1/12/2022,"The boss of the UK’s largest energy supplier has said rocketing energy prices, which are adding to the soaring cost of living for British households, could last for as long as two years. Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said the energy market “suggests that high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years”.  O’Shea told the BBC there was no reason to think that gas price would start to fall again “any time soon”. The rising global demand for gas is partly being driven by the energy transition, according to O’Shea, as countries move away from reliance on coal and oil. “As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel, so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, maybe there is more demand for gas,” O’Shea said. He added: “There isn’t an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly, so I can’t say that this will be done in six months, or nine months, or a year.” However, O’Shea said he did not believe that increasing the domestic supply of gas from the North Sea would help to solve the energy crisis. “I’m not sure an increase in UK supply would have brought the price down from £3 a therm, as it was in December, from 50p as it was a year ago,” he said. “We bring gas in from the United States, from Norway, from Europe, from Qatar, from other places. So we’re not in a position to simply have the UK as an isolated energy market. We are part of a global market.” Consumers are bracing for a jump in what they pay for household energy in April, when the regulator reviews its energy price cap. Many expect Ofgem’s decision will lead to average bills soaring by as much as £700, taking the annual cost of electricity and gas for households on a supplier’s default tariff to £2,000. O’Shea, who has headed Centrica for almost two years, recently called on the government to help out struggling consumers by cutting VAT on energy bills, or stripping environmental levies from bills. According to O’Shea’s calculations, the VAT cut would shave £100 off the average annual bill. However this move has been dismissed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson. O’Shea also suggested that the government should fund environmental and social levies through general taxation instead of household bills, which he estimated would cut the average annual total by £170. Last year saw the collapse of 26 UK energy firms, and O’Shea has previously said that energy companies would have to pass on higher wholesale costs in order to survive, though he has insisted that Centrica would not want to receive a government bailout to help it keep bills down.

1/12/2022,"So here is Scream; actually it should be called Scream 5, and they must surely have thought about 5CREAM. But this one has gone for the solemn franchise-tic of jettisoning the title number as if longevity entitles the latest iteration to automatic classic status. In fact, Scream pre-emptively satirises precisely this affectation, with fans mocking the makers of the film-within-a-film “Stab” franchise who are pompously calling their latest episode “Stab” instead of Stab 8. I have to admit that there is some watchable gonzo humour to this fivequel (though I hid under my seat for the violent bits.) The Scream films were born in the irony boom of the 90s, about a serial killer called Ghostface who slaughtered his victims according to the scary-movie rules tabulated by nerd-cool connoisseurs and who can only be survived or defeated by sticking to those rules. (My fellow film critic Matthew Turner points out that Scream movies also had an unintended irony, on which they are very silent: the Weinstein brothers were involved in production and distribution and the franchise featured the assault and abuse of female actors.) Horror maestro Wes Craven, who died in 2015, directed the first four and this fifth film is directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. Original Scream writer Kevin Williamson has an executive producer credit.  We are back in Woodsboro, the small town where the trouble started. Jenna Ortega plays Tara (pronounced “terror”), a home-alone teen who is texting her friend and intensely annoyed by ringing from something called a “landline”. A horribly familiar voice asks her what scary movies she likes – and the ghastly old boomer psychopath is enraged when Tara pertly nominates The Babadook, this “exalted horror” being apparently superior to the cheesy slasher canon. Further infuriated when this Gen Z wokester starts talking about It Follows and The Witch, Ghostface shows up in person with his cloak and mask and the cold-steel mayhem ensues. Tara’s long-estranged sister Sam (Melissa Barrera) arrives with her boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid) and reveals a grim secret about their connection to the original killings. And after some consultation with Tara’s friend group, Sam asks for help from veteran cop and Ghostface-nemesis Dewey Riley (David Arquette), whose involvement brings in Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Gale Riley (Courteney Cox). The horrible truth dawns. Ghostface is now involving them in a “requel” – a reboot-slash-sequel – whose purpose is to appease the toxic fandom by introducing a younger cast but respectfully leaving “legacy characters” like Riley, Sidney and Gale intact. And Ghostface is the most toxic fan of all. Perhaps there is less zap in Scream nowadays and archly invoking the newer generation of indie horror – Jordan Peele is mentioned, with absolute respect – only serves in the long run to remind you how elderly Scream is. But it’s still capable of delivering some piercing high-pitched decibels.  Scream is released on 13 January in Australia, and on 14 January in the US and UK.",Arts/Film,Scream review – irony-laden horror ‘requel’ is starting to creak with age,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/12/scream-review-irony-laden-horror-requel-is-starting-to-creak-with-age
1/12/2022,"At last, we are waking up to the astonishingly oppressive measures in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, intended to criminalise effective protest. At last, there has been some coverage in the media, though still far too little. The Labour party is finally feeling some heat, and may find itself obliged to stop appeasing the Daily Mail and vote against the government’s brutal amendments in the House of Lords next week. But as we focus on this threat, we’re in danger of forgetting something else buried in this monstrous bill. It’s the provision that turns trespass from a civil into a criminal offence, allowing the police to arrest people who are Gypsies, Roma and Travellers (GRT) and confiscate their homes, if they stop in places that have not been designated for them. Under the proposed law, any adult member of the group can be imprisoned for up to three months. Given that authorised sites and stopping places cannot accommodate the GRT people who need them, this is a deliberate attack on a vulnerable minority.  Put these elements together – the curtailment of protest and the persecution of a minority, alongside blatant corruption and barefaced lies, the bypassing of parliament and the new power in the nationality and borders bill enabling the government arbitrarily to remove people’s citizenship – and you see the makings of an authoritarian state. These measures look horribly familiar to anyone cognisant of 20th-century European history. But they also have deep roots in Britain’s peculiar brutalities. The persecution of mobile people goes back to the 1349 Ordinance of Labourers, which ruled that those deemed to be “vagrants” could be whipped or branded with hot irons. Laws passed in the 16th century decreed that “rogues”, “vagabonds” and other “masterless men” could have their ears sliced in two or bored with a hot poker. If they still failed to return to their own parish (regardless of whether they had one), they could be hanged. A 1554 statute enabled anyone calling themselves “Aegyptians” (Gypsies) to be summarily killed. Some of the brutal, pre-democratic legislation remains in force in England and Wales today. The 1824 Vagrancy Act is used by the police to arrest rough sleepers, still defined as “rogues and vagabonds”. In 2020, 573 people were prosecuted under this act. Some members of parliament sought to use the police bill to repeal this archaic law, but in November the government rejected their amendments. Now homeless people find themselves in an even worse position. Certain councils, seeking to interpret confusing government rules, have decided that they will offer housing support only to verified rough sleepers. They have advised homeless people to start sleeping on the streets, so they can be picked up by outreach teams, who will then try to find accommodation for them. Of course, they might first be picked up by the police, whereupon they can be prosecuted under the Vagrancy Act. If they try to house themselves, by occupying empty buildings, they can be prosecuted for that as well, because David Cameron’s government turned squatting from a civil into a criminal offence. Similarly, people who are Gypsies, Roma and Travellers have been deprived of places where they can lawfully stop, and then punished for the absence of provision. According to a study by the Community Architecture Group, between 1986 and 1993 roughly two-thirds of traditional Travellers’ sites, some of which had been used for thousands of years, were blocked and closed. Then, in 1994, John Major’s Criminal Justice Act granted the police new powers against GRT people stopping without authorisation. With a cruel and perverse twist, the same act repealed the duty of local government to provide authorised sites, and removed the grant aid funding these sites. Partly as a result, a recent study by the group Friends, Families and Travellers found that, of the 68 local authorities they surveyed, only eight had met their own identified need for Gypsy and Traveller pitches. Though there is a long waiting list of GRT households seeking authorised sites and stopping places, official pitches have declined by 8% in the past 10 years. Now the new bill would enable the police to confiscate people’s vehicles (in other words their homes) on the mere suspicion of trespass. When their homes have been seized and their parents arrested, GRT children are likely to be taken into care. The police bill would deprive this minority of everything: homes, livelihoods, identity, culture, even their families. And, like the homeless people trapped between the Vagrancy Act and the housing qualification, it would put people who are Gypsies, Roma and Travellers in an impossible position. To apply for an official pitch, you must demonstrate “proof of travelling”. But if you don’t have access to official pitches, travelling will put you outside the new law. In other words, it is not a particular behaviour that is being criminalised. It is the minority itself. The new authoritarianism meshes with a very old one, that harks back to an imagined world in which the peasants could be neatly divided into villeins (good) and vagrants (bad), where everyone knew their place, geographically and socially. Of course, the demonisation of mobile people, whether Roma or asylum seekers, does not extend to the government ministers and newspaper editors who might shift between their pads in London and their second homes in Cornwall or Tuscany. It’s about the rich controlling the poor, as if democracy had never happened.

A rivalry between the clubs has sustained itself ever since. 1,120 days: “John Kennedy of Celtic had more than three years between successive appearances for the club,” writes Rhuaraidh Fleming. “He played in the Old Firm derby on 28 March before suffering a horror tackle on his international debut for Scotland on 31 March 2004.

And then there was Luis Milla, who played that day (9 September 1984) at only 18 years old, and had to wait almost four years (3 September 1988) for his next match. If you think that proves great patience and faithfulness to the club, it should be noted that after a year and a half he couldn’t agree contract terms and he left for Real Madrid, no less.” 2,925 days: Lewis Baker made his second Chelsea first-team performance in their FA Cup win over Chesterfield on Saturday. He had previously been given a brief debut appearance in the Blues’ FA Cup victory at Derby on 5 January 2014, before being sent out on eight long-term loan, rather than permanent, deals. “What is the largest goal tally for two teams combined drawing in both their home and away fixtures in a season? I presume there are examples of say 3-3 and 4-4 but are there any really big tallies where they just got two points?” asks John McDougall. John Curry gets the ball rolling: “In the old Division One, 1958-59, Spurs drew 1-1 away to Portsmouth in October and 4-4 at home in the following February.” A good start but Clive Denny can go higher. “Charlton may be contenders,” he offers. “Charlton v Middlesbrough finished 6-6 on 22 October 1960 at the Valley, with the return fixture 2-2. More remarkable, but not draws, were the Christmas fixtures between Charlton and Plymouth in 1960. Charlton won 6-4 at the Valley on Boxing Day, then lost 6-4 at Plymouth the very next day. Still just two points apiece.” Last week’s column led on footballers appearing on club calendars in years they never even played for the team. But there’s more and it’s very good … Step forward Donald Vass, who picked up the baton and ran with it for this spectacular thread on the infamous Portsmouth 2013 calendar. “Some context,” he begins. “Pompey were enduring a truly bleak 2012-13 season. We were in administration, on a grim 23-game winless run, and were set to suffer our third relegation in four seasons, eventually finishing 24th to complete our collapse from Premier League to League Two. Crucially, the financial trouble facing the club at the time meant we were desperately short of players. We had a threadbare squad cobbled together with pretty much anyone who was available at the time. “Academy youngsters, loanees, journeymen on one-month contracts and even 40-year-old coach Ashley Westwood was called out of retirement to make an appearance for a particularly memorable EFL Cup tie at Plymouth. Fifty-five different players made appearances for the club that season. So the calendar was always likely to be a disaster. The club were operating week-to-week, while the product was sent to the printers months in advance. It was already wildly out of date by the time it was unwrapped by fans on Christmas Day … and would only get worse from there.” Here it is in all its glory … Always enjoy reading @TheKnowledge_GU column, this week featuring disappointing club calendars.No mention though of surely the worst ever published:This is the story of the infamous #Pompey 2013 official calendar.A thread 🧵 https://t.co/s9bbqEbHJv pic.twitter.com/K8mxDcKFIi “Have they ever used an actual hat for the FA Cup draw?” asked Andy Morrison in 2006. “If so, when was it last used, and what kind of hat was it?” Early draws really did involve headwear; a top hat covered by a handkerchief, to be precise. It was filled with pieces of paper bearing the names of the clubs, with a member of the FA committee delicately lifting a corner of the handkerchief to draw the ties. Bryon Butler’s history of the competition is the only source of information on this arcane ritual, as until the first radio coverage of the draw, in December 1935, it was “barred and bolted against all unofficial comers” – including the press. By then, the bag and ball arrangement was in place. Indeed, the then FA secretary, Sir Stanley Rous, was asked by the BBC to rattle the balls in the bag for dramatic effect. David Barber, the FA’s historian, suggested that the top hat and handkerchief met their demise in a drive for modernisation around 1914. Nevertheless, phrases such as “in the hat for the next round” will always have their roots in the actual routine of the draw. @TheKnowledge_GU This ex-footballer passed recently.

1/12/2022,"That the Women’s Super League leaders, Arsenal, were toppled by a previously winless Birmingham on Sunday was a shock. But perhaps the bigger surprise was the manner of the Gunners’ limp defence of their status as the only team not to have lost. Birmingham’s 2-0 victory was no smash and grab but reward for an intelligent and driven performance that put their opponents to shame.  Arsenal’s decline, starting with the 3-0 FA Cup final defeat by Chelsea on 5 December, has been rapid. In the 18 previous games, from Champions League qualifying until December, Arsenal suffered a bruising 4-1 defeat in Barcelona and dropped two WSL points in a 1-1 draw with Tottenham. The team averaged 3.39 goals per game and conceded 0.55. In the five matches since, starting with the final, they have averaged one goal a game and conceded 2.6 (13 in five games as opposed to 10 in 18 before). Europe’s best, Barcelona and Chelsea, have emphatically exposed Jonas Eidevall’s new-look Arsenal but equally sides such as Hoffenheim, who finished third in the Bundesliga last season, and Birmingham have shown that it is not hard to nullify the previously potent Gunners. Pinpointing exactly what has caused things to unravel so dramatically is not easy. The loss of the influential centre-back Leah Williamson after November’s draw with Tottenham was a huge blow. Jen Beattie, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Steph Catley, Viki Schnaderbeck and Frida Maanum have been tried in search of a centre-half pairing that can cope with the absence of the ball-playing and pacy Williamson, but none have filled the void and a mixture of poor positioning, lack of speed and woeful individual errors have eroded any air of infallibility. The loss of one player, though, should not destabilise the team to such an extent. Arsenal’s problems are not limited to the back. Across the pitch the fluidity and cohesion so potent at the start of the season have gone. A heavy schedule meant a number of players went straight from the Olympics into pre-season training, Champions League qualifiers and the season proper, which included the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of last season’s FA Cup. That has undoubtedly taken a toll and it has not just affected Arsenal. Chelsea’s dominant display in the FA Cup final was the last win of the year for Emma Hayes’s side as the Blues, who limped into 2022 having been knocked out of the Champions League thanks to a 0-0 draw at home to Juventus and 4-0 defeat at Wolfsburg and lost to Reading in the league in between. There was perhaps hope that the winter break would rejuvenate Arsenal legs and minds but the Birmingham defeat suggests the problems are deeper and Eidevall’s seemingly straightforward entry into English football now looks anything but. January signings, with Arsenal linked to the Swedish forward Stina Blackstenius and believed to be hunting for a centre-back, could prompt a revival of fortunes and are necessary. With Arsenal’s three Australian players – Catley, the forward Caitlin Foord and goalkeeper Lydia Williams – competing in the Asian Cup in India, which runs until 6 February, and the defender Anna Patten loaned to Aston Villa, Eidevall is short of players. There are also question marks hanging over the futures of a number of squad members, not least the prolific striker Vivianne Miedema, midfielder Jordan Nobbs and Williamson, whose contracts expire at the end of the season. This kind of uncertainty cannot be healthy for the morale of the squad. The closer the summer gets the more these issues loom large and compound other problems the team face. The games are coming thick and fast and there is little time to work on structural issues on the training pitch but there is an urgent need to grind out positive results to rebuild seemingly shattered confidence. That will not be easy. Reading, unbeaten since the start of October, are up next. Then Manchester United await in the League Cup before Arsenal travel to a resurgent Manchester City. Their WSL fate is in their own hands, the team four points ahead of Chelsea, who have a game in hand and host Arsenal in February. Eidevall’s side are also in the Champions League last eight, facing Wolfsburg. But channelling the early-season form and confidence will be critical to any fast-diminishing hopes of reclaiming the WSL title after back-to-back Chelsea triumphs.",Sport/Football,Problems mount for Eidevall as WSL leaders Arsenal hit the wall ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/problems-mount-for-eidevall-as-wsl-leaders-arsenal-hit-the-wall
1/12/2022,"Seasonal workers in the UK on a post-Brexit pilot scheme to harvest fruit and vegetables were subjected to “unacceptable” welfare conditions, according to a government review. Issues cited by workers included a lack of health and safety equipment, racism, and accommodation without any bathrooms, running water or kitchens.  The UK launched the seasonal workers pilot scheme in 2019 after concerns about a shortage of labour for harvesting jobs on farms on leaving the EU. Most of the 2,481 workers who came to the UK under the scheme were employed picking soft fruits, almost entirely on farms in England and Scotland. A UK government survey of workers found that workers had not been given employment contracts in their native language; had not been provided health and safety equipment, as they had been promised and were legally required to do; and that they had been subjected to unfair treatment by farm managers, including racism, discrimination and mistreatment, allegedly on the grounds of workers’ nationality. Recruitment presentations to potential applicants for the pilot scheme were sometimes found not to have accurately reflected the accommodation, which was mostly on the farms. In the survey, 15% of respondents said their accommodation was neither safe, comfortable, hygienic nor warm, and 10% said their accommodation had no bathroom, no running water and no kitchen. The findings have raised concerns that conditions for foreign workers in the UK’s agricultural sector have not improved in recent years, despite commitments to crackdown on exploitative conditions. A Scottish government-funded review last year also found seasonal workers reporting degrading and unsafe living conditions, as well as poor health and safety practices. The Morecambe Bay tragedy in 2004, in which 23 Chinese cockle-pickers drowned while harvesting the shellfish, prompted the creation of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, which became the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) in 2017, to combat labour abuses. The GLAA’s remit includes ensuring workers receive a minimum wage, adequate accommodation, safe transport, proper contracts and decent working conditions. The recruitment operators Concordia and Pro-Force were selected to manage the pilot phase of the scheme, which required the firms to “maintain high standards of immigration control and migrant welfare”. The scheme has recently been extended to 2024, with two additional firms licensed to bring workers to the UK for employment in the horticulture sector. Up to 30,000 visas are available for this year – with a further 10,000 if demand allows.The joint review by the Home Office and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, published on 24 December, said that the pilot had protected workers from modern slavery and other labour abuses but that other “alleged welfare issues identified are unacceptable”.It said the Home Office had reviewed the requirements placed on the scheme operators and updated the seasonal worker sponsor guidance to tighten the compliance requirements. Pro-Force said it did not want to comment at this stage. Concordia said the report had identified that most workers found the scheme met their expectations and either wanted to return or would recommend it to a friend or relative.“Over the last three years, we have worked with various government departments in an iterative and collaborative way to continually improve and expand the scheme,” it said. “As a charity, we take the utmost care to try to ensure that workers recruited on this scheme have a beneficial experience in the UK; as a labour provider we strive to ensure that our member farms get the labour they need in order to feed the nation.”",News/Global development,‘No running water’: foreign workers criticise UK farm labour scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/12/no-running-water-foreign-workers-criticise-uk-farm-labour-scheme
1/12/2022,"The government of Israel was asked to financially contribute to the 2022 Sydney festival by someone from the festival’s management, a representative from the Israeli embassy in Canberra has claimed. The deputy Israeli ambassador to Australia, Ron Gerstenfeld, told ABC radio on Wednesday that “someone from management” approached the embassy for sponsorship of the Sydney Dance Company production of Decadance, a work devised by Tel Aviv choreographer Ohad Naharin.  “They told us about it … and we were happy and honoured to support it,” Gerstenfeld said. “We didn’t think about it twice … and there were no strings attached. We didn’t ask any promises from [the festival] or the dance company to do something, we didn’t intervene in anything, so it’s a bit of hypocrisy to say we are doing some sort of art-wash in order to hide some kind of Israeli activities in any other sphere.” Division continues over the Sydney festival decision to accept the $20,000 sponsorship with politicians and the militant Palestinian organisation Hamas joining the debate over the past five days. More than 30 productions and individual performers have either pulled out of the festival, or removed themselves from the festival’s banner, to protest the Israeli government’s involvement. In correspondence seen by Guardian Australia dated 20 December, the festival board chairperson, David Kirk, told a coalition of groups lobbying the festival to terminate the Israeli sponsorship that the $20,000 would also pay for a Q&A session hosted by the Israeli embassy, at an invitation-only festival event at the Sydney Opera House. A spokesperson from the embassy told the Guardian the Q&A event was “planned as a private arts and culture event” and confirmed a Sydney festival statement that the event had been cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns. Despite continued requests for comment, festival management and its board – which met on Tuesday night to discuss the crisis – have refused to address the issue publicly since releasing a statement on 4 January, standing by the Israeli embassy deal but pledging to review how future sponsorships would be handled. On Wednesday, Gerstenfeld described the boycott organisers as “agents of chaos” and accused them of anti-Semitism and of politicising the festival. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Writer Michael Mohammed Ahmad, one of the boycott organisers who last month announced he would no longer be joining the festival board as planned, said it was the festival, not the boycotters, who were engaging in a political act. “It is completely paradoxical and a contradictory argument for the festival to defend the most politically contentious nation on earth, and claim that this is non-political,” he told the Guardian. “The non-political position would have been to withdraw and to tell the Israeli embassy that [the festival] is not a political organisation so it has to end this partnership. “You have to ask, why is the Sydney festival putting Israel ahead of the festival itself, and the hundreds of artists caught up in this?” Last Friday, Hamas issued a statement via the Palestinian Information Center supporting the boycott.

But it would be nonsensical to assume as some people have suggested that just because one group supports what we’re doing that we immediately endorse that group, or that we are guilty by association.” The comedian Judith Lucy, singer-songwriter Saint Claire and the Hayes theatre’s production of Lizzie the Musical are among the latest acts to pull out of the festival. Lucy placed blame for the division within the arts community squarely at the feet of the festival board. “As has been pointed out by other [billed] artists, we’ll be condemned no matter what we do,” she posted on Facebook, saying she was reluctant to add her voice to an already polarised situation.

Late last week, the Guardian put a series of questions to Kirk concerning how the decision to accept the Israeli embassy sponsorship was made, and what, if any, risk assessments were undertaken. On Monday, the festival’s executive director, Christopher Tooher, speaking on behalf of Kirk, said the board would not discuss internal deliberations. Posting on Facebook on Saturday, the singer Katie Noonan said she had experienced “vigorous and quite aggressive” social media pressure to join the boycott. “I could not ask my fellow indie artists to turn down paid work after the hardest 2 years of their lives.

1/12/2022,"An Extinction Rebellion activist whose home was raided by Western Australia’s counter-terror police over a chalk message has had the case against her thrown out by a Perth magistrate. Rosa Hicks was one of six arrested after a group of activists used washable chalk paint to write messages on a pedestrian bridge in Perth within view of Woodside’s headquarters to protest the company’s development of the $16bn Scarborough gas project.  Hicks was not involved in applying the paint, arrived after the protest had started and took photos on someone else’s phone. She said she did not take any active part and was very conscious of avoiding any violation of the conditions of her visa. Two weeks after the protest, on 19 August 2021, officers with the state security investigation group – a division of the Western Australian police force referred to as the state’s “counter-terrorism police” – raided the homes of the six activists in the early hours of the morning. Four people who actually applied the paint have since pleaded guilty to damaging property by graffiti and received fines and a fifth activist is awaiting a trial to begin in April. However, police prosecutors maintained that Hicks’ photographing the incident amounted to aiding and abetting, despite her not being involved in applying the messages. At a trial in the Perth magistrates court on Monday, prosecutors played half an hour of CCTV footage tracking Hicks’ movements that confirmed her account of events and a recording of the interview she gave police during the raid on her home. Magistrate Matthew Holgate, however, threw out the case on the grounds it had no legal basis. WA police were ordered to cover Hicks’ legal costs of $3,300. Hicks, who is from the UK, described the decision as an “anti-climactic relief” as police prosecutors had been steadfast in keeping the prosecution going. “It’s just a huge waste of time. A huge waste of money. A huge waste of state security resources,” Hicks said. “Not only have they wasted all those resources but they’ve treated me like a dangerous criminal by not allowing me to see my friends with non-association bail conditions and taking my phone, making me feel like I was really dangerous. “I’ve had to go through all this stress, I’ve had to have my house raided, I’ve had to live in fear of being deported, when in actual fact there was no case.” Hicks’ lawyer, Anthony Eyers, a barrister with Equus Chambers in Perth said any prosecution would have set a bad precedent by criminalising the act of being near protest actions. “It’s the thin end of the wedge,” Eyers said. “If these prosecutions are allowed to stand, they will invariably generate precedents affecting fundamental freedom of expression and freedom of movement, and association. “It’s an unfortunately trivial example of how easy people’s fundamental rights could be eroded against the background of [governments] promoting the interests of big businesses to the detriment of the environment.” The decision comes as other environmental protesters have had strict non-association bail conditions and harsh financial penalties imposed – contributing to what some human rights groups and NGOs say is an alarming trend of repression around the country. In November, three activists with the Scarborough Gas Action Alliance blockaded the only road into the Burrup Peninsula in WA’s far north for 16 hours. The area is home to a significant amount of gas industry infrastructure. Caleb Houseman, who took part in the protest, received a $1,100 fine after pleading guilty in late December to failing to comply with a move on notice, obstruction of a carriageway and obstruction of police. The magistrate rejected an attempt to impose an additional $55,000 in restitution to WA police after finding prosecutors failed to cite proper legal authority to justify the charge and did not give his lawyers adequate time to respond. Sophie McNeill, the Australia researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the decision in Hicks’ case was a sensible outcome to an “overzealous” prosecution.

1/12/2022,"Roger Fischer, the civil servant husband in Tessa Hadley’s 1960s domestic drama Free Love, is a rather circumspect creature. In a conversation with his wife, Phyllis, the protagonist of Hadley’s eighth novel, the couple discuss Roger’s recent work. He has been preparing documents about security in the Middle East. Phyllis offers dutiful but uninformed optimism about the prospects for that troubled region. Roger responds: “I probably come down on the side of not hoping too much. It’s a botched old civilisation, you know. Rather imperfect.” Free Love initially purports to be a romantic novel, imagining a new kind of existence for Phyllis in opposition to the forces of Roger’s stiff-upper-lipped judiciousness. What might it mean to refuse the lot one has been assigned? What will happen if wild desires and aspirations are allowed to blossom? And how does it feel to be living a conventional life so close to the thrilling allure of swinging London, “a world turned upside down”, where such a sense of the possible was being embraced?  At the beginning of the narrative, Phyllis and her family are in the green and pleasant outskirts of London. Theirs is an unremarkable life of middle-class decorum. Hadley subtly draws attention to the solidity of the Fischers’ home – with its “boxed-in oak staircase and panelled oak doors” – and these physical features echo the family’s solidly conventional setup: steady and reliable Roger works up in Whitehall; erudite daughter Colette drips with predictable adolescent antipathy; winningly charming eight-year-old Hugh is readying himself to attend the boarding school his father went to. Mingling with the neighbours (the Barnes-Pryces, the Chidgelys) and managing the domestic help, fragrant Phyllis prettily keeps things ticking over. But of course, as in the work of Richard Yates or AM Homes, “under the placid surface of suburbia, something [is] unhinged”. A deliciously absurd set-piece dinner party is the inciting incident. Nicky, the conspicuously countercultural twentysomething son of Roger’s old friend, is the “interesting” guest of honour at the meal. Nicky’s bohemian affectations and resistance to bourgeois politesse both disquiet and captivate Phyllis – much to her surprise. Phyllis “hadn’t known that the young had this power, to reduce the present of the middle-aged to rubble”. Nicky’s nonchalant dismissal of Phyllis’s settled existence releases this “something unhinged” within her: a latent propensity for risk, a longing for the untried. Without unequivocally lionising its protagonist as an intrepid pursuer of liberty or vilifying her for naive self-indulgence, the narrative coalesces around Phyllis and her relationship with Nicky. It homes in on this latter-day Emma Bovary’s pained evaluations and negotiations – “she saw how fatally Roger and the children […] held her fixed inside their shape, so that she couldn’t change her own life without bringing everyone else’s down around her”. Hadley also shrewdly problematises the misleading promises of the sexual revolution through her unstinting portrayal of the Ginsberg-adoring, pot-smoking rake Nicky. While the Fischers’ Arts and Crafts suburban villa exudes Roger’s desire for steadiness and civility, the faded block of flats in Ladbroke Grove where Nicky lives is perhaps revelatory of what lies beneath his shiny “idyll of playful ease”: The Everglade was a crumbling vast art nouveau palace, built at the turn of the century to contain sixty luxury serviced apartments […] Now it had fallen from grace, broken up into who knew how many run-down bedsits and sublets, taken over by ex-boxers, theatricals, members of occult sects, tarot-card readers […] The roof leaked in a thousand places […] once or twice an excess of stone ornamentation from the façade had crashed into the street below. Master storyteller and superior stylist that she is, Hadley wryly records the unexpected crashes and calamities of Nicky and Phyllis’s relationship as Phyllis wrangles with the “nothingness of her self”. The sustained intimacy of Hadley’s recent novels Late in the Day and The Past that have garnered her legions of admirers is in abundance here – and not just in relation to her central characters. Her acuity in making use of minor figures is a highlight, too. Congruences between Colette’s teenage rebellions (late-night drinking and inexpert flirtation in which she “imagines [herself] doing the audacious … and then follows through”) and Phyllis’s misadventures add a complicating, challenging, satirical thread. Equally, Barbara Jones, a Grenadian trainee nurse and neighbour of Nicky, is a welcome presence. Barbara introduces a salty, straight-talking realism that counters Phyllis’s often infuriatingly hazy idealism. Her muted but nevertheless affecting revelations about the inequities of life as a working-class Black woman in 1960s London importantly widen the scope of this novel’s feminist concerns. One criticism sometimes levelled at Hadley’s astutely observed narratives is that, for all their finesse, they lack propulsion and verve – her 2007 novel, The Master Bedroom, is a case in point. Some readers may consider the conclusion of Free Love in similar terms, feeling that the plot fizzles out, or that the resolution for the Fischers is partial or underwhelming. But on rereading, the final pages struck me as achingly moving and real. This novel does not close as a triumphant bildungsroman of middle life, replete with self-discovery. Instead, Hadley’s poignant drawing together of a situation that ultimately becomes “as fatally twisted as a Greek drama” shows a writer with boundless compassion. Yet again, she offers insightful and sensitive understanding of the quiet compromises people make to survive in a deeply compromised world.  Free Love is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).
