12/27/2021,"England’s players underwent and subsequently cleared an emergency round of Covid-19 testing before day two of the third Ashes Test in Melbourne after the detection of a positive case in the camp. Coming at 9.23 the morning after the tourists had crumbled to 185 all out in their first innings, and Australia reached 61 for one at the close of play, the positive case was detected among what team management labelled “the family group”.  It initially plunged the match into doubt, with a statement from England saying: “The team and management are currently at the team hotel awaiting results of RFT Covid tests [lateral flow] following a positive test in the team’s family group.” The results of testing came back negative, however, and a further update from the team confirmed that players and support staff would travel to the MCG. Two squad players and a small number of coaches were understood to be staying behind as a precaution, despite none testing positive thus far. The less accurate lateral flow tests have provided some peace of mind but a spread cannot be ruled out. This issue, coming just an hour before the start of play, underlined the precarious nature of a series that has already seen Australia’s captain, Pat Cummins, forced to isolate and miss the second Test in Adelaide due to close contact with a positive case. That match also witnessed an outbreak in the media centre, with separate positive cases in both the BBC Test Match Special team and the production staff of host broadcasters Fox Sports causing disruption to their respective services. This case among the wider England touring party represents a serious issue for Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board, not least with players, support staff and family members all lodging in the same hotel and having celebrated Christmas together. While staying in Victoria, which recorded 1,999 positive cases on Boxing Day, both teams have been subject to tighter restrictions off the field, with dining in public limited to outdoor spaces. CA and ECB have tried to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 while simultaneously allowing some normality given the strains of biosecure bubbles.",Sport/Sport,Covid scare in England team delays day two of third Ashes Test at MCG,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/26/covid-scare-in-england-team-delays-day-two-of-third-ashes-test-at-mcg
12/27/2021,"Sarah Weddington, an attorney who argued and won the Roe v Wade supreme court case which established the right to abortion in the US, has died aged 76. Susan Hays, a Democratic candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner, announced the news on Twitter on Sunday and the Dallas Morning News confirmed it.  “Sarah Weddington died this morning after a series of health issues,” Hays wrote. “With Linda Coffee, she filed the first case of her legal career, Roe v Wade, fresh out of law school. She was my professor … the best writing instructor I ever had, and a great mentor. “At 27 she argued Roe to [the supreme court] (a fact that always made me feel like a gross underachiever). Ironically, she worked on the case because law firms would not hire women in the early 70s, leaving her with lots of time for good trouble.” The court ruled on Roe v Wade in 1973. Nearly 50 years later the right it established is under threat from a supreme court packed with hardline conservatives, in part thanks to a Texas law that drastically restricts access and offers incentives for reporting women to authorities. In 2017, speaking to the Guardian, Weddington predicted such a turn of events. “If [Neil] Gorsuch’s nomination is approved, will abortion be illegal the next day? No. One new judge won’t necessarily make much difference. But two or three might.” After steering Gorsuch on to the court – and a seat held open by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell when Barack Obama was president – Donald Trump installed Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett replaced the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of women’s rights. Weddington found her way to Roe v Wade soon after graduating from law school at the University of Texas. Represented by Weddington and Coffee, Norma McCorvey became the plaintiff known as “Jane Roe” in Roe v Wade. McCorvey became an evangelical Christian and opponent of abortion. She died in 2017. In her Guardian interview, Weddington discussed arguing the case in federal court. “I was very nervous,” she said. “It was like going down a street with no street lights. But there was no other way to go and I didn’t have any preconceived notions that I would not win.” She won, but the case continued. “Henry Wade, the district attorney, unwittingly helped us,” she said. “At a press conference, he said, ‘I don’t care what any court says; I am going to continue to prosecute doctors who carry out abortion.’ There was a procedural rule that said if local elected officials continue to prosecute after a federal court had declared a law unconstitutional, there would be a right to appeal to the supreme court.” Before the court in Washington, Weddington said: “It was impossible to read the justices’ faces. The attorney on the other side started by saying something inappropriate about arguing a case against a beautiful woman. He thought the judges would snicker. But their faces didn’t change a bit. “I had to argue it twice in the supreme court: in 1971 and again in 1972. On 22 January 1973 I was at the Texas legislature when the phone rang. It was a reporter from the New York Times. ‘Does Miss Weddington have a comment today about Roe v Wade?’ my assistant was asked. ‘Why?’ she said. ‘Should she?’ “It was beginning to be very exciting. Then we got a telegram from the supreme court saying that I had won 7-2 and that they were going to air-mail a copy of the ruling. Nowadays, of course, you’d just go online. “I was ecstatic, and more than 44 years later we’re still talking about it.” Weddington later revealed that she had an abortion herself, in 1967. “Just before the anaesthesia hit,” she said, “I thought: ‘I hope no one ever knows about this.’ For a lot of years, that was exactly the way I felt. Now there’s a major push to encourage women to tell their stories so people will realise that it is not a shameful thing. One out of every five women will have an abortion.” Weddington predicted: “Whatever else I do in my life, the headline on my obituary is always going to be ‘Roe v Wade attorney dies’.” In fact she achieved much more, as Hays detailed in her tweets on Sunday. “Those career doors shut to her led her to run for office, getting elected as the first woman from Travis county in the [Texas legislature] in 1972 (along with four other women elected to the House: Kay Bailey, Chris Miller, Betty Andujar and Senfronia Thompson). “She was general counsel of the United States Department of Agriculture under [Jimmy] Carter and enjoyed her stint in DC. Federal judicial nominations for Texas were run by her as a high-ranking Texan in the administration. “A Dallas lawyer she knew sought a bench. She had interviewed with him while at UT law. He’d asked her, ‘What will we tell our wives if we hire you?’ She told him he was wasting their time and hers and walked out of the interview. He did not get the judgeship. “Ever the proper preacher’s daughter, she would never tell me who the lawyer was. People don’t know that about Sarah. She was such a proper Methodist minister’s daughter. One of the few people I couldn’t cuss in front of.” Hays also paid tribute to Weddington as a teacher and a member of a “Great Austin Matriarchy” that also included the former Texas governor Ann Richards and the columnist Molly Ivins. In her Guardian interview, Weddington indicated she was at peace with being remembered for Roe v Wade. “I think most women of my generation can recall our feelings about the fight,” she said. “It’s like young love. You may not feel exactly the same, but you remember it.”",News/US news,"Sarah Weddington, attorney who won Roe v Wade abortion case, dies aged 76",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/26/sarah-weddington-attorney-who-won-roe-v-wade-abortion-case-dies-aged-76
12/27/2021,"Ralf Rangnick says Manchester United have a “higher ratio” of double vaccinated players than the Premier League average, and the club would hesitate before signing any player not vaccinated against Covid. United’s past two games – against Brentford and Brighton – were postponed after an outbreak of the virus among Rangnick’s squad that left only eight outfield players available. But with 25 players now in training before Monday’s trip to Newcastle, the German claimed that United’s number of double vaccinated footballers is among the highest in the division.  “I don’t know which of our players have had two or three [the booster] vaccinations. This is a question that only our medical department could answer but I know from our medical department that our ratio of vaccinated players is above the average of the Premier League,” said Rangnick. “As far as I know we have a high record of vaccination of players in our club, but still in the last two weeks we have been shown that even if you are vaccinated two or three times, you can still catch the virus, especially the new virus. So you are not being protected [fully] but at least you are being protected from severe symptoms – most of our players who tested positive at least had very weak symptoms and didn’t suffer.” Being double vaccinated is a consideration for United when considering any potential new signings and Rangnick understands the stance of his Liverpool counterpart, Jürgen Klopp. Klopp said it would be “influential, definitely” for his club, saying any unvaccinated footballer would be a “constant threat for all of us”. “Yes, it could be a consideration and I fully understand what Jürgen said,” Rangnick said. “But it also depends if you want to sign a player and risk him not being available. This is an issue the clubs seriously have to think about. If you sign a player knowing from the very first day that he has not been vaccinated, you have to be aware that he might not be available – not only for 10 days, but this could happen regularly in Covid times.” Rangnick confirmed Anthony Martial has spoken to him about leaving United. “He explained to me he’s been at Manchester United for the last seven years and he feels it’s the right time for a change,” he said. “I could follow his thoughts but it’s also important to see the situation of the club. As far as I know, there has been no offer from any other club and as long as this is the case he will stay.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick: Manchester United are above league average for jabbed players,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/ralf-rangnick-manchester-united-above-league-average-vaccinations
12/27/2021,"Eddie Howe hopes to channel the spirit of Kevin Keegan and Sir Bobby Robson when Manchester United visit Tyneside on Monday night. Newcastle’s manager would relish the sight of his side reprising the swashbuckling performances which became commonplace during the tenures of Keegan and Robson in the 1990s and early 2000s.  Back then beating Manchester United was not regarded as an exceptional feat by Newcastle fans but Howe’s class of 2021-22 face Ralf Rangnick’s team having won only once all season and in acute peril of relegation. “There’s a lot of memories that spring to mind of those games in the 1990s and just after,” said Howe. “Newcastle tended, at that period of time, to have memorable games against most teams. There are standout moments you think back to; I can still picture some of the goals and the scenes in my mind. “It’s up to us to try to recreate those times – the attacking verve, the swagger that Kevin Keegan’s 1990s Newcastle had, the flair the individual players possessed and the team identity. It’s something we’re desperate to do. But we’re going to need a little bit of time to see that in full creation. At the moment, we’re still progressing and we have to obviously get the defensive side of our game right before we transition into the team we all want to be.” Given that Howe’s side have conceded 11 goals – and scored one – in their past three games, adjusting that calibration correctly is imperative. Steve Bruce’s successor must somehow add stability to a vulnerable defence while bringing the best out of talented forwards including Allan Saint-Maximin, Callum Wilson and Miguel Almirón who have yet to gel as a unit on his watch. For many years Newcastle have functioned best as a counterattacking unit, playing very much on the break, but their latest manager hopes to oversee a change into a much more front-foot, possession-heavy style. Possibly Howe’s biggest immediate worry is that Saint-Maximin, his most gifted and improvisational attacker, appears to have regressed in recent weeks and looks to be playing on a different wavelength to Wilson, the team’s most reliable goalscorer. “One of the ways we work is that we attack with relationships,” Howe said. “The only way you build those relationships is by repetition in training, by attacking with everyone together as a team so you know what you’re going to do. We’ve started that work, it’s going on every day. I’ve seen some good things in training, probably not seen as much as we’d want in the matches, but that could be down to the teams we’ve faced lately. “In recent matches we’ve not had a lot of the ball so you’re mainly counterattacking. And you can’t attack as individuals. It’s not as effective as when you attack together. That isn’t aimed at Maxi [Saint-Maximin] but Maxi is part of that.” Despite adverse results, Howe’s desire to ultimately return Newcastle to a brand of football more akin to that enjoyed under Keegan and Robson dictates he continues to enjoy considerable goodwill from the fans. Even so the former Bournemouth manager knows that, for this to continue and for the players to keep buying into his ideas, results must improve. “You always need to win,” he acknowledged. “I’m in the kind of job when only winning is acceptable really because you can highlight positives but ultimately only winning silences any outside noise. And even within the squad, the players need to win; we have to have stability in our thought process.” Howe suggested a sense of perspective is also required; an appreciation of why victories have been in such short supply since his installation in November. “We’ve had some very tough fixtures and the team’s stretched at the moment by injuries and illness,” he said. “We have to understand the moment we’re in and have calmness in our thoughts. “I think our work on the training ground is good work and we will see the fruits of that labour. It may take a bit of time but, while I’m well aware we’re in a results business, I’m really pleased with the progress we’re making.”",Sport/Football,Eddie Howe hopes to instil attacking verve of Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/eddie-howe-hopes-to-instil-attacking-verve-of-kevin-keegans-newcastle
