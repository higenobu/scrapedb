The woman, who has not been identified, was walking across the Royal Park Bridge, which stretches from Lakeview Avenue in West Palm Beach and connects to the island of Palm Beach, at around 1 p.m., West Palm Beach police said. She was about 10 feet away from the end of the bridge when it raised and she fell to her death through a gap in the road, NBC affiliate WPTV in Palm Beach, Florida, reported. West Palm Beach police spokesman Mike Jachles told the outlet, ""The woman tried to hang on."" ""There was a bystander nearby who tried to help her, but tragically she fell five or six stories below where she died landing on concrete,” Jachles said to WPTV. He noted that there was a bridge tender who is responsible for following safety protocols in managing the bridge.

 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) retrieved multiple White House record boxes last month that were improperly kept at former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago property, The Washington Post reported. The boxes reportedly contained important records of communication, gifts and letters from world leaders, which, according to the Post, is a violation of the Presidential Records Act. The newspaper added that the boxes retrieved from the Florida estate included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as well as a letter from former President Obama to Trump. The Post noted that recent administrations have all had some Presidential Records Act violations, including the use of unofficial email and telephone accounts as well as the destruction of emails. But a source told the newspaper that the transfer to Mar-a-Lago was ""out of the ordinary ... NARA has never had that kind of volume transfer after the fact like this."" The Hill has reached out to the National Archives and Trump's office for comment. The Presidential Records Act, which was put in place following the Watergate scandal, requires administrations to document and maintain records of the White House decisionmaking process. The new development comes just a week after NARA handed over some Trump White House documents to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection that were reportedly torn up and taped back together. The National Archives said last week that the documents ""included paper records that had been torn up by former President Trump."" The former president had sued to stop the committee from being given certain documents, with his attorney claiming it was illegal and that Trump wanted to preserve privileges over certain documents.

2/8/2022,"Trump ""gleefully"" watched the Capitol insurrection on TV, an ex-White House official said last month. But he was confused when staffers who also watched were not as excited, the AP reported. The report comes as Trump's daughter Ivanka is expected to meet with the January 6 select committee. Former President Donald Trump was confused when White House staffers didn't like him rewinding Capitol riot highlights on TV, The Associated Press reported Monday. The report offers new details into what happened in the West Wing on January 6, 2021, as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The AP report repeats a previous claim made by Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary, who told CNN last month that Trump ""gleefully"" watched the insurrection unfold on TV, rewinding the footage at several points to watch it over again. ""Look at all of the people fighting for me,"" Trump said at the time, Grisham claimed. As White House staffers looked on in horror, the former president was shocked that they weren't as excited as he was, AP said. The report also provided an update on Trump's daughter and then-senior advisor Ivanka Trump, who was asked by the January 6 select committee last month to voluntarily cooperate with its investigation into the Capitol riot. A committee aide told AP that they are hopeful Ivanka, who has kept a very low public profile since her father left office, will soon commit to a time to meet. ""Ivanka Trump has details about what occurred in the lead-up to and on Jan. 6 and about the former president's state of mind as events unfolded,"" Rep.

2/8/2022,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has spent over $500,000 on private jets since 2020 despite repeatedly describing climate change as an ""existential"" threat the U.S. has a ""moral"" obligation to address. According to campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission, Pelosi’s campaign paid a Virginia-based private aviation provider, Advanced Aviation Team, over $437,000 between October 2020 and December 2021 and over $65,000 to Clay Lacy Aviation, a California-based private jet provider. JOHN KERRY FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED ESTIMATED 116 METRIC TONS OF CARBON OVER PAST YEAR Private jets are notoriously bad for the environment, producing significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights. Pelosi’s campaign spent $67,605 on private air travel just months before she said she viewed tackling the climate crisis as a ""religious thing."" ""For me, it's a religious thing,"" she said in November after leading a 21-member congressional delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. ""I believe this is God's creation, and we have a moral obligation to be good stewards."" Pelosi came under fire in September after she claimed climate change was even more of a priority to discuss with China than its multitude of human rights abuses. ""Climate is an overriding issue, and China is a leading emitter in the world,"" she said at the time. Pelosi is far from the only climate hawk to indulge in private airfare. The campaign for President Biden, who promised to make climate change a key priority of his presidency, spent over $15 million on private air travel over the course of his 2020 campaign. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has also been vocal about climate change and being ""committed to curbing the effects of climate change,"" but they have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to Advanced Aviation Team in recent years. Biden's climate czar, John Kerry, took a private jet to Iceland in 2019 to receive the Arctic Circle award for climate leadership. Kerry defended his high-pollution ride at the time, calling it ""the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle"" in an interview obtained by Fox News. In August 2021, Fox News Digital calculated that Kerry's family jet already emitted approximately 30 times more carbon in 2021 than the average vehicle does in a year.

2/8/2022,"I've always wanted to get in shape and also look in shape, both in and out of clothes. I was looking for a coach, and the Morsia 90-day challenge sounded like a great opportunity to reach my fitness goals. The first big change I made was my diet; I had to be aware of what I was putting in my body, and ensure that the food I was eating had the nutritional values to help me to reach my ideal physique. The most difficult part of the challenge was changing my eating habits and being disciplined in regards to what I ate. At the beginning it was difficult sticking to my calorie intake, but once I got into a routine, it became easier. I also started training in a more consistent way, and had a defined routine where I would target specific areas of my body on specific days. Engaging with the Morsia Instagram page helped to keep me motivated. The other participants in the challenge and I all shared our journey to reach our individual goals, which definitely kept me feeling engaged. Roughly halfway through the challenge, I began to see a difference: I became more defined in my physique, and the main area where there was a visible difference was my abs. My arms also got bigger, my chest got more defined, and my quads grew. I also gained size in my shoulders, in muscles I never even knew I had. In total, I lost 22 pounds, dropping from 192 pounds at the beginning to 170 pounds at the end of the three months. The majority of the fat on my body converted into muscle. As a result of the transformation I feel more confident, fitter, more alert, and I am more happy with my appearance. I've felt so good about myself that shortly after completing the challenge I contemplated taking part in body building competitions. But most importantly, I proved to myself that I am a very disciplined person when it comes to my health. There may be days when you find it hard to continue, you might have responsibilities outside of training, you might be tired, but I would say to stick it out because the rewards are worth it. Stick to your calories, stick to your workouts and trust the process: if I can do it, anyone else can.

2/8/2022,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama welcomes visitors at the “First White House of the Confederacy,” a historic home next to the state Capitol where Confederate President Jefferson Davis lived with his family in the early months of the Civil War. The museum managed by the state's Department of Finance says it hosts nearly 100,000 people a year, many of them school children on field trips to see such things as the “relic room” where Davis’ slippers and pocket watch are preserved. Near the gift shop, a framed article describes Davis as an American patriot who accomplished “one of the most amazing feats in history” by keeping the “north at bay for four long years.” Evelyn England, an African-American woman who worked for 12 years as a receptionist at the historic site, said some visitors, both Black and white, were surprised to see her there. “I’m in a unique position because whites don’t really want me here, and Blacks don’t want to come here,” England told The Associated Press. England, 62, retired this week from the $34,700 state job, and it wasn’t the friendliest of departures: State records show she was suspended for three days last month for refusing to sign a performance review, and she said she filed a racial discrimination complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A spokeswoman said the Department of Finance declined to comment on the personnel matter. After all those years working among the Davis family's furniture and belongings, England wishes the museum would take a broader view of history. That slavery was a catalyst for the Civil War “is sort of stated around,"" she said. “Tell it like it is. Just tell it like it is. This happened. This is what is known to have happened. Give it as absolute truth as you can..... Until that, you are painting a false narrative that this was a gala — no, there were some ugly things that happened,” she said. Explanatory displays at the museum, where the first Confederate flag still flies outside, mostly discuss the furnishings and how rooms were used, and make little to no mention of slavery, which Davis promoted as “a moral, a social and a political blessing."" The residence was salvaged over a century ago by The White House Association,  a state-chartered women's organization that still owns its contents and remains involved, even as Finance Department employees staff the site. The legislature mandated in a 1923 law that the state-owned building serve as a “reminder for all time of how pure and great were southern statesmen and southern valor.” It would be better, England believes, if the historic site was managed by the Department of Archives and History. The museum’s curator, Bob Wieland, said Friday that he would ask the board to respond to questions about how the museum is run, but he doesn’t think the museum depicts an overly rosy view of Davis. “Jefferson Davis has never been called great in the house. He was the president of the Confederate States of America. We would say no more, no less than that,” Wieland said. England, who would sometimes give tours, said guides only gave information such as the dates (February-May 1861) when Montgomery served as the Confederacy’s capital. The museum has made some changes over the years. She said there once was an area called a “shrine” to Davis. The gift shop stopped selling Confederate flags, except for stickers of the design that was used when the Confederate capital was in Montgomery. “They have taken steps. It might be baby steps,” she said. England, who lives in Marion, said she is a distant cousin of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a civil rights activist shot and killed by a state trooper in 1965. His death helped inspire the voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act. England was a young child at the time, but still recalls the commotion and pain. In conversations with visitors, England said she would sometimes use questions and humor to try to get them to see a different point of view. When one person maintained that secession was only about preserving states' rights — a view that had long been taught to southerners as the root cause of the Civil War instead of slavery — she responded, “But did everyone have the same rights?” “You love the Confederacy for what you think it stood for: Your rights,"" she would think. ""What were they fighting about? Some would say states’ rights. I have a problem with your solution of states’ rights because all individuals in that state didn’t have the same rights.” One day, an older white woman said “Oh, the South will rise!” to no one in particular as she browsed in the gift shop, where the merchandise includes books, stickers of the first Confederate flag and children's toys including teddy bears in Confederate and Union uniforms. When the woman turned around to put more items on the counter, England asked her, “What are you rising from?” She said the woman didn't reply. “If looks could kill I’d be a dead woman,” England said. But many interactions have been positive, she said, recalling good conversations, even with people who — a supervisor warned — could be prejudiced against her. She's been “chewed out” by some African Americans for working there, she added. ""It came at me from both sides,” she said. Many visitors — Black and white — found her race a point of curiosity. “How do you work here?” one white woman asked her. “Ma’am, if you pay every last one of my bills, I’ll quit today,” she jokingly replied. England hopes her presence helped open minds. “Just open up what you are thinking. That's where the real change is going to occur, in your heart. You can take down monuments. But if what they are still harboring is there, at an inopportune time it will resurface.”",U.S./Associated Press,Black worker at Confederate site raises race complaint,https://news.yahoo.com/black-worker-confederate-raises-race-140220402.html
