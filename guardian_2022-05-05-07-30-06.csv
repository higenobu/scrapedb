5/5/2022,"Poor sleep may undermine attempts to maintain weight loss, research has suggested. Millions of people who are overweight or obese manage to lose weight every year. But many often then face a struggle to keep the pounds creeping back. Now results from a randomised trial, which was conducted by the University of Copenhagen and presented at the European Congress on Obesity, suggests better and longer sleep patterns could help keep the weight off for good. It is well known that not getting enough or poor quality sleep increases the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and fatty deposits building up in the arteries. Not getting enough sleep has also been linked to diabetes, inflammation and heart disease. Scientists now increasingly believe poor sleep may be a contributing factor in weight regain after weight loss. In the study, 195 adults who were obese and aged between 18 and 65 followed a very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day) for eight weeks, losing on average 12% of their bodyweight. They were then tracked for a year. Their sleep duration was measured using data from wearable monitors and their sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), a self-rated questionnaire. Those who slept for less than six hours a night were found to have, on average, increased their body mass index (BMI) by 1.3 points after a year compared with those who slept for more than six hours. Similarly, the BMI for those who had poor quality sleep increased by 1.2 points after a year compared with those whose sleep was of a good quality. The authors noted the study was observational and could not prove that poor sleep caused weight changes, but suggested that it was likely to contribute. “The fact that sleep health was so strongly related to weight loss maintenance is important since many of us don’t get the recommended amount of sleep needed for optimal health and functioning,” said Prof Signe Torekov, of the University of Copenhagen. More than a third of adults in the UK and the US do not frequently get enough sleep, previous research has found, largely owing to a host of factors in modern life including stress, computers, smart devices and the blurring of work-life boundaries. The study also found about two hours of vigorous physical activity a week could help maintain better sleep. “Future research examining possible ways of improving sleep in adults with obesity will be an important next step to limit weight regain,” said Torekov. “Weight loss maintained with exercise seems promising in improving sleep.” Meanwhile, a second study presented at the conference found more than 1,300 prostate cancer deaths in the UK could potentially be prevented every year if the average man was not overweight. The mechanisms behind the findings are still unknown, but researchers said the UK Biobank study, which was published in the journal BMC Medicine, suggests men should try to maintain a healthy weight. “Knowing more about factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer is key to preventing it,” said the study lead Dr Aurora Pérez-Cornago at the University of Oxford. “Age, family history and black ethnicity are known risk factors but they are not modifiable, so it is important to discover risk factors that it is possible to change.” A third study presented at the conference found almost a quarter of obese teenagers havd no idea that they were obese, despite most of them being worried about the effect of weight on their future health.",News/Society,"Poor sleep may hinder attempts to maintain weight loss, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/04/poor-sleep-may-hinder-attempts-to-maintain-weight-loss-study-finds
5/5/2022,"It was not just that Manchester City had led by two goals with 90 minutes on the clock, a place in the Champions League final against Liverpool basically theirs – although that was plainly the greatest, deepest agony. It was not even that this semi-final should have long since have been over. After the first leg, which City had dominated. Or before Real’s stoppage-time magic, in which the substitute, Rodrygo, cast the spells, scoring two scarcely believable goals to force extra time. The City substitute, Jack Grealish, had seen a shot miraculously hacked off the line by Ferland Mendy in the 87th minute and then watched Thibaut Courtois stick out a toe to divert a shot from him just past the far post. It was the way that the footballing gods, with whom Real Madrid appear to have a deal with options, tormented them. Rodrygo had almost completed a stoppage-time hat-trick at the end of normal time, stealing in to extend Ederson, when Phil Foden received a quick free-kick and saw glory beckon. His shot flew high. On into extra time and there was a measure of inevitability about how Real got the next goal, not to mention the identity of the scorer. It was a tired challenge by Rúben Dias on Karim Benzema, who had nipped on to a Rodrygo cross – in front of the City defender – and everybody knew what would happen next. No panenka this time. Benzema slotted low into Ederson’s left-hand corner. The tie had been spiky from start to finish and how the Bernabéu crowd howled when Pep Guardiola, their bête noire from his Barcelona days, remonstrated with the officials as the City dream headed towards dust. Did they have anything left? Foden drew a fine save out of Courtois with a header at the end of the first period of extra time but that was it. They could do no more. And so Real advance, breathlessly, into a repeat of the 2018 final – in which they beat Liverpool – their sights set on a fifth triumph in this competition in eight seasons. They have defied logic in the past but surely never as much as they have done this season. They were largely outplayed by Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea in the previous rounds only to find a way to get through and here, it was no exaggeration to say that they did not create a clear cut chance until Rodrygo turned home Benzema’s cross to cancel out Riyad Mahrez’s rocket on the night. Rodrygo’s second – the dagger to City hearts – was an excellent header from a Dani Carvajal cross. City’s pain knew no bounds. They have fallen short in the past under Guardiola in the competition that they want more than any other but never quite like this. The wounds will remain open for a very long time. It had been possible to forget that City did actually win the first leg, what with the angst over the missed chances – at least half a dozen big ones; the feeling that the single-goal cushion represented a booby prize. Or a trap. Guardiola had to have reminded his players how much better than Real they had been in Manchester and yet this was always going to be about how they handled the occasion. The pre-match confidence in Madrid had been ludicrously high. Ditto the sense of theatre. “Another magical night from the kings of Europe,” trumpeted the pre-match tifo, above an image of Benzema mocked up as an emperor. It is all a part of the show, all a part of what City had to tame. It was edgy, the passions simmering. When Casemiro set down an early marker with a scissors-style tackle on Kevin De Bruyne, it led to a confrontation between players from both teams, some push and shove between Luka Modric and Aymeric Laporte, the latter riskily putting his hand in the Real midfielder’s face. Both were booked. Casemiro surprisingly was not and he got away with another one in the 33rd minute when he dragged down Foden. City were determined to take the sting out of the occasion, to stroke the ball about, but the home crowd were in no mood to ease up on the whistling. They were deeply unimpressed at how Ederson seemed to take longer than usual over his goal-kicks. Or whenever a City player went down. It was a tremendous atmosphere and the decibel level would have risen if Benzema had done better with an early header, when he was free. However the flag did go up for offside. The striker also lifted high after a Federico Valverde cut-back. Vinícius Júnior was similarly wasteful with a first-half sighting. And that was about it for Real before the interval, City holding firm at the back, limiting them to scraps. Vinícius offered himself on the left, although this time City had Kyle Walker, back from injury, to counter him. Nobody beats Walker in a foot race. Vinícius wanted a foul for a nudge by Walker as they chased a ball over the top but it was wishful thinking. There was also a perfectly timed slide tackle by the full-back on Vinícius inside the area on 40 minutes. It was the visitors who had the clearer first-half chances. De Bruyne released Bernardo Silva with a lovely pass and he went for the near top corner – with power – to draw a smart save out of Courtois. De Bruyne also teed up Gabriel Jesus, who swiped narrowly wide, while there was a sweet hit on the volley by Foden from 25 yards that worked Courtois. There would be frustration when Riyad Mahrez overhit a pass for the breaking De Bruyne in the 45th minute. Carlo Ancelotti, fresh from completing his European grand slam of league titles, having secured La Liga at the weekend, started Modric in the No 10 role, giving him plenty of scope to roam. The manager offered him the platform. How he craved a moment from Modric. The tension crackled, the crowd surged whenever Real did. Vinícius fluffed an opportunity at the far post straight after the second-half restart, although again the flag went up, and Modric did not summon the power in a shot after good work by Vinícius. Benzema also narrowly failed to play in Vinícius. City started to wonder whether it would matter if they could not score. As long as they continued to get bodies around the ball, to maintain their defensive discipline, they would advance. Walker was a symbol of their fight. In his first game for three weeks, it appeared that he would have to go off on the hour after feeling pain only to return. He would eventually be forced off after taking another bang. City thought they had done enough when Walker’s replacement, Oleksandr Zinchenko, combined with another substitute, Ilkay Gündogan, to set Silva away for the assist for Mahrez. They were wrong.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid in final after Rodrygo and Karim Benzema stun Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report
5/5/2022,"Just over a year ago, an evil cabal of European billionaires, American hedge fund plutocrats, Russian oligarchs and Gulf royals came up with a scheme to rip out the heart of the beautiful game and place it on the altar of their greed. Only the heroic resistance of ordinary football fans, aided by an Old Etonian prime minister with his finger on the populist pulse, stopped this diabolical liberty. What – as Lord Sugar might have said, were the former Tottenham Hotspur chairman not part of the problem – a load of old tut. And yet this is the story told by Kicking Off: The Rise and Fall of the Super League (BBC Two), of the fateful days in April 2021 when the owners of 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, including six from the Premier League, unveiled plans for a breakaway competition to rival Uefa’s Champions League. Then, in just three days, the plans were kicked into touch, thanks to fan protests. Another less flattering version of the story was airbrushed from this documentary. Fans of leading clubs might just as easily be thought of not as resisting capitalistic excess, but as implicated in its spread. That story would tell how football has deracinated communities, introduced pricing policies that make opera seem affordable and colluded with the world’s most despotic regimes, while fans cheer from the sidelines. If you think I exaggerate, consider what happened at Stamford Bridge two months ago. Newcastle United fans barracked their Chelsea homologues with a banner that read “We’re richer than you”. Newcastle, you see, had recently been bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s £315bn Public Investment Fund, giving it means beyond even the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, Chelsea’s owner, whose assets had just been frozen by the UK government because of his cosy relationship with Vladimir Putin. The day before the Toon Army made this boast, Saudi Arabia executed 81 men. In short, football fans are not always the principled souls presented by this documentary’s talking heads. In the programme, the Match of the Day host and former England striker Gary Lineker makes an intriguing point: “[Football] is not a religion. But it’s not far off for many people. They don’t want it messed around with.” It is true that football fans worship at the temples of the Etihad or the Emirates as their ancestors did in church: the game is not exactly the opiate of the masses, but of those who can afford astonishingly expensive season tickets or are prepared to make Rupert Murdoch richer by subscribing to Sky Sports. But despite what Lineker says, fans have long been happy to see the game messed around with. They have welcomed transfusions of dirty money, applauded teams filled with vigilantes on six-figure weekly salaries, even endorsed shirt sponsors who induce vulnerable people to gamble with money they don’t have. None of this is to say that the dirty dozen should be let off the hook. This documentary explains how and why an old guard of debt-ridden elite clubs devised the European Super League. A central motivation was to resist the rise of the nouveau riche, such as Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, both of which are funded by Gulf states’ oil money and able to draw on unprecedented capital to secure the best talent. To survive, clubs such as Real Madrid and Juventus wanted to tilt the playing field in their favour. Their proposition amounted to a competition between 20 teams, ringfenced to include 15 founder members every year, plus five who would qualify based on their performances over the past five years, rather than season-by-season achievement in their national league. This would have made the competition akin to the NFL and the NBA in the US, which feature the same teams every year. Why is this intolerable to fans? Because, as this documentary keeps telling us, it crosses a red line, namely that any team should be able to climb to the very top through performance alone. In truth, this is nonsense on stilts. The playing field has long been tilted in favour of the teams with the fattest stacks of banknotes. Bradford Park Avenue or Blyth Spartans (to name a couple of impecunious Bs) will never climb to the top unless something counterintuitive happens – say, a bored sheikh decides to fling a few hundred million at them. To pretend otherwise is to buy the lie at the heart of this programme, namely that football fans are nobly fighting wicked plutocrats. But here is the twist. Uefa is finessing plans to expand the Champions League. As Jonathan Liew argued last month in the Guardian, that could involve giving places to historically successful clubs who fail to qualify, which would make it a super league in all but name. This may prove that the fans’ battle to save the soul of football last April was not successful, as this programme claims. And, worse yet, that the supposedly beautiful game has become chronically, perhaps irredeemably, ugly.",Arts/Television & radio,Kicking Off: The Rise and Fall of the Super League review – a load of old tut,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/04/kicking-off-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-super-league-review-a-load-of-old-tut
5/5/2022,"An independent investigation into allegations of misconduct at a top London state school – including safeguarding breaches, discrimination, bullying and favouritism – has found that “on the balance of probabilities” every complaint made happened. More than 100 former students and staff at Holland Park school in west London submitted evidence to the investigation, which also considered allegations that Ofsted was misled by senior leaders and that there was “overt sexism, Islamophobia, and racism” at the school. On safeguarding, the investigation found the school had failed to support students who had been victims of peer-on-peer sexual abuse, there were inappropriate responses to the case of a teacher who was found to have had a relationship with a pupil, and there was “exploitation” within some student-teacher relationships. There was a culture of fear, favouritism and inequality, a summary of the 554-page report said, with staff and students publicly humiliated. Some of those who gave evidence to the investigation are still traumatised by their experiences. On Ofsted, the report said some staff questionnaires relating to an inspection in January 2020 were destroyed, while certain students were taken off-site or told not to attend school during the inspection. Parents with children currently at the school include the secretary of state for levelling up, Michael Gove, and former Commons Speaker John Bercow. The complaints relate to events dating back as far as 2004, when the school was under the control of the local authority, Kensington and Chelsea, to September 2013, when it became a single academy trust, and up to December 2021. Former head teacher Colin Hall, who left last September, said at the time the allegations began to emerge: “We don’t recognise the characterisation of the school or our leadership in the allegations raised.” A statement issued by the board of governors on Wednesday, which accompanied the summary of the report, said: “The investigator’s view, based upon extensive and corroborative evidence provided during interviews, is that on the balance of probabilities every complaint is found to have happened. “These include bullying, favouritism and the public humiliation of staff and students, serious safeguarding failures, dubious spending, the misleading of Ofsted, and vulnerable children and key worker children not being accommodated at the school during Covid-19 lockdowns against government guidance.” The statement said the board, which has recently been reconstituted, “deeply regrets” that the investigation – carried out by independent investigator, Jessica Joels, of B3sixty, which specialises in workplace investigations – has concluded that these events had occurred. “We are taking the findings very seriously. As a result, and after much consideration, the governors intend to make one referral to the Teaching Regulation Agency and will be commencing a disciplinary investigation in respect of three members of staff. All will be given a full opportunity to respond before any conclusion is reached.” Former pupil Zahra Enver, 20, who was among those who wrote an open letter which helped trigger the investigation, welcomed the report. “We are so grateful and proud of everyone who came forward and hope this summary report can provide some healing for them.” Former teachers Elizabeth Holland and Lara Agnew added: “All the teachers who came forward to submit evidence to this inquiry have shown extraordinary courage and taken a considerable risk in doing so.” The Department for Education previously issued the school with a notice to improve in November 2021, highlighting financial mismanagement as well as “leaders’ excessive salaries and failure to seek prior approval from the government for ‘novel and contentious’ expenditure”.",News/Education,Investigation finds school failed vulnerable children and misled Ofsted,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/04/investigation-finds-school-failed-vulnerable-children-and-misled-ofsted
5/5/2022,"Joe Biden has warned of new attacks on civil rights as the supreme court prepares to strike down the right to abortion, telling reporters at the White House that LGBTQ+ children could be the next targets of a Trump-dominated Republican party he called “this Maga crowd” and “the most extreme political organisation … in recent American history”. “What happens,” the president asked, if “a state changes the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children? Is that legit under the way the decision is written?” Biden’s remarks, at the end of a brief session on deficit reduction, referred to a leaked draft of a ruling by Justice Samuel Alito. One of six conservatives on the supreme court, Alito was writing on a Mississippi case which aims to overturn both Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, and Casey v Planned Parenthood from 1992, which buttressed it. The Mississippi case is expected to be resolved in June. The leak of the draft ruling to Politico, which reported that four other conservatives on the nine-justice court supported it, caused a storm of controversy and anger. In a statement and remarks on Tuesday, Biden condemned Alito’s reasoning and intentions and called for legislation to codify Roe into law. But the president has faced criticism within his own party for seeming reluctant to contemplate reform such legislation would require, namely abolishing the Senate filibuster, the rule that requires 60 votes for most bills to pass. A lifelong Catholic who nonetheless supports a woman’s right to choose, Biden has been eclipsed as a strong voice against the attack on abortion rights by high-profile Democratic women including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who spoke angrily outside the court on Tuesday, and the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Harris’s struggles as vice-president have been widely reported but on Tuesday night, speaking to the Emily’s List advocacy group in Washington, she seemed to hit her stride. The former prosecutor and California senator said: “Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponise the use of the law against women. Well, we say, ‘How dare they?’ “How dare they tell a woman what she can do and cannot do with her own body? How dare they? How dare they try to stop her from determining her own future? How dare they try to deny women their rights and their freedoms?’” She asked: “Which party wants to expand our rights? And which party wants to restrict them? It has never been more clear. Which party wants to lead us forward? And which party wants to push us back? You know, some Republican leaders, they want to take us back to a time before Roe v Wade.” At the White House on Wednesday, Biden took brief questions. He was asked about sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine and about “the next step on abortion once this case gets settled”. “As I said when this hit, as I was getting on the plane to go down to Alabama, this is about a lot more than abortion,” he said. “I hadn’t read the whole opinion at that time.” The 79-year-old president then gave a lengthy, somewhat rambling answer about “the debate with Robert Bork”. Bork was nominated to the supreme court by Ronald Reagan in 1987. Biden was then chair of the Senate judiciary committee. The nomination failed. At the White House, Biden said Bork “believed the only reason you had any inherent rights was because the government gave them to you”, a stance with which Biden said he disagreed. Biden also said Bork had opposed Griswold v Connecticut, the 1965 case which established the right to contraception – a right many on the left fear may be left open to rightwing attack once Roe, another case concerning privacy, has been overturned. In her speech the previous night, Harris said: “At its core, Roe recognises the fundamental right to privacy. Think about that for a minute. When the right to privacy is attacked, anyone in our country may face a future where the government can interfere in their personal decisions. Not just women. Anyone.” The vice-president also said: “Let us fight for our country and for the principles upon which it was founded, and let us fight with everything we have got.”",News/World news,Biden warns LGBTQ+ children could be next target of Republican ‘Maga crowd’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/biden-lgbtq-children-next-target-maga-crowd
5/5/2022,"Good morning. Fears mount for the defenders of Mariupol as Russian troops enter the besieged city’s Azovstal steel plant. On the Australian election trail, Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will be out in Sydney, with jobs and childcare on the agenda. Contestants in the north Queensland seat of Herbert have condemned One Nation for running a candidate who lives in outer Melbourne, with independent Angela Egan saying she was “flabbergasted and disgusted” and Katter’s Australian party’s Clynton Hawks reviling a “ring-in from three states away”. Analysts suggest declining party memberships plus additional competition among the libertarian right could explain One Nation’s scramble to field candidates in a state it still hopes to yield a Senate seat. With the election seemingly tightening, both Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have warned of the “chaos” of a potential hung parliament, but a Guardian Australia analysis suggests minority governments have enjoyed relative success passing legislation. And, as Paul Daley writes, stark differences remain between Labor and the Liberals, not least their ability to wrangle a potentially rowdy 47th parliament. Up to 600 people are now believed to have been killed in Russia’s bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in March, a number double that previously estimated. Contact has been lost with Ukrainian defenders of the Azovstal steelworks – a symbol of the city’s ongoing resistance to heavy Russian shelling. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for Vladimir Putin to pay “a high price for his brutal aggression”, with the EU proposing a ban on Russian oil imports. Oil revenue from the EU has handed the Kremlin an estimated €21bn (A$31bn) since the conflict started. Hungary and Slovakia have voiced opposition to the move. Joe Biden has slammed Trumpian Republican supporters as “the most extreme political organisation in American history”. The president’s comments came in response to the shock leaking of a supreme court draft ruling that would move to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case, which guaranteed the right to abortion. The news has prompted a wave of protests outside courts across the US, with leading Democrats discussing option of codifying abortion rights into law via the US Congress instead. Conservationists have accused the NSW Liberals of caving in to their Coalition partners, the Nationals, over koala habitat preservation. Under new rules core koala habitat is protected from logging but there is a lengthy list of exemptions. Regional Australians living in areas historically sustained by fossil fuel industries are “overwhelmingly” acknowledging the need to transition, a report claims. But local workers have expressed concerns that new industries could adversely affect working conditions. Victoria’s population is poised to reverse pandemic declines, with increasing migration from overseas and returning international students set to return growth to pre-pandemic levels by mid 2024. Interstate migration is also tipped to rise, due to the state’s favourable liveability ratings. The son of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos leads just days out from the nation’s presidential election, withe polls suggesting Ferdinand Marcos Jr is favoured to win, despite a history of corruption and human rights abuse during his father’s 21-year rule, including nine under martial law. The US Federal Reserve has moved sharply to act against inflation, issuing a 0.5 percentage points rise in the benchmark interest rate – the largest single raise since 2000, and a first increase since 2018. Splits are emerging within Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats over the country’s mooted Nato membership, with leading ministers reportedly loath to reverse nearly 200 years of neutrality. For those trapped in the cycle of insecure renting, meeting mortgage repayments amid looming interest rates rises is a daunting prospect. But as Jordyn Beazley writes, Labor’s Help to Buy election promise could just make a difference. And there’s a real-world example of this already happening in outer Melbourne: “It allows you security of tenure, it’s your house … And on a monthly basis, you’re spending, in some cases, substantially less than you would if you’re in the private rental market.” Every month Guardian Australia adds 20 of Australia’s best new songs to a Spotify playlist.
