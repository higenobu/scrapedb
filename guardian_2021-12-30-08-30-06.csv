12/30/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell gave little away as the jury handed down its guilty verdict in her sex-trafficking trial on Wednesday, standing in a black face mask with her hands folded. The jury had come to its decision after a trial in which lawyers and witnesses for the 59-year-old British socialite had argued that she was being scapegoated for the wrongdoing of close confidant Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who took his life awaiting trial on similar charges in August 2019.  Meanwhile, prosecutors had portrayed Maxwell as intimately aligned with Epstein and his activities, both emotionally and financially. In opening arguments, prosecutor Lara Elizabeth Pomerantz said the trial would hinge largely on testimony by four victims who would accuse Maxwell of grooming them for abuse by Epstein between 1994 and 2004, when some were minors. Three “Jane Does” – “Carolyn”, “Jane” and “Kate” – as well as artist Annie Farmer gave evidence during the trial. Pomerantz said Maxwell played an essential role in abusing young girls, saying she “manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused”. Maxwell, she said, was motivated to satisfy Epstein’s sexual desires in order to maintain her jet-set lifestyle. Sarah Ransome arrives at the courthouse The sex-trafficking trial drew a wide range of onlookers, including Sarah Ransome, who recently published a book about her experiences on Epstein’s Caribbean island. Others standing sentinel were members of the Q-anon conspiracy group, who linked Maxwell to far-fetched beliefs of a Democratic party child sex ring centered on a Washington pizza parlor, victims rights attorney Lisa Bloom and members of Maxwell’s family. A lone protester Isabel Maxwell and Sarah Ransome Maxwell’s defense attorneys sought to undermine the credibility of her four accusers, arguing that their memories of Maxwell’s involvement had been embellished over time and that they now wrongfully implicated Maxwell in Epstein’s crimes. Bobbi Sternheim, Maxwell’s lead defense attorney, told the court that “ever since Eve was tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men, and women are often villainized and punished more than the men ever are.” She continued: “The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did, but she is not Jeffrey Epstein, she is not like Jeffrey Epstein, and she is not like any of the other men, powerful men, moguls, media giants who abuse women.” During the trail, defense lawyers sought to capitalize on witness testimony that strayed from the central charges, including the testimony of Juan Alessi, a housekeeper and driver for Epstein. Alessi said he was told to pick up an accuser known as Jane from her school and deliver her to Maxwell, but went on to testify that during his time working for Epstein he’d seen topless women lounging around the pool hundreds of times. “There were many, many females,” he added. “Most of them appeared to be in their late 20s or 30s.” The three victims who testified under pseudonyms – “Carolyn”, “Jane” and “Kate” – offered the court often harrowing accounts of their (alleged) experiences under Maxwell’s direction at Epstein’s properties. All three described how, as teenagers, they were drawn into intimate conversations with Maxwell, who then arranged massages with Epstein that then led to sexual encounters in exchange for cash and gifts. “Carolyn” – 14 at the time – claimed Maxwell had touched her breasts, hips and buttocks and told her she had “a great body for Epstein and his friends”. A fourth witness, Annie Farmer, testified that she’d been told by Maxwell to get undressed and lie on a massage table at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch. Maxwell, she testified, “pulled the sheet down and exposed my breasts, and started rubbing on my chest and on my upper breast”. Ghislaine Maxwell has appeared confident and composed throughout the trial, even sketching the court artists. Photographs shown in court, including this one that some say was taken at the Queen’s Balmoral estate, were seized by US authorities after Epstein was arrested in July 2019 when FBI agents searched Epstein’s townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Prosecutors said agents had seized hundreds of pictures, some featuring nude or partially nude young women and girls. Those that the court released mostly showed Maxwell and Epstein in holiday settings. Defense lawyers objected their release, arguing it could not be shown that the images were unaltered and it was unnecessary for prosecutors to place multiple pictures into evidence. Maxwell gives Epstein a foot massage on the financier’s Boeing 727 – called “Air Lolita” by some – and a plane that flight logs revealed in court show had once carried passengers Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. The plane’s pilot, the first witness in the case, testified that it had been outfitted with a purple carpet. In another undated photo Maxwell and Epstein take to the hills on a trailbike. Sarah Kellen and Nada Marcinkova, both former Epstein assistants, were questioned by lawyers about whether Prince Andrew had any involvement in Epstein’s abuse of underage girls. They were among four named Epstein associates identified by US prosecutors as “potential co-conspirators” in a controversial plea deal Epstein struck in 2007, after admitting he solicited prostitution from a minor. The women have since reinvented themselves as Nadia Marcinko and Sarah Kensington. Outside the court, advocates for survivors of child sex trafficking said the Maxwell trial was a rare case in which prosecutors were attempting to hold a perpetrator accountable. The Polaris Project, which runs the US National Human Trafficking Hotline, has said it has recorded 14,597 probable victims of sex trafficking, with 17 being the average age “of entry”. A supporter of Never Stand Alone, a rights group dedicated to survivors of abuse from plain communities. The group says its mission is “to ensure that no one walks their path alone as a survivor, and no one stands alone when facing their abuser in the courtroom”. A week into the trial, Maxwell’s family wrote to US Attorney General Merrick Garland to appeal for “immediate improvements” in her detention conditions. A two-page letter, signed by all of Maxwell’s surviving siblings, claimed she had “received minimal sustenance during the first week for each whole court day – sometimes no food at all. ” Jennifer Kalin, who has never publicly told her story, also appeared at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan. Her attorney, Bradley Edwards, said Kalin had been ensnared by Epstein, abused and forced into marriage. “She realizes people are sticking their necks out and testifying and wants them to know they’re not alone,” Edwards told the Daily Beast. Maxwell’s defense had wanted to call Bradley Edwards, who represented the victim known as “Kate,” but were denied by Judge Nathan. Their purpose, it seemed, was to draw further attention to the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund, which has payed out about $150m to victims of the financier, including “Kate”, who received $3.2m, and “Carolyn”, who received $2.8m. As the trial wound down, defense lawyers could be seen removing boxes from the federal courthouse. As they were deliberating, jurors requested to review testimony of three of four women who testified against Maxwell.

12/30/2021,"For the Duke of York, the fact he was barely mentioned in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial will have been an undoubted relief. With Maxwell declining the stand, no opening of her “little black book” of society contacts and, crucially, no sign of his accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, Prince Andrew was a mere footnote in the New York proceedings. Maxwell opted not to give evidence before being found guilty on five of six charges, saying there was “no need” because prosecutors had failed to prove their case, so the subject of Andrew was not raised with her via cross-examination.  Of her book of contacts – said to be a version of Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous 97 pages of names and addresses – all but one small extract remained under seal on the judge’s orders. As a close friend of Maxwell’s, Andrew’s details would undoubtedly have been inside, possibly allowing prosecutors to prise the door open on her relationship with the royal. However, it was the non-appearance of Giuffre, 38, who was called neither by the prosecution nor the defence, that prevented him being thrust head-first into the high-profile trial. Giuffre is suing Andrew in a civil lawsuit, claiming he had sex with her on three occasions two decades ago when, aged 17, she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein, allegations Andrew vehemently denies. Her absence was perplexing, as her name was introduced countless times, her photograph was shown in court and she has been one of the most prominent accusers of Epstein and Maxwell. A deposition, given by Maxwell in a 2016 civil suit brought by Giuffre, formed the basis of two perjury charges against the British socialite, who denied all charges. Giuffre was “available” if called upon to give evidence, the court heard. “Certainly, if she had been called, it would have seen Andrew centre-stage,” said Mark Stephens of the law firm Howard Kennedy. Prosecutors gave no reason for their decision. But they may have feared it would complicate the case, especially if inconsistencies could be shown in accounts Giuffre has previously given over the years. It could be, said Stephens, “that the reason the prosecution did not call Giuffre in the Ghislaine Maxwell case is that they risked an own goal if her credibility could be undermined, which would have given Maxwell a leg-up”. Andrew’s lawyers have sought to target Giuffre’s credibility as they attempt to get the case against him dismissed in the civil proceedings she has brought. His legal team has painted her as an unreliable witness, querying certain dates and figures she has provided, and accusing her of seeking another “payday”. She has previously explained any discrepancies as innocent mistakes, and the result of recalling events from many years ago that had left her traumatised. Andrew’s part in Maxwell’s courtroom drama was, therefore, reduced to mentions of him being a guest onboard Epstein’s “Lolita Express” private plane, with the pilots testifying to seeing nothing to suggest sexual activity on the part of those onboard during flights. “It’s fair to say, I think, there must be some relief for Andrew that Giuffre did not appear, because it does distance him, somewhat, from the case,” said Stephens. Nonetheless, he added, “it did not matter if Maxwell was found guilty, or innocent”, as the prince’s reputation was already tarnished, “indelibly so, as, frankly, the association with a convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is enough”. “A guilty verdict on Ghislaine Maxwell, you might say, is almost priced in regarding Prince Andrew and reputational damage. People have already made up their minds about him and the verdict would have no impact on how they view him.” Now Andrew must brace for the next round in the civil case against him, with the US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan scheduling a 4 January hearing when the royal’s lawyers are expected to argue for a dismissal of the case. If they are not successful, or if the case is not settled, it is expected to go for trial between September and December 2022.",News/US news,Prince Andrew emerges with barely a mention in Ghislaine Maxwell trial,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/prince-andrew-ghislaine-maxwell-trial
12/30/2021,"Ministers have been urged to take tougher action against companies that fail to stamp out anti-vaccination content online, as it was revealed posters with hundreds of thousands of followers on social media are still churning out disinformation. After Boris Johnson said that up to 90% of patients with Covid in intensive care across England had not had their third booster vaccine, Labour accused the government of being complacent on “a matter of life and death” and failing to stand up to social media giants.  Prominent anti-vaxxers on Instagram, Facebook and Telegram still have nearly 1.5 million followers, analysis compiled by Labour showed. The most popular were in the name of David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who wrongly believes that coronavirus is spread by 5G. Some disinformation is also hosted on an alternative streaming site – BrandNewTube – a link to which is then posted on other, mainstream social media sites. Videos have amassed up to 3.7m views, sparking fears that during a crucial stage in the booster programme some people are being put off getting jabbed. Around 10% of eligible people have not had their first vaccine, rising to 17% for a second dose. The booster rollout is still under way but 42% of people have not yet had a third vaccine. The shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, said the continuing spread of vaccine misinformation online “is hitting vaccine uptake, and tackling this is critical to getting the unvaccinated vaccinated”. Given the government has urged everyone eligible for a booster vaccine to take up the offer, she added: “One person put off the vaccine by dangerous anti-vaxxers is one too many.” Powell said tech giants were “failing to wipe out vaccine lies” and that “government complacency on fake news means that they are failing to take action against online platforms that are facilitating the spread of disinformation”. She called it as “matter of life and death” and called on ministers to stand up to social media firms, “ignore their excuses, and introduce financial and criminal penalties for failures that lead to serious harm”. It was also claimed that a government-commissioned body known as the counter disinformation policy forum was wound down in June 2021. It had brought together social media companies, academics and fact-checkers in response to fears about the harm posed by anti-vaxxers. Powell asked for an update on the forum in a parliamentary written question, but in his answer DCMS minister Chris Philp said it had “concluded”. He added the department still “regularly meets with major social media platforms bilaterally” to discuss the issue. A government spokesperson said ministers had “been providing people with advice and information about vaccines in one of the most extensive public health campaigns ever launched”. They added that although a pilot had ended in the summer a counter-disinformation unit still exists and “continues to work closely with social media companies to identify and remove dangerous disinformation about vaccines”. The spokesperson said: “Our tough new online safety laws will force these companies into action. Now that parliament has provided the necessary scrutiny of the legislation, we will introduce it as soon as possible.” A senior government source said: “It’s a real shame that Labour are spreading their own misinformation in a desperate attempt to score political points in the fight against the virus. The counter disinformation unit continues to carry out its work and has not been stood down.” Just before the coronavirus pandemic broke out, the World Health Organization said in 2019 that vaccine hesitancy was one of the top 10 threats to global health and that it was important people were given “credible information” about inoculation to understand the benefits of getting jabbed.
