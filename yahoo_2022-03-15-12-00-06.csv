3/15/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - A Kyiv auto mechanics workshop has jumped from car repairs and maintenance to adapting captured Russian weapons for use by Ukrainian troops defending the capital. Oleksandr Fedchenko said he had been throwing around ideas with staff at his car repair shop after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last month, wondering how they could help outgunned local forces. ""It turned out that there are people working at our shop who know how weapons work,"" he said. Ukrainian forces have stripped large quantities of Russian heavy machine guns and other weapons from armoured vehicles they have destroyed in the three weeks since the Kremlin launched what it called a special military operation in Ukraine. But removing their mountings and adapting them for use by troops fighting on foot requires the expertise of specialist mechanics. ""We collected a team of welders, engineers. We gave them drafts, we familiarized ourselves with the drafts. We made a prototype model and it worked,"" Fedchenko said. Ukrainian forces have been forced to adapt quickly and have managed to slow the advance of Russian troops pressing the capital Kyiv despite being outgunned on paper. ""We will remake those weapons so that the barrels will be directed to the enemy's side, but not ours,"" Fedchenko said.

3/15/2022,"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A military drone that apparently flew all the way from the Ukrainian war zone over three European NATO-member states before crashing in an urban zone of the Croatian capital was armed with an explosive device, Croatia’s defense minister said Sunday. The Soviet-made aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia, slamming into a field near a student dormitory late Thursday. About 40 parked cars were damaged in the large explosion, but no one was injured. “Traces of explosives and clues suggesting that this was not a reconnaissance aircraft were found. We found parts of an air bomb,” Croatian Defense Minister Mario Banozic said at the crash site. He said that this further raises a question about whether the drone belonged to Russia or Ukraine. “There are elements that indicated it could have come from both,” he said. Video: Drone company assisting with Ukraine’s defense Air crash investigators have pulled most of the drone’s remaining parts from a large crater it created on impact, including a partly damaged black box that should reveal the drone’s flight path. Croatian officials have criticized NATO for what they called a slow reaction to a very serious incident and called into question the readiness of the military alliance's member states to respond to a possible attack. NATO said the alliance’s integrated air and missile defense had tracked the object’s flight path. But Croatian officials said the country’s authorities weren't informed and that NATO reacted only after questions were posed by journalists. “If this situation had been detected and resolved in time in neighboring countries, we would not be here today,” Banozic said. “We will seek answers to what happened. The defense ministers of Romania and Hungary said that day they were evaluating what happened. We are waiting for an answer,” he said.

3/15/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A dissident legal scholar who was jailed for two years in China after participating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement was killed Monday in his law firm’s office in New York, where he had settled after seeking asylum in the U.S., police said. Li Jinjin, 66, was stabbed to death in the city where he had long worked as an immigration lawyer, even as he continued to advocate publicly for the many people jailed or killed by Chinese authorities during the nation’s democracy movement. An arrest was made in his killing. Police said Xiaoning Zhang, 25, was taken into custody and faces a murder charge. It wasn't immediately clear when she would be arraigned or if she had retained an attorney. Chuang Chuang Chen, the CEO of the China Democracy Party, and lawyer Wei Zhu, a friend of Li’s, both told The New York Daily News that the killing might have stemmed from Li’s refusal to take Zhang on as a client. Zhang came to the U.S. in August on an F-1 student visa to go to school in Los Angeles, Chen told the Daily News. Li, who also went by the first name Jim, was often quoted in recent years by news organizations looking for insight or commentary on the Chinese dissident community or on relations between China and the West. As an immigration lawyer, he also represented some Chinese expatriates living in the U.S. who were considered fugitives by that country. Prior to his imprisonment for protesting, Li had been a legal adviser to an independent labor union that had challenged China’s government on worker rights. “I can’t believe it. She not only destroyed his life, but the hope of our community,” Zhu told the newspaper. “He wanted to realize democracy in China. He will never realize that dream.”",U.S./Associated Press,Tiananmen Square protester killed in his New York law office,https://news.yahoo.com/tiananmen-square-protester-killed-york-022739162.html
3/15/2022,"Chris Hemsworth does a dehydration routine before filming a shirtless scene, his trainer says. He ups his water intake during the lead-up to filming, then drinks no water a day and a half before call time. His trainer says he ""wouldn't recommend"" the process, but they have found it helps make his muscles look denser and harder. Every shirtless scene Chris Hemsworth shoots as Thor has a grueling dehydration process behind it, according to his longtime trainer Luke Zocchi. Hemsworth has appeared shirtless in four movies in his role as Marvel's Thor. A week before he shoots a topless scene, Hemsworth gradually increases his water intake, then stops drinking water a day and a half before call time, Zocchi told Insider while promoting the lifestyle app, Centr, which he and Hemsworth founded. ""We start with three liters and everyday increase by one liter, and then by the end, he drinks seven liters of water,"" Zocchi said. ""Then around lunchtime before the scene, we cut water completely. This is by no means a healthy thing to do, and I wouldn't recommend that anyone else do this."" Zocchi said Hemsworth will simultaneously carb-cycle to prepare for the scenes. He depletes his body of carbs in the week leading up to filming, but then eats 40 grams of carbs every two hours in the last two days before call time. Zocchi said this process replenishes Hemsworth's muscles with glycogen after draining them of all their fluids, which makes them look denser and harder than they would naturally. ""So at the start of the day (before the scene) I would give him a sweet potato and brown rice, then closer towards the day I would give him rice cakes. And then half an hour before he stepped out I gave him snickers and a handful of lollipops, and he doubled in size by the end of the day,"" Zocchi said. Hemsworth also spends the last two days before filming doing high-rep, low-weight lifting workouts to build a pump in his muscles, Zocchi said. ""You're basically trying to look as hard and as dense as you can with your muscles and take all the fluid out of your body, and take out as much fat as you can,"" Zocchi said. Zocchi said he learned about this process from studying competitive bodybuilders, but added that he's seen contestants faint before or after competitions due to dehydration. A competitive bodybuilder named Mohammed Benaziza died at the age of 33 in 1992 from heart failure due to dehydration, according to Men's Health. Zocchi said that Hemsworth has gotten a headache or felt less energetic after his dehydration and carb-cycling routine, which are common symptoms of dehydration. There are also potential aesthetic downsides to the routine as well, according to a doctor. Doing this type of dehydration process can cause muscles to appear smaller in the future, Dr. Rand McClain, chief medical officer of the sports medicine clinic LCR Health, told Insider. McClain says dehydration can disrupt the low salt to water ratio in the body, which would cause muscles to flatten and shrink in size, which is ""the opposite of what they are trying to do."" Also, dehydrating the body after drinking a lot of water can send a signal to the body's cells that not enough sugar is in the blood, which can make a person hungrier and lead to more calorie consumption which could be converted to fat, McClain said.

3/15/2022,"A California middle school administrator fatally shot himself on campus Monday, authorities said, adding that no students witnessed his death. Police were called to Kraemer Middle School in Placentia in Southern California about 9 a.m. and discovered the man in the bathroom, with a firearm nearby, Placentia Police Capt. Brian Perry said. Officials think the incident happened before any students were on campus and before most staffers had arrived. Perry said students were dismissed early. The Coroner Division of Orange County was investigating the death. Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Superintendent Jim Elsasser said in a statement sent to parents that assistant principal Moises Plascencia died in a private staff area. The district will make mental health professionals available to students, staffers and members of the school community, Elsasser said in the statement. He described Plascencia as a member of the school's extended family. ""Moises was so much more than a respected assistant principal,"" the Elsasser said. ""He was a father, husband, brother and friend to so many in our school district community. His passing, and the manner in which it occurred, has left us devastated, confused and heartbroken.""

3/15/2022,"STORY: U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan pressed Washington's message on a Chinese diplomat... asking Beijing not to take additional actions to support Moscow amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The White House described the seven-hour sit down between Sullivan and Yang Jiechi as ""intense,"" reflecting what it called ""the gravity of the moment."" Sullivan warned China of the economic penalties and global isolation it would face if it continues to support Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki: “…Should they provide military or other assistance, that of course violates sanctions or supports the war effort, that there will be significant consequences, but in terms of what those specifics look like we would coordinate with our partners and allies to make that determination.” Psaki said the meeting had been scheduled for some time, adding: “It was a timely and important moment to have this conversation…” It took place as the U.S. told allies in NATO that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war. But China on Monday said reports of such a request from Russia was merely ‘U.S. disinformation.’ Russia, too, denied it had asked China for military assistance and said it has sufficient military clout to fulfill all of its aims in Ukraine. U.S. officials and allies have tried to make clear to Beijing in recent weeks that siding with Russia could carry consequences for trade flows, development of new technologies and could expose it to secondary sanctions. China, a key trading partner of Russia, has refused to call Moscow's actions an invasion, although China’s president Xi Jinping last week did call for ""maximum restraint"" and expressed concern about the impact of Western sanctions on the global economy.",Politics/Reuters Videos,'Intense' talks: U.S. warns China of aiding Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/intense-talks-u-warns-china-221930564.html
