3/29/2022,"Joe Biden on Monday defended the unscripted remarks he made at the end of a major speech in Poland at the weekend, in which he said that Russian president Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”, which had prompted hurried efforts by other senior figures in the administration to play down the comment in the face of international criticism. The US president, when questioned on Sunday after attending church following his return to the White House, denied that he was seeking “regime change” as a new policy. On Monday, at an event at the White House with director of the Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young, to present the 2023 budget proposals, Biden said of his remarks in Poland: “I’m not walking anything back.” He was adamant that he was not calling for regime change in Russia, and instead was expressing only his personal “moral outrage” at the “brutality” of Putin’s assault on Ukraine having visited some of the millions of refugees who have fled the war in the last month. “I was expressing the moral outrage I felt … I had just come from being with those families. But I want to be clear that I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change,” he said. “I make no apologies for it,” he added, of his remarks on Saturday. Biden said that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is “totally unacceptable” and said the comment does not undermine diplomatic efforts by the US and European allies to pursue peace and negotiate an end to the bombardment of Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators resume talks on Tuesday in Turkey, their first meeting in more than two weeks. On Sunday, the day after Biden called Putin a butcher and said he could not remain in power, French president Emmanuel Macron warned against the use of inflammatory language in an already volatile situation. Britain also distanced itself from the US comments. The Kremlin said the “personal insults” further undermined relations between the US and Russia. Pressed on Monday on his remarks, Biden was defiant, and said he was not worried that his comments would be interpreted as a call for regime change, or that it would be used by Russian propagandists to justify escalating Moscow’s aggression. “Nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin … nobody believes that,”he said. “I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man.” He repeated of Putin that “he should not remain in power” but acknowledged that “bad people” do often continue in their positions despite their conduct. Biden did not directly say whether he would be willing to meet with Putin, and it would depend “on what he wants to talk about”. And he said of the Russian president: “He continues on this course he is on, he is going to become a pariah worldwide, and goodness knows what he becomes at home.”",News/US news,‘I make no apologies’: Biden stands by ‘Putin cannot remain in power’ remark,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/biden-vladimir-putin-power-russia-ukraine
3/29/2022,"Good morning. Vladimir Putin appears unwilling to compromise as ceasefire talks begin. The Australian government will release its pre-election budget today. And heavy rains in NSW and Queensland have forced residents in recently flooded areas to evacuate again. Ukraine’s neutrality and the status of contested areas in the east could be on the table in ceasefire talks due to start on Tuesday, but with Russia’s invasion largely stalled, Kyiv will make no concessions on territorial integrity, officials have said. As negotiators arrived in Istanbul for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks, both sides played down the chances of a major breakthrough and a senior US official said Putin did not appear ready to compromise. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russian authorities of disrespect towards the families of their own dead soldiers, criticising Moscow for not agreeing on a scheme to have the remains of those killed in action returned to Russia.

Australia has lost influence in the Pacific by failing to act on climate and cutting foreign aid, Labor leader Anthony Albanese says, amid concerns about China’s proposed security deal with Solomon Islands. Australia and New Zealand are worried the draft agreement could jeopardise regional stability, with China having the opportunity to base navy warships in the Pacific less than 2,000km off the Australian coast. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, is due to address parliament in Honiara on Tuesday about security cooperation with China. Just 15% of projects announced in the government’s multibillion dollar infrastructure budget splurge have been endorsed as priorities by Infrastructure Australia, with the Coalition instead funnelling billions of dollars into must-win marginal seats. A Guardian Australia analysis of the 144 projects being funded by the government in Tuesday’s budget shows that just 21 are included on Infrastructure Australia’s current list of priority projects, accounting for $5.7bn of the approximate $16bn in new funding. Josh Frydenberg’s pre-election budget will also project Australia’s unemployment rate to drop to 3.75% this year, its lowest figure in 50 years, with the Coalition to talk up a “remarkable” post-pandemic recovery. And Queensland’s transport minister has described the budget eve announcement of a train line from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast as being in “circus sort of territory”, saying the promised money appeared “plucked out of the sky”. New data has identified the affluent Gold Coast suburb of Paradise Point as having the highest value of property at risk of coastal erosion in Australia. An estimated $1.4bn worth of property within 6.4km of the coastline in Paradise Point is at “very high risk” of coastal erosion or storm-surge-related damage within the next 30 to 60 years, according to analysis by CoreLogic.

3/29/2022,"Remember the happy clappy Rishi Sunak? The caring Dishi Rishi? The chancellor who could look lovingly into the camera at Downing Street press conferences and promise that he would have our backs? Always. The Good Samaritan who smiled as he dug deep behind the sofa to pay our wages when our employers could not? That Sunak is long gone. The new Rishi is a far snippier iteration. Someone who walks out of interviews when he doesn’t like the questions. Someone who is visibly irritated to have been forced to fill in a police questionnaire about the birthday party of a boss he cannot stand. And who cannot stand him. The dislike is mutual. Someone who is beginning to realise he might just have missed the boat. A month or two ago, Boris Johnson looked like he could be a goner at any moment and Sunak a leading contender to replace him. The chancellor’s poll ratings with Tory members were consistently high and he had the aura of competency. Now, not so much. Half the cabinet, including the prime minister, are actively briefing against him and the other half are merely biding their time to see how the cards play out. But Sunak is not going down without a fight. The job might be a lot tougher now many of his colleagues have withdrawn their support and he is having to take money off the country rather than hand it out, but he’s not planning on rolling over. And even though his spring statement had been torn apart by most independent analysts – along with some Tory MPs – he was determined to defend it to the death in his appearance before the House of Commons Treasury committee. Like most things the chancellor does these days, it didn’t go particularly well. When your luck’s out, your luck’s out. Sunak began by running through the mini-budget headlines with committee chair Mel Stride. He had done the responsible thing by not increasing borrowing, Sunak said. He clearly didn’t count the promised income tax cut of 1p in 2024 as guaranteed to increase borrowing, because he was only counting the measures that were effective as from this year. So if he had had to squeeze the poorest then it was their fault for not having saved more money when he had been so generous during lockdown. Or something like that. None of this went down that well with the committee. Labour’s Angela Eagle observed the government was presiding over the biggest fall in living standards since records began and that Sunak had chosen to put 1.3 million people into absolute poverty. Rishi immediately went on the attack. Well, what would she have done, he asked. Eagle drily observed that the committee hadn’t been convened to hear her choices. Sunak then lapsed into fantasy. His was a tax-cutting budget even though the tax burden in the current parliament was increasing to its highest level since the 1940s. And no, he couldn’t do more to help people on benefits as that would increase public borrowing. Look, it wasn’t his fault there had been a global pandemic and that energy and fuel prices were out of control. If some people had to go cold then so be it. Quite right, said Anthony Browne, one of the few loyal Tories. If energy prices went down, people would only use more of it. And that would be bad for the planet. “Well, Alison …” said Sunak as he talked over the SNP’s Alison Thewlis. He couldn’t have sounded more patronising if he had tried. The longer the session went on, the more out of touch the chancellor sounded. It was as if we were in an economics seminar with Sunak there to score academic points. He seemed to have no idea he was talking about real people’s lives. To him it was just a game. He couldn’t even accept that the £200 heating loan was a loan. That it would saddle people with more debt. Twice he insisted it was some mythical entity, halfway between a grant and a loan. He did, though, reluctantly concede that tax relief on solar panels would not benefit those on universal credits. But it would be dead handy for his gym and swimming pool. And it would also show the poor what they could aspire to if they worked harder. Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh asked him about his disastrous PR stunt at the Sainsbury’s garage. How was the Kia Rio? Now Sunak got decidedly huffy. He was very honoured to have filled up someone else’s car, he said. When people were struggling with rising prices, it was the duty of millionaires to help out the less well off. And by the way, his second car was only a VW Golf. He didn’t mention what his first car was. That was just the preliminaries. For after Sunak had yet again bemoaned his luck at having to deal with an unprecedented series of global events, McDonagh wondered why it was that the UK was the only country in the G20 to be increasing the tax burden at such a time. “Do you think people are stupid?” she asked. Sunak shrugged. Of course he did. That’s why he had announced a tax cut to coincide with the next election. It would give everyone something to look forward to as they went hungry now. The best came near the end as Conservative Kevin Hollinrake tried to tease out why the UK growth forecasts were so low. Rishi took this on the chin. Everyone had always known that a change in trading relationships with the EU would cause a hit to the UK economy. Really? That was odd. Because no one could remember seeing “Brexit will make you poorer” on the side of the bus. Maybe it had just been written in German. Not that Sunak could bring himself to say the B word, even when committee chair Mel Stride followed this up. “Oh no, no, no …” Rishi stammered, suddenly aware he had disclosed the government’s worst kept secret. The 18-year-old Treasury official sitting next to Sunak went white. The chancellor tried to cover it up by saying it was impossible to disaggregate Brexit from the pandemic, but Stride wasn’t having it. The truth was there in black and white. The OBR had a graph showing the UK worse off because of Brexit. For the first time Sunak lapsed into near silence. Just waiting for the end. There were no photo ops to be had. No flags to pose behind. If his budget hadn’t been career ending then his Brexit indiscretion might be. His life was just going from bad to worse. It would be just his luck to end the week with a fixed penalty notice for Partygate.",News/Politics, ‘Do you think people are stupid?’ Sunak shrugged.

3/29/2022,"An alleged poisoning targeting, apparently, one of the country’s best known international figures. Such a story could only really involve Russia, the state accused of being behind dozens of poisonings over the past century. The plot, in its initial telling, appears bizarre: Roman Abramovich, now the outgoing owner of Chelsea FC, and Ukrainian negotiators engaged in back channel talks were targeted after a meeting in Kyiv – developing symptoms including peeling skin, irritable eyes and were, it is said, painfully crying. Can we be sure they were poisoned? Not really; the three men were too busy to provide samples to German toxicologists quickly enough. And their symptoms, never life threatening, appear to have improved. So like a true Russian mystery, the truth may never be known. But the Kremlin has enough form in this area for poisoning to be a plausible cause, a hundred-year history that dates back to the founding of Moscow’s Lab X poisoning laboratory by Vladimir Lenin back in 1921. Names, leaders and possibly ideologies may have changed over the intervening period, but the current regime of Vladimir Putin is accused of being behind multiple poisonings of those who opposed the Kremlin, including the use of the nerve agent novichok. The FSB is accused of trying to kill opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who collapsed on an internal flight in August 2020 and only survived because he was able to get to specialists in Germany for treatment. It was administered, an FSB agent later inadvertently revealed to Navalny himself, in the “inner seams” of his underpants. A couple of years before that, two agents from GRU military intelligence took a trip to Salisbury, although they had no intention of admiring the city’s 123-metre-high cathedral spire as they later claimed. Novichok, carried in a disguised perfume bottle, was sprayed on the door handle of the house of defector and former colleague Sergei Skripal. It was March 2018 and Sergei’s daughter Yulia was visiting. A few hours after the agents had visited, the two were found on a park bench in the centre of the Wiltshire city, foaming at the mouth and drifting in and out of consciousness. They were lucky to survive. Like Navalny they were able to receive timely treatment and the dose was not large. Not so fortunate was Dawn Sturgess, a Briton, whose partner had found the discarded perfume bottle in a bin and given it to her thinking it was a gift. Spraying it on her wrists in July 2018, she fell ill within fifteen minutes and died a few days later. The incidents are so notorious – perhaps this is the intention, to induce a psychology of fear – that they can be recalled at speed: Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium-laced tea, leading to his slow and dramatic death in London in 2006; Bulgarian defector Georgi Markov with a poison tipped umbrella in 1979, an operation in which the Russian KGB is accused of helping enable. Nor is the goal always to kill. Labour MP Chris Bryant revealed he fell violently ill with food poisoning during an official trip to Russia in 2009, when he was a junior Foreign Office minister. It was, he learned, “standard irritants meted out by the FSB to ‘difficult’ visitors”. Poisoning episodes are not unfamiliar in Ukraine either: presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko was a 50-year-old with youthful looks when he ran for the top job against pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych, but fell ill on the campaign trail, his face rapidly disfiguring. It was, scientists concluded, the result of dioxin poisoning, but it remains unclear who did it. Yushchenko’s former chief of staff blamed Russia for the attack, but that has never been proven. Either way it was not very successful in stopping him – Yushchenko triumphed over his rival and served a term as president. Allies of the poisoned men – it is not clear whom – have this time blamed hardliners in Moscow, who, according to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, “wanted to sabotage talks to end the war”. It is, given the long murky history of poisonings, a plausible explanation, if nothing else. A more interesting question would be who might order such an operation. The Kremlin has always denied being involved in poisonings. But only the state has the power to use such deadly and complex substances. Plus, the growing centralisation of Russian state power under Putin leads to the conclusion it would be a bold underlining to sanction such a plot against a high-profile oligarch without authorisation from the top. If, that is, it was a poisoning at all. A murky business all round.",News/World news,A familiar plot but truth may never be known about latest ‘Russian poisoning’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/truth-may-never-be-known-about-latest-russian-poisoning-roman-abramovich
3/29/2022,"The latest round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, set to begin in Istanbul on Tuesday, have been overshadowed by claims that the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and other members of an informal Russian-Ukrainian negotiating group suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month. The allegations surfaced on the eve of the first face-to-face peace talks in weeks, amid fears that the Kremlin was not ready to compromise, despite the stiff resistance its forces have encountered since the invasion began. The poisoning claims were first reported in the Wall Street Journal and by the investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, although a US official told Reuters on Monday evening the evidence did not point to poisoning. A source with direct knowledge of the incident claimed to the Guardian that Abramovich, the billionaire former Chelsea owner, was taking part in informal negotiations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early in March when he began to feel ill. According to the source, the Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation, and the men later left Ukraine for Poland, and then flew to Istanbul, where they received medical treatment. “It was during his first trip to Kyiv. Roman lost his sight for several hours. In Turkey, they were treated in a clinic, together with Rustem,” said the source. Earlier, Bellingcat issued a statement saying it believed the three men had been the victim of a suspected poisoning. “Bellingcat can confirm that three members of the delegation attending the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on the night of 3 to 4 March 2022 experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons,” it said. “One of victims was Russian entrepreneur Roman Abramovich,” wrote the outlet in a tweet. Bellingcat said the symptoms included eye and skin inflammation, and piercing pain in the eyes, and added that the three men recovered quickly. They left Kyiv the next day, drove to Poland, and then flew to Istanbul. “The three men experiencing the symptoms consumed only chocolate and water in the hours before the symptoms appeared. A fourth member of the team who also consumed these did not experience symptoms,” wrote Bellingcat, which said one of its investigators had been asked to provide an opinion on the incident by chemical weapons specialists. “Based on remote and on-site examinations, the experts concluded that the symptoms are most likely the result of … poisoning with an undefined chemical weapon,” said Bellingcat, The tests showed that if the illness had been caused by poisoning, it was unlikely to have been at a dosage intended to kill, Bellingcat said. Much about the story remains murky. Umerov wrote on Facebook that he was “fine”, and called on people not to trust “unverified information”. A US official cast further doubt on the account. “The intelligence highly suggests this was environmental,” the official told Reuters, adding: “Eg, not poisoning.” Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “There is a lot of speculation at the moment, and we recommend to only follow official information.” Abramovich was sanctioned earlier this month by Britain for his “clear connections” to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. However, he escaped US sanctions, reportedly because Zelenskiy asked Washington to hold off because of the role Abramovich was playing in peace negotiations. Abramovich was first brought into the peace talks as an unofficial channel to Vladimir Putin by the Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky, according to Rodnyansky’s son, also named Alexander and an economic adviser to Zelenskiy. “My father was the initial link in getting Roman Abramovich involved in the talks. We were looking for an alternative link to communicate our position to the very top,” Rodnyansky told the Guardian. “What can Abramovich do? He can potentially meet Vladimir Putin and try to convey something to him. But in general, there is limited scope for how much Roman can convey, given the realities in Russia. At the same time, we have to try and give any possibility for peace a chance,” he said. A source in Moscow said Abramovich had had personal meetings with both Zelenskiy and Putin over the past month and had travelled to Istanbul on Monday to take part in the talks there. Abramovich’s negotiations have been running in parallel with official negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian negotiating teams, which have taken place in Belarus and online. The second round of talks in Belarus happened around the same time as the reported date of Abramovich’s first visit to Kyiv. Two days later, a member of the official Ukrainian negotiating team, Denys Kireev, was shot dead. Early reports suggested he had been arrested for treason and was killed while resisting arrest. Later, Ukraine’s military intelligence service said he was a hero who had been killed in the line of duty. It is not clear if his death was related to his activities on the negotiating team. A new round of peace negotiations was due to begin in Istanbul on Tuesday. In an interview in a fortified building in Kyiv on Friday, Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said he felt the Russians were becoming more serious about the negotiations over time. “We can see how they’re changing their behaviour. Why? Because it’s one thing when you go to negotiations thinking tomorrow you’ll seize Kyiv, and it’s another thing when you are fighting for 30 days and you’ve got nowhere near it. There is some kind of thinking process going on there now,” he said. He declined to comment on Abramovich’s role in the negotiations.",News/World news,Abramovich and Ukrainian MP may have been poisoned this month,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/abramovich-and-ukrainian-mp-may-have-been-poisoned-this-month
