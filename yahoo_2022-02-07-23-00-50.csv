2/7/2022,"Apple (APPL) shouldn't let Peloton (PTON) end up in the hands of Nike or Amazon, contends Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives. While Apple is known to be cautious on doing big deals (last one was $3 billion for headphone maker Beats in 2014), a bid for Peloton makes sense. ""Acquiring Peloton would be a major strategic coup and catalyze the company's aggressive health and fitness initiatives over the coming years. With ~2.8 million paid subscriptions today and a very strong/unique competitive moat, Apple acquiring Peloton would be both an offensive and defensive acquisition in our opinion,"" Ives said in a new note. Continued Ives, ""On the defensive front, if Peloton was acquired by Amazon or Nike this would propel the winning bidder on the health and fitness front as well as gain a major foothold into the living rooms of consumers globally. On the offensive front, Apple through its Fitness+ subscription service and Apple Watch strategy would be able to leverage the Peloton services and flywheel to significantly bulk up its health care initiatives which have been a key strategic linchpin for CEO Tim Cook."" Ives assigns a takeout valuation of $12 billion to $15 billion for Peloton. The speculation from Ives comes on the heels of a new WSJ story late Friday saying Amazon and Nike have expressed interest in Peloton. Shares of Peloton surged 25% to $30.39 in pre-market trading Monday. The stock is back to trading above the $29 IPO price from 2019. At its pre-market price, Peloton's market cap stands at roughly $9.3 billion. Any buyout of Peloton would arrive against the backdrop of a true mess that has sent shares plunging in recent months. In a scathing letter in January, activist investor Blackwells Capital — which a source tells Yahoo Finance has amassed a less than 5% stake in the company — demanded Chairman, founder and CEO John Foley be immediately fired. ""Mr. Foley must be held accountable for his repeated failures to effectively lead Peloton,"" Blackwells Chief Investment Officer Jason Aintabi wrote in the letter. Aintabi lists a host of grievances with Foley, ranging from putting his wife in a key operational role at the company (apparel leader) to mishandling a safety recall for a treadmill. Blackwells believes Peloton should put itself up for sale, highlighting Apple, Nike, Sony and Disney as potential suitors. The letter materialized following a CNBC report that the struggling fitness company would temporarily halt production of its bikes and treadmills due to sluggish consumer demand. The company will reportedly stop producing its bikes for two months and treadmills for six weeks. Peloton refuted the report, saying it hasn't halted all production. It also pre-announced quarterly results, which showed a miss on the number of subscribers added. The company will announce its earnings after the close of trading on Feb. 8. To be sure, not everyone on the Street is sold on Peloton be a great acquisition candidate even at cheaper valuations compared to one year ago. ""Now, a large company may certainly choose to pay up for Peloton; however, based on our view of the fundamentals, we remain wary about the value Peloton would bring any of the cited companies, given its comparably small size, faltering demand, and declining engagement,"" long-time Peloton bear and BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said in a new note of his own on Monday.

2/7/2022,"Homebuyers got crushed last year as home prices soared at their highest clip on record. Housing economists saw that price growth—which peaked at a year-over-year rate of 20% last year—as simply unsustainable. Their economic models agreed: Among the seven forecast models reviewed by Fortune heading into 2022, every single one predicted home price growth would slow significantly this year. But over the past few weeks, that consensus is no longer so unified. Now, more industry insiders are throwing out their previous forecasts and replacing them with more bullish short-term outlooks. Indeed, some experts say the 2022 spring housing market might go down as one of the most competitive on record. Look no further than Zillow. Back in December, the home listing site predicted that U.S. home values would climb 11% this year. Economists at Zillow now say that forecast is too conservative. Their latest forecast finds home prices are set to spike 16.4% between December 2021 and December 2022. If it comes to fruition, it would mark another brutal year for home shoppers. Why is Zillow raising its 2022 home price growth forecast? A lot of it boils down to housing inventory. During the pandemic, inventory has plunged to a four-decade low as more buyers rushed into the market. That trend was predicted to reverse late last year as forbearance protection programs lapsed and mortgage rates rose. But not only has that not happened, the inventory situation has gotten worse. In January, there were just over 923,000 U.S. homes listed for sale on Zillow. That's down 40.5% from the pre-pandemic level in January 2020, and down 19.5% from January 2021. Simply put: The housing market is tighter right now than it was last year when bidding wars climbed to an all-time high. That explains why Zillow foresees a rough few months ahead for home shoppers. But there is a big wild card: As the Federal Reserve shifts policy to help tame inflation, its moves will indirectly result in higher mortgage rates. In fact, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in January already spiked to 3.56%—up from 3.11% in December. That marks the biggest one-month jump in mortgage rates in more than nine years. In the short-term, more buyers might rush into the housing market in order to lock down rates before they go higher. But in the long-term, higher mortgage rates would put downward pressure on price growth. Why? As mortgage rates rise, some buyers get locked out of the market altogether. ""Downside risks to our forecast remain,"" write the Zillow researchers. ""Elevated inflation heightens the risk of near-term monetary policy tightening, which would result in higher mortgage rates and weigh on housing demand...Higher rates are exacerbating buyers’ struggles with affordability, and they might dissuade some existing homeowners from moving, by raising the monthly mortgage cost of even those homes priced similarly to their current homes. By dampening both buyers’ and sellers’ appetite in this market, rising rates could drive down sales volumes this year, with uncertain effects on home prices."" Homebuyers and sellers alike would be wise to take Zillow's 16.4% price growth prediction—or any other real estate forecast model—with a grain of salt. After all, none of the major real estate forecast models predicted the historic home price boom we've seen over the past two years. Indeed, when the pandemic struck in spring 2020, Zillow and CoreLogic both predicted home prices would fall by spring 2021.
