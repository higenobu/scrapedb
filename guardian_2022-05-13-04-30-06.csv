5/13/2022,"A sequel to mockumentary This is Spinal Tap is in the works with the original director and cast. Spinal Tap II will see Rob Reiner return as both film-maker on and off the screen along with Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest. The film will be released in 2024 on the 1984 original’s 40th anniversary. “I can tell you hardly a day goes by without someone saying, why don’t you do another one?” Reiner said to Deadline. “For so many years, we said, ‘nah.’ It wasn’t until we came up with the right idea how to do this. You don’t want to just do it, to do it. You want to honor the first one and push it a little further with the story.” The plot will reportedly centre on the death of the fictional British band’s manager and his wife who then inherits a contract that requires them to do one last concert. There’s bad blood and anger towards Reiner’s film-maker Martin “Marty” Di Bergi who they feel did a hatchet job with the original documentary but returns to film their final hurrah. While the original was met with critical acclaim, it wasn’t an initial hit commercially, later finding an audience on VHS instead. Reiner has said that initial viewers were confused. “The first time we screened in Dallas, they didn’t know what the hell it was,” Reiner said. “People came up to me and said, I don’t understand why would you make a movie about a band no one has heard of and is so bad. Why would you do it? I said, it’s satire and I would explain, but it took a while for people to catch up to it. Now, it’s in the National Film Registry.” The original is set to screen at this year’s Cannes film festival which begins later this month and the sequel package will be shopped around at the festival’s market. Earlier this month saw the fictional band’s drummer Ric Parnell, who later toured with them in real life, die at the age of 70. “Nobody hit the drums harder than Ric,” McKean wrote on a GoFundMe page to help pay expenses associated with his death.",Arts/Film,This is Spinal Tap sequel in the works with original team attached,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/this-is-spinal-tap-sequel
5/13/2022,"The last time Stan Wawrinka stood across the net from Novak Djokovic, his victory in their 2019 US Open quarter-final unlocked a notable achievement. While Djokovic had dominated their rivalry 15-2 since they were teenagers, they had split the previous eight matches equally. For that brief period, they not only stood on an equal record but most of Wawrinka’s victories had been under the greatest pressure, deep in the final rounds of his three career-defining grand slam title runs. Those days are long gone. Having already had knee surgery in 2017, 14 months ago Wawrinka underwent the first of two surgeries on his left foot and was out for a year. His comeback has been long and arduous since, but he took several steps forward by beating the world No 17 Reilly Opelka at the Italian Open this week, reaching the third round and setting up an unexpected meeting with Djokovic. Rather than another one of their endless battles, the distance between them was an unsurprising reminder of how far Wawrinka still has to go as he looks to return to something near the top of the game at 37 years old. In 75 minutes, Djokovic comfortably defeated his old foe 6-2, 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals. “Only he knows how difficult it was with all the surgeries and injuries he had to deal with,” said Djokovic. “So of course you can see on the court that he’s slower than he was when he was playing at his best. I’m sure with his team he’s doing his best to get himself in the best shape, but it takes time.” With his mobility naturally limited due to his foot injury, Wawrinka is still working himself back into top physical fitness and feeling on the court. In other matches he has played more conservatively, his groundstroke speeds notably lower than in the past. The comeback is one of the toughest tasks in tennis, requiring players to shake off the frustration of their struggles in the early stages of their return, absorb the positives and move on. After his first two wins in a year, Wawrinka will find solace in the progress he has made since he was flattened by Elias Ymer, the world No 131, at an ATP Challenger event in Marbella six weeks ago. As Djokovic faces Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-final on Friday, Wawrinka’s comeback heads to home soil in Geneva next week: “I need those matches,” said Wawrinka. “I need the competition. You cannot practice that feeling of nerves, stress, the way you feel during the match, the way the body reacts.” Meanwhile, uncertainty continues to reign in the wake of Wimbledon’s decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from their tournament. The ATP player council has recommended that the ATP withholds its ranking points from Wimbledon, with both ATP and the WTA to make a final decision shortly. Earlier in the week, Rafael Nadal, a member of the player council, declined to comment on the situation, only saying that his job in the council is to “work in the benefit of every single player that we are representing”. On Thursday morning, the French Open tournament director, Amélie Mauresmo, explained in a radio interview with France Inter why the event will continue to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete there next week. “We have thought a lot, and I have the impression that there is no fair decision, one way or the other,” said Mauresmo. “We are in line with what European sports ministers have decided, we do not welcome teams but individual athletes. Obviously if an athlete speaks in the press for example and supports Vladimir Putin, there will be sanctions.”",Sport/Sport,Stan Wawrinka on comeback trail but loses to old foe Novak Djokovic in Rome,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/stan-wawrinka-on-comeback-trail-but-loses-to-old-foe-novak-djokovic-in-rome
5/13/2022,"The UK government is threatening to write new laws to allow it to unilaterally override parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol due to concerns over “peace and stability”. But what options are open to the UK, given the protocol was part of a legally binding international treaty co-signed with the EU? Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, thinks there are five options to consider. Article 16 of the protocol This is the most oft-cited set of clauses allowing for “safeguard measures” which could include a pause of the checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea in the event of “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist” or in the event that there is “diversion of trade”. In a statement earlier this week, the government said 200 retailers had stopped delivering to customers in Northern Ireland. But while article 16 allows the UK to take “safeguard measures”, this has already effectively been put in place through earlier unilateral action to suspend the checks on many goods. The section of the protocol also requires the UK to give the EU a month’s notice that it is invoking Article 16 and the protective measures must be reviewed with the EU in the joint committee every three months. As a negotiating tool this is not strong, but it could score points among unionists and Brexiter backbenchers. Article 7 (a) of the withdrawal agreement This gives direct effect to the supremacy of the withdrawal agreement over domestic law. It covers all three elements in the agreement – the Irish border, citizens rights and the divorce bill. To invoke in its entirety would be tantamount to walking away from the Brexit deal entirely. Using article 7 (a) would be very serious because it would mean removing the entire agreement which would remove citizens’ rights too. What the government could be looking at doing is just turning the agreement off in respect to anything to do with the Northern Ireland protocol. Section 8 (c) of the Withdrawal Act 2020 This enables the UK to implement updates to any EU directives in relation to the Northern Ireland trading arrangements without having to go through an act of parliament. It results in what is known as “dynamic alignment” of British and EU laws in this limited geographical area of the UK. This would delight the unionists who have complained that the UK’s sovereign right to make its own laws for the entire country has been undermined by the protocol. Section 38 (b) of the Withdrawal Act 2018 This is known as the Bill Cash clause, which recognises that the parliament of the UK is sovereign. While the clause has been frequently referred to in EU scrutiny committee hearings chaired by Cash, a veteran Eurosceptic, it has never been challenged. It is also seen as stating the obvious, and is unlikely to be the core of legal manoeuvres made by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Article 62 of the Vienna Convention Barnard thinks this is where Truss and the attorney general for England and Wales, Suella Braverman, could be focusing their legal arguments. The 1969 pact allows for a country to withdraw from an international treaty when “a fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the treaty”. Barnard says this would be open to challenge as all parties knew about the divisions in Northern Ireland and the Belfast Good Friday agreement includes mechanisms to respect all parts of the community. Article 62 also warns that this “change of circumstances” could not be a reason for walking away from an international treaty if “the existence of those circumstances [which allegedly changed]” were an “essential basis” of the consent of the two sides. As the protocol was all about protecting peace on the island of Ireland and ensuring no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this may not be a watertight ground for disapplying the treaty, she suggests.",News/Politics,How the UK may try to override the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/how-the-uk-may-try-to-override-the-northern-ireland-brexit-protocol
5/13/2022,"An artist whose staged portraits reflect the language of the family photo album has won one of the most prestigious prizes in photography, with judges saying her work “reframes and reclaims the black experience”. Deana Lawson from Rochester, New York, was awarded the £30,000 Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation prize 2022 at the Photographers’ Gallery in London for her solo exhibition Centropy, held at Kunsthalle Basel two years ago. Brett Rogers, the director of the Photographers’ Gallery and chair of the Deutsche Börse jury, praised Lawson’s inventiveness and the complexity of her approach to image making. “Her work, which reframes and reclaims the black experience, harnesses the traditional and the experimental and opens up a very unique connection between the everyday and the mystical,” she said. “Her subject matter sits somewhere between the ‘here and now’ and the past, a person and a people, the staged and the naturalistic, in a manner which is not didactic or issue-driven, but genuinely radical. The boldness of her vision and the empowered sensibility she brings to her protagonists is clearly the result of a carefully nuanced collaboration with her cast of ‘family’ members, which places her in a rare position of partner or narrator rather than auteur.” Lawson is renowned for her intimate staged portraits that explore intergenerational relationships and their effects within black culture. They reflect tropes from documentary photography and art history as well as the language of the family photo album. She frequently positions women as central protagonists, alongside the presence of elders, totemic male figures and symbolic archetypal characters, such as the celestial child. The images depict familiar domestic settings but contain some unsettling element – what the artist calls portals into other worlds, or portrayals of death or birth. Visitors are introduced to what Lawson calls her “ever-expanding mythological family”. Anne-Marie Beckmann, the director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation, said that while Lawson was grounded in the traditions of photography and in many ways quite classical, her images offered up new possibilities for the medium and its reception. “Interrogating the position of the black body in visual culture and playing with tropes such as family portraiture, artifice and nature, she takes the personal and makes it political, forcing an often unsettling contemplation of how and what we see.” The presentation at The Photographers’ Gallery marks Lawson’s first institutional show in the UK. The jury also acknowledged the work of the other shortlisted artists – Anastasia Samoylova, Gilles Peress and Jo Ractliffe.",Arts/Art and design,Artist who ‘reclaims black experience’ wins Deutsche Börse photography prize,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/12/deana-lawson-artist-reclaims-black-experience-wins-deutsche-borse-photography-prize
5/13/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has been accused of throwing her former agent and friend “under a bus” in a last-ditch attempt to save her reputation in the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial. The footballer’s wife was accused – during the third day of a libel trial at the high court on Thursday – of deliberately destroying evidence, habitually leaking stories to the Sun newspaper, and trying to shift the blame on to her adviser Caroline Watt. The court heard that just days before the trial began, Vardy said she had belatedly realised after almost three years that she may have been “betrayed” by her agent, who was a close friend. Vardy told the court that it could have been Watt who was secretly leaking stories from Coleen Rooney’s private Instagram account to the Sun – all without Vardy’s knowledge or authorisation. Coleen Rooney’s lawyer, David Sherborne, said this was a desperate last-ditch move by Vardy to stitch up her friend: “It’s not her who betrayed you, it is you who has betrayed her by throwing her under a bus,” he said. Watt declined to give evidence at the trial, citing health reasons. But Sherborne said the real reason Watt would not enter the witness box was because it would expose the lies that had been told. In response, Vardy insisted that Watt was unable to attend the court because she had been “driven to suicidal thoughts by these proceedings” and the “antics” of Rooney. Vardy chose to bring the libel case in a bid to restore her reputation, complaining that Rooney had “weaponised her fanbase” when, in 2019, she made the original accusation that Vardy had leaked stories to the media. Rooney looked on impassively as the court heard comments Vardy made in a 2019 interview following the original accusation: “Arguing with Coleen is like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong but it’s still going to shit in your hair.” The court also heard of extensive issues with the retrieval of potential crucial evidence in the case – including data contained in a mobile phone dropped in the North Sea. Vardy said one back-up of her WhatsApp account was missing many key images and voice notes because “something odd happened as I was exporting the files” and they were lost. Sherborne alleged Vardy had purposefully chosen not to export potentially damaging evidence contained in the WhatsApp account, then disposed of the laptop used to make a back-up. He also claimed Vardy had manually deleted large numbers of messages to and from her agent. Asked what happened to nine months of missing WhatsApp chats between the two women, Vardy seemed unclear. She said she had “potentially switched phones” during the period and lost the WhatsApp messages in the process but “I can neither confirm or deny that”. Sherborne alleged in reality it was a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence: “You deleted all of the messages between you and Caroline Watt.” The lawyer also mocked the suggestion that Watt had accidentally dropped her phone in the North Sea shortly after a request was made to search it for WhatsApp messages. The court heard that Watt “was filming a coastline” while on a boat trip off Scotland when the boat hit a wave and she dropped the device into the water. Sherborne said he had wanted to search WhatsApp messages held on the phone but it was now “lying at the bottom of sea in Davy Jones’s locker”. Vardy asked the court: “Who is Davy Jones?” The judge intervened to explain the reference. Rooney’s legal team have admitted they do not have a smoking gun proving Vardy, the wife of Leicester City player Jamie Vardy, leaked stories about Rooney to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming: “If it looks like a leak, it sounds like a leak, and you even used the word ‘leak’, it is more likely than not to be a leak.” During one exchange, Vardy admitted knowing that her agent was discussing private information about Rooney with Sun journalist Andy Halls – but insisted it was material the newspaper already knew and therefore not a fresh leak. Sherborne asked Vardy: “You didn’t object at any stage to the fact that Ms Watt was plainly passing on information from Mrs Rooney’s private Instagram account to Andy Halls?” Vardy replied: “I didn’t think she was passing on any new information.” Sherborne pressed on: “Take the word ‘new’ out of it. Did you, or did you not, know that Ms Watt was passing on information from Mrs Rooney’s private account?” Vardy replied: “She was talking to Mr Halls about information that was already being discussed.” In one WhatsApp exchange read to the court, the agent said a reporter at the Sun wanted to know whether Rooney had definitely crashed her car, a detail that allegedly came from the private Instagram account. Vardy replied with the words: “Haha she deffo did.” Towards the end of Thursday’s hearing, Vardy – who launched the multimillion pound legal case against Rooney in a bid to clear her public reputation – slumped forward with her head in her hands while being cross-examined. The court took regular breaks as she became tearful. When Vardy began one answer by saying “if I’m honest”, the barrister snapped back: “I would hope you’re honest because you’re sitting in a witness box.” At one point Rooney’s barrister described a WhatsApp message in a conversation between Vardy and Watt which said “poor Coleen” followed by “laughing emojis”. Vardy told the court she disputed this characterisation: “I don’t know whether they’re laughing emojis.” The lawyer, in an apparent reference to the 😂 emoji, replied: “OK, crying with laughter.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’ trial: Rebekah Vardy accused of throwing friend ‘under bus’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/wagatha-christie-trial-rebekah-vardy-accused-of-throwing-friend-under-a-bus
5/13/2022,"American novelist, poet and essayist Patricia Lockwood has won the £20,000 Swansea University Dylan Thomas prize for her “searingly witty and innovative take on modern day internet culture”. The prize, awarded to Lockwood for her debut novel No One Is Talking About This, is awarded to an author aged 39 or under, and is one of the most prestigious awards for young writers. No One Is Talking About This focuses on an unnamed narrator as she deals with social media fame and a life lived on a Twitter-like platform called “the portal”. Chair of judges for the prize, writer and festival director Namita Gokhale, described Lockwood as an “astonishing and wholly original new voice”. She added: “A deeply timely winner, Patricia Lockwood is the voice of a generation of new writers who grew up under the constant pressures of real-time news and social media.” Gokhale, co-founder-director of Jaipur literature festival, said the book was “a searingly witty and innovative take on modern day internet culture, and the experience of family trauma in the modern world”. The novel is divided into two parts, and Gokhale called the book’s flow of consciousness “almost diary-like in quality”. This, she said, meant it was “remarkably deft at capturing the psychological impact which simultaneous alienation and ‘group think’ life online has on us as individuals”. Fellow judge Irenosen Okojie called No One Is Talking About This “a timely, absurdist wonder of a book” that was “sharp, intellectually dexterous and full of wisdom”. The other judges were author and former winner of the prize, Rachel Trezise, novelist Alan Bilton and poet Luke Kennard. Lockwood, who is a contributing editor for the London Review of Books, was the only debut novelist to make the 2021 Booker prize shortlist, and No One Is Talking About This was also shortlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction. She’s the author of two poetry collections, Balloon Pop Outlaw Black and Motherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals, and an acclaimed memoir Priestdaddy, about moving back in with her parents and reckoning with her religious upbringing. The other books shortlisted for the prize were A Passage North by Anuk Arudpragasam, Auguries of a Minor God by Nidhi Zak/Aria Eipe, The Sweetness of Water by Nathan Harris, Open Water by Caleb Azumah Nelson and Filthy Animals by Brandon Taylor.

5/13/2022,"BP’s best bet for avoiding a windfall tax might be to hide Bernard Looney on an offshore oil platform for a few months. Every time the chief executive ventures on to tax and investment territory, he inflames the politics around the windfall debate. Looney’s memorable remark last November – one he must regret – was the boast about BP being “a cash machine at these types of prices”. Oil prices at the time were $85 a barrel, so the extra profits at $105 were bound to invite scrutiny when they flow, in the most part, from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Then there was the admission a couple of weeks ago – repeated at Thursday’s shareholder meeting – that a windfall tax wouldn’t alter one jot BP’s plan to invest £18bn in the UK over the rest of the decade. That line invited outsiders to wonder whether BP could do more than £2bn-ish a year on average. The UK’s need to invest in energy security has become more urgent suddenly, so it’s fair to ask if BP has upped its ambition too. If any element of the £18bn represents a boost to previous plans, the company has not identified it. In that context, another of Looney’s comments on Thursday read almost as an invitation to the government to have an arm-wrestle. “By definition, windfall taxes are unpredictable and could challenge investment in homegrown energy,” he said. Does that mean BP could invest more, but won’t if the government takes the windfall route? If that’s the pitch, Rishi Sunak, a chancellor who says he is in “pragmatic” mode, is almost obliged to emerge with a victory of some description from this little confrontation. The weirdness in the whole debate, as pointed out here more than once, is that we’re not talking about huge sums. In BP’s case, an increase from 40% to 50% in the tax rate on North Sea profits this year would mean a payment of £250m on top of the predicted £1bn at the regular rate. For a group currently spending £1bn-plus a quarter on buying back shares, a quarter of a billion is not a gamechanger. Yes, one can call any one-off levy “unpredictable” but, come on, it’s not as if extra taxes in exceptionally favourable trading conditions are unheard of. Other European countries are already doing it. As long as they occur only once a decade, the UK’s recent average, the local fiscal regime will still look stable. Looney’s tune is not persuasive. Amid falling stock markets and untethered “stable” coins, BT offered a port in a storm on Thursday: the shares were up a bit on full-year numbers and the final dividend was restored at the level previously advertised. The group has even finally got shot of BT Sport, a venture that, depending on your point of view, was a vanity project on the part of its previous chief executive, Gavin Patterson, or a necessary Sky-jamming device to stem the loss of broadband customers in the mid-2010s. Or, rather, BT will be half-out of sport. The creation of a joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery will see BT receive only £93m upfront. The real money – up to £540m – will have to come via earn-out fees over four years if milestones are met. In a business heavily reliant on the renewal of sports rights, especially football rights, the structure was probably inevitable. As important, perhaps, was the signing of an extension to a reciprocal channel supply deal with Sky; it provides a little certainty. BT’s main game these days is fast fibre, where today’s boss, Philip Jansen, says Openreach is building “like fury”. In hard numbers, that means 7.2m premises have been passed, another 3m will follow this year, and then 4m annually thereafter. Goldman Sachs’ analysts calculate that the pace equates to three or four times that of peers, so the thesis that BT should eventually emerge from its £15bn spending programme with two-thirds of the fast-fibre market remains intact. One critical moving part in the mix is how many customers actually buy the souped-up broadband connections. The take-up rate is 25% currently, which BT reckons “compares well” with European rollouts at the current early stage. The ratio will be one to watch over coming quarters but, at the moment, BT seems on its way to becoming the telecoms equivalent of a slightly more exciting National Grid. There’s no disgrace in that: it’s roughly what BT should always have been. The footie was always a sideshow.",News/Business,Looney’s tune on windfall taxes is unpersuasive | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/12/looneys-tune-windfall-taxes-unpersuasive-bp-unpredictable
5/13/2022,"In 2019, Emmanuel Macron declared that Nato was becoming “braindead”. The French president’s warning was prompted by fears that the US, under Donald Trump, could no longer be relied upon to come to the defence of Nato allies. Mr Trump last month confirmed that he had threatened not to defend them against Russia. Fewer than three years on from Mr Macron’s warning, the alliance is reinvigorated. Members have increased defence spending significantly, though only eight out of 30 met the target of 2% of GDP last year. Finland and Sweden, long resistant to joining, are knocking on the door. Nothing has done more for Nato solidarity and expansion than Vladimir Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. As the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, observed: “There is a before and after 24 February.” Finland’s president and prime minister, Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin, declared on Thursday that their country must apply to join without delay. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats, long split over the issue, are now expected to opt for membership on Sunday. In Finland, support for Nato membership had never risen above 30% since the end of the cold war, and often fell below 20%. It currently stands at 76%. In Sweden, where non-alignment (preceded by neutrality) has been more ideological, rather than pragmatic, support has also surged: more than 57% of people now support membership. Both countries are receiving a warm welcome. Their membership would increase Nato’s ability to defend the Baltic. In reality, they are already close partners, taking part in exercises and sharing intelligence with the alliance. But entry would formally bind them to the common security guarantee set out in article 5 of the treaty, stating that an attack on any member is an attack on all, and committing members to defend each other. Nato expansion has doubtless contributed to Mr Putin’s paranoid mindset. He sees the organisation as little more than an expression of US power. But it is primarily Russian aggression that has driven expansion, not vice versa. The fear of provoking Moscow tied the hands of its neighbour Finland, and Sweden, for years. Now the all-out assault on Ukraine has led many to conclude that there is nothing to lose – while Russia’s failures there have suggested that it may be less fearsome than they thought. Sweden and Finland joining Nato would leave Kaliningrad, home of Moscow’s Baltic Sea fleet, encircled. Predictably, Russia has vowed retaliation for the Finnish announcement. It had already said it would deploy nuclear weapons in the Baltic, though the real threat is more likely to come in the form of disinformation, cyber-attacks, and other provocations. Yet Moscow should not be the alliance’s only concern. It must also look closer to home. In the US, 57 Republicans voted against the $40bn aid package for Ukraine in the House of Representatives and it faces Republican objections in the Senate. As the Democrats flounder, the spectre of Donald Trump – or someone like him – as the 47th president looms larger. And despite the defeat of Marine Le Pen in last month’s French presidential election, ambivalence or antagonism towards Nato has not vanished from Europe. In Italy, where a general election is due next year, most voters oppose the government’s decisions to increase defence spending and send arms to Ukraine. The alliance exists to counter the threat on its eastern borders. It can only do so by remaining vigilant to internal vulnerabilities.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on expanding Nato: Putin has only himself to blame | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-expanding-nato-putin-has-only-himself-to-blame
