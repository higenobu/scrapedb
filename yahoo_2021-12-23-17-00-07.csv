12/23/2021,"Researchers from a California aquarium were searching for deep sea jellies when they caught a glimpse of an “extremely rare” creature with glowing green eyes. Monterey Bay Aquarium senior aquarist Thomas Knowles spotted the fish in the Monterey Bay on Dec. 1 from a distance but knew exactly what it was. “As we slowly approached it, excitement grew in the control room as everyone began to realize what we had found,” Knowles said in a news release from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. “We all knew that this was likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.” The creature was a barreleye fish. With visible green bulb-like eyes inside its forehead, the bizarre fish can move them forward to see when its eating, according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Though the researchers knew what they were looking at, it was the first time theyhave seen the fish. Researchers have logged more than 5,600 remote dives with more than 27,600 hours of video and they’ve only witnessed the fish nine times. Though sightings of the strange fish are rare, Knowles said they did not capture the barreleye for their upcoming “Into the Deep” exhibit because they weren’t prepared to care for it at the aquarium. “Just observing this animal living in its natural habitat is an amazing opportunity for science,” he said in the release. The rare fish grows to a maximum size of about 6 inches and dwells in the midwater ocean — at depths between 2,000 to 2,600 feet. These fish are found in the Bering Sea to Japan and Baja California. “Most of the deep sea truly is unexplored territory, and it is still revealing it wonders to us,” Knowles said.

12/23/2021,"By Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) - Senior South Korean diplomats will hold talks with Chinese counterparts on Thursday following a diplomatic spat with Taiwan over its cancellation of the attendance by a senior Taipei official for a business forum in Seoul last week. Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun and aides are set to hold talks online later on Thursday with a team led by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng, the first such meeting since June 2017. Both sides are expected to explore ways to reopen stalled denuclearisation talks with North Korea and discuss other bilateral, regional and global issues, Seoul officials said. The meeting comes at a delicate time as Taiwan has lodged a protest over South Korea's revocation of its invitation sent in September for Digital Minister Audrey Tang to speak virtually at a conference last week in Seoul. Taipei's foreign ministry called the move ""rude,"" and summoned South Korea's acting de facto ambassador to express its displeasure. The ministry said South Korea cited ""various aspects of cross-strait issues"" for its decision, but when Taiwan's representative in Seoul separately sought an explanation, he did not receive any answers. South Korea's foreign ministry said the decision was made by the event's organisers based on ""comprehensive considerations of all circumstances"", without elaborating. An official at Seoul's presidential Blue House said on Wednesday that the organisers cancelled the invitation in line with ""our diplomatic principles, not because of China"". ""Our position remains unchanged that we will continue promoting unofficial economic and cultural relations, and practical exchanges through them,"" the official told reporters. Seoul faces an increasingly thorny balancing act as the United States, its top ally, focuses on marshalling allies and partners to counter what it calls a coercive and aggressive China, South Korea's largest economic partner. The vice ministers could also discuss the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing, just as Western countries join a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott. The Blue House has said it was not considering participating in the boycott but discussions have yet to be held with China on sending a delegation.
