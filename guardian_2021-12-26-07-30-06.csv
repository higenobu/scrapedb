12/26/2021,"Whatever happens when Chelsea visit Aston Villa on Sunday evening, Thomas Tuchel is bound to be in more of a festive mood than he was last year. “I’m very confident that I will survive Christmas with my job this year,” Tuchel said, thinking back to Paris Saint-Germain axing him on Christmas Eve 12 months ago. “We are in a fine place. We are not happy with the results we had in the home games: Burnley, Everton and Manchester United. But we are confident. We are competitive.” The German’s spirits were high after Chelsea set up a Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham by winning 2-0 at Brentford on Wednesday night. After a week of fretting over positive Covid tests, suddenly the air felt a little lighter. Tuchel had seen Chelsea knuckle down at the Brentford Community Stadium, even though the absence of nine senior players because of injuries and Covid led to three teenagers making their debuts. The question now is whether the European champions can put a difficult period behind them by reviving their faltering title challenge at Villa Park.  It will not be easy. Villa are improving under Steven Gerrard and won this fixture last season, although Gerrard will be absent on Sunday after testing positive for Covid. They are defensively sound and will back themselves to keep it tight against Chelsea, whose lack of ruthlessness has seen them fall six points behind Manchester City in the Premier League. The hope for Tuchel is that some players who have been out with Covid will be back. The change in the quarantine period from 10 days to seven is a boost. Tuchel reported that Romelu Lukaku and Callum Hudson-Odoi could both be in contention against Villa, although there was less clarity about the status of Kai Havertz, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Timo Werner. “We have negative tests for Romelu and Callum,” Tuchel said. “Then we need to see. The guys have been ill, they had symptoms. I know I need to check how they are.” These are still awkward times for Chelsea. They have seethed since the league rejected their request to postpone their game against Wolves last weekend. They had seven players in isolation – Jorginho was not risked after returning an inconclusive test, but he was cleared to return against Brentford – and only had four outfield players on the bench at Molineux. Tuchel was angry after a goalless draw left Chelsea further off the pace in the title race. He had taken a risk by starting N’Golo Kanté, who had not played since limping off against Juventus on 23 November, and was not in a good mood before facing Brentford. The question of player safety was still on Tuchel’s mind. He called himself irresponsible for playing Kanté against Wolves and insisted that the midfielder would not feature against Brentford. The Frenchman’s importance to Chelsea was too great; they could not afford to lose him to injury again. Yet Kanté did not want a rest and convinced Tuchel to put him on the bench. He changed the game when he came on with 14 minutes left, taking control of midfield and starting the move that led to Pontus Jansson inadvertently giving Chelsea the lead in the 80th minute. “It was nice to see that everyone was pushing to be involved,” Tuchel said. “N’Golo convinced me that he prefers to be on the bench. We agreed on that in discussions with the player. I’ve praised him so many times and of course he makes the difference because he is a very special player. I’ve said it 100 times and I will repeat it another 100 times, there are no more words: it’s outstanding quality that would help every team in the world.” It had turned into a productive evening. The young trio of Xavier Simons, Jude Soonsup-Bell and Harvey Vale all enjoyed their first taste of senior football and could be part of the squad against Villa. Trevoh Chalobah, another academy product, was excellent in defence. Mateo Kovacic, who had been out since October, got some valuable minutes. Even the much-maligned Saúl Ñíguez did well in central midfield. This was a reminder that Chelsea still have plenty of strength in depth. Tuchel was able to change the game by bringing on Reece James, Jorginho, Kanté, Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic in the second half. James fired in the cross that led to Jansson’s own goal and Pulisic won the penalty that allowed Jorginho to make it 2-0. Chelsea, who have won three of their last eight league games, need to build on that lively second half. They need to be more focused in defence and incisive in attack. They must adjust if Lukaku, Werner and Havertz are not ready to start against Villa. Pulisic, who was ineffective through the middle when Chelsea drew with Everton and Wolves, must step up if he is asked to lead the line again. “Is that his very best position where he feels most comfortable?” Tuchel asked. “Maybe not, but he’s very positive about it and he’s fighting for his confidence. And while he’s fighting we’re supporting him.” The messages were positive. Tuchel, who is unsure if Andreas Christensen and Hakim Ziyech will shake off their injuries, sees a group who are ready to fight through the uncertainty caused by Covid. “It’s the same situation for us as for everyone else and we have concerns,” he said. “We are not just football players and coaches, we are also fathers and family members. We have doubts and fears, which is not nice. “Still we are privileged to do what we love the most: to be involved in football. I’m very impressed how the team takes it. We will arrive at Aston Villa with full commitment to the competition.” Tuchel is ready. This is his first experience of football on Boxing Day and he cannot wait. “I am happy to be involved,” Tuchel said, but he still wants more. He knows that Chelsea cannot afford to slip up again. Nothing but victory will do if they want to win the league.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel feeling festive even as Chelsea look to weather harsh winter | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/25/thomas-tuchel-feeling-festive-even-as-chelsea-look-to-weather-harsh-winter
12/26/2021,"Scott Morrison has just joined TikTok - but the most popular Australian politician on the social media app isn’t the prime minister, nor the man vying to replace him. That honour goes to Julian Hill, a federal Labor MP from Victoria you may never have heard of if you’re not a user of the app famous for music videos and viral dances.  With 125,000 followers and 1.8m likes on his videos at the time of writing, Hill comfortably beats the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, an early adopter of the video sharing social media app with 103,000 followers, into second place. The format allows users to post and share videos of up to three minutes (they are often shorter), rewarding those who can make an impression quickly. Homemade music or dance videos, lip syncs, mimes and satire tend to rate best among non-political users, but Hill’s attacks on his opponents have sent his viewer count soaring. Hill’s most popular video to date, with 1.1m views, is a three-minute clip of him finding creative ways to describe Scott Morrison’s “loose relationship with the truth” in a speech to parliament’s second-string federation chamber.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Hill joined the app this year, thanks to the suggestion of Sam Richards, the son of family friends who completed his year 10 work experience in the MP’s office. “I was interested in [him joining] because he had a lot of social media platforms,” Richards tells Guardian Australia. “We started putting videos of his speeches and all that on there and it started to take off.” Richards says he and his friends are big TikTok users, and the platform appeals because the algorithm “tailors [videos] to what people want to see”. Hill says he published a “wide range of material” from parliamentary speeches, to pieces to camera, and while sometimes a video is a sure-fire hit, at other times “the algorithm can be mysterious”. “You’ve got to communicate with people where they are,” Hill says. “A growing number of people engage with social media through TikTok. You have to do them the courtesy of showing up and treating them as intelligent.” Hill says his golden rules are “be authentic, don’t dance, sing or do stunts”. Perhaps stunts are in the eye of the beholder – some might classify calling Indue to ask to be put on to the cashless debit card as a stunt. Hill has become something of an attack dog for Labor, from labelling Morrison a “bullshit artist” to joking about his plan to become a male model by 2050 to ridicule Coalition climate targets.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Hill insists that what he posts to TikTok is often no different to content distributed through other social media, which he uses to amplify what he believes, whether said in parliament or outside. Some colleagues wonder whether Hill’s tone – for all his online popularity – may detract from his ability to convey his policy nous, such as work in parliamentary committees covering everything from outsourcing and migration to funding of the auditor general. Hill insists he does tackle the big issues on TikTok, including robodebt, climate change and jobs, immigration and visa issues. He says there is “lots of silly stuff” on TikTok but “although politics is a serious business, it doesn’t always have to be boring and un-engaging”. “That’s the line to tread.” Hill says he gets “great feedback when I’ve taken the time to explain a policy topic or the politics, as I see it, of what’s going on”. His videos about parliament sitting for just 10 days in the first half of 2022, or the Coalition’s move to block an investigation into Christian Porter’s donation disclosure are both in that vein. Richards says many of his friends now follow Hill – but Hill insists it isn’t a medium just for young people. “I had a woman in her 70s who messaged me, delighted by the [electoral boundary] redistribution. She said, ‘I’m glad I’m in your electorate because I follow you on TikTok’. “I’ve had numerous emails from [parents] thanking me for getting their kids engaged in politics, current affairs and ideas. “I get stopped in the street, in restaurants and shops by people wanting to talk to me because of something that struck them from TikTok, because I’ve taken the time to explain something by meeting them where they are.” Hill’s success has caused other MPs to flock to the platform, including the shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek. Some of his colleagues are already stars of his channel. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has only recently joined TikTok, but rated highly on Hill’s account for calling Peter Dutton a boofhead in question time. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, also rated strongly for comments attacking the government over Covid-19 vaccinations and quarantine. Richards says a lot more MPs have joined TikTok since Hill, but “no one’s topped Julian yet”. “I hope he stays in that top position, I’d love to see it … Of course it’s still going really well with the numbers – it’s exciting to see. “It was a great experience – the experience of being part of something that’s done well, and helped Julian out was really exciting for me.”",News/Australia news,"‘Don’t dance, sing or do stunts’: how Julian Hill became the most popular Australian politician on TikTok",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/26/dont-dance-sing-or-do-stunts-how-julian-hill-became-the-most-popular-australian-politician-on-tiktok
12/26/2021,"The good news about the leech, says Dr Turner, “is it’s a sizeable specimen, so you won’t need more than the one.” Thank goodness. I thought he was about to put the whole jar of leeches – medical grade, collected from Barts that morning – on to poor Lucille’s bruised and swollen eye, and that the Call the Midwife Christmas special (BBC One) was about to take a horrifying turn. I can deal with a bit of blood – you have to with this show – but there’s a difference between birthing matters (“I have just lost the biggest mucus plug you’ve ever seen!” announces Mrs Howells, soon to be mother-of-five) and writhing blood-suckers, about to be attached within the vicinity of an eyeball. The black eye is a hen night injury – a dangerous combination of the Nonnatus House stairs and Sister Hilda’s rum punch. Sister Hilda is recovering with aspirin; for Lucille, it’s leeches, treatment “from the 3rd century BC!” says Sister Monica Joan, with glee. “I feel sick just looking at them,” says trainee Nancy, while Lucille quivers with horror. After barely an hour, the leech is stuffed; by this point on Christmas Day, we might all know how it feels.  Lucille is back to her beautiful self, and her Boxing Day wedding to Cyril is saved. But there is trouble gestating elsewhere, and I don’t just mean the split in Fred Buckle’s Santa trousers. The midwives of Nonnatus House are expecting an influx of women – an extra 20 patients assigned from St Cuthbert’s hospital. “What do you suppose was going on in March?” asks Nancy, with a smirk. There are not enough midwives, then and now. Worse, heroin has arrived in Poplar, and one of the pregnant women reluctantly attending the antenatal clinic is clearly an addict – she is, according to Sister Julienne, “underweight, and very pale”, TV shorthand for drug addiction. When Dr Turner is called to a gangland stabbing, the woman, Anita Page, is there. Anita shoots up in the laundry room, where her gangster husband – so undomesticated in 1966 he asks his mum how to make cheese on toast – will never find her. Call the Midwife is approaching its 10-year anniversary and only the most wilfully ignorant still don’t know that beyond its heartwarming Sunday-night-telly feel, it has radical politics, and deftly chronicles social change. Now drugs are involved, there is the spectre of babies born with addiction. “It is a new challenge in this country, and it will become a scourge,” says Mother Mildred (Miriam Margolyes) – for she is returned! – across a screaming newborn. “One constantly saw babies suffer like this in Hong Kong.” At the news that May, the adopted daughter of Nurse Shelagh and Dr Turner, “was one such child”, Shelagh is horrified – you can tell by the way her eyebrows mirror the shape of her glasses. They’re going to have to administer opiates to the newborn girl to ease her pain. “I know the dosage and I know the method,” says Mildred, earnestly. “No nurse who has done this work forgets, any more than she can forget that cry.” (A note on Margolyes: I revere her to the extreme, but I wonder if her newfound notoriety has ruined her for a role like this – every time she’s onscreen, especially when quietly contemplating prayer, I half-expect her to fart.) It’s Christmas Day, and the babies keep coming. Mrs Howells needs forceps; Mrs Karphopalas is bleeding. Meanwhile, out on homebirth duty, Sister Frances is dealing with her first breech birth. She looks terrified. “Are you afraid, Sister?” asks Mrs Chu, in labour on her best sheets (“They were a wedding present, I’ve been saving them for the big event”). Sister Frances shakes her head. Are nuns allowed to lie? One of my favourite things about Call the Midwife is that the religion is worn so lightly, and the nuns never let it overrule their humanity. The wellbeing of the mothers and babies comes first, as it does for the dedicated secular midwives. I’ll never tire of these wise, capable, kind women, nor this show, even if its emotional manipulation – along with its soundtrack – is fairly unrelenting. It doesn’t so much pull on the heartstrings as yank them vigorously, as if bellringing. By the time Lucille arrives at the church to discover she has bridesmaids and page boys after all – five children that she’d delivered when she first arrived in Poplar – I was undone.
