2/25/2022,"Joe Biden’s nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, has been a judge of the United States court of appeals for the DC circuit since June after the 51-year old Harvard graduate replaced attorney general Merrick Garland. The DC circuit has historically been seen as a stepping stone to the supreme court. As a district court judge, Jasckson has issued multiple high-profile rulings. In addition to being the judge who sentenced the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theorist to four years in prison, Jackson ruled against the Trump administration’s attempt to protect Don McGahn, a former White House counsel from testifying before Congress. She wrote: “Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded history is that presidents are not kings.” From 2010 to 2014 Jackson served as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, during which the commission significantly reduced sentences for numerous drug offenders. Born in Washington and raised in Miami, prior to the bench Jackson clerked for three federal jurists, including Justice Stephen Breyer himself. As a public defender, she was paid by the federal government to represent criminal defendants who were unable to afford their own lawyers. During her time as a public defender, Jackson worked on multiple Guantanamo-related cases. One of the clients she was assigned to represent was Khli Ali Gul, an Afghan detainee at the American naval base. From 2002 to 2004, Jackson worked for Kenneth Feinberg, the attorney who was known for his role as the special master of the US government’s 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. In 2016, Barack Obama interviewed Jackson as a potential nominee following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2020, Jackson praised Breyer during a virtual conference, saying that he “opened doors of opportunities” by hiring law clerks from diverse backgrounds. “As a descendant of slaves, let me just say that, Justice [Breyer], your thoughtfulness in that regard has made a world of difference.” Jackson has received praise from across the political aisle, including from former House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan, whose brother-in-law is her husband’s twin brother. At Jackson’s 2013 Senate confirmation hearing, Ryan said, “Now our politics may differ … but my praise for Ketanji’s intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.” During her 2020 confirmation to the DC circuit court of appeals, several Republican senators – South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, joined Democrats in confirming her seat.",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson: who is Biden’s supreme court choice?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/ketanji-brown-jackson-joe-biden-supreme-court-choice
2/25/2022,"The Scottish government and NHS Scotland have been rebuked for breaching data privacy laws on a Covid vaccine status app downloaded by millions of people. The Information Commissioner’s Office, which polices the UK’s privacy laws, said it had warned the Scottish government and NHS last year that there were serious privacy problems with the app, but not all those problems were fixed before it was launched. In an unusually critical ruling issued on Friday, Steve Wood, the ICO’s deputy commissioner, said: “When governments brought in Covid status schemes across the UK last year, it was vital that they were upfront with people about how their information was being used. “The Scottish government and NHS National Services Scotland have failed to do this with the NHS Scotland Covid status app. We require both bodies to act now to give people clear information about what is happening with their data. If they don’t, we will consider further regulatory action.” The app was needed to get access to nightclubs, sports arenas and some other venues such as university buildings, and for travel overseas, after it became mandatory for people to provide proof of their vaccine status; paper printouts or screenshots of vaccine status were also permitted. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, announced on Tuesday that the vaccine passport scheme would be dropped on 28 February. Her update came three days before the ICO issued its findings; all other Covid regulations in Scotland will remain in force until 21 March. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats said ministers had “arrogantly” put privacy at risk by ignoring warnings from the ICO and opposition parties last year. Murdo Fraser, for the Scottish Tories, asked whether Sturgeon knew the ICO rebuke was imminent when she made her announcement on Tuesday. Wood said the ICO had warned the Scottish government last year it would be unlawful for the app’s developers to use people’s portraits to improve facial recognition technology. That plan was dropped, as were plans to share personal data with the company. Even so, the app still failed to warn users properly about how their data was used when it went live. There had also been “an ongoing failure to provide concise privacy information so that the average person can realistically understand how the NHS Scotland Covid status app is using their information”, the ICO said. The Scottish government admitted the app should have been far clearer about how private data was processed. “Together with NHS National Services Scotland, we will continue to work with the ICO to implement the improvements they have asked for, and ensure that lessons are learned for future work,” a spokesperson said.",News/UK news,NHS Scotland Covid app rebuked for breaching data privacy laws,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/25/nhs-scotland-covid-app-rebuked-for-breaching-data-privacy-laws
2/25/2022,"The EU will seek to freeze the foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, under a new sanctions package due to be finalised on Friday, foreign ministers have said. The move is largely symbolic, as the Russian president is unlikely to have identifiable personal assets abroad, but it will be part of an attempt to highlight the EU’s resolve. “I think we agree that Putin and Lavrov, as far as the freezing of assets is concerned, that we will find a consensus here,” said Luxembourg’s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn. Putin and Lavrov, who has been foreign minister since 2004, would not face travel bans as the EU wishes to maintain a diplomatic way through the crisis, ministers said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier on Friday, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion. With Russian forces encircling Kyiv, Zelenskiy said the EU had the capacity to deter Russia from further aggression but that not enough was being done by the bloc and other western allies. EU leaders had agreed in the early hours of Friday to impose a second tranche of measures designed to cripple the Russian economy. Foreign ministers were due to sign off on the new sanctions on Friday afternoon, with more banks, state-owned companies and individuals to be targeted, along with key sectors of the Russian economy. But the EU is holding back from blocking Russia from an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency or from personally targeting Putin with sanctions. “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” Zelenskiy said. “You still can stop this aggression. You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.” The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions to send secure payment orders and is key to the movement of funds to Russia’s oil and gas sector. But Germany, France, Italy and Cyprus have persuaded EU allies not to make the move. A government spokesperson in Berlin said on Friday the consequences of blocking Russia from Swift would be huge on the country’s economy and preparations would need to be made. When asked why Swift had not been included in the punitive measures, Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minster, said it had been “because we had to move quickly”. The minister added: “There will be other penalties.” On Friday afternoon, Charles Michel, the European Council president, spoke to Zelenskiy to reassure him that a third package of sanctions was being drawn up. Boris Johnson supports cutting Russia from Swift and Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said his government was also in favour although the package as it stood was strong. Martin said: “People have different perspectives on the efficacy or value of Swift in itself, so I don’t think we should singularly focus on Swift because the sanctions will hit hard at the industrial base, in terms of areas that will hurt the Russian economy. Over time these sanctions will have an impact. It won’t halt what is happening.” He added: “Our priority as an Irish government was to have unity around the table. That was very, very important. Having said that, we pushed and will continue to push for the broadest possible sanctions. So, yes, the Irish government has no difficulty whatsoever with the Swift system being sanctioned, and that’s something that we would support.” According to a leaked draft of the new sanctions agreed by EU leaders, all members of the Duma, the Russian security council and any Belarusian officials in the military and ministry of defence who “facilitated” the invasion of Ukraine will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. There is also a proposal to enlarge the listing criteria for imposing sanctions on individuals as well to “better capture other forms of support to the regime, including oligarchs”. Two additional banks will be subject to sanctions, Alfa bank and Otkritie, and there will be a prohibition on EU financial service providers lending to eight state-owned companies, ranging from the owners of seaports to automobile manufacturers. There is also a proposal to prohibit new deposits of more than €100,000 in EU banks by Russian nationals, according to the draft. Foreign ministers will meet later this afternoon to approve the text. There will be a ban on the sale of all aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines and the EU will limit Russia’s access to crucial technology such as semiconductors. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on possible punitive measures against Putin but he said Russia had deliberately reduced its dependence on foreign imports to protect itself against sanctions. He said: “The main goal … was to ensure complete self-sufficiency and complete import substitution if necessary. To a large extent this goal has been achieved. Undoubtedly there will be problems, but they will not be insurmountable.”",News/World news,EU to announce sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin and Sergei Lavrov,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/eu-to-announce-sanctions-targeting-vladimir-putin-and-sergei-lavrov
2/25/2022,"“Many people said they couldn’t sleep,” says Annie Gibbs. “I couldn’t sleep. I was constantly worried about this person out there. And just thinking about what the family must be going through. It was horrible.” The memory of the dark days after the body of Sabina Nessa was found in Cator Park, Greenwich, on 18 September last year still casts a deep shadow over the tight-knit community of Kidbrooke and the wider south-east London borough. Sabina, 28, was a much-loved primary school teacher at Rushey Green primary school in Catford, Lewisham; she was a valued member of her mosque; and she was loved by a close family. The people that loved her spoke of a happy young woman – kind, dedicated. She was the best of their community, a young woman who had taken a five-minute walk from her house at 8.30pm on 17 September 2021 to meet a friend, and never returned. “She was a really dedicated teacher, a really happy positive person whose life sadly was just stolen from her,” says Lisa Williams, the headteacher of the school where Nessa worked. “We were all in complete shock. This was somebody that we knew and cared about so much, whose life had just been taken in this tragic and just devastating way.” But from the ashes of those early grief-stricken days, a deep solidarity has arisen in Kidbrooke and the surrounding area where Nessa lived and worked, according to people who live there. As the man who killed her pleaded guilty to her murder on Friday, there was a determination that the woman they loved should not simply be remembered as a victim of male violence, but for who she was, says Gibbs, the vice-chair of the Kidbrooke forum community group which helped organise a candlelit vigil for Nessa a week after her death. “Everyone who knew her said she was so kind, so loving and caring, and you know, she just gave everybody so much love. We want her to be remembered as a bright light, for the sunshine that she brought to so many people’s lives, especially the children and her family.” In the days that followed her disappearance there was a sense of crippling shock in the community she was such an integral part of, adds Gibbs, the founder of the community interest company Amour Destiné, which supports black women and girls. “There was devastation, but also fear,” she says. “I think the coming together as a community helped with that. We didn’t feel alone. The fact that we had each other really, really helped.” At Rushey Green primary school, teachers, parents and children came together in grief – and fortitude, says Williams. “We speak a lot about loss in our school, because we’ve had so much of it,” she says. “We’ve tried to give our children a kind of literacy, to talk about emotions or feelings.” She pauses before adding: “But children shouldn’t have to understand that there is death and there is murder, and they are not the same thing. That’s definitely not something that you ever think that you’re ever going to have to teach your children about in a whole-school assembly.” At Rushey Green, they have made art exhibitions for the teacher they loved, and as the dark days of winter come to an end, the first shoots are arriving in a more permanent memorial. The school is fundraising to build a memorial garden in the school grounds, and already has a team of volunteers tending the start of an edible garden. “I hope it will give children a really happy, safe space to play, to learn, and that Sabina is remembered for her contributions to our school in a positive way. She had a huge impact on our children here,” says Williams. Nessa’s death has also galvanised many in the area to join a movement to tackle male violence against women. Stacy Smith, director of the Her Centre, a women’s service and charity in Greenwich, says that ​​there is a greater focus on the problem. “I think the community wants to see change,” she says. “And the council has been more willing to work with us on how we can both be more proactive in raising awareness and looking at what’s really going to make women safe.” The charity, as well as Neighbourhood Watch, is running active bystander training to help give men the tools to intervene if they see women being harassed in the streets as well as talking in schools about the impact of domestic violence. The University of Greenwich has launched the Sabina Project, with young women coming together to “use the law to end male violence”, while Nessa’s family have launched a “Sadaqah Jariyah” – a continuous charitable fundraiser – in her name. The Little Fish theatre in Greenwich has produced a play called To Be Continued, looking at issues of sexism, misogyny and toxic masculinity, which will be performed and workshopped in schools across the borough – with the help of council funding – and London. “It was absolutely a response to the death of Sabina Nessa and Sarah Everard, but also to what the teachers we work with were telling us they needed,” says Suha Al-Khayyat, the theatre’s artistic co-director. “These are difficult things to talk about, but by using the theatre and arts we can really engage hard-to-reach groups.” Denise Scott-McDonald, the deputy leader of Greenwich council, said: “What happened to Sabina is a tragic reminder that tackling violence against all women needs to be at the top of everyone’s agenda. “Gender-based violence will only end if we confront those perpetrating that violence. This means challenging the social norms that facilitate abuse like someone’s harmful behaviour or language, intervening with those on the cusp of offending and facing down those already causing serious harm. “We have recognised that we need to do more to tackle violence against women, not just as a council, but as a society in general. We are working closely with and investing in local charities and community groups which focus of supporting women, including the Her Centre. “Our enforcement teams are working closely with partners including the new dedicated police team for Woolwich town centre. We are running a behaviour-change programme with the perpetrators of domestic abuse, while continuing to invest in support for victims. We have invested £3.7m in digital CCTV cameras. “Perhaps most importantly, we are also tackling the cultural and societal changes needed to address the root causes of gender-based violence, through specialised education programmes aimed at men and boys in schools and the workplace.” For Gibbs and the community that pulled together after the death of the young teacher, Sabina’s light will continue to shine in the work, people and places she inspired. “We understand change takes time, but the need is urgent and it has to happen,” says Gibbs. “We don’t want her life to be forgotten. She wasn’t just someone whose life was taken by an evil person, we should remember the impact her life had, and make sure her legacy lives on. We want Sabina to be a bright light.”",News/Society,‘She was so kind’: how Sabina Nessa’s murder spurred move to tackle misogyny,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/25/she-was-so-kind-how-sabina-nessa-spurred-move-to-tackle-misogyny
2/25/2022,"Joe Biden on Friday nominated judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the supreme court, elevating a Black woman to the nation’s highest court for the first time in its 232-year history, according to multiple US media reports. Jackson was nominated to succeed justice Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior jurist in the court’s three-member liberal wing, who will retire at the end of the court’s current session this summer. The nomination will not affect the ideological composition of the court, controlled by a conservative super-majority of six justices, including three appointed by Donald Trump, but it does secure a liberal seat on the bench for at least a generation. The nomination represents a welcome bright spot for Biden, whose approval ratings have fallen to record lows as he confronts myriad crises at home and abroad. It is also his most significant opportunity yet to shape the federal judiciary, which remains overwhelmingly white and male. In his first year, Biden nominated a record number of district and appeals court judges from a range of racial, ethnic, geographical and legal backgrounds. Jackson’s nomination fulfills a campaign promise Biden made to supporters when his prospects of winning the Democratic presidential nomination appeared dim. Urged by congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina ahead of his state’s primary, Biden made the pledge during a debate. Days later, with Clyburn’s endorsement, Black voters lifted Biden to a resounding victory in the South Carolina primary that set in motion a string of successes that ultimately earned him the nomination and later the White House. When Breyer announced his retirement in January, Biden vowed to nominate a jurist with “extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity”. And, he added, “that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States supreme court.” The pledge divided Republican senators, some of whom argued that race or gender shouldn’t play a role in the selection process, despite similar commitments from Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and Trump. Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have said they intend to move forward quickly with the confirmation process. It will be the first Supreme Court confirmation hearing for a Democratic president since Elana Kagan was nominated by Barack Obama twelve years ago. Republicans refused to hold a hearing for Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, which further poisoned what has become scorched-earth affairs. But there are already early signs that this confirmation may be different, as Republicans weigh how aggressively to confront Biden’s nominee, particularly when it will not affect the balance of the court. With their agenda stalled and the president unpopular, Democrats are hopeful the nomination will energize their base as they brace for a political backlash in this year’s midterm elections.",News/US news,Biden nominates Ketanji Brown Jackson to become first Black woman on supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-nomination-biden-pick
2/25/2022,"In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they’ve been reading recently. This month, recommendations include the audiobook version of a Victorian novel, nonfiction books about hoarding and funny fiction. Tell us what you’ve been reading in the comments. I’m reading many books at the moment, as I’m judging the Christopher Bland prize which is a Royal Society of Literature award for the best debut by a writer over 50. I assume I can’t tell you yet which ones of those I liked best yet but turns out old people – I can say that as I’m one of them – have all sorts of creative juices left in them. I’m also listening to North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell. Not to go on about age, but my failing eyesight means that I’m turning more and more to audiobooks, and big Victorian ones really appeal, particularly when they’re read, as this one is, by Juliet Stevenson. So far I’m liking Gaskell’s “Industrial Revolution Pride and Prejudice” but I’ve come to it really because of Stevenson, whose audiobook readings I’ve been a superfan of ever since listening to her rendition of Middlemarch, which is I think the best solo acting performance I’ve ever heard. Jews Don’t Count by David Baddiel is now out in paperback (HarperCollins £7.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. During February I have read several books. Two that I would recommend are The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett and The House in Paris by Elizabeth Bowen. Although published about 80 years apart they are both sensitively written. The characters come from very different backgrounds of class, race and time, but the books help you to get under the skin of their protagonists. I enjoyed Things I Didn’t Throw Out, a slim but charming memoir in which Polish author Marcin Wicha retraces the life and times of his late mother, Joanna, via the vast haul of books she left behind when she died. They include cookbooks dating back to the Stalin era, faded midcentury hardbacks, an English language primer from the 1980s and numerous volumes on psychiatry and self-help pertaining to her work as a counsellor in Warsaw. Ably translated by Marta Dziurosz, this tender homage to one woman’s bibliomania doubles as a brisk overview of Poland’s postwar history. On a related note, I’m currently reading Rebecca R Falkoff’s Possessed: A Cultural History of Hoarding, which blends psychiatry, psychology and literary criticism – an erudite exploration of a fascinating phenomenon. On the fiction front I’ve just finished Pankaj Mishra’s Run and Hide, a novel about three Indian friends who transcend their humble provincial origins to join a rarefied milieu of cosmopolitan movers and shakers. It’s an emotionally astute if occasionally overwrought portrait of the social climber’s fraught psyche: the narrator contends with impostor syndrome, a gnawing homesickness and a constant sense of precariousness, suggesting that the price of upward mobility is profound existential loneliness. Dance Move, a very fine new collection of funny and poignant short stories by the Northern Irish writer Wendy Erskine, was more satisfying at the prose level for its understated simplicity. Erskine’s stories are set in school discos, tanning salons and shabby hotels; she’s great at conjuring a sense of place without breaking sweat – her touch is as sure as it is light. The best book I’ve read in recent weeks – indeed, one of the best I’ve read in a long time – is Percival Everett’s taut and wickedly funny novel, Erasure, which tells the story of an African American writer who struggles to achieve mainstream recognition because his work is considered “not black enough”. First published in 2001, this perfectly pitched satire is still every bit as relevant today. Everett’s latest novel, The Trees, will be published in the UK by Influx Press next month, and I’m eagerly looking forward to reading it. I have recently read Circe by Madeline Miller, having read The Song of Achilles previously. I like her relatable style of writing that makes the characters feel more human than godlike. We sympathise and care for them as they have faults, secrets and worries, as we do. Also, being only vaguely familiar with the myths, I have learned more about some of the characters from Greek mythology. I have also recently read Any Human Heart by William Boyd. I had already read Trio, but I much prefer Any Human Heart. The story takes us through most of the 21st century, following the life of Logan Mountstuart. Like Circe, this book resonated with me by showing human nature at its worst and best.",Arts/Books,What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they’ve enjoyed in February,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/25/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-theyve-enjoyed-in-february

2/25/2022,"Russian forces have entered Kyiv and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city. The defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west after a day of fighting, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolon suburb about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. Gunfire could be also heard close to St Sophia Cathedral, reporters said, creating an increasingly tense atmosphere in the capital, which many expected would have been better defended given its obvious strategic significance. Konrad Muzyka, the president of Rochan Consulting, said the “situation does look dire at the moment” particularly regarding Kyiv. “It appears that the main goal is to take Kyiv, break the C2 [command and control], and ‘decapitate’ the political leadership.” Earlier on Friday, Ukraine had said it had retaken the Hostomel airbase north-west of the city, which was the target of a dramatic helicopter assault by the Russian 31st guards air assault brigade on Thursday afternoon. But it was far from clear that was definitive, and uncertainty grew as Ukraine’s defence ministry warned earlier on Friday morning there were Russian forces in north-western Kyiv suburbs to the south of the base preparing to attack the city. One of the areas through which Russian forces have been trying to advance in their assault on Kyiv has been through the north-western suburbs around Vorzel, Buch and Irpen. In the early afternoon, Russia claimed it had control of the capital from the west. During the fighting on Friday, Ukrainian officials claimed that a kindergarten in Vorzel where 50 children were sheltering was hit by Russian fire, although without inflicting any casualties. Nevertheless, Ukraine’s military said on Friday morning that the damage sustained by the strategic airfield because of the fighting meant that Russian paratroopers had to land at Gomel, in Belarus, suggesting Moscow’s efforts had been partly repulsed. Kyiv authorities warned locals in the Obolon district to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching – suggesting there could be an impending counterattack. Earlier in the morning, Ukraine’s armed forces urged residents of the district not to leave their homes, and to “make Molotov cocktails” or petrol bombs, while the defence ministry said it had distributed 18,000 assault rifles in the capital. Ukraine’s military also warned that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district of Kyiv about 3 miles (5km) north of the city centre. Video posted online by an interior ministry adviser apparently showed dead Russian saboteurs who had captured Ukrainian military vehicles and switched uniforms. Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv’s main airport, where a 2-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A policeman said people were injured there but not killed. Pressure was also intensifying around Chernihiv, about 90 miles north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s military said, with Russian forces trying to bypass the city and head to the capital down the E95 road to Kozelec and ultimately Kyiv’s eastern suburbs. Further east, about 125 miles from the capital, Ukraine’s military admitted on Friday morning that the city of Konotop had been lost to Russian forces. Boryspil, the capital’s main civilian airport, lies to the east of the capital. The speed of the Russian advance, despite the best efforts of Ukraine’s military, caught many by surprise as Russian military forces converged on Kyiv from the north, east and west. Early on Friday morning, one resident who had evacuated from Kyiv’s city centre described hearing fighting close to the main road connecting Zhytomyr in the west to the capital and reports that Russian forces were trying to infiltrate from that direction. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that 137 people including 10 military officers, had been killed. An adviser said about 400 Russian forces had died, while the British said the figure was 450. Moscow has given no casualty count. The death toll could not be independently verified. Ukraine’s forces were believed to be holding firm in the in eastern Donbas region, according to Rochan Consulting, while the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million, was gradually being surrounded. In the south, fighting was reported to be continuing around Kherson on the Dnieper River and in Melitopol. Video circulated showing large numbers of what appeared to be Russian Spetsnaz special forces massing outside a Ukrainian SBU intelligence building in Melitopol. Fighting was also taking place around Mariupol, further east, and close to the line of control with the pro-Russian separatist statelets, its mayor said at lunchtime, as Moscow’s forces attempted to create a land corridor to occupied Crimea. The situation in the rest of the country remained more fluid. A resident in the southern Black Sea port of Odesa said that while there had been Russian strikes in the south of the city the north remained calm. Maryna who lives in Odesa, described the situation in the Black Sea port city. “I live in Odesa in Kotovsky settlement on the northern edge of the city. There are not many explosions where I am. It’s a narrow, long town along the coast and I’m in the north whereas most of the military units are in the south. “The only thing near me is a training area which I can usually hear and it is quiet. One of the strikes yesterday hit a residential area called 411 Battery. It’s a historic area named after the gun battery that defended Odesa in world war two but now it is residential. “People in Odesa are mainly staying indoors. The shops are open but people are too scared to go out and yesterday people bought all the bread because they were worried it would run out.” In Sumy, the main city in the Sumy region, and 125 miles from the Russian border, Russian forces were in control of the city, with residents saying that armour was visible patrolling in the streets. Sasha, 33, a vet who lives in Sumy, the main city in the Sumy region, said: “I live not far from the artillery training school which is where there was fighting yesterday when the Russians came. “I have elderly parents and a small child, so we think it’s best to stay. “All the traffic in the city has stopped and there is Russian armour in the streets. If the citizens don’t shoot at the Russians, they don’t shoot back. They arrived before lunchtime yesterday which is when we heard the shooting. It’s quiet now. So far it is only Russian soldiers and they are not making any proclamations.” “We’ve also heard that the Russians have taken Okhtyrka which is 70km from here and further west. They have put up the Russian flag.",News/World news,The fight for Kyiv: Russian forces enter Ukrainian capital,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/fight-for-kyiv-russian-forces-ukraine-capital-war
2/25/2022,"In Brazil, Gustavo Gava’s mother was an interior and shop window designer and he fondly recalls how fascinated he used to be by all the shapes and colours in her work. Many moons later it was the time to decide between studying advertising, architecture or design and Gus decided to pursue a Product Design degree at the UFPR (Universidade Federal do Paraná). After some years working in local design studios he came to London where he started his first job in the digital space. What made you decide to move to the UK? When I was at school I was fascinated by the UK. It was the time of ‘Cool Britannia’ and I was obsessed with the plethora of culture, it was the time of Blur, Radiohead, Alexander McQueen and all that. At Uni, the ties got stronger when I realised how significant British product and graphic design influences were in the world. One of my teachers, who was a real inspiration to me, had also done her masters in the UK and established herself as one of the most influential designers of her generation, with award winning works including the Tate visual identity. So, I was really sold on this dream of London as the place to be, as a multi diverse, cultural power house and I wanted to be part of it. It was the place where you got to set the design trends of the world instead of just following them. It was a shock when I first arrived as I couldn’t barely understand the many accents I could hear. But it was also the most fun I’ve ever had in my life. I started by working in a bar in Shoreditch where I met people from different parts of the UK which actually really helped me get to grips with the language. Once I was settled, I was confident enough to start looking for a job in my field and years later I too completed my MSC in Interactive Design and Games Technologies. In fact, I got a distinction. How did you start your journey to UX? I kicked things off working for a small studio as a digital designer and doing all sorts of websites and even working on social media 1.0 projects (remember Flash and MySpace?), before moving on to Sky where I worked for seven years as a UI Designer, with a little bit of UX. After a while I started to feel somewhat detached from the decision making process. I felt like I was designing blindly for other people and only seeing the product pop up months later. Over the years, I got back to falling in love with creative ways to solve a challenge, which brought me back to my product design roots. Being a UXer allowed me to think more critically about the ‘why’ and ‘how’. As in the customer’s expectations and needs from a product or experience, how can we deliver a viable, wholesome and fulfilling experience that is aligned with our business goals. To me, that meant thinking and researching a lot harder about the design instead of just considering client satisfaction and what would look good on a page. After Sky, I thought that a move back to a smaller organisation might be just the thing so I ended up at Hive Learning where I worked on designing a learning and collaboration app for teams. I also made the shift from UI to a more all rounded product role, including UX, strategy and visual design. Where can I find open positions? Apply for one of our open positions here. What can I expect from the interview process? We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process. Similar to other organisations, there is a CV screening, phone interview, coding exercise and a face to face interview. Read more about what to expect and apply now here. - What made you decide to finally join the Guardian? I’d been at Hive Learning for over two years when I had another soul-searching moment after successfully launching the app. I looked back at my career and saw that I was happiest when working closer to editorial teams. Designing an app was a rewarding experience, but I thought it was the right time to look for a job that combined my skill set, editorial design with an organisation doing something positive in the world. The Guardian was the natural choice as it was the newspaper close to my heart and aligned with my values. So consequently, one night, after a few exhausting hours of application submissions and a glass of wine, I noticed an advert in one of the LinkedIn newsletters. Two weeks later, I got an email, then a phone call and finally an interview. Suddenly I found myself starting my journey at the Guardian as a senior UX designer. What does a typical day look like? I wake up quite early, and one of the first things I like to do is check our chat channels to see if I missed anything from the day before or overnight. Then I have a look at my calendar to double-check if there is any change in my schedule for the day. Most days, I officially start with a standup, but on Tuesday, we have a design heartbeat meeting where we update each other on where we are in design work across teams and talk about case studies and new ideas. Throughout my time at the Product and Engineering team, I worked in different hurdles, such as Editorial Tools and Journalism. Still, I stayed over three years in the Supporter Revenue team to create the best experience for our readers and encourage them to become supporters. So, the rest of my day is either individual work or many one-to-one and cross-functional meetings. They’re one of my favourite types of discussions because it involves team members from different areas of the department like product and engineering, and members from outside the department like marketing, brand and commercial. All of us are on board the same product discovery journey, working together towards the same goals. What do you enjoy the most about working here? The Guardian is the first workplace where I feel totally myself, especially as a professional who is part of the LGBTQI community. I find my day-to-day work more meaningful, our efforts are for the right reasons, and I feel at home as my colleagues are progressive like-minded individuals. Also, I really love the morning conference which is our daily news meeting led by our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. It’s open to anyone in the organisation and it is an opportunity to hear what our editorial teams are planning to publish that day. I think it’s one of the best perks of working here because you feel like you’re at the very beating heart of the news. Knowing that part of my work involves making sure all our wonderful journalists are able to do their jobs is very rewarding for me; holistically as well as practically for I was previously on the team working on editorial tools. The UX experience for me isn’t just about the external reader but also about the internal user and those people are some of the more amazing, principled and hardworking individuals I have had the pleasure of working with. Development of digital products is central to the Guardian. You could be building the products that showcase our progressive and independent journalism, crafting the tools that journalists use to write their stories, developing the services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe, or safeguarding our financial future.

2/25/2022,"The funding standoff between Transport for London and central government has inched closer to a long-term settlement, with £200m agreed to keep TfL services running for the next four months. Fares across TfL will rise next week as part of the ongoing talks, even as London Underground workers are due to strike because of the threat to jobs from budget cuts. The government said the latest settlement, the fourth such deal, would take its emergency Covid aid to TfL up to nearly £5bn, and included “the potential for a longer-term capital investment settlement”. However, it insisted that London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, make more cost savings and consult on more revenue-raising to deal with the shortfall from the pandemic. The new settlement, which will run until 24 June, could be increased if a new variant hits, or reduced if revenues from transport return more quickly than anticipated. The government said it had made an additional pledge to provide more than £1bn every year for capital investment in October’s spending review. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the government had “repeatedly shown its commitment to London and the transport network it depends upon”. He added: “These support packages must be fair to all taxpayers and the settlement agreed today provides enough to cover lost revenue from the pandemic while the mayor follows through on his promises to keep TfL on the path to financial sustainability by 2023.” Khan will consult on options to raise more revenues, with road charges in some form likely to be extended throughout London. He will also have to find cost savings of up to £400m in the next year and address TfL’s pension fund. Khan said he was “relieved” to have the funding, but reiterated that the pandemic was the only reason TfL was facing a financial crisis. He added: “Once again the government has just provided a short-term funding deal that will only enable TfL to continue running transport services for a few more months. “This agreement makes reference to future capital investment for TfL, but it’s essential that this quickly turns into a concrete commitment from the government. The only way we will be able to avoid significant and damaging cuts to tube and bus services is if the government steps up and provides the longer-term capital funding TfL urgently needs.” Andy Byford, London’s transport commissioner, said: “Working together, we must achieve this longer-term funding settlement. Only that would ensure London’s transport network can remain safe, efficient and reliable, can continue to support the jobs and new homes that rely upon it and can support the economic recovery of the capital and the country as a whole.” Tube and bus fares will rise in London from next Tuesday by an average of 4.8%, an additional 1% above the RPI inflation rate rise due for rail fares around the country. The tube network will also be brought to a halt on Tuesday for the first of two strikes next week, brought by the RMT union. Services are not expected to run on Thursday, the second strike day, and to be severely disrupted on Wednesday and Friday morning. Talks between TfL and the RMT ended on Thursday without agreement. The union argues the funding agreements between the DfT and TfL would hurt staff. General secretary Mick Lynch said the strike was “because a financial crisis has been deliberately engineered by the government to drive a cuts agenda which would savage jobs, services, safety and threaten working conditions and‎ pensions”.

2/25/2022,"An outside observer watching France’s presidential election campaign would be forgiven for thinking that immigration, crime and secularism are all that the French public care about. In fact, according to a recent study by Ipsos, a staggering 52% of registered voters said their top concern ahead of April’s first-round vote was the cost of living, followed by healthcare and the environment. That’s not what the leading candidates are talking about. Instead, the campaign has been dominated by familiar national obsessions such as immigration and crime, but also increasingly inflammatory culture wars over national identity, the place of Islam and laïcité – France’s muscular variant of secularism. These are debates that almost always take place on the right’s terms. The president, Emmanuel Macron, has not yet officially declared his bid for reelection, hoping to stay above the melee for as long as possible. In the meantime, his top three competitors – all of them on the right – are aiming to outflank each other on these issues, running neck and neck for a spot in the runoff round and a likely match-up against the incumbent. Every week of their sparring seems to bring new horrors. Earlier this month, Valérie Pécresse, the right’s mainstream candidate, decided her first major campaign event was just the right moment to nod to a white nationalist conspiracy theory. At a highly anticipated speech in Paris, she declared there was “no inevitability” to the “great replacement” – a term that refers to the supposed cultural and demographic transformation of white Europe. (Pécresse later insisted she didn’t mean to actually endorse the idea, which was coined by the French writer Renaud Camus, and has been described as a “master narrative” for far-right terrorist attacks.) To be sure, there is demand for this brand of politics. They may not be a majority, but France has a solid bloc of hard-right voters. In 2017, around 7.7 million people propelled the National Front’s Marine Le Pen into the second round, where she went on to win a third of the vote against Macron – the best ever result for her party, since renamed the National Rally. Still, the fixations of voters like these are being blown out of proportion – amplified by short-term political interests and a media landscape that rewards rightwing provocation. Some of the responsibility lies with Pécresse, who desperately wants to distinguish herself from the sitting president. On economic policy, there’s not much she would do differently, as Macron’s record already reads like a conservative wish list: tax cuts for the super-rich; pro-employer labour law reforms; beefing up oversight of welfare recipients. If it hadn’t been put on hold due to Covid, Macron’s plans to restructure the pension system would have sailed through parliament – an achievement that the right has dreamed of for decades. With little else to campaign on, Pécresse and her party have opted to flex their law-and-order credentials and double down on highly charged social issues. The approach is designed to sway voters thinking of backing Macron, but also those considering more radical alternatives. It also has the effect of further legitimising the far right, whose talking points circulate more freely than ever in the mainstream press. Above all, this is due to CNews, a Fox News-esque channel founded by the conservative billionaire Vincent Bolloré in 2017 that has become one of the country’s most watched news networks. On a typical day, panellists rail against themes such as wokisme and “Anglo-Saxon” identity politics, while the ostensibly impartial news coverage skews heavily toward stories with a link to crime or immigration. Through his control of the media conglomerate Vivendi, Bolloré has more recently extended his influence to the radio station Europe 1, leading to an exodus of journalists, while new personalities who share his brand of conservative grievance politics and penchant for whipping up moral panics are brought in. Both networks, but especially CNews, play a key role in setting the news cycle. This is the media landscape that birthed the candidacy of Éric Zemmour, a polemicist who has largely set the tone for this year’s campaign. A former star panellist on CNews and former columnist for Le Figaro newspaper, who has been convicted multiple times of hate speech against Muslims and racial minorities, Zemmour knows how to deliver red meat to regular consumers of rightwing media. Just as importantly, he knows how to reap the rewards of coverage from outlets that aren’t as ideologically friendly. Zemmour has a knack for delivering soundbites that make for good TV and easy shares on social media. His capacity for historical and intellectual references impresses people. And like the former US president Donald Trump, with whom he recently spoke on the phone, Zemmour understands the benefits of provocation: at its best, it works as a critique of the political establishment; at a minimum, it keeps people talking about you. Under different circumstances, this campaign would have been an excellent opportunity for the left. So far, it is botching the occasion. Divided parties have wasted time criticising each other, waffling on strategy and struggling to present a clear alternative to the leading pack. At this stage, only Jean-Luc Mélenchon of La France Insoumise polls in double digits. For now, Macron has been more than happy to sit back and watch things from afar, focusing on more internationally pressing issues such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Polls suggest this strategy hasn’t hurt too much either. He is projected to coast to reelection over either Le Pen or Zemmour, and while Pécresse would fare slightly better he’d still win comfortably against her. Now against the backdrop of war, Macron will likely sell himself as the competent leader that France needs to navigate a frightening new phase of geopolitical uncertainty. In contrast, his three rightwing challengers lack experience and, to varying degrees, all underestimated the threat of Putin. (Le Pen’s party even took out a massive loan from a Russian bank ahead of its 2017 presidential campaign.) Still, the following weeks could be full of surprises: the war will likely upend the race. Le Pen and Zemmour are still scrambling to collect the mandatory 500 signatures from local officials to qualify for the ballot. Many voters have yet to make up their minds, especially leftwing ones. And while polls suggest turnout could be lower than ever for a presidential election, young and working-class voters turned off by the campaign so far could be drawn in by a credible progressive challenger. Macron remains the clear favourite, but it may be too soon to count out the left.

2/25/2022,"How much effect does the label have on your decision to buy a wine? A fair bit, I’d imagine – and, despite being more concerned with the contents than the appearance of a bottle, the same applies to me as well. The label can change your perception of a wine, too. To take one example, I’ve never been a huge fan of the Most Wanted range, but its recent rebranding with a strikingly colourful selection of street-art labels designed to promote diversity and inclusivity in the wine business made me feel I should give it another try. And it turned out that I was quite impressed by the unusually characterful pinot grigio in today’s pick with a label designed by Hackney-based street artist Jelly J. I’d also buy the malbec, and either would be great to take to a party. Jazzy labels are, of course, nothing new, but they are still less widely used on wine bottles than they are on beer. And they can sometimes contribute hugely to a brand’s impact: the success of 19 Crimes, for one, must owe a lot to the striking, augmented-reality labels (download the app, and you can hear the character on the label tell their story). I still find their red way too sweet, though. It’s also more common for new-world wines to feature unconventional artwork than the classic European ones, which tend to appeal to older wine drinkers. “Brighter, bolder, more daring labels certainly help attract younger consumers,” says Ben Cahill, wine buyer at the Co-op, which stocks a fair few in its range. “And it’s more difficult to ‘reinvent’ the labels on wines from the classic regions; for instance, people have a preconception of what a chablis should look like, and often find reassurance in familiarity.” But, interestingly, innovative labelling doesn’t apply only to inexpensive wines. “Almost the same rules apply to the top and bottom ends of the market,” says Neil Tully, founder of one of the leading modern label designers, Amphora. “People who are super-confident about wine are willing to part with money on something disruptive and creative, and with inexpensive, entry-level wines, it’s not a major risk, either.” Tully reckons we’ll be seeing more campaigns such as Most Wanted’s. “Wine labelling is inherently quite conservative, but I think there will be the kind of incremental change we saw with screwcaps. At first, they were disrupting. Now, you see them everywhere.” Most Wanted Collective Pinot Grigio 2020 £7 Sainsbury’s, £7.75 Morrisons (though you may find only the Collective edition in store), 12%. Much more personality than yer average pinot grigio, both inside and outside the bottle. Shhh. It’s Riesling 2020 £6 Co-op, 11.5%. Fresh, fruity and with a label that boldly tackles consumers’ prejudice against this grape. Mimo Moutinho Portuguese Loureiro 2020 £6.49 Aldi, 11.5%. A light, fresh, spring-like white from a snazzily-labelled range of Portuguese wines. The Blind Spot Pinot Meunier Yarra Valley 2021 £12.95 The Wine Society, 11%. The striking graphics highlight the unconventional use of a grape more normally found in champagne. A gloriously fragrant, light red – or is it a rosé? You decide. Three Crows Bridge Pa Hawkes Bay Syrah 2019 £30 The Wine Society, £35 Oxford Wine Co, 13%. A wonderfully expressive syrah from New Zealand, made as a tribute to the northern Rhône.

2/25/2022,"Uefa is in discussions with its lawyers over ending the governing body’s longstanding relationship with Gazprom, after confirming that this season’s men’s Champions League final has been moved from St Petersburg to Paris. On a day when European football began to take firm action after the invasion of Ukraine, with Manchester United ending their sponsorship deal with Aeroflot and Russian teams forced to play matches at neutral venues, Russian authorities claimed Uefa was playing politics with sport. Uefa’s showpiece fixture will be held at the Stade de France on 28 May, with the governing body thanking Emmanuel Macron for his role in facilitating the change. “Uefa wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic president Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis,” a statement said. “Together with the French government, Uefa will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.” In a further statement, Uefa confirmed there would be meetings of the ExCo soon “where additional matters will be addressed”. The Guardian understands this will include the relationship with Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, which has sponsored Uefa’s club competitions for more than a decade and is closely intertwined with football across Europe. SportBusiness Sponsorship has estimated that Gazprom’s 2018-21 sponsorship deal was worth about €40m a year to Uefa. That deal was extended last year to include sponsorship of all Uefa’s international competitions. A second decision was taken to move the home fixtures of Ukrainian and Russian club and national teams in Uefa competitions to neutral venues. In effect this applies immediately only to Spartak Moscow, who play RB Leipzig the last 16 of the Europa League. Uefa’s international competition the Nations League is scheduled to resume in June, when Russia are set to host Iceland and Albania, and Ukraine are due to be at home to Armenia and the Republic of Ireland. On Thursday the Ukrainian FA (UAF) had called for all Russian teams be excluded from Uefa competitions. Although Uefa stopped short of this, its decisions were strongly criticised by Alexander Dyukov, the head of the Russian Football Union (RFU), who sits on the Uefa ExCo and is chairman of the Gazprom subsidiary Gazprom Neft. In a statement released via the RFU, Dyukov said: “We believe that the decision to move the venue of the Champions League final was dictated by political reasons. The RFU has always adhered to the principle of ‘sport is out of politics’, and thus cannot support this decision. “The RFU also does not support the decision to transfer any matches involving Russian teams to neutral territory as it violates the sports principle and infringes on the interests of players, coaches and fans.” Andrii Pavelko, the UAF president, was also present at the meeting. Russia and Ukraine are due to play in World Cup play-offs next month in fixtures that fall under Fifa’s jurisdiction. A United spokesperson said of the move to end ties with Aeroflot, the club’s official carrier: “In light of events in Ukraine, we have withdrawn Aeroflot’s sponsorship rights. We share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected.” The decision ends a nine-year association between United and Russia’s largest airline. The contract was was due to expire next year, having been renewed in 2017. United’s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, said moving the final was “inevitable” and “the right decision”. West Ham’s manager, David Moyes, said the club’s Ukrainian forward Andriy Yarmolenko had been given time off. “He’s not in a very good position at the moment,” Moyes said. “We’ve given him a few days off. We’ll do all we can to help him – it’s a really difficult time for him and his family. I spoke with him yesterday and he was upset, which you can imagine. We just hope his family keep safe.” The UK government responded positively to Uefa’s actions. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, welcomed the move and the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said other sporting bodies due to host events in Russia this year should follow Uefa’s lead. “I appreciate that a lot of people are uncomfortable mixing sport and ‘politics’ but the situation in Ukraine is way beyond ‘politics’,” Huddleston said.",Sport/Football,Uefa moves to end Gazprom deal and strips Russia of Champions League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/russia-stripped-champions-league-final-uefa-ukraine
2/25/2022,"When asked to sum up his experience of Peaky Blinders in one word at the premiere of the final season of the hit BBC drama, its creator, Steven Knight, simply said: “Birmingham”. Hundreds of fans dressed in baker boy hats and 1920s clothes descended on Birmingham’s city centre on Thursday night to catch a glimpse of the stars of a show that has transformed the city’s image over its six-season run, the last of which starts on Sunday. Peaky Blinders-themed events, tours and street art have popped up all over Birmingham, attracting tourists from across the world. A record 131 million people visited the West Midlands in 2018, which the West Midlands Growth Company has partly attributed to the “Peaky effect”. The official merchandise for the Commonwealth Games, to be held in Birmingham this summer, even features the Peaky Blinders cap. “The show has sent a message that art, creativity and writing is the catalyst that changes things and it’s got to be taken seriously,” said Knight. “At government level, they have not understood that what we’re really good at is this, and we should invest in it more.” The series, which follows the infamous Shelby crime gang, has also helped establish the city as a centre for creativity, TV and film production. A number of major Hollywood productions, including Mission: Impossible 7 and Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, have filmed in the region in recent years. Knight himself is building a film and TV studio in the city, down the road from where the first recorded attack by the real “Peaky Blinders” took place – he hopes to start shooting a Peaky Blinders film there within 18 months. “I don’t like to say we put Birmingham on the map. We had the Industrial Revolution, the Lunar Men, James Watt, Matthew Boulton, some incredible people who invented some amazing things,” said Birmingham-born Knight. “But I think in terms of the media, we haven’t banged the drum enough and we haven’t shouted enough about ourselves, because Birmingham people are quite embarrassed about doing that. But we don’t have to be embarrassed.” The Birmingham writer Benjamin Zephaniah, who stars in the show, said it had helped boost the city’s image by “bringing a sense of style, to the world”. “I mean, I’ve seen Japanese Peaky Blinders, dressed in the full costume. We’ve done that,” he said. Martin Green, the chief creative officer of the 2022 Commonwealth Games and previously head of ceremonies at the London 2012 Olympics, said there was “absolutely a direct line from the show to the cultural elevation of Birmingham in the UK and around the world”. He suggested the show would feature in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games, while Knight is working on a new contemporary dance inspired by Peaky Blinders that will form part of the cultural programme running alongside the event. “Successful global pieces of entertainment, they do give a place confidence. People can go around the world and say ‘Hey, I’m from Birmingham’ and people will say Peaky Blinders. It’s a calling card,” he said. “Birmingham is just about to go through its Manchester/Liverpool/Glasgow moment. It has waited patiently for its turn, and you can absolutely trace the line from those big global entertainment successes in terms of how a city changes culturally and in its confidence. “This place is young and diverse and creative and ready to go so I think there’s this mystic mixture of ingredients that make a city just go, right, for the next few years, we are the centre of the universe.” As Knight looked out across the legions of Brummies crowded around the red carpet, he reflected on what he hopes the show’s ultimate legacy would be: “I hope it means that people telling working-class stories will have the confidence to believe that the story from their back yard is international.”",Arts/Television & radio,Birmingham doffs cap to Peaky Blinders for transforming its image,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/25/birmingham-peaky-blinders-finale-city-tourism-boosted
2/25/2022,"History of Fashion, the only Irish-trained runner in a field of 17 for the Eider Chase at Newcastle on Saturday, is the favourite in the early betting and Ireland’s strength in depth over jumps at present means that many punters will find Pat Fahy’s gelding irresistible. The bare form of his winning handicap debut at Down Royal in January gives him plenty to find in such a competitive race, however, and while he scored with something to spare, the step up to a marathon trip is another unknown. Eclair Surf (3.15), on the other hand, is similarly unexposed but certain to appreciate this test, following a clear-cut win over three miles and five furlongs at Warwick last month. At around 7-1, he looks a better bet than the favourite to extend his winning run. Kempton 1.15 Patroclus was pulled up on his chasing debut in December but improved significantly on his second try over fences, battling on from the last to edge out a more experienced opponent in the final strides. That form gives him an obvious chance at around 4-1 and there should be better still to come. Lingfield 1.30 Tone The Barone beat Exalted Angel by nearly two lengths in a useful Wolverhampton handicap in December, but this Listed event is at level weights and an 8lb swing should be enough for Karl Burke’s gelding to turn the tables.

2/25/2022,"Monday Just over a week ago, I headed up to north London to see Spurs play Wolves. As we’d recently lost to Chelsea (several times) and Southampton, my expectations weren’t high. Just some signs that the players vaguely recognised one another would have been nice. But even that was too much to ask. Wolves took the lead early on thanks to some chaotic defending, doubled it within 20 minutes and Tottenham never mustered a threatening shot on goal. Come the final whistle, the person in charge of the PA system immediately ramped up the music to drown out the sound of the boos from the few spectators who had bothered to stick it out to the end. On the walk back to the tube, Matthew and I wondered if the team had hit a new low. Going to matches was beginning to feel like a chore. Without even the excitement of a relegation battle to liven things up. Just an endless tide of mediocrity. Then came Saturday’s match away to Manchester City, one that took even the diehard optimists by surprise. An early goal to give you hope where previously you had none. Tick. A City equaliser to remind you it was only a matter of time before they scored again. Tick. A second goal totally against the run of play to reignite the hope. Tick. A third goal disallowed to make sure you’re not tempted to relax. Tick. A 90th-minute penalty conceded to allow City to level the game and for you to convince yourself a draw isn’t so bad and that you’re not secretly devastated. Tick. An improbable 95th-minute winner to steal all three points. Tick. This was Classic Spurs. One week seemingly useless and unable to see where their next win is coming from and the next beating the best team in Europe. And nothing in between. It’s why I love and support the team. But God it feels exhausting. Tuesday With Russian forces invading the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, Boris Johnson’s decision to end all Covid restrictions got rather sidelined. It was all most confusing as it turned out there were two versions of the statement. One for the Tory MPs in the Commons, who have been clamouring for an end to restrictions for months – in some cases years – and another at the press conference the prime minister held with Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. In the Commons, Johnson, AKA The Suspect, was positively gung-ho. There would be no more need for anyone to self-isolate and testing would as good as end once people realised they were going to have to pay for their own tests. It was as if Johnson thought Covid was over. After all, if you don’t test then you don’t find any infection. From now on, it would all be a matter of personal responsibility. The Tory MPs loved all this, with none of them questioning for a moment the wisdom of a man with no sense of personal responsibility urging the rest of the country to use theirs. Do as I say, not as I do and all that. Prize for hypocrisy and toadying went to Matt Hancock. The man who had shown no self-restraint and personal responsibility in the CCTV footage that is seared on the nation’s brain went out of his way to say that the pandemic was over thanks to Johnson’s self-restraint and personal responsibility. How badly can he want a ministerial job again? The press conference was much more measured, with Whitty and Vallance pouring cold water on The Suspect’s boosterism. Omicron hadn’t been as bad as we had feared, but we must continue to be vigilant and be ready to implement severe restrictions again at short notice. And self-isolating wasn’t a matter of personal responsibility, it was a national necessity. I know whose advice I believed. Wednesday When my Twitter timeline started to fill up in the new year with people posting a series of yellow and green squares, I didn’t have a clue what was going on at first. And when I did discover they were announcing their daily Wordle scores, I thought this was just pointless showing off and decided I was going to avoid the game at all costs. But I have to confess that recently I’ve begun playing Wordle and have become something of a convert. There’s something very satisfying about watching the letters gradually turn yellow (right letter in wrong place) and green (right letter in right place) until you have all five greens. It was my wife who got me started one evening about a week ago when she asked me for help with a word and I haven’t looked back. Now I sometimes even find myself wondering whether it’s worth staying up till midnight to have a crack at the new puzzle. I haven’t been doing Wordle long enough to have a view on whether it’s got harder since it was bought by the New York Times, but I have already made up some rules for myself. There are those who always use the same starting word – audio is popular as it has four vowels – but I like to begin with a different word each time. Just to make it more interesting. And I’m not that bothered how many attempts it takes me to get the right answer. One recent answer was shake. The K happened to be my fourth guess. But shale, shame, shape and shave were all equally good shouts. And I’m still not posting my scores on Twitter. Yet. Thursday My gut response on hearing that the BBC was planning a new adaptation of Great Expectations with Olivia Colman was much the same as Brenda from Bristol’s on hearing there was to be a general election in 2017. Not another one. Nothing against the book or Colman – I’m sure she will make a wonderful Miss Havisham – but the BBC seem to remake Great Expectations every five to 10 years. So how about trying something new? A while later, I noticed on Twitter that the author Philip Hensher felt much the same way and, as he is much better read than me, I asked him what books that had been overlooked he would like to see serialised for TV. Here’s his selection. If you’re determined to stay with Charles Dickens, it’s been a while since either The Pickwick Papers – Toby Jones would be a great Mr Pickwick – and The Old Curiosity Shop have been adapted. And Mrs Lirriper’s Christmas stories would make a fabulous 19th-century “Keeping Up Appearances” series. Anthony Trollope is also due a revival: Orley Farm and He Knew He Was Right would make cracking series. As would William Thackeray’s Pendennis – a story of making it in the big city – and Charlotte Brontë’s Villette, one of the most compelling novels of the 19th century. Moving into the 20th century, there is Elizabeth Bowen’s The Death of the Heart, Ivy Compton-Burnett’s Elders and Betters and Elizabeth Taylor’s The Soul of Kindness. Or how about Joseph Conrad’s Chance, an anti-capitalist seafaring adventure and the biggest success in his lifetime? What books would you like to see adapted for the small screen? Or are you happy with the BBC endlessly repeating Great Expectations and Sense and Sensibility? Friday During his first Commons statement on Tuesday following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, MPs from all sides of the house widely criticised Boris Johnson for an inadequate response. Imposing sanctions on five small Russian banks and three oligarchs, all of whom had already been sanctioned by the US back in 2018, didn’t seem much of a deterrent. Come Thursday, after Vladimir Putin launched a further ground, sea and air offensive on several Ukrainian cities, Johnson appeared to have got his act together, with a far more wide-ranging set of sanctions, and it was noticeable how much agreement there was from almost all MPs in the Commons about the UK’s response to the crisis. Hostilities over Partygate and the mismanagement of the economy were temporarily put on hold. Not that everyone in Ukraine was feeling the love. President Zelenskiy tweeted that his country now stood alone and needed more than warm words of support. Still, there was one British politician who made no secret of his support for Putin. Step forward, Nigel Farage, who was at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida for his GB News show. Nige’s hot take was that the war in Ukraine had been started by Nato and the EU deliberately going out of their way to provoke Russia. Weird how Farage can support a brutal, imperialist regime actively involved in expansionism after having accused the EU of empire-building for decades. There again, I guess Nige is still grateful for all the Russian support during the Brexit campaign. “None of this would be happening if Donald Trump was still in the White House,” he said. Quite right. The Donald would be actively welcoming Putin on to the streets of Kyiv. Digested week, digested: war in Europe.

2/25/2022,"Perched on a rock surrounded by a vast nature reserve, the hilltop hamlet of Trevinano sent tremors across the Lazio region when it was announced this month that it and its 142 residents were in line for €20m (£16.73m) from a Covid recovery fund to save small villages on the verge of extinction – equal to a whopping €140,845 per resident. “This initiative is generating a lot of envy and bad feeling,” said Alessandra Terrosi, the mayor of Trevinano, who has the responsibility for spending the millions before 2026, when the funding programme ends. The hamlet’s good fortune has fuelled rancour among its neighbours who missed out, raised questions over how efficiently Italy will invest some of the €191bn coming its way from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund and had critics asking if €20m is just too much money for one small village. Trevinano was pitted against 14 other candidates in Lazio, including the region’s better known gem, the fortress-like Civita di Bagnoregio, for a slice of the €420m fund. “We went through exactly the same procedures as everyone else, and our project was judged to be the best,” said Terrosi, who alongside her team of two councillors worked around the clock to come up with the hamlet’s winning project, called Re-Wind. “I think we won because of its feasibility – we weren’t asking for the moon, we simply proposed a series of things that were practical.” Trevinano was settled by the Etruscans 2,500 years ago, and in the 1960s had about 1,000 residents before the population decline took hold. Today, it hosts two restaurants, one with a Michelin star, but there is no supermarket, school or cashpoint, and the post office is only open one day a week. In five years’ time, Terrosi envisages it as a bustling place filled with students, remote workers, artisans and visitors enjoying concerts in the gardens of its castle. The hoped-for revival will be ushered in by a project that includes creating a student training hub, offering programmes such as reforestation, as well as renovating dozens of empty homes and making them available to tourists and pensioners. Terrosi plans to revive agricultural initiatives, pointing to the example of a couple who moved to the area and bought a vineyard that now produces local wine. It may also generate its own electricity. It is a vision backed by its residents. “People from other towns are jealous but the mayor has done something very good, we have never had anything before,” says Elide Marelli, who moved to Trevinano after marrying a local. Among those from other towns is her gardener, Elio, who lives in the nearby Acquapendente. “I have a lot of friends here … I just hope they don’t all become snobs.” An hour’s drive away is Civita di Bagnoregio, where Luca Profili, the mayor of the hamlet perched on a plateau of volcanic rock with a permanent population a tenth that of Trevinano’s, was among the first to object to the resources going to one village. “Obviously, if we’d won, I would have been really happy,” he said. “But my point is that it would be better to share the money more evenly between several villages so that a whole area could be developed, especially because it’s extremely difficult for small administrations to manage such huge amounts of money. And with a deadline of 2026, it’s not going to be easy.” The controversy shows no sign of dissipating, with leaders in other Italian regions scrapping as they await the verdict on their own €20m winner. “If you play one off against the other, it’s obvious there is going to be anger and division,” said Marco Bussone, the Piedmont president of Uncem, the national union of mountain communities, who wants the awards abolished. “It’s basically a lottery. But pivoting funds on one village won’t generate development, what it will create is a tourist resort, and we don’t want that. The money is meant to reduce inequality – we need projects that regenerate communities across a whole area.” Italy is the biggest beneficiary of the EU’s recovery fund, and a significant chunk of the grants and loans will need to be repaid by taxpayers. Francesco Grillo, a political economist and director of the thinktank Vision, said the village initiative casts serious doubts on how efficiently Italy will invest the rest of the cash. In addition to the €420m for some of Italy’s tiniest settlements, a further €580m is on offer to 229 villages of fewer than 5,000 people. “These small administrations are expected to apply for something very complicated and overcome difficult milestones,” said Grillo. “It’s like asking a very small cat to eat a massive cow. By tomorrow. It’s worrying.” He also doubted the project would achieve the objective of reviving dying towns. “One thing is revitalising places which have links to big cities, the other is trying to repopulate remote areas – my question is: would it be sustainable?” The residents of Trevinano seem to think so. “We invested here when there really was nothing,” said Romano Gordini, who owns the La Parolina restaurant with his wife, the Michelin star chef Iside de Cesare. “It’s great that Italy is relaunching from places that are usually forgotten.” The restaurant attracts a good flow of custom from Lazio and neighbouring Umbria and Tuscany, and is hoping the project will bring in more. Gordini enjoys Trevinano’s stunning scenery and slow pace of life. “It’s otherworldly,” he said. “Once you visit Trevinano, you always come back,” said Marelli.",News/World news,Covid recovery funding pits Italy’s dying towns against each other,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/covid-recovery-funding-pits-italys-dying-towns-against-each-other
2/25/2022,"Russian forces have reached Kyiv, a day after attacking Ukraine from three sides on a massive scale. Air raid sirens wailed over the city and heavy gunfire and explosions were heard in a number of districts, as Russian military vehicles approached from the north-west. There was also significant fighting near Ivankiv, about 40 miles north-west of Kyiv, and Russian troops entered the city of Sumy, which sits on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east. Russia attacked Ukraine on multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv, including an ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase. Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. One Russian line came through the Senkivka border crossing near Chernihiv. A substantial attack was also aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. Social media footage showed them reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 130km inside Ukraine. Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric also grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and APCs on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia: Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. Half of Russia’s air force is now deployed near Ukraine, according to western estimates. Russian warships conducted training exercises in the Black Sea in the run-up to the invasion. This footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence shows a Ka-27PS helicopter taking off and landing on the deck of a frigate during exercises on 22 February: These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year: Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye in western Crimea. The US estimates 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. This image from 18 February shows deployments including armour, helicopters and field hospitals in Novoozernoye: Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to what the UK defence secretary described as potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
2/25/2022,"The UK government has failed to back up its call for schools to ditch plastic, say campaigners, despite setting a 2022 target. Three years ago Damian Hinds, then the education secretary, challenged headteachers in England to ditch disposables such as straws, bottles, bags and food packaging by this year. But campaigners say that without tangible targets, funded resources and a realistic strategy, this goal is still a long way off. After the announcement, the environmental charities Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) and Kids Against Plastic (KAP) saw a flurry of interest from teachers and pupils wanting to join their school-based initiatives. About 4,500 schools have signed up to programmes, but these represent just 14% of UK schools. The guidance was “much too vague”, according to Amy Meek, who co-founded KAP with her sister Ella in 2017 and launched the Plastic Clever Schools initiative in spring 2018. “We were excited to see the government target because it felt like a step in the right direction; they were acknowledging the importance encouraging schools to take action,” she said. “But ‘eliminating unnecessary single-use plastic’ is hard to quantify – what falls into that category? How do they want schools to go about it? There was so little for schools to actually build upon.” “We really thought that announcement would help make change happen but since then so little has been done; what’s the point of setting a target if nothing was going to happen towards it? It didn’t make sense to us that they would set this goal and then do nothing.” So far, more than 1,300 schools have signed up to the Plastic Clever Schools initiative. Another 3,174 schools have signed up to the Plastic Free Schools programme that SAS established in September 2017. Hugo Tagholm, the chief executive of SAS, is also disappointed. “[The government] shouldn’t be making bold statements and commitments unless they really know what their pathway to delivering the success is. Otherwise it’s disingenuous.” Emily van de Geer, the education manager at SAS, says the Plastic Free Schools programme helps teach students to hold power to account by challenging government representatives and industry. “We’re providing young people with the tools to use the power of their voice and know that those avenues of communication to politicians and business owners are open to them in the future.” To reach Plastic Free School status, schools must also remove at least three single-use plastic items from use, either by ditching them altogether or choosing reusable alternatives. But when schools are tied into multi-year contracts with suppliers, procurement is a barrier, says Van de Geer. “If government introduced stronger bans – of plastic drinks bottles in schools, for example – those companies would have to change the way they are supplying schools. That pressure needs to come from the top, too.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The government wants schools to be single-use plastic-free. We know many schools have met this ambition and others have made significant progress towards it. The government has launched a call for evidence looking for views on how to shift away from single-use items to reusable or refillable alternatives.” Tagholm says new regulations are needed to make a substantial transition. “Just look at what’s happened with deposit return schemes: we won that battle in 2018 but the government is still dragging its heels. It’s a really achievable, sustainable solution to plastic pollution from bottle and drinks containers that we see on every beach and street of the country,” he says. “But instead of putting in good legislation, they seem reliant on voluntary measures. That’s not a systems change.” Van de Geer remains hopeful: “2022 is an opportunity [for the government] to reflect on the 2018 announcement, acknowledge that not enough support has been provided to reach those goals and lay out some more concrete support for schools to achieve this in the future,” she says. “Schools need a roadmap.” For sisters Amy and Ella Meek, their Plastic Clever Schools project is about shifting mindsets. “Becoming ‘plastic clever’ is a realistic first step towards tackling plastic pollution,” says Amy, 18. “Being completely plastic-free is so unachievable for most people, never mind overworked teachers. So a big part of our programme focuses on enabling the youth voice, getting kids to start to lead this in the school so that … they’re much more likely to want to do more at home and elsewhere in their community.” When a school signs up to Plastic Clever Schools, the website guides teachers and pupils through a three-stage process. First up, lesson plans help teachers educate primary pupils about the impacts of plastic pollution by building a base level of awareness. By the end of this first stage, pupils present an assembly about plastic pollution to the school, organise a litter-pick and create a video explaining the importance of reducing plastic. In stage two, students audit the single-use plastic in their own school to quantify the problem. “Schools vary in terms of the stage they’re at and the types of plastic they use most of, so each school needs to decide which four problem plastics they want to eliminate,” says Ella. “For some it might start with crisp packets in packed lunches, for others it could be glue sticks or milk bottles.” The final stage is about action. “Having done the audit, pupils campaign to reduce four items of single-use plastic across the whole school – that’s the ultimate goal,” says Ella. The duo hope to make the model scalable to reach more primaries and secondaries in the future.",News/Environment,"DfE did nothing to help schools ditch plastics, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/department-education-did-nothing-back-up-push-schools-ditch-plastics
2/25/2022,"Mmm, cashmere. So soft and fluffy, right? As warm as toast, as light as bubble bath. What’s not to love? A lot, actually. It turns out we are doing it wrong. Which is a bit of a shock, since cashmere has been one of the high street fashion success stories of our times. Just the word – cashmere – has become a brand name, a status symbol in its own right. Like Häagen-Dazs or Chanel No 5, everyone loves cashmere. Retailers, having identified the killer shelf appeal of a neat stack of marshmallow-soft sweaters in M&M colours as a weakness – one that can trigger an impulse purchase of a box-fresh lemon-yellow cardi, when you only popped into the store for a pair of tights – have enabled our cashmere habit. The thing is, cashmere can be problematic for sustainability and for animal welfare. A yarn once prized for its durability has been hijacked by fast fashion, damaging farming practices in ways that cause unnecessary suffering to goats, and creating inferior sweaters that wear out or lose shape. Like an egg-white omelette, cheap cashmere is whipped up from scant ingredients into something that looks good but is insubstantial. “Fluffy feels good, but it often covers up weaknesses,” says Tim Ewington, co-founder of cashmere label Aethel, which is pricey, but made to last. “Fluffiness is good at disguising shorter cashmere hairs, which are less well spun and heavily dyed. And it covers up the fact that there isn’t so much cashmere in the sweater, since fluffy cashmere looks bulky even if it doesn’t weigh much.” His advice? Ask about ply – “two-ply is a good mid-weight sweater” – or take your kitchen scales to the shop, and weigh the sweater before you buy. Is that such a crazy idea? This is a serious purchase, after all. (Aethel’s Big Hug knit weighs a substantial 700g.) The Good Cashmere Standard (GCS)was launched in 2020 to safeguard the welfare of goats and farmers whose traditional practices are endangered by fast fashion appetites. Belly hair is sometimes combed without waiting for the goats’ natural moulting period, causing distress to the animals. The GCS only gives its approval to farms that follow ethical practices. The White Company, where a luxurious pure cashmere sweatshirt costs £169, was the first British brand to join the initiative. “All animals farmed for their yarn should be cared for,” says Barbara Horspool, the White Company’s clothing director. “The livelihoods of remote communities depend on this trade, so it’s about educating and working with farmers.” She says responsibly sourced cashmere is a sound buy. “Handwash it, or machine wash at 30C, and it will last and last.” Boden and Cos, both GCS signatories, are excellent places to look for well-priced cashmere. Longevity is as much about design as it is about manufacture, as a Cos spokesperson pointed out: look for timeless, less trend-driven pieces. (You can’t go wrong with a Cos charcoal turtleneck, £145.) Mindful of balancing durability with the frothiness customers have come to expect, Boden sends its cashmere out for testing in real-life wardrobes “to ensure we have the right balance between handfeel and pilling performance”, says Cristina Gilkes, director of product development and buying at Boden. Its knitted tank top, £90, is a useful multi-season layering piece. Occasionally, Aethel hears from customers bemused that their new sweater doesn’t feel like candy floss. But they also get feedback that their sweaters last, and hold their shape. Ewington’s advice to cashmere shoppers is: “Weigh the piece in your hands, feel the elbows and cuffs – ask yourself whether you believe the piece will last.” Because, price aside, that is what cashmere’s famous feelgood factor really feels like.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Cashmere has been hijacked by fast fashion – so be careful what you buy | Jess Cartner-Morley,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/25/cashmere-has-been-hijacked-by-fast-fashion-so-be-careful-what-you-buy
2/25/2022,"Mark Bruce has always been driven by music, feeding off it like a vulture in the desert – that’s the kind of imagery he might use, drawn to darkness, Americana and violent urges. In this triple bill, each piece takes a different musical direction. Bruce is not the only person to choreograph to the White Stripes (see: Wayne McGregor’s Chroma), but in Green Apples he does it in the spirit of the garage band themselves. Two dancers (one male, one female) are dressed in red and black like Jack and Meg White – jeans, vest, tattoos and some of that couple’s ambiguity (were they siblings or spouses?). There’s pressure and resistance, a look of relish on Bryony Harrison’s face, her body twanging with the tension of a bass guitar string (not that the two-piece had a bassist). Bruce’s choreographer father, Christopher, made Rooster to the music of the Rolling Stones; Bruce Jr seems to be working towards the rawer, scuzzier modern equivalent. The company of five dance to Martin Simpson’s folk songs in Folk Tales, brutal yarns of murder and grief, but the dance is knowing and laced with comedy. Carina Howard launches into a fantastic jig, with perfect pas de chat and sissones thrown in. Jonathan Goddard is a master at playing the haunted, hollow and insidious, but he moves like an angel, with unbelievable lightness: the silken swoop of a leg brushing the air, his sudden speed and detail, his ability to almost control the friction between his body and the air. In the programme’s main work, Phantoms, Bruce gets to live out his Nick Cave fantasies, having composed and sung the music himself. It’s a dance built on movie tropes. Loners and outcasts, a sociopathic preacher, a fallen angel; the land of Johnny Cash shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die; Lynch and Tarantino (a woman brandishing knives is pure Uma Thurman). With a sparse set, it’s hugely atmospheric, bright footlights masking scene changes where characters materialise and disappear. There’s an indulgence about it and it loses its way for a little while in the instrumentals, lost in the emptiness of these characters’ souls. Bruce is best when tied to a song, where he thrives.

2/25/2022,"You know a show has made it when it’s prepared to say no to its main backer, especially when that backer is a megastar rapper who is singlehandedly responsible for the show even being on TV. “When we first met Drake to talk to him about helping us to revive the series, he said, ‘Look, I’d love to be in it!’” says Top Boy creator Ronan Bennett, but this offer gave him a problem. “If Drake were to appear, it would have been a distraction. It would be hard to maintain Top Boy’s level of authenticity – so it didn’t happen.” Since its launch in 2011, Top Boy has had a reputation for an unblinking depiction of the drug trade rife on inner-London estates. Soon, viewers will be treated to its second, hyper-realistic season on Netflix, nine years after it was cancelled by Channel 4 following two runs. Longtime fan Drake helped convince Netflix to commission the series, becoming executive producer along the way. It was also helped by calls from fans – including famous ones. When Kane “Kano” Robinson, the grime musician who plays gang leader Sully in the show, met Noel Gallagher, the first thing Gallagher said was: “When’s Top Boy coming back?’” “It got annoying sometimes,” says Ashley Walters, who has played Dushane, another gang leader, since the start. “I love the fans and I love how much they love the show. But you kind of get drowned by it sometimes. It’s like you can’t exist as any other character. It’s like: ‘All right, that’s good. But when’s Top Boy coming back?’ It was a relief to have it return.” This time round, the show is much bigger in scope. We follow the drug route into London from Morocco through Spain – prompting scenes of sun-dappled ocean waves gently lapping a yacht’s bow. Naturally, this being Top Boy, these scenes are followed by a naked man being shot in the head and dumped overboard. We also see into the police investigation of the various London crews, which is actually a first, even though the show has been dubbed the UK’s version of The Wire. (Bennett is quick to point out that this story has “not remotely been influenced by comparisons to The Wire.”) Plus, we see Top Boy do something it has certainly never done before – have a grime MC hang out in a bush with a fox called Roy, fork-feeding it from a tin while chuckling: “Here comes the plane!” “Ronan had been showing us videos of him feeding a fox that was living in his garden,” says Robinson. “So when I saw that in the script, I thought: ‘Oh God, you’ve stitched me up.’” This is a result of his character retreating into a less urban lifestyle after the climax of the previous series. “I was a bit nervous. I don’t like foxes. I don’t think anyone likes foxes. You normally avoid them, don’t you?” But some things have stayed the same. Just like the previous two series, this new season begins with Sully and Dushane falling out. “It’s an ongoing battle,” says Walters. “Every time we get scripts, Kane and I are like: ‘Ah man, again?’ But we’re always creatively trying to find ways to make it feel different.” Robinson adds: “It does blow my mind how long the show has been running, especially when I get a young person saying: ‘When the first series came out, I wasn’t allowed to watch it. I was 11 and my mum wouldn’t let me.’” It’s not just Top Boy fans who have grown up with the show. Its actors have, too. “I just remember everyone in school talking about it,” says Brit award-winning MC Little Simz, AKA Simbi Ajikawo, who plays Dushane’s girlfriend Shelley. Jasmine Jobson, who plays Dushane’s deputy Jaq, chips into our group Zoom call: “Everyone in class would be like: ‘Oh my God, did you see what happened in Top Boy last night?’” In the past, the show has been very male-dominated. But last month, a giant poster was unveiled in London featuring Jobson and Ajikawo. “There we are, faces as big as satellite dishes!” says Jobson. “Our boats are right there! I’m so gassed!” Ajikawo gets her own storyline, too, running a nail bar and being visited by a shadowy figure from her past. Meanwhile, as Jaq becomes a major player in the Summerhouse gang, we step into her love life and see her in the grip of a family drama that introduces a Liverpool-based crew. So is there more of a spotlight on female characters this season? “One hundred per cent,” says Jobson. “The women who live in this world aren’t often spoken about. And the female perspective was something we were lacking, but now we’re opening doors.” Ajikawo adds: “Yeah, the earlier seasons were really male-led, but we’re pushing the narrative forward now. Not just in showing that these men have sisters, girlfriends and mothers, but also that they work with women who are leading their field.” Top Boy has always been unflinching in tackling broader social issues, such as the county lines phenomenon, in which inner-city kids briefly decamp to small towns to sell drugs. Series four showcases the post-Windrush threat of deportation faced by older African-Caribbean immigrants, as well as homing in on gentrification and furious residents’ meetings whose attendees face rehousing in different cities. However, due to the series already being in production at the time of George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement didn’t make it in. Does that feel weird? “You have to remember what type of people the characters are,” says Robinson. “They’re violent drug dealers who come from a place that has made them that way. Are they going to Black Lives Matter marches? I doubt it. I doubt most people out there selling drugs are.” Still, it’s hard not to look at Top Boy at least through the prism of BLM. For years, it has been depicting a side of the inner-city British Black experience often overlooked by the mainstream media. And it does so by casting actors from the community it represents, initially holding open castings for kids who’d never acted before, until – by season two of its Channel 4 run – they were swamped by thousands of applicants. Casting agent Des Hamilton’s dedication to giving roles to actors with no previous experience saw him win the first ever Bafta for scripted casting. “That’s what I’m proudest of,” says Walters. “Top Boy is creating careers for people who wouldn’t otherwise have had that opportunity. You get to see new actors coming into the show, watch them flourish. That’s always been important to us.” Top Boy has launched the careers of Letitia Wright, Michaela Coel and last season’s breakout, Bafta Rising Star award-winner Micheal Ward, who has since worked with Steve McQueen on Small Axe and acted with Sharon Stone. This season, it looks set to do the same for Jobson. “Top Boy has opened so many doors for me,” she says. “But I didn’t get into acting to win awards. It’s so important that we’re showing issues like gentrification because I honestly couldn’t tell you how many estates from areas I grew up in are no longer there. It’s heartbreaking. Sometimes that’s all people know – it’s where they’ve lived their whole lives, where their whole family grew up.” Jobson’s journey to acting via her background in care was not only made possible by Top Boy but also inspired by it, in particular Wright’s shift into the Marvel universe. “Letitia is definitely a big inspiration for me. She comes from nothing. She was the lead girl in Top Boy – and now she’s smashing it.” And what about Robinson and Walters, who have been with the show from the start – when will they get their Hollywood break? “I don’t know, man,” says Robinson. “I just want to do what I believe in. Top Boy suits me artistically. If I come across another project I believe in, I’ll give it a look. But it’s not something I’m chasing.” Shunning Hollywood? Perhaps we shouldn’t be too surprised. After all, Robinson does star in Top Boy, the show that refused Drake a cameo.

2/25/2022,"Formula One has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix after the state’s invasion of Ukraine. The sport did not issue any condemnation of Russia but cited the “impossibility” of holding the race under the current circumstances. The meeting was set to take place on 25 September and as things stand F1 has made no suggestion of which country might replace the meeting. Turkey has been mooted as a potential replacement having been used twice in the last two years, stepping in for races cancelled due to the Covid pandemic but F1 is understood to not be considering the Istanbul Park Circuit as an option this time. On Thursday evening F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali held a meeting with the team principals and the FIA to discuss the Russian GP, with clear, widespread opinion that the sport could not go to Russia while it engaged in an invasion of Ukraine. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner had described the idea of going to Russia as simply untenable and the world champion Max Verstappen had decried the idea of going racing in a country that had declared war on a neighbouring state. Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to declare he would boycott the race if it went ahead. A statement from F1 read: “The FIA Formula 1 World Championship visits countries all over the world with a positive vision to unite people, bringing nations together. We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation. On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances.” On Friday Uefa dropped Russia as host of the Champions League final in St Petersburg, replacing it with the Stade de France in Paris. The teams are completing the third and final day of their first test in Barcelona on Friday, where the Haas team removed the Russian flag-based livery of its title sponsor Uralkali from their cars, trucks and motorhomes. Uralkali is a Russian chemical company with Dmitry Mazepin as deputy chairman of the Uralkali board and Uralchem CEO. He is the father of Haas driver Nikita Mazepin and is an associate of Vladimir Putin, attending the Kremlin for a meeting called by Putin on Thursday. The future of the team’s association with Uralkali remains in doubt, according to sanctions that may be imposed, raising questions over the team’s financial stability. Michael Schumacher’s son, Mick, is currently entering his second season in F1 with Haas. Equally Mazepin’s status as a driver may be under threat with the potential for visa bans being imposed on Russian nationals. Only three countries that host F1 meetings currently admit Russians without a visa, Azerbaijan, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. The Haas owner Gene Haas was at the Circuit de Catalunya on Friday with the team principal, Guenther Steiner, who insisted the team were not at risk should they end their association with Uralkali, a decision on which would be made in the next few weeks. “It is a headache but it’s not something that disturbs the team,” he said. “Financially we are OK. It has no implementation on the team, how we are running, how we plan the season, there are more ways to get the funding, we have no issues with that.” Steiner did concede that he was unaware how the removal of Russia from the Swift payment network, should it occur, would affect the team but was expectant they were well placed to work around any issues and be ready to compete at the first race of the season in Bahrain on 20 March. “We had to take a decision and I think this was the right decision to take,” he said of removing the Uralkali sponsorship in Barcelona. “There is no setback on the competition side of the team because of this, we just need to go through the commercial issues and we will go through that in the next few weeks but it is a to-do list, nothing more.”",Sport/Sport,Russian F1 GP cancelled and may switch to Turkey after Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/russian-grand-prix-set-for-switch-turkey-after-ukraine-invasion-motor-sport-formula-one-f1
2/25/2022,"Up in the posh seats, one extremely astute judge of talent was watching with interest. Chelsea were taking on Al-Hilal in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup and, as far as Arsène Wenger was concerned, the chance to have a close look at Kai Havertz was not to be missed. For those near Wenger at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, it was impossible not to notice how much the former Arsenal manager appreciated Havertz’s game: the elusive movement, the way he kept popping up in unexpected positions, the sense that the Chelsea attacker was always on the verge of producing something special. But it never quite happened for the young German. When he charged down the left and lifted a cross into the area in the 32nd minute, it required a defensive mix-up from Al-Hilal to gift Romelu Lukaku the winning goal. Then, when the former Bayer Leveruksen player tore through midway through the second half, he hit the post when he had the chance to score a magnificent solo goal. It was another one of those nearly moments from Havertz. Sometimes it seems his curse is almost scoring great goals. He can be indulgent with his finishing and for all his elegant movement there are times when he seems reluctant to push the limits, which has stopped him from becoming a more dominant figure for Chelsea. Nonetheless the depth of Havertz’s ability is obvious. Wenger glimpsed it from afar and Thomas Tuchel has seen it up close. So, too, have Havertz’s Chelsea teammates. They had faith even when he was struggling to adapt to English football last season. Seasoned players saw in training that Havertz was capable of moments of individual brilliance. Yet he remains a work in progress: a £62m star who finds himself in the weird position of having secured his place in Chelsea’s history, only to find that nobody is quite sure whether he is going to make the most of his vast potential. Havertz’s time at Chelsea has not been spectacular, but it has been special. It is not clear whether he is best as a false nine or a classic No 10. But what do you focus on more? The disappointment of six goals in 44 league appearances or the glory of scoring the winner against Manchester City in last season’s Champions League final? An inability to become a mandatory pick or the nerveless penalty that saw off Palmeiras when Chelsea became world champions for the first time this month? The positive take is that Havertz, now 22, thrives under pressure. Based on his big-game record, he should be in his element when Chelsea face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. Havertz has already scored against Jürgen Klopp’s side this season – a clever header in front of the Kop last August – and Chelsea are more fluid and aggressive when he is up front instead of Lukaku, who was dropped against Lille last Tuesday. Havertz took his chance against Lille. He pressed energetically, moved cleverly, linked the play and scored a good goal, so there is little reason for Tuchel to restore Lukaku to the lineup on Sunday. However Havertz’s inconsistency means there are no guarantees he will rise to the occasion. He has not developed the relentlessness of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, whose productivity puts Chelsea’s misfiring forwards to shame. This could be a galling experience for the Chelsea hierarchy. They have decent attacking players, but none belong to the elite. There is, as one staff member privately acknowledged this season, nobody in the class of Salah or Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. That, of course, is on Chelsea. “Thanks, José!” was how one figure put it recently, pointing out that Mourinho, during his second spell at Stamford Bridge, sold two players who are now among the Premier League’s best. Salah was 21 when Chelsea signed him from Basel in 2014. The Egyptian was exciting but Mourinho did not take to him or De Bruyne. Both were banished to the sidelines and players from that era remember feeling embarrassed by Mourinho’s treatment of Salah. Chelsea cannot head down that path again. This is the first time they will have faced Salah in a major final and one look at him in a red shirt should be enough to convince them not to let Liverpool profit from their impatience again. Of course, too many expensive forwards are underperforming at Chelsea and it is not a surprise that some have grown unhappy. It is not just about Lukaku, who is probably going nowhere given that he cost £97.5m last summer. Tuchel also has to think about Timo Werner, who would probably benefit from a change of scenery, and there could be another difficult conversation if Christian Pulisic wants to leave. Pulisic, under contract until 2024, could well turn out to be another Salah. The 23-year-old has not lived up to the hype since his £58m move from Borussia Dortmund in 2019 but he is not a lost cause. The American is a dynamic threat when confident and his goal against Lille, who could not handle his speed and directness, was a reminder of what he can do when fully fit. These are complicated times for Chelsea. The summer could bring change but the memory of losing Salah and De Bruyne adds a layer of intrigue to the decision-making process. It is a cautionary tale; one that tells Chelsea it would be wise to give Havertz room to grow. He has not pushed on as expected after his heroics against City last May, but he is heading in the right direction. After all, one of the reasons Chelsea have made it to Wembley is because of Havertz scoring in the semi-final against Tottenham. Maybe Arsène still knows.",Sport/Football,Chelsea need Kai Havertz to start being more than their sometimes man | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/chelsea-kai-havertz-carabao-cup-final-sometimes-man
2/25/2022,"An estimated 450 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict in Ukraine so far and Vladimir Putin failed in his military objectives on the first day of fighting, the UK defence secretary has said. Wallace also rebuffed pleas from Ukrainian and some Conservative politicians for the UK to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, arguing that introducing one would amount to declaring war on Russia. “Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hoped-for timetable,” Wallace told Sky News. “They have lost over 450 personnel. One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz [special forces] has failed to be taken. In fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back. “So, I think contrary to great Russian claims, and indeed President Putin’s sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause – he’s got that completely wrong. The Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective.”In a later exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Wallace for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”. However Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response, and result in “war across Europe” as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members.Wallace said: “To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.”He added: “I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.” Vasylenko warned that Europe is already at war, since “if Ukraine is allowed to fall others will follow”, and other democratic nations should seek to protect a fellow sovereign country. “What you are witnessing is a restructuring of the defence and security framework we are so used to,” she said. She said present sanctions were “not enough” and Ukrainians were disappointed by the lack of support. “We are going into over 24 hours of full-on war with the biggest military power in Europe and still nothing.” Later in the House of Commons, James Heappey, a junior defence minister, said the UK would send extra troops to Estonia “earlier than planned” to reinforce the Nato ally in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in Estonia to double force levels in the country, he said. Heappey also echoed warnings against any potential clash between Russian and Nato troops, saying it could become “existential”. “We must all in this house be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine,” he said. “We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily.” What is it? Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals. Who owns it? Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Why would a Swift ban be so serious? Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban? One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. Wallace said the UK had supported accelerating Ukraine’s Nato membership, which would have triggered military intervention from fellow members, but that other countries had been concerned by the pace.He added that other democratic countries have a “moral duty” to continue to arm the Ukrainian forces since it is widely acknowledged that Putin “won’t stop at Ukraine” and will train his sights on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after, since he “doesn’t believe the Baltic states are countries”.He told Sky News: “What you’re seeing on your cameras today is illogical. Putin didn’t need to do this, he didn’t need to occupy a sovereign country. None of the reasons why he would do that stack up. He’s not doing something that’s logical, he’s doing something about his ego and his legacy.” In that interview, he added that Putin and Russian military commanders of all rankings “will be held responsible” for their involvement. “Putin has to fail … because he’s fighting our values and all the human rights that we stand for. I don’t know if he’ll fail in Ukraine, we’ll do everything to make sure he does, but if he doesn’t we’ll make sure he fails after that.”",News/World news,"Russian army failed to deliver key military goals on day one, says Ben Wallace",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/putin-ukraine-russian-army-failed-to-deliver-key-military-goals-day-one-ben-wallace
2/25/2022,"A subsidiary of Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB, has been suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange after the UK’s imposition of sanctions over Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The London Stock Exchange Group said on Friday it had suspended VTB Capital’s membership with immediate effect, meaning it can no longer trade on the LSE. The move comes after Boris Johnson announced what he called the “largest ever” range of sanctions against Russian firms and individuals, freezing the assets of all the main Russian banks, including VTB. VTB, which is majority owned by the state and has interests in banking assets across eastern Europe, has assets totalling £154bn. Legislation is expected to be tabled next week to ban major Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to prevent Moscow from raising sovereign debt in London. “Sanctions are a reality for us over the last few years and another round of politically motivated anti-Russian sanctions did not come as a surprise,” VTB said in a statement. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, explained the significance of the stock exchange’s move. “You have to be a member of the LSE to trade on it, so if VTB Capital’s membership has been suspended it will not be to able to trade in secondary markets in equities, bonds, derivatives, ETFs and any other instruments offered on the LSE platform, or, presumably, raise capital for other firms (or the Russian state) via its primary/advisory arms. “This does not mean VTB, the parent, cannot lend or have a presence in London or that its stock be suspended – although VTB Capital won’t be able to trade in any stock or debt or derivative instruments related to the parent, I would assume.” VTB has its primary listing on Russia’s MOEX stock market. It maintains a secondary listing in London, where investors can trade in Global Depositary Receipts each equivalent to 2,000 ordinary VTB shares, which has not been affected by the suspension order on subsidiary VTB Capital. There are a number of VTB executives, and those with links to the bank, who feature in the government’s list of individuals against whom it has levelled sanctions. These include VTB’s president-chair, Andrey Kostin, who is also a member of the supreme council of the United Russia political party, as well as high-ranking executives Andrey Puchkov and Yuri Alekseyevich Soloviev. Denis Bortnikov, the deputy chair of VTB Bank’s management board, is also on the sanctions list. He is a deputy president of VTB Bank and chair of its management board. As well as this, he is the son of Aleksandr Bortnikov, a director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who has been on the sanctions list since March 2021. Russian politicians involved with the bank who also feature on the sanctions list include the deputy prime minister and chief of the government staff, Dmitry Grigorenko, who is chair of the supervisory council of VTB Bank. As a former director of the Russian tax service, he set up a new tax system in Crimea after its annexation. Also featured is Maxim Reshetnikov, the minister of economic development, who is a member of the supervisory council of the VTB Bank.",News/Business,Russia’s VTB Capital suspended from London Stock Exchange,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/russia-vtb-capital-suspended-london-stock-exchange

It said that export facilities at the port of Pivdennyi in the south-west of Ukraine have been “temporarily suspended following notification from the port authorities”. The company said: “As a result, the group’s marketing department has issued force majeure notices to certain customers that were due to receive the group’s products via oceangoing vessels in the near term.” The group, which on Thursday said that the Ukrainian government had suspended rail transportation, said its mining operations near the city of Horishni Plavni in central Ukraine, were continuing to operate. “The group has the ability to stockpile its iron ore pellets at site while Ukraine’s logistic networks continue to experience disruption,” the company said. “The group’s continued primary focus remains the safety of its workforce in Ukraine.” Ferrexpo shares were down 2% in London on Friday morning.

2/25/2022,"The news came as a surprise to many in Beijing. Barely 24 hours ago, Chinese pundits predicted that a war in Ukraine was not inevitable. In New York, as Russia geared up for a full-on assault on its neighbour, China’s UN envoy, Zhang Jun, urged in a security council meeting that “the door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, nor should it be shut”. But when people in Kyiv woke up to sound of bombs in what the Nato chief called a “deliberate, cold-blooded” invasion, the door had clearly been closed. China’s state media, however, insisted it was a “special military action” by Russia. Quoting Vladimir Putin, China’s central television tweeted: “Russia was left with no other choice.” Chinese netizens were fascinated by Russia’s move. Three weeks ago, Putin was the guest of honour at the Beijing Winter Olympics. On 4 February, he and Xi Jinping pledged that there would be “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” in their bilateral relationship. On Thursday, millions took to the social media site Weibo to discuss it. So much so, a new phrase was coined: Wu Xin Gong Zuo（乌心工作）to describe those who were so concerned with the situation in Ukraine they could not focus on work. The reality on the ground contrasted with the official Chinese media narrative, yet it also offered a glimpse into the tightrope Beijing is walking. On Thursday, as she refused to use the word “invasion” to describe Russia’s action, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, also indicated that China would not provide arms to Russia. “I believe that as a strong country, Russia doesn’t need China or other countries to provide weapons to it,” she said. In his call with Putin on Friday, Xi reiterated that China “respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations” and called for negotiations to resolve the issue. Putin, according to a Chinese readout, said he was “willing to conduct high-level talks with Ukraine”. Bonny Lin, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, said “Besides China’s effort to balance its various goals, all indications point to the fact that China prioritises its relationship with Russia at the moment,”adding that Moscow’s action also posed a problem for Beijing. In public, Beijing advocates the position that sovereignty is sacrosanct. This is a discourse it often deploys when it talks about Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province. On the other hand, the Ukraine crisis offers Beijing the opportunity to express grievances against its common adversaries with Russia: the US and Nato. So far, the latter appears to be weighing heavier in Beijing’s messaging. This explains why Hua on Thursday invoked the memories of a diplomatic incident from more than 20 years ago. On 7 May 1999, Nato missiles struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and set it ablaze in a predawn strike, killing three Chinese nationals. The US claimed it was a “mistake” caused by an out-of-date map, but China was never convinced. “Chinese elites operate in a way that political gains can be prioritised over economic gains,” according to Zeno Leoni, a defence expert at King’s College London. “Right now China’s political goal is to weaken the US-led liberal order. This means that it could accept some economic disruption and continue to publicly support Russia – a marriage of convenience – for the sake of a political objective.” Lin said the further escalation of events was likely to worsen China’s relationship with the US and the EU and push countries such as Japan and Australia further away from China. “In the near term, China will be impacted by secondary sanctions and these costs for China will likely increase as the situation in Ukraine deteriorates.” In unveiling the latest round of sanctions on Thursday, Joe Biden took a swipe at Beijing, saying any country that backed Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine would be “stained by association”. “Putin will be a pariah on the international stage,” he declared. The impression will further deepen as China on the same day announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports. But Leoni said that if military tensions were to escalate across Europe – where China has major economic interests – Beijing’s attitude might still change. “We have seen recently how both Nato’s and Russia’s naval assets have been positioning or involved in trainings in the Mediterranean Sea: Beijing might change its calculus about Russia should military hostilities extend, even mildly, to this region where the bulk of China’s trade with Europe travels through.” Western leaders are alarmed by Beijing’s response as they see the implications for the US-led postwar world order being fundamentally reshaped as a result of Russia’s action. “What we need to make sure in our response today is that we don’t just have a tactical response … But we have a long-term response to the threat to the democratic order,” Jeremy Hunt, a former British foreign secretary, told BBC Radio 4. “There are now two very big powers, Russia and China, that are absolutely committed to upending that order. And that is why we have to think long and hard and smart about what to do next.” Beijing is aware of the diplomatic fallout such a response would cause. But a government researcher, who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter, quipped: “Even if China joined the west in sanctioning Russia or criticising Russia, will the US-China relations improve?” “We don’t want to face such a difficult choice, either,” he added, admitting Beijing’s dilemma but insisting its policy had to be pragmatic. “After all, China and Russia share a 4,000km-long border. In the long run, China has to be on good terms with Russia.” To realist Chinese foreign policy thinkers, geography and history continue to be relevant in their reasoning of the new world order. The deadly Soviet-China border conflict in 1969 still casts a shadow for Beijing particularly as Biden frames America’s China challenge as “democracy v autocracy”. “We are in the middle of massive changes [in geopolitics] and if you look around, many countries have been adventurous in recent years. For China, it is an opportunity as well as a challenge,” the Beijing- based government researcher said. “Adding the pandemic factor, it’s going to be very chaotic in the years to come.”",News/World news,China ponders how Russia’s actions in Ukraine could reshape world order ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/china-ponders-how-russia-actions-ukraine-reshape-world-order
2/25/2022,"From yams to chocho to ackee, a new exhibition is shining a light on south London’s Caribbean gardens, created by the Windrush generation who moved to Britain after the second world war. The Sowing Roots exhibition at the Garden Museum in Lambeth explores how Caribbean horticultural heritage has enriched British gardening. It tells the stories of 15 individuals through interview extracts, photographs and artefacts – including a pair of dirty gardening gloves, horticulture books and herbal teas. The idea for the exhibition came after the Windrush scandal in 2018, which exposed how thousands of Caribbean people who had been invited to the UK as British citizens had been wrongly targeted with deportation. The exhibition looks at how cultivating land has helped Caribbean communities to feel at home and rooted in the UK. “The resulting oral histories shed light on the varied traditions that Caribbean people carried with them when they moved to Britain,” a panel at the start of the exhibition reads. “We hope to have unearthed the inventiveness, creativity and power at the heart of Caribbean gardening that has shaped families, communities and empire across time and space.” Through gardening, people in the diaspora have been able to connect with their cultural heritage. “The exhibition filled the spot for me, and I know for many gardeners of colour. It’s shone a light on what we’ve been doing for a long time, and given us a little platform,” says Ras Prince Morgan, who was born in Rock River in Clarendon, Jamaica, and migrated to London in 1969 when he was seven years old. Morgan created his garden 16 years ago on disused land filled with Japanese knotweed on the edge of playing fields in Lewisham, south-east London. He initially just wanted to grow some fruit trees so his children would know where their food came from; now he grows plants from all over the world and runs horticultural and educational projects. One of Morgan’s inspirations is Alan Titchmarsh. He loves London’s Kew and Hampton Court Gardens, the Eden Project in Cornwall, and many other European-led institutions, but is frustrated by the lack of visibility of Africans involved in creating this rich history. “Gardening has been such a very European-led institution,” he says. “It paints the picture that Africans were never involved, but that is the furthest thing from the truth. It’s only when you do your research, then you realise we were the backbone of the industry. [White people] were in control, passing the orders and instructions down the line, where we were to carry them out.” Part of Morgan’s motivation for growing things was to increase diversity in gardening in the UK. He now has more than 10 volunteers helping him, and most are people of colour. He has noticed the climate getting warmer over the past 10 years, meaning he is able to grow more heat-loving plants outside, such as bananas, avocados, sugar cane and angel’s trumpet. “I grew yam on my veranda and had dinner from it. That just blew my mind. People say you can’t grow yam over here, it’s not hot enough, but I grew a piece of yam on my veranda!” he says. Morgan gardens according to the cycles of the moon and uses a horoscope book called Old Moore’s Almanack, which has information on lunar rising and setting times and when is the right time to plant what. His mother – and probably his grandmother too – used the same book. Another story included in the exhibition is that of Earline Hilda Castillo Binger, who was born in Trinidad and moved to the UK in 1971 and became a nurse. She is now a community gardener and leads gardening sessions on land belonging to GP surgeries in Lambeth. “There’s a bush for everything. Every ailment you have, there’s a bush,” she says in her interview for the exhibition. “You know, this gardening has taken me on a journey, a very interesting journey.” Subsistence and small-scale farming occupies a unique place in the history of Caribbean peoples, says historian Dr Elizabeth Cooper, who curated the exhibition. “Sowing Roots taps into this history and the ways that migrants from the Caribbean carried meanings and traditions of gardening with them when they moved to the UK – and in turn transformed the uses and meanings of green spaces in south London,” she says.

2/25/2022,"Orford Ness is a narrow shingle and marsh spit off the Suffolk coastline that “speaks gull, speaks wave, speaks bracken & lapwing, speaks bullet, ruin, gale, deception”. Now a nature reserve, it was previously the site of secret military activity from the first world war onwards, and retains the squat concrete structures that were used for military testing during the cold war. Narrated with great seriousness and portent by actor Stephen Dillane, Ness – a collaboration between nature writer Robert Macfarlane and artist Stanley Donwood – is a wonderfully weird prose poem and ecological parable in which a group of scientists including the Armourer, the Physicist, the Engineer and the Ornithologist gather at the decaying concrete Green Chapel. There they sing a hymn of ruination called “The Firing Song” and plot the end of the world. Meanwhile, five natural forces called “it”, “he”, “she”, “they” and “us” converge on the chapel to reclaim the land and avert catastrophe. “She” comprises lichen, moss and fungi; “it” is drift, with plastic bones and a body of pallet slat and bottle tops held together with fishing line. Listeners of Ness will miss out on Donwood’s eerie pen-and-ink drawings, but they gain a gently sinister score courtesy of composer Hugh Brunt, recorded at London’s Abbey Road studios. With its mythical atmosphere and rhythmic pleas to “Listen to the pasts of Ness. Listen inland to the long-gone wood, which rings with the cries of wildcat & brock, heorte & hind, doe & bocke”, this is a work that is best heard out loud.

2/25/2022,"On a bright, lunchtime drive to Haywards in Epping, I thought how, over recent years, Essex has transformed as a lifestyle concept. Essex folk doing “Essexy” things – winebars, brunch, nail appointments, wearing leather leggings – is the winning formula for multiple award-winning TV shows. Rarely, however, do we see Essex’s fancier fine-dining side, which is a shame as the county excels at fantastic, old-school, multi-course, finesse-in-heaps hospitality, with places such as Dunmow, Dedham, Chatham Green and Bell Common all being destination dining spots for earnest foodie types. Essex hospitality’s bigger problem, of course, is it’s just too darn close to Soho, where the fine-dining scene transmogrifies weekly, overshadowing the likes of chef Jahdre Hayward, his wife Amanda and his small, friendly team. This is a great shame, because since Haywards opened in 2013, people who love a good lunch have pointed me there, talking of a renovated coach house and skittle alley, close to a 17th century pub, serving ornate plates of venison with parsnip and quince or fig with Pedro Ximénez souffle. During the grimmest days of the pandemic, I wondered if independents like Haywards could remain afloat, so it was pleasing to enter its dining room of a Friday noon and be reminded how many ladies who like a three-course lunch live in the environs of Epping Forest, because it was fizzing with the kind of gossip about errant grandchildren and neighbourhood disputes that makes me want to pull up a chair and say things like: “She didn’t?” and “Not with those ankles”. Stylewise, Haywards felt, and I mean this in the nicest sense, like being on the set of MasterChef: the Professionals – a pale room with strategic pops of tasteful marine blue, a wooden floor, single flowers in rectangular mini-vases, unframed aerial friezes of the countryside on the walls and a grey menu where the modern-European fine dining is revealed with scant clues as to how it may look; eg: “monkfish, leek, mussels”. On telly, this gives Jay Rayner and me the opportunity to explain airily how we expect the dish to look, only to be heroically wrong when our lunch finally bowls in. We opted for three courses from the small, yet meaningful à la carte, kicking off with a very good, fresh-from-the-oven sourdough loaf and a plentiful wodge of salted butter, plus a surprise of veloute of pumpkin and a crisp, aerated cod-skin cracker dotted with delicate taramasalata, perched on rocks. By this stage, I knew Haywards was a great choice. It may not be as throbbingly of-the-moment as the newest multi-million-pound London or Lake District venture, but it has assured, ambitious dishes, using stellar produce, served by warm-hearted ladies whose feet never seem to touch the floor. A starter of glorious cured mackerel arrived, skin glossy, flanked by puddles of mackerel tartare in a clear dashi broth, made pretty with radish. A starter of quail was both roast breast and confit leg with crisp skin, a poached quail egg arranged dreamily around heavenly artichoke puree and deeply moreish pickled mushrooms. Things only got brighter over mains with a beguiling plate of roast lamb rump, crisp belly and croquette of shank, with aubergine puree. Unusually for restaurants like this, Haywards offered a plentiful side dish filled with steamed carrots, baby potatoes and hispi cabbage, lest anyone grumble that they left hungry. Oh how I have quietly pined for a potato at some world-class restaurants. Not here. The hero dish was a roast loin of venison, with a homemade venison sausage surrounded by satellites of quince puree and shooting stars of roast artichoke. A further mini-saucepan of venison ragu appeared to spoon over the buttered baby potatoes and add to the fun. Having eshewed booze and drunk only quince and ginger fizz, I had the perfect right to order a souffle all to myself. Tired of souffle, tired of life, I say. There will never be a time anyone presents me with one of these wobbly, featherlight highlights of pudding architecture and I don’t react like the Queen if you show her a racehorse. “Souffle,” I will gasp, as I did when a cream-coloured fig-flavoured souffle with caramel quivered as it neared my table, bringing along its friend, fresh almond ice-cream. It was five spoons of ecstasy that will rule me out of ever wearing leather leggings – without having to be cut out of them two minutes later in a changing room – but it was absolutely worth it. Haywards wasn’t the coolest, newest or the most experimental place I ate at during that week, but it lives on in my memory as fantastic, and that makes all the difference.

Portrait of a Man by Hans Baldung Grien, 1514You can see age and decay starting to eat at this portrait. It’s not just the sharply observed face of the unknown man with his time-hewn skin and the grey in his beard and hair. In spite of the gold insignia that he wears, his fur collar looks a little the worse for wear. Perhaps this is not much. But the strange sheen of that hair is vividly reminiscent of Hans Baldung Grien’s similarly silvery images in other works including pictures of witches at the sabbath, or his painting The Ages of Woman and Death, in the Prado. There too, aged hair is emphasised – including the horrible matted hair of a skeleton that holds an hourglass. Here, with terrible irony, the man’s name is lost but the year is known, 1514, as his time ticks away. This is a subtle and self-controlled, yet haunting image by an artist just about holding his macabre imagination in check. National Gallery, London To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

2/25/2022,"UK airlines face higher fuel costs and longer journey times on flights to Asia and beyond after Russia banned British carriers from its airspace. The move came in swift response to Boris Johnson’s decision to ban Russian national carrier Aeroflot from landing in the UK as part of a range of new sanctions against Moscow. British Airways, the only UK airline flying to Moscow prior to the ban, said it was warning customers that some flights to destinations east of Russia would now take longer due to rerouting. BA usually operates three flights a week to the Russian capital but does not fly to any other destinations in Russia or Ukraine. The retaliatory move from Russia will increase already escalating jet fuel costs and pose more headaches for the national carrier’s long-haul services. A BA spokesperson said: “We apologise for the inconvenience but this is clearly a matter beyond our control. We are notifying customers on cancelled services and are offering a full refund. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely.” Virgin Atlantic said that the flight ban would increase flight times to India and Pakistan by up to an hour. The airline had decided from Thursday evening to avoid Russian airspace before Moscow’s edict confirming the ban. A spokesperson said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers by slightly longer flight times. “The safety and security of our customers and people always comes first and we’re monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia extremely carefully following the escalation of conflict, continuing to operate in full compliance with relevant safety regulators, authorities and governments.” The longer flight paths will affect four Virgin routes, between London Heathrow to Islamabad, Lahore and Delhi, and between Manchester and Islamabad. Virgin has not flown in Ukraine airspace since 2014, on its own risk assessments, above and beyond official guidance, and said it had further increased distances from the hostilities at the Russia-Ukraine border since December. All airlines remain acutely conscious of the fate of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine in 2014 by what investigators concluded was a Russian-made missile fired by pro-Moscow forces, killing all 298 people aboard. The US and the EU have yet to follow suit on any flight ban. Aeroflot currently operates as part of the SkyTeam alliance, and has codeshare flights in and out of the US with Delta. Wizz and Ryanair were the only airlines operating direct flights from Ukraine to the UK. All flights have been suspended.

2/25/2022,"About 5,000 miles away from the violence in Ukraine, shock waves from Russia’s invasion are being felt in Taiwan. Until recently, Taiwan was considered to be one of the world’s most significant potential flashpoints for a multination war. It was heralded – albeit with some exaggeration – as “the most dangerous place on Earth”, under growing threat of invasion by Xi Jinping’s China, which considers the independently governed democracy to be a Chinese province. This week its people have watched their fears play out in eastern Europe, as Russian forces – ordered by Xi’s ally Vladimir Putin – attacked in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday. The invasion prompted solidarity from Taiwan. The government proclaimed it stood with Ukraine, and announced unspecified economic sanctions against Russia. “The principle of self-determination cannot be erased by brute force,” said Taiwan’s vice-president, Lai Ching-te. It also prompted fear. There is speculation about whether Beijing might use this crisis to make its move, while the world is focused on Ukraine. “China may think about using military action against Taiwan at any moment,” Taiwan’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said earlier this month. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, warned “the shock will echo around the world” if Ukraine was endangered, specifically citing Taiwan. On Thursday, Beijing sent nine warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence zone – a slightly larger than average sortie among the near daily incursions of the last two years. On Wednesday, President Tsai Ing-wen ordered Taiwan’s military and national security apparatus to boost its defences, surveillance, and early warning systems, and to strengthen its already sophisticated responses to cognitive warfare. Analysts and China watchers say it is unlikely an attack is imminent. This year is politically sensitive for Xi with a once-in-five-years leadership congress, and Taiwan is both more easily defended than Ukraine and more important – strategically and economically – to world powers such as the US. “The Chinese leadership continues to emphasise that time is on China’s side for cross strait [unification], that trends are favouring China,” says Brookings Institute scholar on China and Asia, Ryan Hass. “That’s an alibi for maintaining the status quo throughout a turbulent year.” But J Michael Cole, a Taiwan-based China expert, warns there is a danger in assuming autocratic leaders like Putin and Xi are making decisions rationally. “The unimaginable is possible, even if, from our perspective, taking action, in this case launching a war of choice despite the threat of major sanctions, seems irrational.” In Taiwan feelings are mixed. The crisis has raised questions about Taiwan’s preparedness and the commitment of its friends. The threat of invasion has loomed for decades, but when the day comes Taiwan will need help to survive, and so people are watching closely how the international community is responding to Ukraine. In the bustle of a Taipei morning market, women are flitting from stall to stall, filling their trolley bags with produce, while sellers shout across the lanes to each other. Bebe, a fruit and vegetable seller, is unloading bags of cabbages from a blue truck onto her bicycle. It is a busy day before the long weekend, but Ukraine is at the top of her mind. “I’m really concerned about it,” she says from behind a wide straw hat and a face mask bearing the flags of Taiwan, the US, Lithuania, and Japan, with the message: “Thank you my friends.” “I don’t know if the US is strong enough to help protect Ukraine, so of course I worry about Taiwan.” Lannie, a 20-year-old student, says she fears that China appears to be helping Russia, and that could mean Russia helps China later on. “I don’t think we will have war today, but now I see everything happening I’m a little bit worried.” The moment is a litmus test for the US, several analysts say. “If the US is perceived as indecisive or incoherent or otherwise indifferent to western Europe’s concern about Russia, then that may diminish western Europe’s intention and willingness to help the US in the Indo-Pacific theatre as well,” says Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University. Several analysts argue that this week is a wake-up call for all western governments that have been strong on the rhetoric about Taiwan but haven’t yet really had to act. “International volatility is compelling countries to speak out more clearly about the importance they attach to Taiwan security,” says Hass. “To a certain extent events are providing a bit of a catalyst for coordination.” Online, many Taiwanese commenters fear those governments have already shown how far they are willing to go, and it is not enough. “I just hope that the president will strengthen Taiwan’s national defence,” wrote one person on Tsai’s Facebook page. “[In Ukraine] many big countries have done nothing at all except for sanctioning and praying! These countries are unreliable.” Taiwan’s military is no match for China’s despite billions of dollars in arms purchases from the US. Civilian urban warfare training programmes, similar to those that Ukrainians were filmed practising this week, are still in pilot mode. On Taiwan’s north-east coast in Yilan, a Ukrainian restaurant owner, Sergei Balagov, is watching the invasion of his home from afar. Balagov’s family are still there: a nephew is in Kharkiv, one of the first cities targeted, an uncle and aunt elsewhere in Ukraine. His brother is in Russia. “People are ready to meet the invaders,” he says just hours before Russian missiles hit Ukraine. He fears Taiwan’s people are not. “My feeling is the situation will change drastically in their mind if there are invaders stepping on their country and try to force their will,” he says. “But they need to be more able to fight. Right now … they are quite laid back.” Recent polling tends to support his concern. A survey taken just prior to the invasion showed more than half of respondents did not fear a war over Ukraine, and 63% did not think Xi would use the distraction to move on Taiwan. Cole says the crisis could make the threat of war less abstract to the Taiwanese public, and the government should use it to push for a viable reserve force and to encourage citizens to “perhaps dedicate a few weeks/months of their time learning skills that would come in handy in time of emergency”. Bebe believes it is up to Taiwan to defend itself. “Don’t depend on other nations,” she says, putting her faith in “a strong president” and the will of the people “to protect our country”. “Taiwan is not China. Absolutely not. That’s very important.”",News/World news,‘Of course I worry’: shock waves from Ukraine reach Taiwan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/of-course-i-worry-shockwaves-from-ukraine-reach-taiwan
2/25/2022,"Recently appointed associate artist with the London Symphony Orchestra, soprano-conductor Barbara Hannigan has made much of her dual role, often singing and conducting simultaneously, with uneven results, both live and on disc. Her latest venture, first unveiled in Paris in January last year, juxtaposes Strauss’s Metamorphosen with a multimedia version of La Voix Humaine, Poulenc’s one-act opera depicting the final phone conversation between a desperate woman, Elle (“She”), and the unseen lover who is dumping her for someone else. Her take on the work is idiosyncratic. At several points, Elle admits to lying, and Hannigan, in a video talk before her performance, posits the idea that the opera itself is a lie, arguing that Elle’s lover doesn’t really exist, and that “all this is a fantasy in her mind”. She notes Elle’s need to control her world, much as she herself controls the orchestra. “Perhaps she imagines that she is me,” she tells us. Hannigan conducts and sings the opera largely with her back to us, while live footage of her face and torso, directed by Clemens Malinowski, is projected from multiple platform cameras on to a large screen behind the orchestra. Rhythmic gestures are dramatically integrated as she pounds the air in fury at a crossed line on her now nonexistent phone, or claws her face in self-pity. Though she is amplified, the role suits her well vocally, and there is plenty of the underlying orchestral sensuality that Poulenc demanded. Yet it remains misguided. Conducting yourself on film seems quite literally self-regarding, I’m afraid. And if Elle’s lover doesn’t exist then Poulenc’s heroine becomes a delusional narcissist, which plays havoc with the balance of sympathies. Video was also promised for Metamorphosen, but didn’t, for whatever reason, materialise. Strauss’s great lament for the collapse of European culture in the last days of the second world war needs no visual accompaniment, and in this instance gained terrible resonance from being played on the day of the invasion of Ukraine. The performance, though, was overly restrained and understated, rarely attaining the harrowing immediacy the work ideally needs, which was a shame.",Arts/Music,LSO/Barbara Hannigan review – playing havoc with the balance of sympathies,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/25/lso-barbara-hannigan-review-barbican-london
2/25/2022,"What a difference a week makes. Burnley have gone from the darkest depths of the table to three points from safety in the space of two brilliant performances. Sean Dyche’s side seemed to have forgotten themselves but Wout Weghorst’s destruction of Brighton and a masterful 1-0 over an over-confident Tottenham has them back grinding for survival. A third successive win (last seen in April 2019) could incredibly move them out of danger. So can Crystal Palace survive an encounter with this reconfigured behemoth? Patrick Vieira’s only recent successes have come when punching down and after putting four past Watford the Frenchman will hope he has found an attacking combination that truly clicks after Palace’s early fire appeared extinguished.

2/25/2022,"Slowly, we are returning to something resembling a pre-Covid state. In England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales at least, the final remaining restrictions have been lifted, or are likely to be lifted in the coming weeks. Offices are filling up, the queues at your chosen sandwich shop chain are getting longer, and for many the dreaded commute to work has returned. Which, in turn – for some of us – means the return of something else: the strange looks from other commuters as we try (and fail) not to laugh at podcasts. I felt that familiar rush of embarrassment earlier this week when, on The Always Sunny Podcast, Rob McElhenney recalled how, as a child, his mother would spray him with vinegar at the beach. I’m still not entirely sure why McElhenney’s mother sprayed him with vinegar on the beach – something to do with horseflies I think – but his description, and the comedic savaging he received from co-hosts Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day started me snorting. The Always Sunny Podcast is nominally a companion piece to It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, the long-running, much-loved sitcom starring McElhenney, Howerton and Day, as well as Kaitlin Olson and our lord Danny DeVito. I say nominally a companion piece: while each instalment of the pod is supposed to be a discussion on a corresponding episode of the sitcom – which, if you haven’t seen it follows the truly reprehensible owners of a decaying Irish pub in Philadelphia – the hosts usually abandon that premise a couple of minutes in to instead ramble about weird subjects, argue with each other, attempt bizarre impressions and generally try to make each other laugh. In fact, sometimes they don’t even bother to cover an episode of the show at all: last week they hosted a phone-in with members of the public, which not only managed to include a touching call with a woman who had recently undergone brain surgery, but also an eye-wateringly scatological convo with someone who was on the loo at the time. What’s particularly fun about the podcast, if you’re familiar with the show (I doubt the pod makes much sense if you aren’t, so it’s worth taking in the two in tandem), is how McElhenney, Howerton and Day resemble the mannerisms of their characters, without ever reaching the heights of their awfulness. The trio were friends before the pitched the sitcom to US network FX, and the podcast gives a glimpse into how they built the series from their own interactions: the bickering, the teasing, and the enjoyment of being in each other’s company. In short, The Always Sunny Podcast is fantastic, but it does present a bit of a problem on public transport. Do I just try to stifle a laugh? Or try to bury it in my sleeve as if I’m sneezing? Or do I just full-throatedly own the laughter, and risk the weird looks? Any advice from experienced comedy podcast commuters would be gratefully received!

2/25/2022,"Guardian Australia has won two Walkley awards for excellence in journalism for political editor Katharine Murphy’s commentary and reporter Naaman Zhou’s series on the dangers faced by food delivery drivers. Murphy took out the commentary, analysis, opinion and critique category for three of her columns on the gendered dynamics in federal parliament. In her article on former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins finding her voice after an alleged rape in Parliament House, Murphy argued the revelations about the incident needed to spark a moment of profound change. “This story, the gut-wrenching story of Higgins and the grotesque indignity she believes she suffered on a couch in the people’s house late at night – coming after a succession of stories about women struggling in a professional culture that remains institutionally hostile to women – has opened a wound in the building I’ve worked in for more than two decades,” Murphy wrote. “Women who work in politics to serve their country have had enough.” In early March, Murphy argued that the men in the halls of parliament were missing the moment – just as they had when Julia Gillard delivered her famous misogyny speech in 2012. Later that same month, in the wake of an interview with Scott Morrison on A Current Affair, she described how the prime minister was attempting to appeal to a particular cohort of women. “Perhaps for the foreseeable future Morrison’s prime ministership will now have two objectives: speaking to men who might vote Labor, and women inclined to pity unreconstructed men. Perhaps there was always some crossover with these two cohorts,” Murphy wrote. Samantha Maiden, the political editor of news.com.au, won the Gold Walkley for revealing allegations that Higgins had been raped in Parliament House. Reporter Naaman Zhou, who left Guardian Australia in 2021 to work at the New Yorker, won the all-media public service journalism Walkley for a series of reports on the dangers faced by food delivery drivers. In a feature in early November 2020, Zhou profiled three food delivery drivers who died while delivering meals for DoorDash, Hungry Panda and Uber Eats. In one case, the driver Chow Khai Shien’s death did not officially register in Australia for two and a half days. His follow-up news story in late November revealed that food delivery companies did not check whether their delivery riders had working bikes – or whether they could even ride a bike – before approving them to work. Zhou continued his coverage of the issue with a story in May last year, exposing the alarmingly low rates of pay Uber Eats riders in Australia were earning for long deliveries across multiple suburbs. Guardian Australia was a finalist in three other categories: Indigenous affairs, innovation and press photography. Reporter Matilda Boseley was nominated in the innovation category for her vibrant and informative TikTok news videos, including her viral explainer on Afghanistan. The category was won by Kylie Boltin, Ella Rubeli, Ravi Vasavan and Emma Anderson, from SBS for Ravi and Emma, an “interactive documentary” in Southern Dialect Auslan. Laura Murphy-Oates, Lorena Allam, David Maurice Smith and Jeremy Worrall were nominated in the Indigenous affairs category for Childhood in Custody, a series about the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the justice system. That category was won by Karla Grant, Julie Nimmo, Michael Carey, Mark Bannerman and the team from NITV’s Living Black program. Guardian contributor Christopher Hopkins was named a finalist in the press photographer of the year category, which was won by Brook Mitchell of the Sydney Morning Herald. Entries for this year’s Walkleys needed to have been published between 1 September 2020 and 31 August 2021. The 66th annual Walkley awards were held in Sydney on Friday night, after being moved from Tamworth due to Covid-19 concerns. The chair of the Walkley Judging Board, Michael Brissenden, said: “The judges had a difficult job picking winners among so many high quality entries across the 30 award categories that covered an incredibly broad range of subjects; from Covid-19 to the war in Afghanistan, mental health, underprivileged Australians, sexual harassment, racism and the Tokyo Olympics.” “The winning entries showcase the pinnacle of Australian journalism, long-form writing and photojournalism.”",News/Media,Guardian Australia wins two Walkleys for political commentary and reports on food delivery drivers,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/guardian-australia-wins-two-walkleys-for-political-commentary-and-reports-on-food-delivery-drivers
2/25/2022,"The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, ended the pretence that Britain was not at odds with its fellow European leaders over the issue. He said there was still time for Russia to be excluded, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “The UK is working with allies to exclude Russia from the Swift financial system.” Wallace added: “We will work all the magic, do everything we can in diplomacy.” Truss is to undertake a round of shuttle diplomacy to try to rally support for the British position after the EU refused to adopt what has been billed as the “nuclear option” of sanctions. What is it? Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals. Who owns it? Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Why would a Swift ban be so serious? Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban? One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. British officials said that the EU, reflecting the divisions at its council meeting on Thursday, kept the Swift option on the table. UK diplomats are arguing that with Ukrainian forces mounting a defence of their country, and scattered signs of unease in Russian cities, this is the moment to try to get ahead of Putin for once and surprise him with a move that would send the Russian economy straight into the deep freeze. The British position has the support of Canada and some US senators. British officials insist they will keep up the pressure for the policy even if Kyiv falls. Boris Johnson lobbied the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Wednesday on the issue but made no progress. Johnson’s position, also raised at a virtual meeting of the G7, is backed by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. The Swift payment system (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars’ worth of deals. Swift is incorporated under Belgian law and, although supervised by a complex web of central banks, it was forced in 2012 to comply with an EU regulation, as confirmed by its home country government, that had cut Iran off from the banking system. Wallace said: “We would like to go further. We’d like to do the Swift system – that is the financial system that allows the Russians to move money around the world to receive payments for its gas – but … these are international organisations and if not every country wants them to be thrown out of the Swift system, it becomes difficult.” Opponents of the move argue that it would incentivise Russia to try to use an alternative fledgling scheme. They also say it would be dangerous for countries highly dependent on Russia for their energy, principally Italy. The Biden administration privately supports the Swift cutoff, but is also focused on maintaining transatlantic unity. Biden highlighted the other swingeing sanctions that the EU had agreed to take, arguing that they were more effective than Swift. He said: “It is always an option, but right now that’s not the position the rest of Europe wishes to take.” Scholz said before an EU meeting to decide on sanctions late on Thursday night that it was important for the EU to hold measures in reserve to punish Russia further. “It’s very important that we decide on measures that have been prepared in recent weeks and reserve everything else for a situation where it is necessary to do other things as well,” he said. The former European Council president Donald Tusk said on Friday that some EU governments had “disgraced themselves” by refusing to impose the toughest possible sanctions on Russia even as Vladimir Putin was bombing Kyiv. The remarkable rebuke by Tusk, who led meetings of the council as president from 2014 to 2019, revealed deep divisions among Europe’s political elite at what is perhaps the continent’s most acute moment of crisis since the second world war. “In this war everything is real: Putin’s madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv,” Tusk posted on Twitter. “Only your sanctions are pretended [sic]. Those EU governments which blocked tough decisions (i.a. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.”",News/World news,UK says it will work ‘all day’ to persuade Europe to cut Russia off from Swift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/uk-says-it-will-work-all-day-to-persuade-europe-to-cut-russia-off-from-swift-ukraine
2/25/2022,"Good morning. Ukrainians are being urged to resist as Russian tanks close in on Kyiv, in a day which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister has said. Explosions and gunfire have been heard in the Obolonskyi area, a northern district of Kyiv, as invading Russian forces approached. Anton Herashchenko said the city’s defenders were waiting with anti-tank missiles as reports came in that tanks were advancing on the city of almost 3 million from all sides. The Ministry of Defence’s Facebook page urged civilians to resist, saying: “We urge citizens to inform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails, and neutralise the enemy.” Kyiv residents were woken by the sound of explosions as reports circulated that Russia had launched a series of missile strikes on the city. The UN refugee agency has predicted that 4 million people may flee Ukraine “if the situation escalates further”. The death toll in Ukraine has risen to 137 people, while 316 had been wounded by Russia’s invasion and attacks, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an address late on Thursday. All men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine as the military mobilises, with Zelenskiy declaring martial law. Russian forces have taken the city of Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine. The city is about 200km west of the Russian border. Kyiv was shaken by explosions in the early hours of Friday, with Ukraine claiming it had shot down a Russian military aircraft over the city. The interior ministry said a residential tower block had been set alight by the falling debris. Cars queued for up to 15 hours as thousands attempted to flee Ukraine into Hungary and Poland. Fuel is in short supply, with a 20-litre fuel restriction imposed at six petrol stations and huge queues. Internal flights have been suspended. Thousands of Russians have protested against the war in dozens of cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, with police arresting at least 1,702 in 53 cities. Zelenskiy has pleaded with western countries to ramp up their sanctions on Russia and send more military support. In an address to the nation just after midnight, the president said: “We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of Nato membership? Everyone is afraid.” On Thursday evening, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his fury shortly before the EU decided against blocking Russia from Swift, an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency – potentially the most effective sanction the bloc could impose. “I will not be diplomatic on this,” he tweeted. “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too. BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT.” Is Swift bound by sanctions? The network has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries, but there is precedent. In 2012, the EU banned Swift from serving Iranian firms and individuals sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme. Russia’s ministry for the economy has responded to sanctions by saying it is developing measures to minimise their impact, with plans to expand trade with Asia. Three former Minneapolis police officers have been convicted for violating George Floyd’s civil rights. A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial who might not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection will now be questioned publicly as Maxwell’s team seeks a retrial. The Dominican Republic has begun construction on a controversial border wall with Haiti, with officials claiming it will limit the flow of migrants, drugs and weapons. Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled, meaning microplastics are everywhere. The material is difficult to recycle and slow to decay. A summit of world leaders is being held online and in Nairobi, Kenya, next week, with hopes that the first ever global legally binding treaty to combat plastic waste could be agreed upon. Musicians touring used to mean one thing: a hedonistic party life, fueled by booze and drugs. But the culture is starting to change, music journalist Hannah May Kilroy writes, with growing availability of support for those who want to stay sober. “There’s almost this unwritten rule that drugs and alcohol are a necessity if you’re a musician or in the music industry,” says Norman Beecher, who runs a workshop at Music Support, a charity specialising in mental health and addiction in the industry. “It’s a narrative that needs to change.” Major oil companies are largely all talk and no act when it comes to the clean energy initiatives they espouse, a comprehensive peer-reviewed study has found. Researchers compared rhetoric with action taken from 2009 to 2020 from the world’s four largest oil companies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP, finding that the firms were not transitioning their business models to clean energy. Twelve years since they first appeared on London’s streets, “Boris bikes” – named after Boris Johnson, who was mayor at the time of their introduction – have been hailed as an eco-friendly way of getting around the city. Or perhaps a bit further: a Freedom of Information request showed that the bicycles have turned up in places as far from the capital as Australia, Jamaica and Turkey.

2/25/2022,"Fighting has reached the northern suburbs of Kyiv after a night of missile attacks on the Ukrainian capital to prepare for a major Russian assault, as president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded for more international help and tougher sanctions. Air raid sirens wailed over the city of 3 million people and heavy gunfire and explosions were heard in a residential district on Friday morning. Ukrainian officials warned that Russian military vehicles were approaching the city from the north-west. A day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, launched an invasion that shocked the world, a senior Ukrainian official said Russian forces would enter the city limits later in the day, adding that Ukrainian troops were defending positions on four fronts. Pre-dawn blasts in Kyiv set off a second day of violence after Putin on Thursday defied western warnings to unleash the biggest attack on a European state since the second world war. It has so far claimed at least 150 lives and displaced more than 100,000. “Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted. “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow was ready for talks if Ukraine’s military surrendered, as he insisted the invading forces were seeking to free the country from “oppression” and would not seek to occupy it. The Ukrainian defence ministry said Russian forces had entered the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv, about six miles from the centre of the city. In a statement posted online, it advised residents to report the movements of Russian troops and “prepare molotov cocktails in order to neutralise the enemy”. Cleaning broken glass from her room, one Kyiv resident, Oxana Gulenko, said: “How we can live through it in our time? What should we think. Putin should be burnt in hell along with his whole family.” Witnesses said loud explosions could also be heard in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city, close to Russia’s border, while air raid sirens sounded over Lviv in the west. A resident told the Guardian the eastern city of Sumy had been taken. Ukrainian officials said a Russian aircraft had been shot down and crashed into a building in Kyiv overnight, setting it ablaze. An unverified recording shows a Russian warship ordering a Ukrainian Black Sea outpost to surrender. The Ukrainians reply: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” In the Ukrainian village of Starognativka near the frontline where separatists have faced off against Kyiv’s forces for years, a local official, Volodymyr Veselkin, said missiles had been raining down all morning and the power was out. “They are trying to wipe the village off the face of the earth,” he said. The UN’s refugee agency said about 100,000 people were already displaced inside Ukraine, while thousands of others fled across the border. Streams of people in cars and on foot were seen crossing into Hungary, Poland and Romania at border points where queues were lasting up to 15 hours. Zelenskiy said in a televised address early on Friday that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country. The president, who also criticised world leaders for “watching from afar”, spoke after large explosions were heard in the capital, and after a warning from the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, that “all evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threaten” the city. Zelenskiy has vowed to stay in the capital. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said it is the view of British intelligence that Russia intends to invade the whole of Ukraine, but that its army failed to deliver on the first day of its invasion. The international criminal court said on Friday it might investigate possible war crimes, though did not provide any further details. Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, although his ultimate aims remain obscure. Blinken told a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Thursday that the US believed Moscow had “developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses – and potentially worse – on the Ukrainian people”. Ukraine announced it had lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site near the country’s northern border with Belarus hours after Russian troops began an invasion on Thursday, and the White House said it was “outraged” by credible reports that Russian forces were holding facility staff there hostage. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was following the situation “with grave concern” and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that might put Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at risk. In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said that more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained. The west scrambled to respond to Putin’s aggression with a range of new sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send 7,000 more troops to Germany to shore up Nato’s eastern borders. But even after the invasion there were divisions on the strength of the response. The EU faced furious remonstrations from Kyiv after Europe’s leaders held back from imposing the potentially most damaging sanction on Russia: blocking Russia from the international payments system through which it receives foreign currency. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they failed to impose the heaviest toll on Moscow by cutting Russia from the Swift payments system. France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said cutting Russia off from Swift was “a very last resort”. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was united after discussions of the five-pillar sanctions package targeting the financial, energy, transport and export industries and visa controls. She said: “Today’s events are a watershed moment for Europe. Bombs are falling on innocent women, men and children. They fear for their lives and many are dying. All of this happens in 2022 – in the very heart of Europe. President Putin chose to bring back war to Europe. “Let me stress that these events, indeed, mark the beginning of a new era. We must be very clear in our analysis: Putin is trying to subjugate a friendly European country. And he is trying to redraw the maps of Europe by force. He must, and he will, fail.” Leaders of the 30 Nato allied nations will meet on Friday, the US president, Joe Biden, confirmed, as they come under pressure to go further than the two rounds of sanctions already announced, after what the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, described as a “dark day in the history of our continent”. The UN security council will also vote on Friday on a draft resolution condemning Russia’s invasion and requiring Moscow’s immediate withdrawal. However, Moscow can veto the measure, and it was unclear how China, which has rejected calling Russia’s move an invasion, would vote.",News/World news,Fighting reaches Kyiv suburbs as Russian invasion of Ukraine intensifies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/ukraine-invasion-explosions-in-kyiv-as-uk-reports-fierce-resistance-across-the-nation
2/25/2022,"The pictures this morning of Russian tanks rolling across the Ukrainian countryside seemed both surreal – a flashback to a Europe that we’ve seen only in newsreels – and inevitable. It’s been clear for years that Vladimir Putin was both evil and driven and that eventually we might come to a moment like this. One of the worst parts of facing today’s reality is our impotence in its face. Yes, America is imposing sanctions, and yes, that may eventually hamper Putin. But the Russian leader made his move knowing we could not actually fight him in Ukraine – and indeed that his hinted willingness to use nuclear weapons will make it hard to fight him anywhere, though one supposes we will have no choice if he attacks a Nato member. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to dramatically reduce Putin’s power. One way, in particular: to get off oil and gas. This is not a “war for oil and gas” in the sense that too many of America’s Middle East misadventures might plausibly be described. But it is a war underwritten by oil and gas, a war whose most crucial weapon may be oil and gas, a war we can’t fully engage because we remain dependent on oil and gas. If you want to stand with the brave people of Ukraine, you need to find a way to stand against oil and gas. Russia has a pathetic economy – you can verify that for yourself by looking around your house and seeing how many of the things you use were made within its borders. Today, 60% of its exports are oil and gas; they supply the money that powers the country’s military machine. And, alongside that military machine, control of oil and gas supplies is Russia’s main weapon. They have, time and again, threatened to turn off the flow of hydrocarbons to western Europe. When the Germans finally this week stopped the planned Nordstream 2 pipeline, Putin’s president Dimtry Medvedyev said, “Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros ($2,270) per thousand cubic meters!” His not very subtle notion: if the price of keeping houses warm doubles, Europe will have no choice but to fold. Finally, even the Biden administration – which has been playing its hand wisely in the lead up to the invasion – is constrained by oil and gas. As we impose sanctions, everyone’s looking for an out: the Italians want to exempt high-end luxury goods and the Belgians diamonds, but America has made it clear that it it doesn’t want to seriously interrupt the flow of Russian oil for fear of driving up gas prices and thus weakening American resolve. As one “senior state deparment official” told the Wall Street Journal this week, “doing anything that affects … or halts energy transactions would have a great impact on the United States, American citizens and our allies. So our intention here is to impose the hardest sanctions we can while trying to safeguard the American public and the rest of the world from those measures,” the official said. It’s obviously not an idle fear: as of this morning Tucker Carlson was attacking Russia hawk Lindsay Graham for supporting a conflict that will bring “higher gas prices” while he has a “generous Congressional pension”. If you’re an apologist for fascism, high gas prices are your first go-to move. So now is the moment to remind ourselves that, in the last decade, scientists and engineers have dropped the cost of solar and windpower by an order of magnitude, to the point where it is some of the cheapest power on earth. The best reason to deploy it immediately is to ward off the existential crisis that is climate change, and the second best is to stop the killing of nine million people annually who die from breathing in the particulates that fossil fuel combustion produces. But the third best reason – and perhaps the most plausible for rousing our leaders to action – is that it dramatically reduces the power of autocrats, dictators, and thugs. Imagine a Europe that ran on solar and wind power: whose cars ran on locally provided electricity, and whose homes were heated by electric air-source heat pumps. That Europe would not be funding Putin’s Russia, and it would be far less scared of Putin’s Russia – it could impose every kind of sanction, and keep them in place until the country buckled. Imagine an America where the cost of gas was not a political tripwire, because if people had to have a pickup to make them feel sufficiently manly, that pickup ran on electricity that came from the sun and wind. It would take an evil-er genius than Vladimir Putin to figure out how to embargo the sun. These are not novel technologies – they exist, are growing, and could be scaled up quickly. In the years after Hitler invaded the Sudetenland, America turned its industrial prowess to building tanks, bombers, and destroyers. In 1941, in Ypsilanti, the world’s largest industrial plant went up in six month’s time, and soon it was churning out a B-24 bomber every hour. A bomber is a complicated machine with more than a million parts; a wind turbine is, by contrast, relatively simple. In Michigan alone (“the arsenal of democracy”), a radiator company retooled to make 20m steel helmets and a rubber factory retooled to produce the liners for those helmets; the company that made the fabric for Ford’s seat cushions stopped doing that and started pushing out parachutes. Do we think that it’s beyond us to quickly produce the solar panels and the batteries required to end our dependence on fossil fuel? It’s not easy – among other things, Russia has a good deal of some of the minerals that help in renewable energy production. (Nickel, for example.) But, here again, the example of the second world war is helpful – with the Axis in control of commodities like rubber, we quickly figured out how to mass produce substitutes. It’s true that we could produce carbon free energy with nuclear power too, as long as we were willing to pay the heavy premium that technology requires – and right now Germany is probably regretting its decision to hastily shutting down its reactors in the wake of the Fukushima accident. But if you think about the scenario now unfolding across Europe, you’re reminded of another of the advantages of renewable power, which is that it’s widely distributed. There are far fewer central nodes to attack with cruise missiles and artillery shells – targeting reactors is pretty easy, but driving your tank across Europe from one solar panel to the next so you can get out to smash it with a hammer is comical. At the moment, big oil is using the fighting in Ukraine as an excuse to try to expand its footprint – reliable industry ally Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, went on Fox this week to argue that stopping the Keystone XL pipeline had empowered the Russian leader, for instance, and the American Petroleum Institute today called for more oil and gas development. But this is absurd – we may need, for the remaining weeks of this winter, to insure gas supplies for Europe, but by next winter we need to remove that lever. That means an all-out effort to decarbonize that continent, and then our own. It’s not impossible. We have to do it anyway, if we’re to have any hope of slowing climate change. And we can do it fast if we want: huge offshore windfarms in Europe have been built inside of 18 months without any wartime pressure. We should be in agony today – people are dying because they want to live in a democracy, want to determine their own affairs. But that agony should, and can, produce real change. (And not just in Europe. Imagine not having to worry about what the king of Saudia Arabia thought, or the Koch brothers – access to fossil fuel riches so often produces retrograde thuggery). Caring about the people of Ukraine means caring about an end to oil and gas.
