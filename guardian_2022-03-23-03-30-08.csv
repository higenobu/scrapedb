3/23/2022,"Communication within government was often done on instant messages such as WhatsApp during the pandemic, a senior Cabinet Office official has accepted, as it emerged that a series of messages have been lost from Boris Johnson’s phone. The messages were lost in April 2021 amid security precautions when it emerged that the prime minister’s phone number was listed on the internet, according to a statement by Sarah Harrison, chief operating officer at the Cabinet Office. “The effect was that historic messages were no longer available to search and the phone is not active,” she wrote in a witness statement prepared for a court challenge by groups Good Law Project and Foxglove over the use of private messaging in government. Among messages that would have been lost were ones with Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s then-chief adviser, in March 2021, which Cummings later presented in screenshot form, illustrating what he said was dysfunction amid the start of the Covid pandemic. The loss of the messages comes despite official guidance, set out by Harrison in the statement, that ministers are “required to make a separate record of any conversation” relevant to work, and reminding them about an “export” function so conversations can be saved. No 10 has a dedicated team that maintains both hard and electronic copies of relevant documents, her statement added, while WhatsApp is only allowed “for ephemeral chat and/or unclassified material”. “Users are expected to preserve any data for the public record that may be on WhatsApp or private email accounts where it should be copied [and moved to No 10 records],” she wrote, adding that No 10 staff are “constantly reminded of their responsibilities concerning the accurate keeping and capture of electronic records”. Her statement sets out how much communication moved to electronic messaging amid remote working during Covid, often through WhatsApp groups. “These WhatsApp groups were used for informal discussions between the participants,” it said. “These are the equivalent to the conversation that might previously have taken place in corridors, or in passing, had there not been a shift to remote working in line with the government’s guidance at that time. “I have been reassured by No 10 officials that any relevant actions from these WhatsApp groups were copied across to formal channels and the official record where appropriate.” The statement notes that there is also “some limited use” of ministers using private emails, mainly when travelling, and that two unnamed ministers use the secure chat service Signal “for informal conversations”. Both groups had challenged the government over the use of informal communications, and the risk to permanent record-keeping of decisions. In a statement, the Good Law Project said: “Given the current ‘partygate’ investigation, as well as the future inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic, this has serious implications for transparency and holding the prime minister and his government to account.” Johnson’s official spokesperson said he would not get into the “levels of communication” used by the prime minister but that “there are rules and guidelines” that were followed: “Those conversations can happen as long as any requisite information is provided to [their] private office and passed on, and that’s what takes place when it comes to the prime minister.”",News/Law,"Government work often done on instant messages during Covid, says top official ",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/22/government-work-often-done-on-instant-messages-during-covid-says-top-official
3/23/2022,"Russian forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition left to conduct the war after a breakdown in their supply chains, Ukrainian military commanders have alleged. The claims of major shortages were described as “plausible” by western officials although they said they were unable to corroborate the analysis. The report from the Ukrainian armed forces general command was said to be consistent with evidence that the Russian advance had stalled, and that they had reverted to using “indiscriminate and attritional” artillery attacks on civilians. “We do think that the Russian forces have used a lot of material including particular categories of weapons and we have seen isolated reports of particular units that have lacked supplies of one sort or another,” the official said. “It is consistent with an advance which has ground to a halt. Failures in the logistic chain has been one of the reasons they have not been as effective as they hoped”. A Pentagon official added there were continuing morale issues among Russian troops, with food and fuel shortages, as well as frostbite due to a lack of warm weather gear. “They’re struggling on many fronts,” the US official said. The Ukrainian military said that a major problem for the Russian advance was a failure to lay down a fuel pipe to the front, although the claim could not be independently verified. On Monday, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the pro-Kremlin tabloid, reported that according to Russian Ministry of Defence numbers, 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine and 16,153 were injured. The death toll was swiftly removed from the newspaper’s website. Western officials said they believed the numbers cited by the newspaper are a “reasonable estimate”. The official said: “It is a level of casualties that has not been experienced [by Russia] really since the second world war. It is still continuing … It is a conflict on a different scale.” While Vladimir Putin’s forces have struggled around Kyiv, a senior US official said the fighting had been taken to the streets in Mariupol, where many civilians remain trapped among rotting corpses and flattened buildings. Two “super powerful bombs” hit the city on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. The port city is said to be under naval shelling from ships in the Sea of Azov. Russians are said to want to be able to declare Mariupol as a first strategic victory. The city is seen as key to securing a Russian corridor between the separatist Donbas region and illegally annexed Crimea. It is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery. The US military said, however, that it has not seen any signs that chemical weapons were being prepared for imminent use.",News/World news,"Russian invaders have three days of supplies left, says Ukraine military",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/russian-invaders-have-three-days-of-supplies-left-says-ukraine-military
3/23/2022,"Manu Tuilagi is back in contention for selection this weekend according to his Sale Sharks coach, Alex Sanderson, who also conceded that the England centre was “rushed back” to the international fold in time for the Six Nations. “It needed a more graduated return to play, in terms of his loading, for him to take on [the] load he couldn’t handle that week,” Sanderson said of Tuilagi who was selected to start against Wales after only 81 minutes of rugby after a three-month absence, but then suffered a hamstring injury in training. “Is that being rushed?” Sanderson asked. “Yes, in hindsight, I guess there’s no other way around it. He got injured, so we have to look at how he was managed. We are going to sit down with England, have another conversation about how we can get him through to [next year’s] World Cup fit and strong.” Tuilagi’s return is welcome news for club and country. England sorely missed his physicality and direct running in midfield, tellingly utilising the prop Ellis Genge as their primary ball carrier against France in Paris last Saturday. Sale, meanwhile, are seventh in a tightly packed Premiership table and play Bristol across two ties in the European Champions Cup round of 16 next month. Before that they have league games against Harlequins and Saracens as well as this weekend’s trip to Bath. Sanderson was evidently delighted to have “one of the world’s best centres”, as he called Tuilagi, back in the ranks. “He’s the glue off the field and forever a positive, smiley face,” Sanderson said. “On it he’s a wrecking ball. We talked a bit at the start of this week about how we can challenge each other at this business end of the season. That’s what he does. People grow a few inches around him and we get tighter as a squad. We’re very lucky to have him back.” Sanderson’s upbeat demeanour shifted when talking about Tom Curry. The England loose forward will be out for five to six weeks with a grade two hamstring tear, but may be back in time for the Champions Cup quarter-finals. “He’s had a torrid time, hasn’t he?” Sanderson said of Curry who battled through a bout of tonsillitis in the same week he was made England captain for the opening game of the Six Nations against Scotland. Curry also missed the second half against Wales after failing a head injury assessment. Sanderson was quick to point out that Curry was not the only England player who struggled during the tournament and noted that the physical and psychological impact can stay with them once they return to their clubs. “I’ve had past experience of seeing Saracens lads come back elated, sometimes full of themselves because of what they’ve achieved and the attention they received,” said Sanderson, who worked as an assistant coach with Saracens between 2008 and 2021. “At other times, like Maro Itoje would be the first to admit, it was probably the worst moment in his life losing that World Cup final, it took him a year to get over. You’ve got to go through that journey with them and get them out the other side.” Sanderson welcomed back two other England players this week but neither stepped on the field throughout the Six Nations. The Sale coach is not worried about the prop Bevan Rodd, who he said would brush off the disappointment like “water off a duck’s back”. He did, however, express concern over Raffi Quirke. “Raffi took it quite hard, his expectations of where he was in the autumn, wanting to play, that’s something we’ll work through,” Sanderson said, but said he would be better for the experience of training in the England camp. The young scrum-half is not guaranteed a starting place on Saturday. Standing in his way is the World Cup winning Springbok Faf de Klerk. “We said we’d pick them on merit, on training form and playing form, we’ve done that,” Sanderson said. “There isn’t a lot to choose between them, aside from the experience.” Quirke may not have this problem for long. Both De Klerk and his countryman Lood de Jager have been rumoured to be leaving at the end of the season, though Sanderson would not budge: “Until the official media statement has been put out there, you’ll get nothing hot off the press from me.”",Sport/Sport,‘We’re lucky to have him back’: Manu Tuilagi in line for Sale return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/22/were-lucky-to-have-him-back-manu-tuilagi-in-line-for-sale-return
3/23/2022,"My father, Lloyd Williams, who has died aged 84 after suffering from Covid-19 and heart problems, was 22 when he was first elected to the parish council in Waen, north Wales. He went on to give more than 60 years of service to his local community as a parish, borough and county councillor, and as a highly respected chair of all three councils. Waen is a hamlet near St Asaph, Denbighshire. Lloyd was born there, to Jane (nee Evans) and John Williams, both farmers; he had two older brothers and an adored half-sister who had severe disabilities. He would walk two miles each day to the village school in Rhuallt and later went to St Asaph grammar school. Intelligent and hard-working, he passed the “school certificates” with distinction and wanted to study to be a vet, but as for most at that time he had to leave school to work on the farm. Lloyd’s service to others was guided by his quiet and gentle faith. People sought his advice on different matters, knowing they would receive a sympathetic ear and help. Many were discreetly given financial support. Lloyd believed that everyone should have the same opportunities whatever their background. He opposed the selling of local authority housing, believing young families would have no opportunity to live and work in their local area and dormitory villages would result, a prophecy that was sadly realised. He campaigned successfully in the early 1990s for the Rhuallt bypass to be built on the A55. The B-road through the village had caused many fatalities, and Lloyd invited the Welsh secretary of state to visit and to see how a small rural road was unsuitable to carry the hundreds of thousands of cars travelling into north Wales. Conservation and stewardship were very important to him. He planted woodlands, created ponds and wildlife habitats, getting up at first light to do farm work before changing into his suit for countless meetings, then returning home and working late into the night until the last months of his life. He was instrumental in establishing a free rural day care service for severely disabled and elderly people in Denbighshire in 2011. In 1960 Lloyd married Margaret Winter Davies, who grew up on a neighbouring farm, and together they ran her family’s farm for many years. Sadly Lloyd and Margaret were both infected with Covid-19, and Lloyd’s previous heart problems resurfaced. He is survived by Margaret, and their two daughters – my sister, Ffion and me – six grandchildren, Emilia, Miriam, Gethin, Elen, Tom and Aled, and a great-granddaughter, Neli.",News/UK news,Lloyd Williams obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/lloyd-williams-obituary
3/23/2022,"The American rapper Pusha T has issued an extraordinary attack on McDonald’s, releasing a diss track with a rival fast-food chain, Arby’s. The 75-second song was inspired, the rapper told Rolling Stone, by resentment over what he claims is McDonald’s failure to pay him and his brother properly for their part in writing and performing the famous I’m Lovin’ It jingle. In the diss track (essentially a rap that attacks a target, usually another rapper), Pusha T criticises McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish while promoting Arby’s Spicy Fish Sandwich. “I’m the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it,” he raps. He also says the Filet-O-Fish is “shit” and adds: “You should be disgusted / How dare you sell a square fish asking us to trust it / A half slice of cheese, Mickey D’s on a budget?” The origins of the I’m Lovin’ It McDonald’s jingle are disputed. It was released in 2003 and features rapping by Pusha T and his brother Malice, whose stage name is No Malice. Pharrell Williams and Justin Timberlake are also credited, the latter having been paid $6m for a full song of the same name. In the interview with Rolling Stone about his defection to the Arby’s camp, Pusha T said McDonald’s only paid him and his brother a one-time fee, with no royalties, for their work on the seminal ad. “I am solely responsible for the I’m Lovin’ It swag and the jingle of that company,” the rapper said. “That’s just real. I am the reason. Now I gotta crush it. “I did it at a very young age, at a very young time in my career where I wasn’t asking for as much money and ownership. It’s something that’s always dug at me later in life like, ‘Dammit, I was a part of this and I should have more stake.’ “It was like half a million or a million dollars for me and my brother – but that’s peanuts for as long as that’s been running. I had to get that energy off me and this [Arby’s ad] was the perfect way to get that energy, like, ‘You know what? I’m over it.’” According to a Pitchfork article published in 2016, other artists credited with creating the track deny Pusha T was involved. In his own interview with Pitchfork, Pusha T said: “It’s funny that people find it so amusing now that I wrote that.” By Tuesday afternoon the pro-Arby’s track, which the rapper shared with Twitter followers on Monday, had racked up more than 4.4m views. “Drowned in tartar, that Filet-O-Fish is tasteless,” Pusha-T raps. “Arby’s only deals in the greatness. I bet the house on it like its Vegas.” The rapper tweeted: “Just dropped a diss track with Arby’s.

3/23/2022,"An extreme heat event in the Arctic could cause it to reach the maximum of the extent of its ice for this year “considerably earlier” than usual, a scientist has warned. Temperature records were broken in Norway last week, with rain falling at Svalbard airport, and unusually warm temperatures recorded in Greenland and the Russian archipelago of Franz Josef Land. Some stations reportedly reached 30C warmer than usual for the Arctic winter. The situation was echoed at the south pole, with Concordia station, on the Antarctic Plateau, hitting a record -11.8C on Friday, more than 40C warmer than usual for this time of year. “It is unusual to have such large departures from average occur at the same time at both poles, and in the Arctic it may have led to the maximum sea ice extent reached considerably earlier than average,” said Prof Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London (UCL). Arctic sea ice extent was tracking well below the 1981 to 2010 median, according to data published by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. On 21 March, it spread across 14.5m sq km (5.6m sq miles) compared with a 15.5m sq km historical average. The NSIDC’s graph showed levels were also tracking below those seen in 2012, when Arctic sea ice hit its lowest ever extent. However, ice extent was greater than that seen at this time of year in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and broadly in line with levels in 2019 and 2021. Similar extents were also seen in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011. Stroeve was cautious about attributing the extreme heat events to the climate crisis. “While we may expect such warming extremes to occur more frequently under climate change, it is too early to say this particular event is related to climate change,” she said. “Weather is always unpredictable. And it’s important to remember that air temperatures, while warmer than average, remain below zero.” Dr Lisa Schipper, co-ordinating lead chapter author for the IPCC sixth assessment report and Oxford environmental research fellow, said: “The IPCC report on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability released in February underscores that the window of opportunity to act on climate is rapidly closing. “If these extreme temperatures don’t wake people up about this urgency, at the same time as war threatens to encourage more fossil fuel extraction and use, I don’t know what will.”",News/Environment,Arctic sea ice could hit maximum extent ‘much earlier’ than usual,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/arctic-sea-ice-could-hit-maximum-extent-much-earlier-than-usual
3/23/2022,"Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, has tested positive for Covid-19 and will not travel to Europe with Joe Biden for meetings in Brussels and Poland this week. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Psaki said she had met twice with Biden, 79, on Monday but he had tested negative the following day. “In preparation for travel to Europe,” Psaki said, “I took a PCR test this morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the president’s trip to Europe. “I had two socially distanced meetings with the president yesterday, and he is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC guidance. I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an abundance of transparency. The president tested negative today via PCR test. “Thanks to the vaccine, I have only experienced mild symptoms. In alignment with White House Covid-19 protocols, I will work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day isolation period and a negative test.” Biden is vaccinated and boosted. Psaki, his chief voice in the media, has tested positive for Covid before, in October last year. More than 972,000 people have died of Covid in the US. Most public health restrictions have been relaxed, under new federal policy aimed at focusing on areas where hospital resources are under strain.

3/23/2022,"Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg denounced as “racist” and “colonial” the decision by the Swedish government on Tuesday to allow a British company to dig an open-cast iron ore mine on land belonging to the indigenous Sami people. Beowulf Mining, headquartered in London, has fought for nearly a decade to win approval for the mine, but has consistently faced stiff opposition from Sami and environmentalists. The Gállok site, 45km from the town of Jokkmokk in Swedish Sápmi, commonly known as Lappland, has become a symbol of the tension between business and government on one hand, and the protected status of Sami culture. Announcing the decision on Tuesday, the business minister, Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson, said the mine was in the public interest. He stressed that permission came with a number of “far-reaching conditions” to minimise the impact on reindeer husbandry, compliance with which was essential. These include commitments to arrange transport for migrating animals, compensate reindeer herders and restore the land after exploitation. But critics of the mine responded furiously. “Sweden today confirmed its shortsighted, racist, colonial and nature-hostile approach,” Thunberg, who is Swedish, posted on Twitter. “Sweden pretends to be a leader for environment and human rights, but at home they violate indigenous rights and continue waging a war on nature. The world will remember this.” Amnesty International Sweden said it “deeply regretted” the decision, noting concerted opposition to the mine from the Sami parliament, UN experts, Unesco, the Church of Sweden, the Swedish environmental protection agency, Sweden’s national heritage board and others. Märta Stenevi, spokesperson for Sweden’s Green party, said on Twitter that the decision to give the go-ahead for the Gállok mine was a “tragedy for Sami rights, nature and future generations … Short-term economic gain is now put before Sami rights, animals and nature. Incredible.” Beowulf’s share price had been on a sharp upward trajectory since December when the Swedish Greens, who have opposed the plans, left the governing coalition. Thorwaldsson declared that his party “loved mines” and hoped to open more. However, the share price fell sharply following claims by a Swedish newspaper earlier this month that Beowulf lacked the necessary funds to develop the mine and had links to an offshore tax haven. The company strongly denied the claims, while its chairman dismissed them as biased. Welcoming the government’s decision, the Beowulf chief executive, Kurt Budge, said in a statement: ”Beowulf’s ambition is to build the most sustainable mine possible. … The company remains committed to working constructively – and in good faith – with all stakeholders and engaging in meaningful dialogue.” The Sami parliament, the representative body for people of indigenous heritage in Sweden, says the mine will destroy grazing areas and cut off the only viable migratory route for reindeer followed by the Jåhkågasska Sami community, who move westerly with their animals to the high hills of the Laponian area on the Norwegian border for the animals to calve during the spring. However, the promise of hundreds of new jobs created by the mine has divided the local community in Jokkmokk, who fear economic decline and a continuing exodus of people from the area.",News/Environment,Thunberg condemns ‘racist’ decision to allow UK firm to mine on Sami land,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/greta-thunberg-condemns-racist-decision-to-allow-uk-firm-to-mine-on-sami-land
3/23/2022,"Across the United States on Monday evening, many Americans asked a simple question: what is the American Song Contest? The all-live NBC music competition, which aired its two-hour premiere last night, attempts to bring Eurovision to the US. That’s not necessarily an easy task; despite its track record of success overseas – you can thank Eurovision for Abba and Celine Dion – the 65-year-old annual song tournament is not widely understood in the US. Whereas Eurovision showcases one artist per country and offers a web of political intrigue and often untranslatable local culture, the American version, somehow not called “Amerivision,” pits original songs by 56 artists from all 50 US states, five territories (Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands) and the nation’s capital in a bracket-style showdown. The multi-step competition will air over the course of six weeks. American Song Contest, hosted by Kelly Clarkson (the first-ever winner of American Idol) and Snoop Dogg, has the backing of the European competition’s producers and a showrunner, Audrey Morrissey, who has executive-produced NBC’s highly successful singing competition The Voice. It has legions of Eurovision fans curious as to what, exactly, differentiates the US states and territories. It has a process that combines the votes of an expert jury panel with fan votes on NBC’s website and on TikTok. (According to Variety, the 56 jury members – one from each state/territory, including a former member of the band The Fray and the president of iHeartMedia – are supposed to evaluate each performance based on “artistic expression, hit potential, originality and visual impression.”) And it has a March Madness-style series of rounds pitting artists with various levels of name recognition and professional experience against each other. Established stars such as Michael Bolton (Connecticut) and Jewel (Alaska) will compete against amateurs (Michigan is sending is 16-year-old high-schooler, for example). So how did the games begin? The premiere packed a lot of enthusiasm and ginned-up state rivalries into a chaotic two hours. (Full disclosure: I’m from Ohio – shout-out to Macy Gray, the Grammy-winning R&B singer representing the Buckeye State – and the only Eurovision performance I’d seen before this was the unbeatable Latvian pirate group, so I entered pretty confused on the concept.) Clarkson and Snoop applied their signature energies – irresistible, maternal bubbliness for her, slightly stoned vibing for him – to short interstitials between the 11 performances. The (almost entirely upbeat) performances themselves reached for a full cornucopia of genres, from hip-hop to Latin pop to a country-rap earworm called New Boot Goofin’, courtesy of Wyoming’s Ryan Charles, that was seemingly designed for TikTok (it was the night’s clear social media winner.) The hosts only loosely explained the formula, so here are the logistics: the first five episodes will contain 11 performances each (one will have 12), from which one act will automatically advance based on the jury vote, announced at the night’s end. Fan votes will determine the other three acts to advance per episode, announced the following week. The two semi-final rounds will feature 22 acts total offering “slightly elevated” performances of their original songs, according to NBC. Ten artists will make the grand final, where a combination of jury and fan votes will determine the winner. Back to the initial crop of competitors, representing areas of the country as geographically different as tropical Puerto Rico and frozen Wisconsin. Overall, the evening was a mixed bag of quality – to be fair, it is very difficult to sing live in a studio, especially when some of the artists hadn’t performed for more than a couple of thousand people – though Clarkson was uniformly excited and Snoop bopped to every song. Several of the artists explained their styles through mashups of famous stars. Pink-haried Alisabeth Von Presley of Iowa described herself as if Lady Gaga and Pat Benatar collided and exploded into a pile of glitter; Rhode Island’s Hueston said he was Chris Stapleton mixed with Adele and Sons of Anarchy, “but in a good way;” Wisconsin’s Jake’O, black hair slicked back like Elvis, coined his style “nuvo-retro.” Some played to the expectations from their state: Minnesota’s entry, the pop-boy band Yam Haus, consisted of four very earnest white guys embodying “Minnesota nice” (“Ope!”). Mississippi’s Keyone Starr, who has recorded with Mark Ronson, paid homage to her state’s rich history of black musical traditions – delta blues, gospel, rock’n’roll – with a fiery performance heavy on belting and guitar. Arkansas’s Kelsey Lamb sang a pretty conventional country ballad in a wide-brimmed hat. Michael Bolton, very sincerely of Connecticut, sang an earnest Michael Bolton song called Beautiful World. But there were also several conscious efforts to surprise and complicate the image of different regions of the country, and to highlight the diversity of American musical talent. AleXa, an established K-pop artist used to performing to large crowds in South Korea (you could tell – she owned the stage, and the hosts knew it), said that because she’s from Tulsa, Oklahoma, people expected her to wear a cowboy hat and sing country music. Her choreography-intense performance of Wonderland was the highlight of the evening. Indiana’s UG Skywalkin’, real name Josh Kimbowa, is an immigrant (the UG represents Uganda) openly striving to put Indianapolis’s hip-hop scene on the map. Puerto Rico’s entry, Christian Pagán, sang in English and Spanish in a leather pop-punk outfit. The night’s jury winner, Rhode Island’s Hueston, pushed against the state’s image of sun-soaked beaches and tourism by speaking about his tough blue-collar upbringing and the loss of friends to addiction. That intentional steering of the spotlight is perhaps the best argument for American Song Contest. The performances were almost secondary to the three-to-five-minute intro videos, which offered lesser-publicized slices and experiences of the country a moment to connect and expound. This is particularly exciting for the territories, which many Americans know very little about, if they even know they exist as part of the US at all. As chaotic and haphazard as American Song Contest was last night and is likely to be, that opportunity for low-stakes exposure is a worthwhile one. That exposure may be more limited than NBC hoped. The premiere garnered just under 3m viewers, less than the new episode of ABC’s long-running American Idol, broadcast at the same time. So, Eurovision fans probably want Americans to want this. Several NBC executives and a 56-member panel of music industry figures want Americans to want this. But do Americans want their own Eurovision? We’ve got six more weeks to see.",Arts/Television & radio,American Song Contest: the US Eurovision is a chaotic copycat,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/22/american-song-contest-eurovision-nbc-copycat
3/23/2022,"Readers should applaud Aditya Chakrabortty’s article (Western values? They enthroned the monster who is shelling Ukrainians today, 17 March). The west’s failure to back Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and advocacy of reality led to the cataclysmic implosion of the Soviet Union and prevented the more gradual constitutional changes that would have provided stability. The US, supported by the UK government, rushed to push open the door into Russia and other Soviet republics to enable capitalists to feast on the Russian economy, and particularly its natural resources, when what was needed was a kind of Marshall plan to underpin the rouble and to assist the development of civil society. The consequences of that failure were apparent as early as 1990, when I was being asked in Moscow to advise on the immediate setting up of companies to make hay while the sun shone. It was even more apparent in 1996, when the oligarchs showed great disdain for the presidential election taking place that year. They told me that to them the result was irrelevant, such was their financial influence. This capitalist opportunism led to the collapse of the rouble in 1998, causing even more poverty among the Russian people. With Boris Yeltsin unable to stabilise the country, they inevitably looked for a strong nationalist leader. Ready in the wings was Vladimir Putin, and the rest is the sad history that has culminated in today’s Ukrainian horror. It is vital that we separate Putin and his regime from the Russian people, who rightly have a great pride in their cultural heritage. The west needs to understand and to respect that heritage, and to make it clear that our future relationship after Putin can be very different.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds  Gordon Brown and John Major have called for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his associates for war crimes in Ukraine (19 March). The accused are not going to appear at such a tribunal voluntarily, and the west has no way of arresting them and compelling them to do so, therefore the call might be dismissed as futile. In fact, it is worse than that – it is positively counterproductive, since such arrests could be made only after the defeat and subjugation of Russia. That enables Putin to argue that those are the real aims of western policy, and that support for Ukraine is merely the means to that end. Such an argument will rally support among patriotic Russians, even those with qualms about the war. The call for a tribunal is yet another example of a western policy with what might appear to us to have laudable aims but with no attention paid to how it might be understood by the other side.Anthony MatthewLeicester  Aditya Chakrabortty’s article brings to mind the sage response that Mahatma Gandhi is said to have given to a journalist when asked what he thought of western civilisation: “I think it would be a very good idea.”Tony WildGalle, Sri Lanka  Many of your articles have marked 2014 as the beginning of Putin’s criminal campaign to re-vassalise Ukraine.

But there is an option to turn the move into a permanent transfer this summer for €30m. The option will remain valid the following summer unless the second clause – a €35m mandatory buy clause – comes into play. That will be activated at the end of the 2022-23 season if two conditions are met during the campaign: that Kulusevski plays in 50% of the team’s Premier League matches for at least 45 minutes and Spurs qualify for the Champions League. Kulusevski is extremely happy at Tottenham and with life in London, boosted by his relationship with Antonio Conte. The manager had wanted to sign Kulusevski when in charge of Internazionale two years ago and approved when Fabio Paratici, the Spurs managing director of football, pursued January’s deal. Paratici, in his previous job, had brought Kulusevski to Juventus from Atalanta in 2020 for €35m plus €9m in add-ons and felt sure the player would thrive in the Premier League.",Sport/Football,Revealed: the deal Spurs struck with Juventus to buy Dejan Kulusevski,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/spurs-deal-with-juventus-to-buy-dejan-kulusevski-revealed
3/23/2022,"Dr Xand van Tulleken (Falling ill made me realise the true wonder of the NHS, 19 March) says he will repeat to his patients the advice that an A&E doctor gave him: “You mustn’t let being ill make you think differently about yourself. You’re still the same person, just one bit of you isn’t working very well.” I am suffering from long Covid, and if any doctor said this to me I’d be hurt and offended. Part of the agony of long Covid is that you really are not the person you were before. You lose a lot: work, leisure, maybe the ability to walk for a length of time. You may lose friends and relatives who cannot cope with the diagnosis and its implications. You’re undergoing a profound change that will no doubt impact on your sense of self for years. Anyone who says “don’t think differently about yourself” in this situation is a Panglossian fantasist. I urge medics to remain aware of the unequal power dynamic between patient and doctor, and to resist imposing their view of how the patient should feel about their illness. They must be open to understanding the experience of the person in front of them.Sean KennyLondon  Last Thursday, I was slightly hoarse so did two lateral flow tests before going to my choir rehearsal. Both were negative. On Friday, I developed a cough, sore throat and runny nose, but again the LFT was negative so I assumed I had a cold. On Saturday, my only remaining symptom was a slight sore throat, so I planned to take part in my choir’s concert that night – except that this time my LFT was positive. Thank goodness for the availability of free LFTs, without which I would have spread Covid around my choir.

3/23/2022,"The excellent points that George Monbiot makes are undermined by his narrative, which sets farmers against environmentalists (There are solutions to the food crisis. But ploughing up Britain isn’t one of them, 16 March). At best, he risks dividing those who would otherwise be allies and putting them into falsely opposing positions. At worst, it is a dangerous distraction while Nigel Farage et al, and the opaque sources of funding behind them, rush to undercut the hard-won progress for climate and nature, health and equity. Of course, we must manage the risk to food security as well as tackle the nature, climate and health crises. It is progressive farmers who are doing the real work in changing farming and food systems, by shifting to agroecological and regenerative practices. Agroecology, which allows for rewilding some agricultural land, removes overreliance on fossil fuels, synthetic chemicals and animal feeds. It is a growing movement that could build a fairer, more sustainable food system. Farmers – if given the right policy and market signals – have huge potential to be a force for change. The Ukraine war is the latest episode in a future of increasing geopolitical and ecological instability, characterised by competition for power and resources. Rather than polarising populism, we need collaboration, imagination, and the courage to find common purpose to tackle the challenges ahead that Monbiot so eloquently describes.Sue PritchardChief executive, Food, Farming and Countryside Commission",News/Environment,Farmers and environmentalists must unite to create a sustainable food system | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/farmers-and-environmentalists-must-unite-to-create-a-sustainable-food-system

3/23/2022,"Bob Wellings, who has died aged 87 after a fall, was an “everyman” television presenter. He will be best remembered on Nationwide, the BBC’s early-evening news magazine programme, throughout the 1970s, his relaxed style and affable manner putting interviewees at their ease. It was populist TV with a mix of hard news and quirky, lighter items, covering subjects from industrial action to a skateboarding duck. The format was intended to unite viewers across Britain by following each region’s news bulletin with a national programme bringing together items from BBC studios around the UK. The frequent technical hitches, in an era before satellite, seemed only to increase viewers’ affections for the show. Wellings was first seen on Nationwide as a London and south-east of England reporter and presenter in early 1970. The programme had begun six months earlier, with Michael Barratt anchoring single-handedly. In 1971, Wellings was added as a co-presenter, with Frank Bough soon joining them. Others later at the helm of Nationwide included Sue Lawley, John Stapleton and Sue Cook. “As a Nationwide reporter, you had to be able to tackle anything, from interviewing, say, Edward Heath to some extraordinary animal,” Wellings recalled in the 1991 TV documentary Let’s Go Nationwide, before a clip of him with a piglet during his early days on the show. “Daft, really – and, of course, there’s no programme nowadays where that kind of thing could happen.” He then turned to a llama and asked: “I wonder if I could have your views on Tibet and the chances of its independence.” Alongside features on “ordinary” people, there were star interviews. After an exchange with Gregory Peck, the Hollywood actor said to him: “Mr Wellings, I do admire your tie. Could you tell me where you got it?” It turned out that Peck was opening a mayor’s gala in France and Wellings posted him an identical one. During 1973, Wellings also appeared weekly on That’s Life!, the consumer show presented by Esther Rantzen and originally billed as “a late-night collection of the jokes, dramas and problems that happen in real life” – like Nationwide it featured a mix of serious and light items. He and the actor George Layton were Rantzen’s co-presenters for that first series. In 1980, after 11 years on Nationwide – and three years before it was axed following more than 3,000 editions – Wellings was replaced by Richard Kershaw as the programme tried to become more serious. Wellings and Joan Bakewell then presented the regional show On the Town (1980-81), a Friday night look at entertainment in and around London. He was back in front of a national audience as a reporter on Nationwide’s shortlived successor, Sixty Minutes (1983-84), before being teamed with Eamonn Holmes and Pattie Coldwell to present Open Air (1986-89), with viewers venting their thoughts about the previous night’s television and wider TV issues. Wellings was born in Jerusalem, to Louise (nee Dalzell), an American from Texas, and Francis Wellings, the chief geologist of the Iraq Petroleum Company, originally from Shropshire. During the second world war, the family lived in the US, where Bob attended a military school, then moved to Amersham, Buckinghamshire, in 1947. On leaving Downside school, Somerset, he did national service in the RAF, then studied English at Trinity College, Cambridge, not taking his final exams but acting with the university’s Footlights Club. Failing to find a theatrical agent on auditioning with his mime and monologue act, Wellings worked as a “hack writer” for a children’s book publisher, taught at a boys’ prep school in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, then found his way into television in 1959 when he landed a job with Anglia, ITV’s newly launched east of England franchise holder. He joined as a reporter on the regional news programme About Anglia, and later recalled being summoned by his producer after three weeks there and being told: “Bob, look, with most people who are new to television, our problem is to make them look relaxed. With you, we don’t have this problem – you just look … asleep!” Although he switched to the BBC’s South Today as a presenter in 1964, he returned to anchor Anglia’s news magazine from 1966 to 1969, as well as hosting other regional series. Wellings moved back to the BBC in 1970 and, following Nationwide and Sixty Minutes, presented the newly launched regional news programme London Plus from 1984 to 1985. His last nationally screened series, The Solent Way, in which he followed the route of Hampshire’s coastline, was broadcast in 1989. In 1963, Wellings married Pennie Tennyson; they divorced in 1984. He is survived by their daughters, Emma and Sophie, and son, Matthew.

3/23/2022,"At the moment the vividly-coloured pieces are dotted around Sandy Brown’s studio, a former sailmaking loft in the north Devon shipbuilding town of Appledore. In a few weeks they will be transported to a Cornish town and slotted together to become the tallest ceramic sculpture in the UK, possibly the world. Earth Goddess will soar 12 metres high over the town of St Austell, becoming south-west England’s answer to the Angel of the North. It is hoped the sculpture – made from materials as diverse as Appledore estuary mud and Cornish china clay – will draw tourists and give a further boost to the area’s growing reputation as a place to view and make art. “I’ve lived with her for two years,” Brown said as she gave the Guardian a sneak preview of the almost-finished work. “It will be sad to see her go. The place will feel a little empty without her.” Earth Goddess was commissioned as part of an art and regeneration project celebrating the amazing history of china clay in St Austell. The discovery of the material, used in the manufacture of a products including paper, rubber and paint, made St Austell the Silicon Valley of the 18th and 19th centuries. It created thousands of jobs and a striking addition to the landscape – the bright white and sharp-tipped spoil tips nicknamed the Cornish Alps. Earth Goddess is to be the centrepiece of a ceramic sculpture trail in the town. She began with what Brown described as a “doodle” in clay at her desk in the corner of her studio. “I wasn’t thinking or planning, just doodling, but as as far as I’m concerned that’s where the best stuff comes from.” What emerged was a “vaguely female form” – and the idea of a giant earth goddess. Brown took advice from an engineer friend who pointed out that the original shape she had envisaged was not practical because flat bits sticking out would catch the wind. So a sleeker, curvy form emerged. A limiting factor was the size of the studio kiln. Brown has one of the biggest in the UK but she had to make the body in 15 separate pieces to be able to fire them. Brown said she was confident Earth Goddess would be the biggest ceramic sculpture in the UK and she has yet to find a bigger one in the world. “I keep expecting people to tell me there is one, but they haven’t yet.” As well as being big, the sculpture is also very bright – a riot of swirling reds, yellows and cobalt oxide blues. Like the great Cornish potter Bernard Leach, Brown studied in Japan. While Leach is better known for more muted tones, Brown went down a brighter route. “When I started 50 years ago, there seemed to be a belief that studio ceramics should be brown. I preferred colour.” The sections are decorated with circles. “I call them rounds,” said Brown. “The circle is a symbol of unity, harmony – so it feeds into the idea of the earth goddess.” She has used china clay as a base layer. “It’s an extremely fine material and shows off the bright colours beautifully – it makes them shine.” Brown is currently working on tiles made out of china clay that will be used to create a base around the statue. They are coated in Appledore mud that she scoops from the river just in front of her house. “It’s creamy and buttery, it feels like you could spread it on toast,” she said. When fired, it turns a lovely rusty colour with golden flecks. Earth Goddess will be presented to the world at the start of April. “I can’t wait to see her installed,” said Brown. “I’ve got no idea what people will make of her. I hope they’ll be proud.”",Arts/Art and design,Artwork that will be UK’s tallest ceramic sculpture takes shape in Devon,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/22/artwork-that-will-be-uks-tallest-ceramic-sculpture-takes-shape-in-devon
