1/2/2022,"Despite raging inflation and warnings from some prominent investors that the stock market is dangerously overheated, JPMorgan still expects a boost from “the January effect."" The phrase refers to the belief that the market’s best month tends to be the year’s first. This month, JPMorgan expects high-beta stocks with more volatility than the S&P 500 to outperform the market. The bank’s analysts say high-beta stocks entered an “outright bear market” in 2021. That’s not because of a lack of value; investors have been selling them off in favor of stocks that offer lower volatility. The low demand/high upside dynamic means “the January effect” could “be even more pronounced this time around” for high-beta stocks, according to JPMorgan analysts. If they’re right, these three stocks might be in for a leap. And perhaps you’ll decide that one is worth jumping on with some of your extra cash. Plug Power is at the forefront of the hydrogen fuel cell industry. By powering cars, trucks and large facilities like data centers and hospitals, HFC companies figure to be central to the planet’s sustainable future. Plug also produces liquid hydrogen and projects that it will be the top U.S. producer of sustainable liquid hydrogen by late 2023 or early 2024. That’s the good news. Now the bad. Plug’s Q3 earnings fell well short of expectations, while its net loss in the quarter hit $107 million, up from $65 million a year earlier. Plug has told investors that its gross margin remains under downward pressure from elevated production and fuel and service costs. Plug’s share price is down about 23% in the last month alone. But if you believe in the future of HFCs, or that ESG investors might buoy the company, this may be your chance to get in for cheap. Even after providing vaccine jabs for millions of people in 2021, Moderna has seen its stock slide about 18% in the last month. It’s down about 48% since peaking at $484.47 in August. Investors appear doubtful of Moderna’s ability to maintain the COVID-driven momentum that’s put it on track for $17 billion in sales in 2021. But the majority of Americans have not received their boosters so far, and many medical experts predict we’ll need more shots. And mRNA-based shots like Moderna’s may be easier to adapt to new variants of COVID that might emerge. Forbes has valued Moderna stock at $300 per share, which implies about 17% worth of upside if you were to buy at recent prices. But remember: If the swings for individual companies’ stocks are too risky for your taste, you could always fall back on a more diverse portfolio — a popular app even lets you build one with your spare change. Shares in social media platform Pinterest were in a queasy up-and-down pattern for most of 2021, but their value has trended steadily downward since July. Pinterest’s stock has dipped an eye-popping 54% in the last six months. There are several factors that contributed. In October, PayPal abandoned plans to acquire the company for $70 a share, a transaction that would have led to a $45 billion valuation for the platform. Pinterest’s third quarter earnings were solid — 43% year-over-year growth — but a paltry 1% increase in monthly active users during Q3, including a 10% decline in the U.S., marred results. But with its reputation as a positive place to find inspiration with an unobtrusive ad experience, Pinterest’s average revenue per user rose by 37% in Q3, driving overall revenue for the quarter to $633 million. Even if January is a big month for the stock market, there’s no telling how long those gains will last. If you’re looking to strengthen your portfolio with more reliable, long-term bets in 2022, you might want to put some money into fine art, which has outperformed the S&P 500 almost every year since 1995. It used to be that only the wealthy could afford to invest in modern masterpieces. But you can now buy shares in rapidly appreciating paintings by artists like Banksy, Monet and Warhol. The art won’t wind up on your wall, but it could look good in your diverse portfolio. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

1/2/2022,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- (This story was originally published Dec. 23. On Dec. 29, crypto platform Polygon revealed it recently fixed a bug that exposed some $24 billion of cryptocurrency to the risk of theft.) Most Read from Bloomberg Billionaires Are Embracing Crypto in Case Money ‘Goes to Hell’ Kids’ Covid Hospitalizations Hit Record in U.S. Omicron Surge U.S. Housing Crisis Only Gets Worse as Population Shrinks Cases Rise ‘Through the Roof’ as Omicron Sweeps Across U.S. Hawaii Is Rethinking Tourism. Here’s What That Means for You Cryptocurrencies made a giant leap in 2021, expanding well beyond their niche among geeks and Redditors. Wall Street strengthened its embrace, with Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman declaring it no fad. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams said he’ll initially get paid in Bitcoin. And tokenmania invaded pop culture, from sports, entertainment and gaming to high-end auctions. Even Major League Baseball umpires wore the FTX exchange’s logo on their chests. Yet the industry often failed to get the basics right, still plagued by the same problems that have dogged it from the start: trading glitches, infrastructure snafus, hacks and other crypto weirdness. Back when digital tokens fetched a pittance, this could be dismissed as a silly sideshow. Now, cryptocurrencies are worth real money — more than $2 trillion, assuming the tally isn’t garbled by a data error — and their backers want to overtake traditional finance and revolutionize much more. Their ability to do so — and crypto’s staying power — may hinge on addressing and fixing basic plumbing and security issues, assuming they can. The industry uses “the Facebook model of ‘move fast and break things,’” said Larry Tabb, head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence. “There's no regulatory push to solve these problems, so it just becomes more of an issue of competition. If I get fed up with one exchange, I'll switch to some other player.” Crypto believers argue that snags are to be expected in an industry that’s still in its early days. It will find its footing, they say. Perhaps. Whatever the future holds, there sure were a ton of major screw-ups in 2021. Just this month, CoinMarketCap, a go-to source for crypto prices, spewed out incredibly wrong data for the entire market. Bitcoin prices exceeding $800 billion were displayed on its website, which valued all tokens in circulation at $15 quintillion — roughly 660,000 times U.S. gross domestic product. The company, owned by digital-asset exchange Binance, responded in typically wacky crypto fashion: with glib, meme-filled tweets. “How did it feel to be a trillionaire for a couple hours?” read one, followed by the tears-of-joy emoji. Some industry watchers weren’t as sanguine in their response. The incident blew over, and even market players affected by the gaffe seemed willing to forgive and forget. “It’s honestly just one of the things that is indicative of an emerging industry,” Coinbase Global Inc. President Emilie Choi said during a Dec. 15 interview at the Bloomberg Technology Summit. While the CoinMarketCap incident didn’t appear to hurt anyone much, that wasn’t the case in other instances. Some mistakes sparked declines in Bitcoin, a situation compounded by the fact that automatic safety features — like the U.S. stock market’s circuit breakers — aren’t common in crypto. In October, a trader’s algo went haywire, sending the world’s biggest cryptocurrency down about 87% before it shot back up. In early December, Bitcoin saw a smaller but still harrowing plunge of as much as 20% when traders imprudently tried to sell too much amid thin weekend trading — exposing the downside of 24/7/365 crypto markets if there aren’t enough counterparties around. Some disruptions left investors unable to trade at all. When Bitcoin fell more than 10% on May 19, both Coinbase and Binance suffered outages. Bitfinex faltered on Sept. 30. Then there were moments when the blockchain infrastructure that powers crypto posed problems. Solana emerged in 2021 as a competitor to Ethereum, which is effectively a global supercomputer running software called smart contracts. But Solana broke for 17 hours in September, crippling a small but growing corner of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Separately, a project built on Solana — Pyth, which counts major Wall Street traders as contributors — encountered computer software bugs in September that caused the service to erroneously report a 90% plunge in the price of Bitcoin. These are only a handful of the many examples. “These are absolutely problems that need to be solved, but I think that there are pretty straightforward solutions to a lot of them,” Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of FTX, said this month on Bloomberg’s “What Goes Up” podcast.

Gox Shutdown Prompts Bitcoin Damage Control Efforts The 45-Millisecond Ether Flash Crash Prompts Safeguard Effort Other asset classes have also gotten ensnared in technology drama over the years. For instance, squirrels were a recurring nightmare for stocks, causing power outages that took down Nasdaq’s market in 1987 and then again in 1994. The infamous 2010 flash crash, in which the whole U.S. stock market dove to a trillion-dollar loss in minutes and then recovered just as quickly, badly spooked Wall Street. A key Nasdaq price-reporting service broke in 2013, freezing stocks like Apple Inc. for hours. Since a 3 1/2-hour New York Stock Exchange outage in 2015, though, it’s been mostly smooth sailing for equities-market infrastructure, evidence a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown got traders and exchanges to make their software more resilient. Crypto has much less oversight — at least for now — meaning the industry mostly gets to decide what, if any, safeguards to implement. Many Wall Streeters are now flocking there, bringing with them conventional ideas about protections. But the space was initially forged mostly by people without professional finance experience who may not have fully appreciated what it takes to build systems that can handle fast-paced modern trading.

FTX’s Bankman-Fried and FTX.US President Brett Harrison migrated to crypto after jobs in conventional finance, including the time both of them spent at trading firm Jane Street. “We’re used to how other exchanges work,” Harrison said on the “What Goes Up” podcast. FTX has something called price bands, which prevents trades if they’re at prices too far from current levels — similar to what’s seen in traditional markets. “If you haven’t been growing up in that environment, you don’t think to do this sort of stuff,” he added. Robert Zagotta used to work at CME Group Inc., the biggest U.S. derivatives exchange, and is now CEO of Bitstamp US, a crypto market. He thinks others in the industry don’t sweat technology hiccups. “I do not think our competitors think it’s critical to their success,” he said. “But based on my experience in traditional technology, I know it’s coming. It will be in 2022 and 2023.” Hacks are also a big problem in crypto, which is deeply connected to the internet — making it vulnerable — whereas in conventional finance computers are often walled off from the internet inside guarded data centers. Nasdaq was hacked about a decade ago, but its core trading computers weren’t infiltrated. Over in crypto, money gets drained from projects all the time. Hackers stole about $130 million from BadgerDAO earlier this month, while customers of crypto exchange BitMart lost about $150 million. Just this week came the worrisome revelation that a network upgrade made earlier in December by crypto platform Polygon was done to fix to a “critical vulnerability” that could have allowed a hacker to steal some $24 billion of a token called MATIC. Many of the coins were stolen nevertheless. Polygon was tipped off to the problem by white-hat hackers — computer-science jargon for people who discover a vulnerability and report it. They were paid a $3.46 million bounty, showcasing another quirk of crypto and the incentive structures that aim to keep it working and secure. Crypto culture is simply different from traditional finance, so some weird stuff is inevitable. Take the $532 million non-fungible token trade that took place this year — or, more accurately, appeared to take place but really didn’t since the buyer and the seller were the same person. Except for trading fees, no money changed hands, meaning all the pseudo-transaction really did was draw attention to the hot NFT market. Maybe that was the point? And then there was the person who mistakenly sold a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for roughly 100 times less than they’d intended — for $3,066 instead of about $300,000 — because of a typo. In the stock market, that might have been blocked by something called a fat-finger check, which aims to prevent erroneous keystrokes from causing mistaken trades. Some are optimistic and think crypto technology is getting more robust and less prone to mistakes, catching up to traditional finance, or TradFi in crypto-speak. “In the old days, there were lots and lots of bugs and idiosyncrasies in many exchanges,” said Michael Safai, founding partner of proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital. “Exchanges are definitely investing in the demand they’re seeing this past year to get to that professional level that TradFi has been at for a few decades.” Still, much of crypto is built on the idea of no take-backs — once a transaction happens on a blockchain, it’s supposed to be a done deal. So the passwords protecting Bitcoin and other crypto assets have to be guarded carefully; it’s far easier for hackers to swipe that, and therefore your coins, than it is to get at real dollars sitting in a real bank account with insurance backing it up. And don’t lose track of them: Some digital tokens are literally lost in garbage dumps, on mouldering hard drives. That raises a question: Is that too much to expect of crypto holdouts, creating a big hurdle to mainstream adoption?

1/2/2022,"Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag says Aerospace stocks are not pricing in recovery as sentiment is negative, and stocks are trading at about a 27% discount to normalized 2019 levels. The analyst named TransDigm Group Inc (NYSE: TDG), her top pick in Aerospace in North America for 2022. She has an Overweight rating and a price target of 2 (an upside of 20.12%) on the company. Liwag views TransDigm as a pureplay on the aftermarket and sees the potential for upside to her and consensus estimates depending on the pace of an air traffic recovery. In terms of Defense, Liwag named Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: NOC) as her ""preferred Defense prime,"" calling it her ""preferred way to play the Great Power Competition theme in 2022."" She is particularly bullish on the company's space portfolio and sees an additional runway for growth there. Liwag has an Overweight rating and a 0 (an upside of 14%) price target on Northrop shares. Liwag also argues that Northrop today is similar to Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: LMT) a decade ago with the F-35 given its position as the prime contractor for the B-21 bomber and Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent put it ""on the cusp of major platform-fueled growth."" She has an Overweight rating and a price target of 0 (an upside of 22%) on Lockheed Martin shares. Price Action: TDG shares traded higher by 0.10% at $635.06, NOC higher by 0.11% at $384.94, and LMT lower by 0.27% at $352.62 on the last check Friday.
