4/23/2022,"Seven Russians now under sanctions were awarded controversial “golden visas” by the UK after Vladimir Putin’s regime first invaded Ukraine in 2014, the government has admitted. The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February amid the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s border as it prepared to broaden its occupation beyond Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Since the invasion, sanctions targeted at many of Russia’s richest businessmen have become a key part of the response by the UK and its allies. The measures have also prompted awkward questions for the government, with critics accusing it of offering an open door to kleptocrats and oligarchs, who in some cases are thought to have expropriated wealth from the Russian state on a massive scale. Much of that wealth has been used to buy luxury property in London. The golden visa scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. Before 2018 it is thought that minimal checks were carried out on investors or the source of their wealth. The government revealed that 10 Russians who received golden visas are now subject to sanctions, an increase from the eight previously admitted, in a written answer to a question from Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister. Kevin Foster, a junior Home Office minister said seven of those 10 Russian nationals “either obtained an initial grant of leave or obtained further leave via the route after 2014”. The government declined to name the people who received the visas, despite demands from Labour and Spotlight on Corruption, a campaign group. In 2014 David Cameron, then prime minister, said Russia must “choose the path of diplomacy and de-escalation, or face increasing isolation and tighter and tighter sanctions”. However, the latest data suggested that the government continued to wave through visas for Russian nationals now considered by officials to play key roles in supporting Putin’s regime. “Putin’s invasion of Crimea should clearly have been a fork in the road for how the British government viewed Russian oligarch investors,” said Kinnock. “It therefore beggars belief that – even after the threat posed by Putin to western security and British interests had been exposed – the Conservative government continued to award grants of tier 1 (investor) leave to seven of Putin’s cronies who would later be sanctioned.” Spotlight on Corruption said the latest revelation made it even more urgent that the government release a 2018 report on the golden visa scheme. A minister last month committed to publish it, but the government has not yet done so. Susan Hawley, the group’s executive director, said: “This is compelling evidence of the frankly shocking complacency in the UK government about Russian money coming to the UK even after Russia started its aggression against Ukraine in 2014. “The golden visa regime looks increasingly like a state-sponsored scheme to enable kleptocracy. The lessons must be learned for the UK visa regime across the board.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have made it clear we will not tolerate abuse of our immigration system and we have closed the tier 1 (investor) route with immediate effect to ensure that those who have profited from dirty money cannot gain access to the UK. “We want to make it clear that the UK is no safe haven for those who enable the Putin regime. By implementing the largest and strongest sanctions package in the UK’s history, we are continuing to crack down on these individuals and making sure they pay the price.”",News/News,UK gave sanctioned Russians ‘golden visas’ after first Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/22/russians-sanctioned-uk-given-golden-visas-ukraine-invasion
4/23/2022,"Boris Johnson is preparing a “fix” to set aside some of the Northern Ireland Brexit arrangements in a high-risk move that could provoke a row with the EU and lead to further accusations that the UK is breaching international law. The prime minister told reporters in India that the UK is ready to take measures if necessary to “fix” the deal with the EU governing post-Brexit trading arrangements with Northern Ireland. The prime minister claimed the Northern Ireland protocol “does not command the confidence of a large part” of the population in the region. “The protocol really does not command the confidence of a large, large component of the population in Northern Ireland. We have to address that, we have to fix that,” Johnson told a news conference in Delhi. “We think we can do it with some very simple and reasonable steps. “We have talked repeatedly to our friends and partners in the EU. We will continue to talk to them. “But, as I have said many times now, we don’t rule out taking steps now if those are necessary.” His comments come two days after Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg warned the UK would “reform” the protocol if the EU did not. Speculation is rife in Northern Ireland industry circles that the government is planning an “internal market bill 2.0” as part of the Queen’s speech – a reference to the controversial 2020 attempt to unilaterally tear up some of the protocol. Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns told LBC radio he refused to be drawn on the specifics of the moves, which Rees-Mogg described as “in motion”. But he said: “I hope Brussels are listening to this conversation and other conversations. “I hope they will come back to the table constructively to allow us to change the protocol to make it work in the way it was intended. “If they don’t hear that, then the government reserves the right, as we have always said, as laid down in the protocol, to take remedial action.” The shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle condemned the plan as “absolutely astonishing and incredibly damaging”. “If we just recklessly pull out of it unilaterally, how will any other country in the world sign a deal with us and think that we will honour it?” he said. “How will Prime Minister Modi react today when Boris Johnson asks for a trade deal if he is pulling out unilaterally of the last trade deal he signed?” he told Sky News. The government has always maintained its right to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, but this will force the UK and the EU back into talks. Rees-Mogg hinted two days ago that the UK would be triggering section 38 (b) of the parent EU Withdrawal Agreement Act 2020 which restates the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. But the move risks further accusations that, while the UK is free to legislate whatever domestics laws it choses, proposed changes to the Northern Ireland protocol may not be compliant with the international treaty signed with the EU. Giving evidence to the EU scrutiny committee this week, Rees-Mogg declared in relation to section 38 (b) of the withdrawal agreement: “We can do what we want, ultimately.”",News/Politics,Johnson preparing to ‘fix’ Northern Ireland Brexit deal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/johnson-preparing-to-fix-northern-ireland-brexit-deal
4/23/2022,"A root and branch review of children’s social care in Wales is needed after the case of five-year-old Logan Mwangi, who was killed by his mother and stepfather after being removed from the child protection register, a leading social work expert has said. Prof Donald Forrester said the case highlighted critical issues affecting many children’s social services in Wales, ranging from social worker capacity and staffing shortages to high and increasing numbers of children being taken into care. Logan’s mother, stepfather and a teenage boy who cannot be identified for legal reasons were convicted on Thursday of murdering Logan after subjecting him to months of abuse and violence. Logan was found dead in a river with more than 50 injuries to his body. Forrester said it was impossible to prevent child deaths of this nature ever happening again and there were no “simple solutions” but the case offered an opportunity for the country to take stock of children’s social care. “We really should be taking a step back and saying: ‘is this [the current system] working. Or could we do it better?’” said Forrester, the director of the Cascade children’s social care research centre at Cardiff University. “Child protection is always difficult, and Covid made it even more difficult. What we have seen is a system already under strain coming under even more stress,” he added Wales has the highest proportion of children in care outside their home of all UK countries, according to latest figures, with Welsh young people twice as likely to be placed in care than in England. Numbers of looked-after children in Wales have risen by 80% since 2003. It also shares with other countries in the UK problems relating to child social worker shortages, with some councils reportedly having vacancy rates of up to 40% and heavily reliant on temporary staff. However, Wales is the only one which has not undertaken a recent review of children’s social care. Scotland’s care review reported in 2020, Northern Ireland’s launched in February, and England’s is due to report in May. The court case suggested safeguarding authorities in Logan’s home town of Bridgend potentially missed a series of clues and reports that Logan was at high risk of abuse. Just weeks before his death, social workers took him off the child protection register, suggesting he was not considered to be in immediate danger. The local safeguarding children board has launched a child practice review to determine whether and why social workers and other safeguarding professionals failed to take chances to intervene to save Logan, though this is unlikely to report before the autumn at the earliest. An inspection by the Welsh care watchdog carried out just months before Logan’s death found child protection teams managed by Bridgend county borough council were struggling to provide uniformly safe and comprehensive services to vulnerable children as demand rose during the pandemic. The assurance check by Care Inspectorate Wales, published in November, said the council’s support for some families was “fragmented” and inconsistent in relation to child safeguarding issues. It highlighted vacancies in children’s teams and problems coping with the volume and complexity of cases. It also found examples of good practice, and noted “positive examples of a multi-agency approach to risk management and of practitioners, partners and agencies working together effectively sharing information, identifying and monitoring vulnerable children and adults’ needs and risks”. The children’s commissioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, said: “In respect of this case, we must allow due process to take place and allow the regional safeguarding board to undertake its review. “In the wider landscape, the Welsh government has consulted on its white paper for reform of social care in Wales; this work needs to be brought forward in line with the programme for government commitments, to ensure children’s rights are protected and promoted, wherever they are living.” A spokesperson for the Welsh government said: “This is such a tragic case and our thoughts are with everyone affected by Logan’s death. It is of vital importance now for both the child practice review and the planned inspection by Care Inspectorate Wales to be completed.”",News/Society,"Logan Mwangi’s murder: major review of Welsh social care needed, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/22/logan-mwangi-murder-welsh-social-care-review-needed
4/23/2022,"Football tactics are complex chains of reasoning. Football tactics have a chaos theory element. Football tactics must always return to certain key tenets of space and movement. Very bright people are employed to stare at this seeking the tiniest margins of influence. But sometimes you do wonder about the obvious things. For example, the great innovation of the past 15 years has been the way teams attack “between the lines”, as embodied by inside-forwards, false nines and their many shades. We remember the story of Pep Guardiola’s late-night phone call to Lionel Messi back in May 2009, babbling about switching his role to “the Messi zone”. This wasn’t new: Hungary were doing the same thing to England’s rigid lines 66 years before. But it created a trend and pretty much all elite teams are now geared to attacking that area between midfield and defence, between full-back and centre-half. This is how the best players torture defences. Between the lines: this is the weak spot. So, just a thought. Why are there still lines? Why, if between the lines is such a problem, are we still offering up a flat back four, a three, a deep five? Why do defences still set up like they’re expecting an attack based on the previous 120 years of linear orthodoxy? It’s as though two decades after the invention of the musket the French infantry is still insisting the answer to this game-changing ballistic weapon is brighter battlefield tunics and a more inspiring trumpeter. And yes this kind of “child’s eye” tactical pub-chat sounds more convincing when it comes from, say, Johan Cruyff, who had the advantage of being a genius, seer and visionary. And no doubt most managers would prefer to avoid a 14-0 defeat while trying to stop Messi and Neymar with a revolutionary mix of false full-backs, “jagged lines” and messing up your offside trap. But there is surely some kind of innovation waiting to happen here. Struggling to defend between the lines? Don’t have lines. Jonah Hill can play me in the movie. This is a very roundabout way of getting on to Harry Kane and the Premier League goalscoring record. Kane has become his own attacking innovation in the past few years, a forward who doesn’t so much play between the lines, as occupy two orthodox positions, the nine and the 10, in rotation. It has been fascinating to follow him, from the early days of high-throttle centre-forward play, when he still looked like an ambitious young Edwardian notary clerk who wants to marry your daughter; through to his current incarnation as creator, disruptor, goalscorer, and bearer of all those fragile Tottenham hopes. At the same time other elements in Kane’s personal horizon have continued to shrink. He turns 29 in July. Judging by the noises off this week he seems more likely to stay at Tottenham now, committing the entirety of his peak years to his boyhood club. And why not? The task of driving Spurs on towards one trophy, any trophy, is as noble as hoovering up the financially inevitable shared glory available at one of the mega-clubs. But if Kane does stay the pursuit of that scoring record will come into sharper focus, a marker of what he can still achieve. Does it matter? Are records really interesting? Why is this one even a thing when it simply refers to a commercially defined period of time, a graphic on Sky Sports, wilfully overlooking the fact Jimmy Greaves has 357 of these top-flight goals, Ian Rush 232, Tony Cottee 214? In this case the numbers are interesting, if only because the record itself looks increasingly like an anachronism, something that belongs outside football’s evolution into a game of systems and team play, of finding space outside those lines. These are the standings. Kane has 178 goals, 82 short of Alan Shearer’s Premier League mark of 260. He needs four 20-goal seasons from here, taking him up to 33 years old. It feels doable. Shearer scored a similar number past the same age. Kane just needs to repeat the most prolific period of his career either side of turning 30, not get injured, not become a midfielder, not play abroad, and he may just reach that summit. One thing worth saying at this point is: how good was Shearer? Never mind the longevity, Shearer also had three 30-plus goalscoring years before Euro 96 when he was one of the best players in the world. Memories may be clouded by the later version, who seemed to reinterpret football as a game to be played while walking backwards, arms outstretched like a man groping for the bathroom light. But peak Shearer had supreme mobility, passing, shooting power and above all a thrilling sense of ruthlessness. Like Kane, Shearer was also an outlier. Both stayed at clubs where Premier League games are the most vital games, and where your own ability to score is the key tactical element. How many footballers of that quality will do this from here? In any case the numbers are more equally shared now. Thirty-goal individual seasons are rare. Players move leagues more often. If Kane doesn’t get that record there is a fair chance nobody ever will. Certainly very few of the current crop are anywhere near it. Mo Salah needs five more seasons to get close. Romelu Lukaku is on a very creditable 118. The only other under-30 in the top 30 is Raheem Sterling, the only under-25 in the mix Marcus Rashford with 59. Otherwise it’s packed out with Dion Dublins and James Beatties, remnants of a time when the career centre-forward roamed the land, nose buried in the rushes, blind to the approaching asteroid. Kane has found his own variation on the role of chief scorer in the time of between-the-lines, of team play and shared roles. It makes him a note of interest, a genuine star outside the elite; and who knows, perhaps the last great one-club goalscorer, out there in pursuit of his own white whale.",Sport/Football,"Harry Kane, the evolving outlier, may be among the last great one-club goalscorers | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/harry-kane-the-evolving-outlier-may-be-among-the-last-great-one-club-goalscorers
4/23/2022,"The actor Michel Bouquet, who has died aged 96, was already middle-aged by the time he found fame playing baleful, corrupt or complacent figures in films by the New Wave provocateur Claude Chabrol. He was a cuckolded husband who kills his wife’s lover in La Femme Infidèle (The Unfaithful Wife, 1969) and an advertising executive who accidentally kills his own lover in Juste Avant La Nuit (Just Before Nightfall, 1971). In between, he did some of his wickedest work as a wealthy tyrant besmirching his daughter-in-law’s name as he plots to gain custody of his grandson in La Rupture (The Breach, 1970). Each of these films paired him with the director’s wife, Stéphane Audran, and portrayed “the petit bourgeois household as unsparingly as Thérèse Raquin or Madame Bovary”, as the critic Nigel Andrews put it. Bouquet lent the most unsavoury characters a compelling inner life, even when they lingered only briefly on screen. In François Truffaut’s Hitchcockian thriller The Bride Wore Black (1968), he was one of the men murdered by a widow (Jeanne Moreau) seeking revenge for her husband’s death. His demise is especially grisly – he expires on the floor of his seedy hotel room after being poisoned – but the actor conveyed hidden dimensions which made the victim a plausibly pitiful figure, rather than merely cannon fodder. (“I can count on one, no, two hands how many women I’ve had,” he says.) He was equally fine, though scarcely more likable, as a detective in Truffaut’s Mississippi Mermaid (1969). Though many audiences first saw Bouquet in his New Wave films, he had decades of stage and screen work behind him by that point. Even viewers who did not know the face may have recognised the voice: his controlled, emotionless tones were heard in Alain Resnais’s sobering Holocaust documentary Night and Fog (1955). His narration was written by Jean Cayrol, who survived the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp; Truffaut called the 32-minute short “the most noble and necessary film ever made”. Bouquet was born in Paris, to Georges, an officer in the French army, and Marie (nee Monot), a milliner. He worked as a baker and a bank clerk to help support his family, then took acting lessons at the age of 17 from the stage actor Maurice Escande. He enrolled at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts in Paris; a role in the 1946 production of Jean Anouilh’s Le Rendez-vous de Senlis began an enduring association with that playwright which continued with Roméo et Jeanette in 1953. Bouquet also helped to popularise the work of Harold Pinter among French audiences, and was a tireless interpreter of Molière, Beckett and Ionesco; he played the lead role in Ionesco’s play Exit the King more than 800 times. It was Anouilh who co-wrote the screenplay for Monsieur Vincent, which in 1947 provided Bouquet with one of his first screen roles, and won the Oscar for best foreign film; he played a consumptive opposite Pierre Fresnay as the 17th-century saint Vincent de Paul. In the same year, he was seen as a killer in the drama Criminal Brigade. He played Louis X in Abel Gance’s La Tour de Nesle (1954) and a priest at a Catholic boarding school in Jean Delannoy’s Les Amitiés Particulières (Special Friends, 1964). His initial films with Chabrol — the knowingly absurd spy thrillers Le Tigre se Parfume à la Dynamite (Our Agent Tiger, 1965) and La Route de Corinthe (The Road to Corinth, 1968), which co-starred Jean Seberg – were hardly characteristic of either of them, and gave little hint of the rich collaboration ahead. In Borsalino, he was third-billed as a lawyer on the trail of gangsters played by Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon, though he got a bigger bite of the cherry as the title character in The Cop (also 1970), which showed a disillusioned police officer taking the law into his own hands a full year before Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry did the same. The unsparing depiction of police brutality and corruption led the French minister of the interior, Raymond Marcellin, to call for the film to be banned. In the dreamlike horror Malpertuis (1971), Bouquet was a mysterious Uriah Heep-style figure who quivers with delight while being abused and insulted; Orson Welles and Susan Hampshire co-starred. He was another cop in the murky policier Deux Hommes Dans la Ville (Two Men in Town, 1973), this time remorselessly hounding an ex-convict (Delon) in the manner of Inspector Javert from Les Misèrables – whom he later played in Robert Hossein’s handsome 1982 film version, with Lino Ventura as his quarry Jean Valjean. Theatre provided him with many of his most prestigious roles – he was presented with the best actor award by the French Critics’ Circle in 1976 for his performance in René de Obaldia’s Monsieur Klebs et Rosalie, and played Pozzo in Waiting for Godot two years later. On screen, there was a delicious reunion with Chabrol in the thriller Cop au Vin (1985), with Bouquet as a dastardly lawyer. Just as he had been “discovered” by the New Wave directors at the end of the 1960s, so he was now introduced to a new generation of cinemagoers via the imaginative and original Belgian comedy Toto the Hero (1991). Bouquet was the ageing, bitter narrator, who looks back enviously on the life he would have enjoyed had he not (as he believes) been swapped with another infant at birth. More plum parts followed. The director Anne Fontaine had him in mind when she wrote How I Killed My Father (2001), in which she cast him as an estranged patriarch returning to France to complicate the life of his son, played by Charles Berling. Bouquet won the best actor César for his performance in that film, and another for playing France’s former president in The Last Mitterrand (2005). He and Philippe Noiret reprised their stage roles as dyspeptic pensioners in Bertrand Blier’s film of his own play Les Côtelletes (2003). In Renoir (2012), Bouquet was agreeably spry as the elderly artist opposite Vincent Rottiers as his film-maker son, Jean, and Christa Théret as their muse. At 91, he was back on stage in Paris as Orgon in Molière’s Tartuffe. He is survived by his wife, the actor Juliette Carré, whom he married in 1970. His first marriage, to the actor Ariane Borg, ended in divorce.

4/23/2022,"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to ration cooking oil as the Russia-Ukraine war chokes off the flow of sunflower oil to the UK food industry, further raising the cost of popular items such as crisps and chips. Most of the UK’s sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and the war has had a devastating impact on availability as exports ground to a halt. With firms left scrabbling to source other vegetable oils, the price of cooking oil in the shops is about a 20% higher than a year ago. Tesco has introduced a buying limit of three bottles per customer across its entire cooking oil range. The UK’s biggest retailer says it has good availability of cooking oil but on its website a small number of vegetable oils are out of stock. Tesco is following in the footsteps of Morrisons and Waitrose which have already limited purchases to two a person. Waitrose said it was “closely monitoring the situation and working with our suppliers to ensure customers continue to have a choice of cooking oils”. Sainsbury’s and Asda have yet to take any action. As well as being a cupboard staple at home, sunflower oil can also be found in hundreds of products, from ready meals to crisps, and biscuits to mayonnaise. Tom Lock, founder of The British Snack Company, which makes hand-cooked crisps for sale in pubs, said that after potatoes, its other key ingredient was sunflower oil. “Sunflower oil is the industry standard for snacks,” said Lock who explained the company had been forced to switch to rapeseed oil. “It is impossible to get sunflower oil in any quantity. You just can’t get it. We’ve secured enough rapeseed to get us through to August, but we are paying three times as much for it as we were for sunflower oil a year ago.” Lock said it was inevitable that price increases would be passed on to the customer. “We’ve already done one price increase to our customers this year,” he said. As an interim step to make sure foods such as crisps, breaded fish, frozen vegetables and chips remain on sale, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said suppliers can switch to using rapeseed oil and allow their labels to catch up. Shoppers should look out for stickers on packets and on shelves explaining any recipe change, it advises. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said some retailers had put limits on cooking oil purchases “as a temporary measure to ensure availability for everyone”. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, deputy director of food, said that where sunflower oil had been substituted retailers would “change product labels as soon as possible”. Gary Lewis, of oil importer KTC Edibles, said that vegetable oil prices had eased off their recent highs but were still “way up” on before the war. Other factors, such as the crop problems linked to Covid and the climate crisis, as well as the competing demand for biofuels, were also underpinning the market, he said. “Prices are still extremely high and that will contribute towards the high inflation around the world.” On Friday, Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, announced it would ban exports of cooking oil and its raw materials to reduce domestic shortages and hold down skyrocketing prices. President Joko Widodo announced the ban, a day after hundreds of people protested in the capital against rising food costs. It begins next Thursday and will last for an undetermined length of time.",News/Business,Tesco to ration cooking oil purchases as war in Ukraine hits food prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/tesco-to-ration-cooking-oil-purchases-as-war-in-ukraine-hits-food-prices
4/23/2022,"The incoming boss of the Sports Direct owner Frasers Group has been handed his biggest ever payout, netting a near-£21m consultancy fee as he prepares to take over from the founder, Mike Ashley, next month. Michael Murray, the Frasers “head of elevation”, who is engaged to Ashley’s daughter Anna, is being handed a cash payment three times larger than any previous sum he has earned from Sports Direct. It is being made under a controversial agreement in which Murray is paid a consultancy fee based on value generated under property deals made for the company. Murray’s MM Prop Consultancy Ltd is entitled to up to 25% of any value created by its services to Frasers, which also owns the House of Fraser department stores, the designer fashion chain Flannels, the gaming retailer and events group Game, Evans Cycles and Jack Wills. The £20.9m payment handed to Murray for 2022 comes after a £2.5m sum in 2021 and £9.7m in payouts during 2019 and 2020. Those payouts were already far in excess of the £150,000 a year paid to Sports Direct’s previous senior executives, such as former CEO Dave Forsey. The Doncaster-born son of a property developer, who began by helping Ashley with personal real estate deals a few years after meeting Anna on holiday in 2011, could also be handed shares worth more than £100m if he more than doubles its share price to £15 by 2025 under a new pay deal which comes into force from 1 May. The share price currently stands at £6.93. Almost half of the independent shareholders in Frasers rejected the group’s plans for the £100m bonus scheme and more than half came out against a pay rise and bonus for the group’s finance director, Chris Wootton. In an announcement to the stock market late on Friday, Frasers said the latest payout was being made after an assessment of the final terms of Murray’s consultancy deal before he moved to his new role. It said the assessment had been made “with the assistance of independent third-party experts”. Frasers said the deal included a 40% discount agreed with Murray as part of the “finalisation and cessation” of the consultancy agreement. The board of Frasers said: “The agreement with MM Prop Consultancy Ltd has delivered significant financial and strategic value for the group and its stakeholders. We are delighted that Michael will now drive us forward in our elevation journey, which we are already making strong progress with.” Murray said: “I am very excited to be leading Frasers Group in its next chapter and am confident we are going to take the group to new heights with the progress we are making in our elevation strategy.”",News/Business,Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group to hand nearly £21m to incoming chief,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/mike-ashleys-frasers-group-to-hand-nearly-21m-to-incoming-chief
4/23/2022,"Tyson Fury has promised fans “a real war” when he defends his WBC heavyweight title against Dillian Whyte at Wembley on Saturday night after weighing in 11lb lighter than his last fight. Despite looking a little fleshy around the waist, Fury said he was in great shape for his first contest in Britain in more than three years after stepping on to the scales at 18st 12lb – significantly less than the third bout of his trilogy with Deontay Wilder last October. “Shout and respect to Dillian and his team, proper professional men, and we are going to give you a real fucking fight,” said Fury, who claimed he was feeling the benefits of a 14-week training camp. “Don’t doubt us. We are going to put a show on. It’s going to be a war. “People are going to be enjoying this fight because we are putting it all on the line. We’ve both trained very well. As you can see I’m in a fantastic mood, my spirits are high. We’re ready to have a fight.” Fury, who has an unbeaten record of 31 wins and a draw with 22 knockouts, wished his opponent luck at the stare down after the weigh-in, which was notable for its lack of needle. Not only did both fighters shake hands, they even traded hats before posing for photographs. “He looks focused, he looks ready,” said Fury. “But at the end of the day, he can’t beat the Gypsy King. Nobody can. I’ve proved it time and time again.” Whyte will enter the ring as a 4-1 underdog, but after weighing in at 18st 1lb he insisted he was ready to take full advantage of an overdue shot at the heavyweight title. “It’s taken a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of patience,” said Whyte, who has two defeats in 30 fights. “But I’m ready to go to war.” Whyte has suggested that Fury could be on the slide because “giants age faster”. However Fury’s father, John, who has helped supervise his son’s training camp, insisted that was nonsense. “Not this giant. People can surmise all they want but facts and fictions are different things. If I didn’t think my son was up to it 100% he wouldn’t be here. He’d have retired long ago.
