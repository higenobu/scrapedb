12/24/2021,"Selfridges’ new owners are taking control of a premium brand in a deal that will reunite the department store with its former boss. The Weston family, owners of Selfridges since 2003, have sold their European department stores to a Thai conglomerate, Central Retail group, and an Austrian property company, Signa Holding, which already jointly own upmarket department stores in Italy, Germany and Denmark through a division run by the former Selfridges head Vittorio Radice.  The deal is the latest instalment of a rollercoaster history for the brand founded by a retail legend. After more than 20 years rising through the ranks of the Marshall Field’s store in Chicago, in 1906 the US entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge arrived in the UK with one intention: to found a great department store. By some accounts, he was tempted to the UK by Liverpudlian Samuel J Waring Jr, who had built up a string of furnishings stores in London and wanted someone to run a neighbouring shop to his new Waring and Gillow outlet on Oxford Street. It was initially intended to be called Selfridge-Waring store, but Selfridge took control when his partner hit financial difficulties and the new store opened in March 1909 under his name alone. From the start, Selfridge embraced retail theatre and was determined his store would be “a civic centre, where friends can meet and buying is only a secondary consideration”. On the opening day, which drew enormous crowds, the store dazzled shoppers with live music, abundant floral displays and copious lighting in its airy halls. The store sold a huge range of goods but, out of respect for his early business partner, not food or furnishings. It housed a library, a rest room for ladies, a picture gallery and a restaurant linked to a roof garden. Selfridges set a new benchmark for UK department stores, ditching the tradition of housing staff above the shop and opting for large modern window displays more akin to advertising than the practice of piling up as many goods as possible. When the store was awarded one of English Heritage’s blue plaques in 2003, the charity said: “It is largely thanks to Selfridge that Oxford Street remains the commercial heart of the West End.” The store was originally much smaller than today but gradually extended backwards and westwards along Oxford Street through the 1920s, to consume almost two blocks. At one point it encompassed 100 departments, including a shooting range and an ice rink, and today houses a cinema. From the late 1920s, Selfridges expanded across the UK, but these provincial stores were sold off to John Lewis in the 1940s and the founder was ousted from its board. The Oxford Street flagship was bought up by the Liverpool-based owners of the Lewis’s department stores group. In 1965 Selfridges was bought by the Sears group, owner of a string of high street footwear brands including Dolcis and Saxone. It was used as the launchpad for the Miss Selfridge chain and opened a food hall and hotel, but gradually became fusty and unloved. The department store was demerged from the ailing Sears in 1998, two years after appointing Radice, an Italian retail expert and previously the boss of Habitat, as managing director. Radice led a bold £100m reinvention of the store as a “house of brands”, taking it more upmarket. Just like Gordon Selfridge, he courted publicity with elaborate events, and launched the brand’s re-expansion outside London. In 2003 Selfridges, then listed on the London Stock Exchange, was bought by the Canadian billionaire Galen Weston for more than £600m, just after Radice’s 2002 exit for an unsuccessful stint running Marks & Spencer’s furniture division. The Westons, one of Canada’s richest families, first confirmed in June this year they may consider selling their European department stores after an approach by a mystery buyer. The deal includes Selfridges’ four UK stores – in London, Birmingham and two in Manchester – as well as Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland and De Bijenkorf in the Netherlands. It also covers about £2bn of the chain’s prime property assets, including the freehold of its listed Oxford Street flagship store in London, but not the family’s Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada. It is not clear why the Westons decided to sell during a pandemic. However, the auction began shortly after the death of Galen Weston, 80, head of the family. Central Retail group and Signa Holding are taking ownership just as the business is likely to require an influx of new funds. In the year to February 2020, Selfridges’ sales rose by 7% to £1.97bn, but profits fell 10% to £88m. Since then, department stores, especially in London, have suffered from a drop in international travel, while their large expensive buildings continue to attract high property taxes and they have been forced to close for lengthy periods during high street lockdowns.",News/Business,Selfridges sale one more chapter in luxury brand’s rollercoaster history ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/24/selfridges-sale-one-more-chapter-in-luxury-brands-rollercoaster-history
12/24/2021,"Australians will soon be able to access Covid-19 vaccine booster shots four months after their second dose, then the wait will be shortened again. The government has said the minimum interval will be cut from five to four months on 4 January, and reduced to three months on 31 January.  The move, announced on Friday, follows calls from state premiers to speed up the shots to better protect against the more infectious Omicron variant. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said maximising booster coverage – if combined with “enhanced public health and social measures” – may prevent a large surge in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said the decision was “based on the science and the medical advice” but acknowledged it also took into account logistical challenges, such as the exhaustion of the health workforce. “It’s just not feasible to suddenly give those large numbers their doses during this period,” Kelly told reporters in Canberra. He said it was important to continue to prioritise groups who would be most at risk of severe illness from Covid-19. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the changes to intervals would increase the number of people who were eligible for boosters from 3.2 million now to 7.5 million as of 4 January. Shortening access to three months on 31 January would mean 16 million Australians would then be eligible. Hunt said the decision was “all about following the medical advice and making sure that there’s an orderly staged process”. “So, of course, there has to be a priority program,” Hunt said, joining the press conference by video link from Melbourne. “The alternative of suddenly putting an extra 4 million people who would displace the older or more immunocompromised and less presently vaccinated is absolutely at odds with the right way.” Hunt said Australia had “more than enough supply of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to roll out booster doses to the newly eligible cohort from 4 January”. In its formal advice, Atagi recommended bringing forward the minimum interval from five months to four months for over-18s “as soon as practical, noting the holiday period”. “It is understood that this is achievable from 4 January, although some providers may have flexibility to administer before that time,” the advice said. “In addition, as soon as practicalities allow, Atagi recommends providing boosters to all eligible adults from a minimum of 3 months following the second dose of the primary course.” Atagi said it expected an earlier booster does would reduce the risk of symptomatic infection, severe illness and death from Covid-19, and could play a role in reducing impacts on the health system. The advisory body said while some early data indicated the risk of hospitalisation due to Omicron was lower than with the Delta variant, “this difference would not be enough to offset the impact of high case numbers on the health system”. “Atagi expects that booster vaccination alone will not be sufficient to avert a surge due to Omicron,” the body said in advice published on Friday. “However, maximising booster coverage by expanding eligibility and encouraging high uptake, in combination with enhanced public health and social measures, may prevent a large surge in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths.” New South Wales on Friday reported 5,612 new cases of Covid, while Victoria had 2,095 cases and numbers in other states and territories also continued to rise. Kelly told reporters Australians should expect to see a continuation of the “very rapid rise in cases” as a result of Omicron – but the country had “three main weapons” to use against the variant. In addition to the vaccination and booster program, Kelly cited public health and social measures – such as mask mandates – and noted that the states were now in “pretty close alignment”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday declined to specifically endorse mask mandates – contrary to the latest health advice – but instead “highly recommended” that Australians to wear them in indoor settings. The following day the NSW government – which had similarly been emphasising “personal responsibility” performed a U-turn and reintroduced mask mandates. Many other states and territories have also tightened restrictions. Kelly said the third weapon in the fight against Omicron was test, trace, isolation and quarantine arrangements. He and the state and territory chief health officers have been asked to report back to national cabinet in early January to consider policy changes in response to Omicron, including the definition of close contacts and who should be told to stay at home. The announcement comes a day after the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, predicted Atagi would recommend bringing forward boosters, and called on the government to prepare for it. Hunt had on Thursday branded Albanese’s comments as “utterly irresponsible, utterly inappropriate, utterly unworthy of somebody who wants to be a PM”. But on Friday the health minister said the bringing forward of booster shots should come as “no surprise”. Hunt and Kelly both made the point the changes did not mean people were “overdue” for the booster the day they became eligible. The minister said the vaccination program for children aged five to 11 years – due to begin on 10 January – was “proceeding precisely according to the schedule”. He said the Therapeutic Goods Administration was making “great progress with batch testing”, and he hoped no Australians “would want us to delay or defer childhood vaccination”.",News/Australia news,Millions more Australians to be eligible for Covid booster as interval reduced to four months ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/millions-more-australians-to-be-eligible-for-covid-booster-as-interval-reduced-to-four-months
12/24/2021,"The family owners of Selfridges have sold out to a Thai retailer and an Austrian property company for an estimated £4bn ($5.36bn) in a deal which sees the return of the luxury department store’s former boss Vittorio Radice. Thailand’s Central Group and Austrian real estate company Signa Holding already jointly own major department stores in Italy, Germany and Denmark via a division run by Radice, who left Selfridges in 2002, the year before Canada’s Weston family bought it for £628m.  The firms are thought to have beaten off rival bids from the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns Harrods, and Lane Crawford, a Hong Kong-based department store owner. The Thai group, which began with one store in Bangkok run by Tiang Chirathivat in the 1950s, last year listed part of the business on the Thai stock exchange, and has other interests in convenience stores, shopping centres and hotels. Signa is owned and run by René Benko, one of Austria’s richest men. The deal with the Westons includes Selfridges’ four UK stores – in London, Birmingham and two in Manchester – as well as Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland and De Bijenkorf in the Netherlands. It also covers about £2bn of the chain’s prime property assets, including the freehold of its listed Oxford Street flagship store in London. A source told Reuters the new owners hope to build a luxury hotel alongside the site. The Westons, one of Canada’s richest families, first confirmed they might consider a sale of their European department stores in June after an approach from a mystery buyer. They are not selling their Canadian chain Holt Renfrew. The deal comes shortly after the death of the 80-year-old head of the family, W Galen Weston, who had spearheaded the purchase of Selfridges in 2003. Investment in Selfridges could be a boon for ailing Oxford Street, the home of its flagship London outlet, at a time when department stores across the country are downsizing or closing. London’s premier shopping street has seen visitor numbers and sales dive as international tourists have been kept away by Covid travel restrictions and businesses have switched to working from home. Department stores have been particularly hard hit across the country because of high business rates and rents on their large stores, which have faced increasing competition from specialists and online outlets. Among the stores currently lying empty on Oxford Street is Debenhams, the department store chain which collapsed last year, leading to the closure of more than 120 high street outlets. Fellow department store group Beales also went into administration last year, with only a handful of its 22 outlets since revived. John Lewis has closed 16 outlets in two years, while House of Fraser now has just 42 of the 59 outlets it had in 2018 when it was bought out of administration by Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley’s retail group. Its flagship store on Oxford Street is to close in January, and its Swindon site also recently closed.",News/Business,Selfridges sold as part of £4bn deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/24/selfridges-sold-as-part-of-4bn-deal
