1/17/2022,"Donald Trump made provocative comments about abortion and transgender people at a rally in Arizona. He falsely claimed that Democratic politicians say that ""babies can be killed even after birth."" He also spoke about transgender people and promised to ""ban men from participating in women's sports."" Former President Donald Trump stoked the culture wars at a rally in Florence, Arizona on Saturday, making provocative comments about the Democratic party's stances on transgender people and abortion. ""We're done taking lectures on science from a party that tells us men and women, women are men, and the babies‚Ä¶ and this is a fact, the babies can be killed even after birth,"" Trump said. ""They used to talk late-term, now they're talking about‚Ä¶ just go check out your governor of Virginia, your former governor of Virginia, and it's all just fine with them, babies can be killed after birth."" ‚ÄîAaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 16, 2022 Trump was likely referring to disproved allegations that then-Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam promoted infanticide in an interview in 2019. In the interview, Northam spoke about cases where a fetus might be nonviable, or severely deformed, and what might happen after birth. A spokesperson for Northam clarified to Vox at the time that the ""governor had 'absolutely not' been referring to the euthanasia of infants born after a failed abortion."" Abortion has long been a hot-button issue to voters, particularly Republicans, and Republican state legislators around the country have passing increasingly restrictive abortion laws. While still a private citizen, Donald Trump was once vocal about his pro-choice chance, but said he ultimately changed his mind and became anti-abortion. Trump also made multiple references to transgender people at the Arizona rally, including his claims that the Democratic party says ""men and women, women are men."" Elsewhere in his speech, Trump promised to ""ban men from participating in women's sports."" ‚ÄîJonsey üçä (@joneslillycal) January 16, 2022 Whether transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in women's sports has recently become a lightning-rod issue. Trump's comments about transgender people reflect his approach towards transgender rights during his time as president, which the Biden administration has described as discriminatory. His administration banned transgender service members from joining the US military, which President Joe Biden later overturned.

1/17/2022,"The scene was a stretch of railroad tracks in Lincoln Heights on Saturday: A blizzard of torn plastic wrappers, cardboard boxes and paper packaging attesting to a wave of rail car thievery that officials say has been on the rise in recent months. Several scavengers picked through the debris, hoping to find electronics, clothes or whatever valuables thieves left behind. ""Everything comes on the train ‚Äî cellphones, Louis Vuitton purses, designer clothes, toys, lawnmowers, power equipment, power tools,"" said a 37-year-old man who declined to give his name. He said he comes to the tracks regularly and once found a Louis Vuitton purse and a robotic arm worth five figures: ""We find things here and there, make some money off of it."" Thieves are pilfering railroad cars in a crime that harks back to the days of horseback-riding bandits, but is fueled by a host of modern realities, including the rise of e-commerce and Southern California's role as a hub for the movement of goods. The images have generated national attention and revealed tension among rail operators, government officials and authorities over what can be done to reduce the thefts. Later Saturday, approximately 17 cars on a Union Pacific train derailed in ""the same area where the vandalism has been occurring,"" said Robynn Tysver, a Union Pacific spokesperson. The crew was not hurt and the cause is under investigation, Tysver added. Union Pacific reported what it claimed was a 160% increase since December 2020 in thefts along the railroad tracks in L.A. County. The railroad didn't release specific data on what was stolen or the value of what was lost, but it said the increase in crime cost the company at least $5 million last year. A bottleneck in the supply chain and the presence of homeless encampments near rail lines have contributed to the thefts, officials said. ""Organized and opportunistic criminal rail theft ... impacts our employees, our customers in the overall supply chain industry,"" said Adrian Guerrero, a director of public affairs for Union Pacific. Guerrero estimates that about 90 cargo containers a day are compromised, sometimes by an organized group that has halted trains and recruited people living on the street to ransack the containers. Union Pacific is deploying more drones, has brought in extra security and enlisted the Los Angeles Police Department, California Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to combat the thefts, Guerrero said. But Union Pacific is partly to blame for not deploying more security, said Los Angeles Police Capt. German Hurtado, who works in the Hollenbeck Division. ""We have millions of dollars of items and equipment, but it is unpoliced,"" Hurtado said. ""There are even sometimes weapons on these trains. Everything goes by train, you learn."" The problem gained attention last week when KCBS and KCAL photojournalist John Schreiber posted a series of videos and tweets, including one of himself picking through discarded packages strewn along a rail line in Lincoln Heights. He plucked out a discarded coronavirus test and a box of REI merchandise along tracks plastered with the detritus of packages intercepted and torn into well before reaching their destinations. ""Missing a package? Shipment delayed? Maybe your package is among the thousands we found discarded along the tracks,"" Schreiber wrote on Twitter, alongside an aerial shot of the littered tracks. The posts went viral, as others posted their own photos. Though Los Angeles has seen a significant increase in homicides over the last two years, property crimes like the rail thefts are a different story. According to LAPD data through Nov. 27, property crime was up 2.6% over the same period last year but is down 6.6% from 2019. Along the tracks Saturday, a couple who said they showed up after seeing an Instagram post scanned the crush of abandoned cartons looking for something valuable. An Xbox package had caught their eye. Another man who had been waiting for a bus stopped to rummage through the debris. He found some car speakers he figured he could sell for $200 to make up for the hours he missed at work that day. ""It's ugly out there,"" the LAPD's Hurtado said. In a letter to Dist. Atty. George Gasc√≥n, Union Pacific's Guerrero estimated that more than 100 people have been arrested but they ""boast to our officers that charges will be pled down."" Alex Bastian, an advisor to Gasc√≥n, said the district attorney's office has filed charges in some burglary and grand theft cases, but other cases don't have enough evidence to prosecute. Lena Kent, a spokesperson for BNSF Railway, a major operator in Southern California, said somebody is depending on those stolen items. ""These are not victimless crimes, particularly when many of these packages include much-needed supplies,"" she said. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handle about 40% of the nation's maritime imports. The majority of the nearly $450 billion in goods moved at the ports eventually lands on a train. Dumping, trash and encampments around railroad tracks last year prompted Los Angeles Councilman Joe Buscaino to call for the city to declare them a public nuisance. But the effort was dropped after Union Pacific cleaned up a swath of tracks, said his spokesperson, Branimir Kvartuc. Still, Buscaino said, Union Pacific needs to hire more agents to patrol the tracks. ""It's no surprise we are seeing the additional crimes,"" he said in a text, adding that the problems had been ""unabated for years."" The biggest problem is around two rail yards where cargo is transferred from trucks onto trains or vice versa. One of those yards is a sprawling rail facility that sits just east of downtown off the 5 Freeway in Lincoln Heights. Keith Lewis, vice president of operations for CargoNet, a company that tracks cargo thefts, said figuring out just how much is stolen from trains is difficult because much of it is unreported. Union Pacific operates about 3,200 miles of railway in California and BNSF has 2,100 miles. In Southern California, many of those tracks abut businesses and homes in low-income communities such as Wilmington and Lincoln Heights. In El Sereno, where crime has been increasing, barbed-wire fences line the street-level train tracks. ""It is not like we have given up on it. We do task forces with the sheriff, other agencies along the tracks and make arrests,"" Hurtado said.

1/17/2022,"I‚Äôve read the current reporting regarding Jason Walker and Lt. (Jeffrey) Hash and as much detail as has been released in The Fayetteville Observer. As a gun enthusiast and a CCW permit holder who has voluntarily undergone almost 200 hours of self-paid training, I have one question. Walker was beating on a windshield with a wiper. Is this threat considered deadly? In all of my training there is one underlying rule immediately following the four rules of gun safety. Do not shoot an unarmed person. In order to consider shooting anyone you must reasonably believe your own life or another‚Äôs is in immediate danger. In other words, someone attacking you with any sort of weapon, including in some cases their hands, may be considered a threat to your life. More: Judge approves release of police body camera video in Jason Walker homicide More: ‚ÄòI've had enough': 3rd day of protests in case of Fayetteville man shot by off-duty deputy Granted there will always be gray areas that hopefully are fairly investigated after a shooting event that reveal the assailant could have caused death. That may be a discussion for another time. My immediate question involves Lt. Hash and Jason Walker. As has been reported, Walker was on Lt. Hash‚Äôs hood, and was beating on Hash‚Äôs windshield with a wiper blade. In my world that‚Äôs pretty violent, scary at some point, even-out-of-control on Walker‚Äôs part. But not deadly, not yet. Crazy, yes, but not deadly. If I‚Äôm to understand correctly, Hash was still inside his vehicle and had many less lethal options to regain control of the event. As reported, Hash left his vehicle and shot Walker. At this point Walker was not a deadly threat. Angry, acting out, verbally and/or physically abusive possibly. But not deadly. If those are the circumstances there is yet one more important question. Support local journalism with a subscription to The Fayetteville Observer. Click the ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù link at the top of this article. Why would Lt. Hash not be as responsible for the outcome as I would be? Put me in that driver's seat, and I know I‚Äôm going to jail simply because I‚Äôm not a Law Enforcement Officer. I would be charged, have to spend thousands on defense, and probably convicted. Because at that point my life was not threatened. I would have had a lot of other options to mitigate the problem that do not involve my gun. Even if I‚Äôm not found guilty, my life will be ruined in every conceivable way. Hopefully this horrible event will be sorted out in a transparent manner. I‚Äôll be watching closely.
