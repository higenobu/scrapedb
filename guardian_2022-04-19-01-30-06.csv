4/19/2022,"Having been a midwife for more than 40 years, I am shocked and saddened to read the catalogue of poor care and callous behaviour described in the Ockenden report. It is scandalous that it has taken a series of tragedies to focus attention on the dire state of English maternity services, and especially the greater risks for Black women (‘I was told they didn’t offer C-sections’ – the dangerous obsession with ‘natural births’, 14 April). As your article says, all women must be listened to and have their wishes respected. Many women also opt for out-of-hospital births, but it is now commonplace for them to have to go into hospital to give birth, often at the last minute, due to no midwife being available. This will not be the last report to uncover failings in maternity care; of 193 maternity services in England, 80 are rated as “inadequate” or “requires improvement” by the Care Quality Commission. Soundbite headlines fuelling a false dichotomy between “natural” and safe birth deflect attention from the real cause of this crisis: years of cuts and a failure to prioritise maternal health.Sarah DaviesSalford  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/19/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has consolidated his lead over Marine Le Pen as France’s presidential race enters its final week, according to polls, suggesting harsher scrutiny of the far-right challenger’s plans may be shifting the race’s dynamic. Six days from the runoff that will decide who occupies the Élysée Palace for the next five years, all 16 polls carried out since the first-round vote on 10 April have put the incumbent ahead, by between seven and 12 percentage points. Both candidates have opted for light agendas before a TV debate on Wednesday that could prove critical to the campaign: in 2017, when they last faced off at this stage, Le Pen’s poor performance was widely seen as precipitating her second-round defeat. Le Pen insisted on Monday she was better prepared this time around. “I hope it’s a real confrontation of ideas and not the succession of invective, fake news and excess like I’ve heard over the past week,” she said on the campaign trail in Normandy. Macron also expressed confidence, telling the broadcaster TF1 on Sunday night he believed he had “a winning project that deserves to be known – and the feeling that on the far-right side, there is a programme that deserves to be clarified.” The Rassemblement National (National Rally) leader’s first round campaign, focusing on cost of living issues, succeeded in sharply narrowing the early gap between her and the Macron, securing her 23.1% of the vote against his 27.8%. With a long push to detoxify her party and soften her own image finally bearing fruit, analysts say Le Pen was also shielded by her first-round far-right rival, the virulently xenophobic TV pundit Éric Zemmour, who distracted media attention. But polls suggest a far more intense second-round scrutiny of her economic, welfare, immigration, foreign and environment policies – combined with renewed and more pointed attacks from Macron’s team – may have slowed her momentum. Some opinion polls immediately before the first round saw Macron winning a runoff against Le Pen by as little as three points, within the margin of error. The president’s predicted lead now averages eight or nine points across polls, while the Ipsos daily tracker foresees a 56%-44% victory. Media outlets have highlighted Le Pen’s recent call for a “strategic rapprochement” with Moscow after its war against Ukraine, her promise to remove existing wind turbines and ban new ones, and her proposal to ban the Islamic headscarf in public places. Her team on Monday played down the headscarf proposal, saying it was “not her priority” in the fight against extremism, and also hit back at the “suspicious” timing of embezzlement accusations against her by the EU’s anti-fraud office, OLAF. Multiple analyses have argued that one of the cornerstones of the far-right leader’s manifesto – a law on “immigration, identity and citizenship” that would establish a “national preference” for French nationals for jobs, welfare, housing and benefits – would violate the principle of equality enshrined in France’s constitution. The law – which Le Pen has said she aims to pass by referendum – would exclude non-nationals and dual nationals from many public-sector jobs and restrict access to benefits. It would also cancel automatic citizenship rights for children of non-nationals born in France, and make naturalisation significantly harder. Le Pen’s draft law “would constitute a radical break with France’s identity”, Dominique Rousseau, an emeritus professor of constitutional law, said on Monday, adding that it would also “breach European law, set France on the same path as Hungary or Poland, and lead to a progressive or indirect Frexit”. Economists have been similarly scathing about the far-right leader’s “incoherent” economic plans, including lowering the retirement age to 60, which Jean Tirole, the French winner of the 2014 Nobel prize for economics, warned this weekend would cost €68bn more than estimated and “permanently impoverish the country”. Lawyers, NGOs and teachers have also criticised Le Pen’s plans to grant police a “presumption of self-defence” and the right to file anonymous complaints; radically boost the number of prison sentences; deny healthcare to undocumented migrants and “restore neutrality” to an education system based on “traditional values”. Analysts say the harsher second-round spotlight is making it harder for Le Pen to maintain the affable image on which she relied to sell a platform that Le Monde has described as “superficially soft – but fundamentally far right”. “The French are taking a closer look at her programme, and don’t seem to like what they see,” said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director of the Eurasia Group consultancy. Growing clarity around what an eventual Le Pen presidency might look like in practice is unlikely to change the minds of many convinced Le Pen supporters, pollsters say, but it may persuade enough hesitant voters – particularly on the left – to vote for Macron to keep the far-right candidate out. With the election likely be won by the candidate who can reach beyond his or her camp to convince voters that the other option would be far worse, both candidates are looking to attract some of the 7.7 million voters who backed the far-left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round. Polls suggest about 33% of the radical leftist’s voters – mostly moderates who backed Mélenchon because he was the only left-wing candidate with a chance of reaching the second round – will back Macron. Several surveys, meanwhile, have suggested that not all voters who backed Zemmour will cast their ballots for Le Pen.",News/World news,Macron lead over Le Pen stabilises as election scrutiny intensifies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/macron-lead-over-le-pen-stabilises-as-election-scrutiny-intensifies
4/19/2022,"Derby County have been relegated from the Championship after a 1-0 defeat at QPR on Easter Monday was coupled with Reading’s remarkable comeback from 4-1 down to draw 4-4 with Swansea. Luke Amos scored the only goal of the game in west London with just two minutes to go to condemn Wayne Rooney’s side to defeat and a first season in the third tier since 1985-86. But their fate was only sealed by a stunning second-half fightback from the Royals at the Madejski, where Swansea led 3-1 at half-time and 4-1 at the hour mark. Tom Ince started the comeback, Lucas João made it 4-3 and Tom McIntyre scored the equaliser deep into stoppage time. Elsewhere, Luton tightened their grip on a playoff spot with a 1-0 win over Cardiff in south Wales. Harry Cornick came off the bench to score the goal, making it a very happy Easter for the Hatters, who beat play-off rivals Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Good Friday, and keeping them in fourth place. Blackburn’s play-off hopes, on the other hand, are hanging by a thread after a 1-0 defeat at home to Stoke. Jacob Brown’s solitary strike did the damage as he combined with Josh Maja in the fourth minute to score his 13th goal of the season. Scott Malone’s freakish second-half goal helped Millwall to a 2-1 win against Hull at The Den to boost their playoff hopes. Malone made it 1-0 after 51 minutes when Richie Smallwood’s clearance rebounded off him into the net, before Tom Bradshaw doubled the lead four minutes later. But the game was far from over as Tom Eaves scored an 86th-minute consolation to make the home fans sweat.

4/19/2022,"Nicola Sturgeon has been warned by police officers about the law surrounding face coverings in Scotland after she failed to wear a face mask in a barbers shop on Saturday, in breach of her own regulations. The first minister was reported to Police Scotland after footage emerged of her in a crowded barbers shop without a face covering, joking with staff and pretending to shave a customer while out campaigning in East Kilbride. Facemasks are still legally required in Scotland. pic.twitter.com/9dxazpy3QI Sturgeon apologised after the police issued a statement, and admitted it was “an error on my part”. She said it was a momentary lapse and she quickly realised she needed to wear a mask, before posing for photographers. “I accept that not wearing a face covering even for a few seconds was an error on my part and I am sorry for that. Having received complaints about the matter, Police Scotland made contact with me. “This is what they would have done with anyone else in these circumstances, and they were absolutely right to treat me no differently to any other citizen. I explained that the error was inadvertent and the police have confirmed that the matter is closed.” Police Scotland announced on Twitter its officers had visited Sturgeon after the complaint. “Local officers have spoken to the first minister to remind her of the importance of wearing a face covering when there is a legal requirement to do so,” its statement said. Local officers have spoken to the First Minister to remind her of the importance of wearing a face covering when there is a legal requirement to do so. pic.twitter.com/KEAjUaEQq5 “Given the circumstances of this incident, Police Scotland is satisfied that no further action is necessary. This is in line with our proportionate approach throughout the pandemic.” The incident came less than 48 hours before Scotland’s strict rules on face coverings were relaxed, becoming a recommendation for shops, public indoor spaces and public transport, rather than mandatory. Opposition politicians were scathing about Sturgeon’s oversight. Dr Sandesh Gulhane, the Scottish Conservative’s health spokesperson, said on Sunday: “She’s happy virtue signalling for official photos but behind closed doors it’s clear she doesn’t believe in her own rules so why should anyone else. “This is blatant hypocrisy from the first minister who has now shown her true colours.” This is the second time Sturgeon has broken Covid regulations. In December 2020 she said there were “no excuses” after it emerged she had taken her face mask off during a wake. She told MSPs after the incident: “I am kicking myself very hard, possibly harder than my worst critic ever could. But more importantly, I’ll be making sure I do not drop my guard again.” In April 2020, Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, was forced to resign after it emerged she had twice visited her holiday home in Fife in breach of strict lockdown rules in force at the time.

4/19/2022,"It’s tax day in the US, the deadline for most individuals to file and pay tax owed. But while this year’s tax season may be closing for millions of Americans who are paid through a digital payment service such as PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and Cash App, the next tax year could come with even more complications. Under a new law buried in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, digital payment services, or Third-Party Settlement Organizations (TPSOs), will now be required to notify federal tax collectors of payments amounting to more than $600 in total during the course of the year. Before the change, taxpayers received a notification – known as a 1099-K – only if they processed more than 200 business transactions amounting to more than $20,000 over a year. Now, with the payment threshold reduced to $600, US taxpayers who have never seen a 1099-K will be receiving one. No one knows how many Americans will be getting these forms, but tax lobbyists estimate the number at as high as 20 million. According to small business consultant Gene Marks, writing in the Guardian earlier this year, “the reality is there are 30 million small businesses, freelancers, solo-preneurs and independent contractors in the US … who receive a number of small payments from many customers throughout the year may, well, forget”. For individuals whose record keeping is sub-par, says Marks: “No worries! The IRS will now be able to find out what you earned anyway.” Venmo says it will send out 1099-K forms to business profile owners after January next year to anyone who receives payments for the sale of goods or services through the service. The threshold varies with the owner’s state of residence. For most states, the threshold is $20,000 in gross payment volume from sales of goods or services in a single year, and 200 payments for goods and services in the same year. For residents of Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, and Virginia, the threshold is $600, irrespective of the number of transactions. For Illinois residents, the threshold is $1,000 with three or more transactions. Further, individual taxpayers who have sold cryptocurrency on Venmo will receive a gains and losses statement. If that induces record-keeping anxiety, the IRS would like you to know that the data collected will only be used for “taxpayer education and outreach products and services”, as well as “new examination and collection approaches”. “For the 2022 tax year, you should consider the amounts shown on your 1099-K when calculating gross receipts for your income tax return,” PayPal warns. “The IRS will be able to cross-reference both our report and yours.” The changes come as the IRS is facing its biggest backlog in history. At the end of the 2021 filing season, the agency had 35.3m returns waiting for processing, but with no more staff than it had in 1970, a reduced budget of 15% in real terms, and a considerably more complex tax code. Over the past two years, the agency has suffered the largest data breach in its history, with famous taxpayers’ personal financial information leaked to news website ProPublica.",News/US news,Tax day: Venmo and PayPal users face more paperwork under new US rules,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/tax-day-venmo-paypal-us-tax-code-changes
4/19/2022,"Earlier today I set you the following puzzles, adapted from Math Games with Bad Drawings by Ben Orlin. 1. Five nice dice A roll of five dice produces the numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. i) By combining the numbers using +, –, x and ÷, what is the closest you can get to the target of 55? ii) What is the largest whole number you can reach? iii) What is the largest whole number you can reach using only subtraction? (tip: it’s a positive number.) iv) What is the largest whole number you can reach using only division? Clarification: By combining the numbers I mean creating an expression using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (and as many brackets as you like.) For example, using the five numbers above, you could combine them in this way: ((5x6)+ 4) ÷ (3 – 1), which is equal to 17. You can use as many, or as few, plus, minus, times and division signs as you like. You must use all five numbers exactly once. Solutions i) We can hit it exactly: (5 x 4 x 3) – 6 + 1 = 55 ii) 6 x 5 x 4 x (3 + 1) = 480 iii) 6 – (1 – 3 – 4 – 5) = 17 iv) (6/(1/5))/(3/4) = (6x5x4)/(1x3) = 40 2. Five nicer dice You roll five standard dice. i) What is the probability the five numbers can be combined to reach 0? Solution 100%. If any two dice are identical, multiply their difference (e.g., 5 – 5) by the sum of the other dice. If all five dice are different, then find a trio that form zero (1 + 2 – 3 or 5 + 1 – 6 or 4 + 2 – 6) and then multiply this by the sum of the other dice. ii) What’s the probability that the maximum result is obtained simply by multiplying them all together? Solution The maximum can always be obtained this way as long as there are no 1’s present (for example (1+2) x 3 x 4 x 5 is larger than 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5) so this is equivalent to rolling no 1’s. That has probability of (5/6)5 , or approximately 40%. iii) What’s the probability that the maximum result is obtained uniquely by multiplying them all together? Solution There can be at most a single 2, because with multiple 2’s present, the maximum can be attained by using addition as well (for example (2+2) x 3x3x3 = 2x2x3x3x3). Thus, either there must be no 1’s or 2’s, which has probability (4/6)5, or no 1’s and a single 2, which has probability 5(1/6)(4/6)4. These sum to approximately 30%. iv) What is the probability that the five random dice cannot be combined to reach any of the targets from 33 to 99? Solution One way this failure can occur is if all the dice are 1’s and 2’s. This has a probability of (2/6)5, or approximately 0.4 per cent. The failure also occurs with the following combinations of dice. (In brackets I have listed the number of ways to rearrange that particular set of dice) 1 1 1 1 3 (5) , 1 1 1 1 4 (5) , 1 1 1 1 5 (5) , 1 1 1 1 6 (5) , 1 1 1 2 3 (20), 1 1 1 2 4 (20), 1 1 1 2 5 (20), 1 1 1 3 3 (10), 1 1 2 2 3 (30). There are 120 total combinations, so total probability of all of these combinations is 120(1/6)5 , or approximately 1.5 per cent. Thus, the probability of being unable to form any of the numbers from 33 to 99 is just under 2 per cent. To read more about Math Games with Bad Drawings, see my previous post.

4/19/2022,"The procession had begun peacefully. Marching through the streets of Delhi’s Jahangirpuri district on Saturday, the crowds had gathered to celebrate the Hindu festival of Hanuman Jayanti. But the peace did not last long. As the evening drew in, a section of the parade clad in saffron, the signature colour of Hindu nationalism, began to brandish swords and pistols, and loudly shout provocative communal slogans. Ignoring previous agreements between Hindu and Muslim residents for the procession to avoid passing by a local mosque, they charged toward it. “A Hindu mob smashed beer bottles inside the mosque, put up saffron flags there and chanted Jai Shri Ram [Hail Lord Ram],” said Tabreez Khan, 39, a witness. “A caretaker of the mosque started resisting them, leading to a brawl. It was only after they started to desecrate the mosque that Muslims got angry and clashes started and stones were thrown.” It was an account verified by both Muslim and Hindu witnesses. Rinku Sharma, a Hindu taking part in the procession, said the clashes began “when we entered the mosque area”. “Most of the people living in this area are Muslims,” said Mohamad Fazal, 35. “This was not a religious rally but an attack on us [Muslims].” Six police officers were injured in the violence, and more than 20 people arrested, the majority of whom were Muslim. But among the arrests was the leader of the local branch of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a notorious rightwing organisation. “There was no instigation, it seemed the attack was planned to create communal tensions,” added Khan. The events in Jahangirpuri were far from isolated. Over the weekend, almost 140 people were arrested in connection with incidents of communal violence and rioting between Hindus and Muslims in the states of Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka during celebrations of Hanuman Jayanti. It had been a similar story in previous weeks. Celebrations of the Hindu festival of Ram Navami in seven states as far flung as Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand and West Bengal were marred bay communal violence, mostly against Muslims, who are observing Ramadan. The clashes left one person dead, resulted in dozens of Muslim-owned homes and shops being set alight or demolished, provocative slogans being shouted outside numerous mosques and attempts to install saffron flags inside Muslim places of worship. The surge in communal violence has sparked concern among many in India who fear the country is becoming more polarised than ever along Hindu-Muslim lines. For many, the blame has been directed at the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi. The BJP is accused of overseeing a religiously divisive agenda and emboldening hostility towards India’s 200m Muslims, relegating them to second-class citizens. In the southern state of Telangana, a BJP legislator, T Raja Singh, was among those booked for provocative slogans during a procession. “There is a strong case to be made that we are passing through the most difficult phase for Muslims in independent India,” said Asim Ali, a political researcher at the Centre for Policy Research thinktank, writing in the Telegraph, an Indian newspaper. “Being in the crosshairs of the dominant party of the country is a bad place to be for a community, and the Hindu nationalist stance towards Muslims seems to be becoming more hostile with time.” The wave of violence in recent weeks, added Ali, was evidence that “this anti-Muslim mobilisation … has also acquired a momentum of its own”. In Muzaffarpur, a district of Bihar, Muslims alleged that a saffron flag was hoisted on to the entrance of a mosque during one of the processions. Video footage showed the crowd cheering and brandishing swords and hockey sticks while the flag was hoisted. But it was in Khargone, a district of Madhya Pradesh, that some of the worst clashes took place. The violence began when a Ram Navami parade of about 5,000 people passed by a mosque that inflammatory Hindu nationalist slogans and threats allegedly began to be shouted by Hindu hardliners, and stones thrown in retaliation. “I was in my home with my family preparing to break Ramadan fast when a large mob started attacking our house,” said Farooq Khan, 23. “They were shouting [kill the Muslims].” Khan said he had to beg the sword-wielding mob, which entered his house and started looting, to let him and his family flee. About 10 houses were set on fire in Khargone, and 24 people, including a police officer, injured in the violence. Muslims in Khargone accused police of refusing to file cases against Hindus involved in the violence and arresting mainly Muslims instead. There was also outcry after the local administration bulldozed at least 16 houses and 29 shops belonging to Muslims accused of throwing stones at the procession. Nawab Khan, a Muslim whose house was also set alight, said he had been beaten by police when he had tried to file a report at the station, showing the wounds on his back he said were caused by officers. “Our properties have been burned, we have been attacked and we are the ones who are being accused of it and punished,” he said. Supt Shalendra Singh denied Muslims had mainly been targeted and said the police were taking proper action against all communities involved. Clashes also broke out at the beginning of April in Karauli, Rajasthan, when a Hindu procession was passing through a Muslim area and aabout 70 shops, mostly belonging to Muslims were set alight. The violence this month even reached one of India’s top universities, Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, after rightwing Hindu activists objected to the cooking of non-vegetarian food at a student hostel. Over the weekend, the leaders of 13 opposition parties condemned Modi for staying silent over the surge in communal violence. “We are shocked at the silence of the prime minister, who has failed to speak against the words and actions of those who propagate bigotry and those who, by their words and actions, incite and provoke our society,” they said in a statement. Modi’s minority affairs minister, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, blamed the events of the past few weeks on “fringe elements, who … try to defame India’s inclusive culture and commitment”. Activists and academics have pointed to increasingly violent rhetoric against Muslims seeping into India’s mainstream, stirring up communal tensions to dangerous levels. In December 2021, a religious assembly of Hindu holy figures was held in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, during which the speakers called for a genocide against Muslims. Last week, police arrested Bajrang Muni Das, a Hindu priest accused of threatening mass rape against Muslim women during a speech two weeks ago in presence of officers. The attacks also come after the passing of state legislation accused of being discriminatory towards Muslims, including a hijab ban in schools in BJP-ruled Karnataka. Writing in the Indian Express over the weekend, the leader of the opposition Congress party, Soniaa Gandi, said: “an apocalypse of hatred, bigotry, intolerance and untruth is engulfing our country today. We as a people cannot stand by and watch as peace and pluralism are sacrificed at the altar of bogus nationalism.”",News/World news,"‘Hatred, bigotry and untruth’: communal violence grips India",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/hatred-bigotry-and-untruth-communal-violence-grips-india
4/19/2022,"John Oliver investigated the unreliability and predatory nature of police interrogations, which are often aimed at extracting a confession rather than determining truth. Confessions are “viewed as the gold standard when it comes to an indicator of guilt, as they can apparently be more persuasive than even DNA evidence”, the Last Week Tonight host explained on Sunday evening. An admission of guilt, however obtained, is “wildly persuasive”, he added, “because we think that they’re one of those things that only guilty people do, like posting a Notes app apology or refusing to answer any of Ronan Farrow’s questions”. But confessions can be false and coerced. Of all the convictions overturned by DNA testing, 29% involved a false confession. While that might seem baffling, “the truth is, there are a number of reasons an innocent person might confess to something they didn’t do,” said Oliver, “and a lot of that comes down to what happens in a police interrogation room.” The modern practice of police interrogations in the US developed after a 1936 supreme court ruling outlawing physical coercion. The most popular now is the Reid Technique, which has “influenced nearly every aspect of modern police interrogations”, according to a 2013 New Yorker investigation. “The Reid Technique has become one of those things that just culturally comes with being a cop,” Oliver explained. “You know, like their fondness for donuts or their complicity in the perpetuation of state-sponsored violence.” The technique involves two phases: the interview, an evaluation of trustworthiness via dubious behavioral analysis (studies show the accuracy is basically 50-50, or “around the same accuracy as a Buzzfeed quiz”, said Oliver), and the interrogation. “If they have decided you are guilty, you’re in big trouble,” said Oliver of interrogations. “Because while they say they are looking for the truth, Reid trains officers to steer the conversation away from anything that’s not a confession. “If an investigator is trying to get you to confess, they can grind you down,” he continued, citing a study which found that false confessions came after an average of 16.3 hours of questioning. “The notion that people crack under pressure and falsely confess really shouldn’t be that hard to understand. It’s a concept that even children’s cartoons get,” Oliver said, referring to a clip from My Little Pony (really) in which a character cracks under interrogation and shouts “tell me what you want me to say and I’ll say it!” Compounding the issue is that once a confession, even a blatantly false one, is secured, investigations tend to stop. And it’s legal in the US for police to lie to suspects about evidence. “The police in this country can flat-out lie to you to make you think you have no choice but to confess,” Oliver said, which he called “crazy”. Most other countries don’t allow it, “and for good reason – it is far too powerful a tool.” As a whole, “the overwhelming pressure of a police interrogation, coupled with their ability to invent evidence, can actually make people question their own memories”, Oliver continued. These tactics, unsurprisingly, prey on already vulnerable people – research shows that false confessions played a role in 34% of wrongful convictions involving those under 18, and in 69% of cases involving mental illness or intellectual disability. Regardless of the tactics, it’s not guaranteed that juries will see anything beyond the confession; only 30 states require showing the recording of all or some of the interrogation. “You just cannot get the full story from seeing one short clip,” said Oliver. It would be like basing the plot of One Tree Hill, a teen soap about high school basketball, just on its infamous scene of a dog eating a heart transplant. The current issue with police interrogations is “the same problem that we have with policing at large,” said Oliver. “They’re emboldened to act however they’d like in a system where they hold an undue amount of power with very few protections for civilians, especially the most vulnerable.” What can be done? Oliver argued that US courts should require that interrogations be recorded and shown in their entirety and that police should be banned from lying to suspects, “because it is madness that they are currently allowed to do that”. There has been some movement on this front already; Oregon, Illinois and Utah have already banned police from lying to juvenile suspects, and New York has introduced legislation that would ban lying to all suspects and require courts to evaluate the reliability of confession evidence before using it. “That should be adopted absolutely everywhere,” said Oliver. In the meantime, there’s decades of cultural conditioning from crime procedurals and “ends justify the means” cops to undo. “Our misconceptions about police interrogations have been hammered in by crime dramas,” said Oliver, “and they’ve been hammered in deep.”",Arts/Television & radio,"John Oliver on police interrogations: ‘If they have decided you are guilty, you’re in big trouble’",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/18/john-oliver-police-interrogations-false-confessions-last-week-tonight
4/19/2022,"‘Life in juvie ain’t no movie / I might deal drugs but one day I’ll rule the thugs.” Oui, welcome to All The Way Up (or Validé in its native tongue). It’s the French hip-hop dramedy you didn’t know you needed in your life but almost definitely do. Gallic TV imports are à la mode, with the likes of thief romp Lupin and thesp-com Call My Agent! having won over fans and critics in recent years – not to mention the loyal followings of long-running shows such as spy saga The Bureau and twisty policier Spiral. Now, after a two-year wait, All The Way Up is finally available for streaming in the UK – and the opening line of dialogue is uncannily apt: “What’s the delay, dickwad?” This fast-rhyming viral phenomenon follows charismatic Clément – a gifted but raw MC (played by rising rap star Hatik) who goes by the name of Apash. Well, when he’s not working as a drug dealer’s delivery boy in the housing projects on the northern outskirts of Paris. Backed up by the endearingly unintimidating posse of childhood mates Brahim (Brahim Bouhlel) and William (Saïdou Camara), Clément seizes a random opportunity to gatecrash a Tim Westwood-alike radio show. His improvised bar-spitting skills win approval from one of France’s biggest hip-hop stars, Mastar (Moussa Mansaly, a real-life “rappeur” himself under the handle Sam’s) – only for the pair’s mentor-and-protege musical alliance to turn into a dangerous rivalry. Our have-a-go heroes find out that, in the rap game, fame comes with strings attached, with Clément struggling to escape his criminal connections and go legit, while the ghetto keeps sucking him back in. Gritty, funny and viscerally thrilling, All The Way Up pulsates with adrenalised energy. Think Atlanta meets The Get Down, with dashes of Dave, Empire, even Top Boy. Or, perhaps, the underrated E4 gem Youngers – but with sexier accents. Episodes are a snappy half-hour long and move as swiftly as Clément’s lyrical flow, if not the Porsche GT3 he cheekily borrows in episode two. The 10-part series is the latest addition to the recently launched streaming service StudioCanal Presents – available via the Apple TV app, which is home to box sets such as Spiral and Hannibal, plus a catalogue of cult and classic films (not just French titles either). It also marks the TV debut of stunt dog trainer turned director (no, really) Franck Gastambide, who previously directed hit film comedies. Showrunner Gastambide – who also appears as DJ Sno, the “best beatmaker in the business” – told Variety that his main inspiration for All The Way Up was HBO’s 00s bro-com Entourage. “It made me dream,” said Gastambide. “I wanted to be their friend in Hollywood and bump into Jessica Alba at Starbucks. But I wanted to do this for our rap scene, with real people and real places. The French rap scene sometimes has a criminal aspect, so it’s the perfect playground to mix the glitz and glam with the universe of Gomorrah and epic reckoning moments.” In addition to the gifted young cast of newcomers, the series is sprinkled with cameos from French artists including Soprano, Ninho, Lacrim, Soolking and Kool Shen. If your knowledge of le rap extends mainly to 90s stalwart MC Solaar and Nique la Police (Fuck the Police) from the cult film La Haine, prepare for a musical education. Pirate radio stations pump. Crews wage freestyle battles. Forget 8 Mile, this is 12.8 Kilomètre. All The Way Up’s debut run in spring 2020 became a huge word-of-mouth hit in France, breaking records with 44m streams, according to Canal+, and winning the audience award at the Cannes international series festival. The second season, which launched last autumn, built on that success. Canal+ says it clocked up a record 10m views in its first week. Lead actor Hatik has become a breakout hip-hop sensation. His biggest track, Angela, has more than 120m YouTube views. The original soundtrack has more than 100m streams on Deezer and Spotify, Canal+ claim. All The Way Up also turbo-boosted the career of the French-Congolese rapper Bosh, who plays Karnage in the show. At a time when France is in the throes of a Le Pen-fuelled political identity crisis, All The Way Up showcases a vibrantly diverse side of the capital rarely seen onscreen. It’s a world away from the ooh-la-la romcom cliches of Emily in Paris or Sex and the City’s Gallic sojourns. There is not a beret or baguette to be seen here – although there are “Yo mama” gags and an amusing dig at the quinoa-munching middle classes. No spoilers, naturellement, but a shock plot twist in the debut series spins the follow-up in unexpected directions. Season two also introduces female rap tyro Sara, AKA Lalpha (Laetitia Kerfa), whose struggle for acceptance in the male-dominated industry reflects the show’s own attempt to become less of a saucisson-fest. HBO Max has snapped up the show for the US and there is talk of international remakes, too. All The Way Up is indeed firmly in the ascendant. The show’s trailer might see Mastar give Apash a warning: “Forget the rap game, or you’ll have a war on your hands.” But it doesn’t look like he’ll be following that advice any time soon.

4/19/2022,"Boris Johnson’s government’s proposal to deport asylum seekers of whatever origin who arrive on unauthorised routes, such as by crossing the Channel, to Rwanda in east Africa is beyond callous. It is understandable that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, should want to add his voice to the protests. But invoking God’s judgment in the matter leaves him vulnerable to a second question. If the Almighty did offer him such an opinion, what did He suggest be done instead? The government’s argument for deportation is bizarre. It is that people smugglers along the French coast are endangering the lives of refugees – so it is “bold and innovative” to arrest and expel the latter. To Jacob Rees-Mogg this is “almost an Easter story of redemption”. Redemption for whom? What do these people think they are doing? It is like reacting to a spate of burglaries by locking the victims outside their homes. Since tens of thousands of refugees crossed in small boats last year, but only low numbers are likely to face removal in the short term – and with legal challenges expected – Johnson’s gesture is pure headline fodder. He has even demanded that the first flights go within weeks, to be close to his critical May local elections. Was vote-grabbing ever more blatant? We know that the only solution to the Europe-wide migration crisis must lie in a long-term and agreed-upon EU policy towards the movement of people, particularly from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. For Britain, in particular, it must lie with France. When it was a member of the EU, Britain could at least seek collaboration on a joint policy, most critically along its Channel coast. While the chief argument for Brexit was to stop immigration, the reality has turned out to be that Britain’s membership of the EU has no bearing on the movement of those forced to leave their homes as a result of war, crisis and state failure. France has no need or incentive to help us. Handling migration requires political realism and sensitivity. Britain’s policy is chaotic thanks to the Home Office’s deployment of “hostile environment” as a tool of control. Anyone with personal experience of this knows it to be cruel, expensive and of limited effectiveness. Its ingrained bureaucratic obstructionism has given the lie to Johnson’s boast of an open door to Ukrainian refugees. That department’s permanent secretary has reportedly questioned the Rwanda policy as an unproven expense, only to be overruled by his boss, Priti Patel. Britain’s civil service is in a poor state if, when ordered to implement an unethical policy, it can object only on grounds of “value for money”. In which case, where were their objections to costly PPE procurement or HS2? As for God, where is He in all this? Welby is professionally entitled to claim priestly infallibility, though his distinction between a policy’s details, which he leaves “to politics”, and its principles that must “stand the judgment of God” needs exegesis. I always thought “the devil is in the detail” was a cop out. The days when an archbishop could plausibly speak for the conscience of the nation are over. Surveys now put “irreligious” Britons at 52% of the population and Welby’s Anglicans at below 12%. This need not affect a priest preaching to his own flock. But when a state-established church summons God to condemn an evil policy it merely confuses the forces that need mustering against it. They are forces not of religion, but of reason and common humanity. They must now confront a desperate politician’s latest attempt to save his own skin.

4/19/2022,"Dozens of pro-independence Catalan figures, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region and three of his predecessors, have been targeted using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, according to a report from cybersecurity experts. The research published on Monday by Citizen Lab, considered among the world’s leading experts in detecting digital attacks, said victims of the mobile phone targeting included Pere Aragonès, who has led Catalonia since last year, as well as the former regional presidents Quim Torra, Carles Puigdemont and Artur Mas. It also found that MEPs, legislators, lawyers, civil society activists and journalists were targeted, as were some members of their families. Although NSO Group claims that Pegasus is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists, a joint investigation two years ago by the Guardian and El País established that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament and at least two other pro-independence supporters were warned the spyware had been used to target them. The Citizen Lab report said at least 65 individuals had been targeted or infected with mercenary spyware, of whom at least 63 were targeted or infected with Pegasus. Almost all the incidents took place between 2017 – the year of the failed bid for Catalan regional independence – and 2020. Victims’ phones were said to have been targeted using fake texts or WhatsApp messages. It said Aragonès wastargeted while serving as vice-president of Catalonia, while Torra – who served as regional president between 2018 and 2020 – was targeted while in office. Puigdemont, who led the failed, unilateral push for independence almost five years ago, was also targeted – as was Mas, who was targeted after leaving office. Thirty-one regional MPs – 27 of them from the three pro-independence Catalan parties – were reportedly targeted, as were nine members of the two powerful grassroots groups, the Catalan National Assembly and Òmnium Cultural. The Citizen Lab investigation also concluded that multiple lawyers representing prominent Catalan separatists Catalans were targeted and infected with Pegasus. According to the report, they include Gonzalo Boye, who represents Puigdemont, and Andreu Van den Eynde, a lawyer for several high-profile pro-independence politicians including the former regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras. The report said the number of confirmed mercenary spyware victims was “extraordinarily high … [and] gives a window into what is likely a larger effort to place a significant slice of Catalan civil society under targeted surveillance for several years”. Citizen Lab pointed out that NSO Group claims that Pegasus is sold only to governments, adding: “While we do not currently attribute this operation to specific governmental entities, circumstantial evidence suggests a strong nexus with the government of Spain, including the nature of the victims and targets, the timing, and the fact that Spain is reported to be a government client of NSO Group.” It called for an official inquiry to determine who had ordered the targeting, what judicial oversight had applied, and how the hacked material was used. Aragonès said Citizen Lab’s findings, which were first reported in the New Yorker, had revealed “a case of espionage against a democratic European movement, which puts fundamental rights at risk everywhere”. He called on the Spanish government to provide immediate explanations, saying: “Spying on public representatives, lawyers or civil right activists is a red line.” A spokesperson for NSO said: “NSO continues to be targeted by a number of politically motivated advocacy organisations like Citizens Labs and Amnesty to produce inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports based on vague and incomplete information. “We have repeatedly cooperated with governmental investigations, where credible allegations merit. However, information raised regarding these allegations are, yet again, false and could not be related to NSO products for technological and contractual reasons.” A spokesperson for Spain’s interior ministry said neither the ministry, the Policía Nacional, nor the Guardia Civil had ever had any dealings with NSO Group and had consequently never contracted any of its services. He added: “All communications intercepts are carried out under judicial authority and with full respect for the law.” Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) has previously told the Guardian and El País that its work is overseen by the supreme court and that it acts “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws”. In US court filings in response to claims by WhatsApp, NSO Group has denied allegations that it bore any responsibility in the targeting of individuals and said it did not operate the technology itself.",News/World news,"Catalan leaders targeted using NSO spyware, say cybersecurity experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/catalan-leaders-targeted-using-nso-spyware-say-cybersecurity-experts
