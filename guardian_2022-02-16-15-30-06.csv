2/16/2022,"Simon Holmes à Court, the convener of Climate 200, says his organisation has not extracted specific undertakings from candidates running in Liberal party heartland, because “if we start dictating specifics then we can hardly say these independents are independent”. Holmes à Court on Wednesday declared Australian politics was “broken” and blasted the Morrison government’s record on climate policy, transparency and gender equality.  But he told the National Press Club he would not be dictating policy or determining the next government of Australia if there was a hung parliament after the election. He said his personal opinions didn’t matter “because I won’t be in parliament and I won’t be in any negotiation room – this is a decision for the independents”. Climate 200 is a company not a political party or a charity. It is a fundraising vehicle to bankroll campaigns by independents prioritising climate action and stronger accountability measures. Controversy erupted this week after it was revealed the independent Zali Steggall – who promotes climate action and greater transparency – received a $100,000 donation from the family trust of former coal company director John Kinghorn which the Australian Electoral Commission found was not properly declared. At the time, the financial controller of the Warringah campaign was Damien Hodgkinson, who is now a director of Climate 200. Liberals rounded on Steggall, accusing her of hypocrisy. Holmes à Court insisted his organisation complied with disclosure rules and Hodgkinson retained his full confidence. He characterised political fundraising in Australia as a “David and Goliath” battle, where the major parties enjoyed significant structural advantages, including taxpayer-funded office and communication budgets “often used for campaigning”. Holmes à Court said that in 2019 the Coalition raised $65m in undisclosed donations. The Kooyong fundraising vehicle supporting the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, had also received “$2.8m in the past five years without disclosing a single donor”. Holmes à Court argued on Wednesday it was not hypocritical for Climate 200 to call for better transparency in Australia’s disclosure laws while not identifying all of its donors. He said some donors resisted voluntary disclosure beyond the current legal requirements because they feared retribution from the Morrison government. He said Climate 200’s objective was to try to level the playing field between independents and the major parties. In that context, there couldn’t be one rule for the major parties and another rule for political independents. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Holmes à Court acknowledged there was “noise around electoral disclosure at the moment” but he said Climate 200 went “above and beyond the legal disclosure requirements, encouraging all of our donors, large and small, to disclose their names on our website” – a practice that “neither major party comes close to doing”. He said if the major parties agreed to reduce the current donation disclosure threshold to $1,000 and mandate real-time disclosure, Climate 200 would comply with that policy, having already “taken the first step with our voluntary disclosure”. Later in parliament, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, asked Frydenberg – who had blasted the Steggall donation – whether he could confirm the Kooyong 200 club raised $1.1m in donations last financial year but named no individual donors in paperwork lodged with the electoral commission. “We adhere to the relevant rules,” Frydenberg said.

Asked to explain how those values might translate to policy undertakings extracted from the major parties in a minority government negotiation, he said independents had made it clear to Climate 200 that any donations would have to come with “no strings attached”. “We don’t have any agreement at all with the candidates, they are strictly independent and that is of critical importance to them,” the Climate 200 convener said. He ventured that Steggall “got it right” with a private member’s bill requiring the government to set a rolling emissions budget and introduce risk assessment and adaptation plans, establish an independent climate change commission and incorporate the Morrison government’s technology investment roadmap. Holmes à Court said he supported proper resourcing for the Climate Change Authority. But he declined to elaborate further.",News/Australia news,Holmes à Court insists Climate 200 doesn’t have any agreements with the independents it’s backing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/holmes-a-court-insists-climate-200-doesnt-have-any-agreements-with-the-independents-its-backing

2/16/2022,"The Morrison government has argued it needs to pass its strengthening character test bill to prevent “overseas criminals” staying in Australia. Labor has said the government already has that power, saying if it can deport a tennis player (Novak Djokovic) it can deport someone with a criminal conviction.  So what is the bill – and what is the truth of the power the immigration minister already has, or might gain? The bill amends migration law to create a new category of “designated offences” involving violence against a person, weapons, breaching of an apprehended violence order and nonconsensual sexual acts, punishable by a maximum of at least two years in prison. If a non-citizen is convicted of one of these designated offences they are automatically deemed to fail the existing “character test” and their visa can be considered for cancellation. Yes. Section 501(2) of the Migration Act states that the minister “may cancel a visa … if the minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test”. So, there is no minimum standard of criminal conduct for visa cancellation or refusal. The Australian government can already cancel visas even without criminal conduct. In December, the human rights committee, chaired by Nationals MP Anne Webster, concluded: The minister may already cancel or refuse a person’s visa where a person has committed an offence that would fall within the new definition of ‘designated offence’, including having regard to the broad notion of the person’s past or present criminal or general conduct. The explanatory memorandum says the bill creates a “new specific and objective ground” for failing the character test. This “aligns directly with community expectations that non-citizens who are convicted of offences such as murder, sexual assault or aggravated burglary will not be permitted to enter or remain in the Australian community”, according to the memorandum. However, it also notes that failing the character test due to a designated offence “would enliven the discretion whether to … cancel a visa but would not dictate the outcome of the exercise of the discretion”. On Wednesday the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, said the bill gives “more discretionary power” to cancel visas, including allowing crimes committed offshore or in the past to be triggers to refuse or cancel visas. The biggest concern is that by increasing the number of people who fail the character test the bill makes it much more likely they will be deported, with one estimate suggesting visa cancellations could increase fivefold. Permanent residents, even those who have lived in Australia for many years with no substantial links to their country of citizenship, are already deported, and this would probably increase. Visa cancellations disproportionately affect citizens of New Zealand, and have been a substantial sticking point in Australia’s relations with the country. On 10 February, Labor’s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, wrote to her counterpart Hawke setting out three concerns: The changes should not be retrospective; The risk that low-level offending could result in visa cancellation should be reduced by using the existing definition of a “substantial” criminal record; The impact on New Zealanders should be softened by a new ministerial declaration. The government has had many goes at getting this through. The first bill, introduced in 2018, lapsed at the 2019 election. The second, introduced in July 2019, was defeated in the Senate in October 2021. The government reintroduced the bill in November. On Wednesday, Hawke said the bill would be put for a vote as a “test for Labor”. This follows Scott Morrison telling Coalition MPs and senators they should look to ramp up examples of “sharp contrast” with Labor in the lead-up to the 2022 election. The government has made one change. The third version of the bill states that a violent offence will only be “designated” if it “substantially contributes to bodily harm to another person” or their mental health, or involves family violence. This was added to exclude extremely low-grade common assaults. Keneally has claimed further negotiations are still possible – but on Wednesday Hawke ruled out further amendments. Labor, despite opposing the bill in October, has resolved not to oppose the bill in the House of Representatives. On Wednesday Hawke suggested it would go to the Senate before the election, but later in question time complained Labor had shifted its support “when [they] know we have run out of time to pass the bill”. The Greens have warned Labor will fold there and wave it through – but no final decision has been taken. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor used Novak Djokovic’s deportation as an example of the godlike powers in the Migration Act, after the world number one tennis player was deported in January due to Hawke’s concerns his presence in Australia would embolden the anti-vaccination movement. The government countered that section 116, which was used to deport Djokovic, cannot be used against permanent residents in Australia. Labor suggested this could be fixed by an amendment – but it is largely a red herring as there are powers to cancel visas for failure of the character test elsewhere in the act.",News/Australia news,What is the strengthening character test bill and does Australia need it?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/what-is-the-strengthening-character-test-bill-and-does-australia-need-it
2/16/2022,"It took courage for Ayodeji Bella to raise the subject of female genital mutilation in her rural community in southern Nigeria. She knew local chiefs were key to challenging beliefs around the practice but when Bella, who was cut at five, broached the issue with an elder from her village, she was rebuked. “I was young and unmarried and they wouldn’t take me seriously.”  Four years on, the tribal chiefs are contacting Bella directly for advice on how to stamp out FGM. One of a thousand grassroots activists in 10 African countries backed by the Global Media Campaign (GMC), Bella now hosts discussions on television stations. “After I started appearing on TV, they couldn’t shut me up,” she says. “They had to listen and now the tribal leaders contact me and say ‘let’s talk about FGM’.” FGM has been practically eliminated over three years in one community where she works. Engaging with local media is the most efficient way of changing minds, according to Maggie O’Kane, former Guardian journalist and co-founder of GMC. “We pioneered this new activist model and now because we have the data to prove it works, we have big organisations like UNFPA and Plan [International] supporting it.” Since 2016, GMC has raised $6.4m (£4.8m) – channelling it directly to small, local groups. “I really think if we give these frontline women more money, we can end FGM by 2030. They don’t waste a penny,” says O’Kane. Eleven independent impact surveys in countries including Sierra Leone and Nigeria have shown the success of the small grants – typically between $300 and $500. Three years of surveys in Kenya’s Tana River region showed support for the most severe type three FGM dropped from 89% to 5%. In Mali funding has delivered 193 local and national media campaigns, accumulating 468 hours of airtime reaching 86 million people. Afterwards, an independent study by 60 Decibels in 2021 recorded an 8% drop in support for FGM in the previous six months. O’Kane says: “Mali’s TV chief would not even allow FGM to be mentioned on-air 18 months ago, but now the negative impact of cutting girls is being shown during primetime TV ads reaching 5 million people a night – and the rates of cutting are falling.” The World Bank has now given $50,000 to build on the progress. “There used to be this idea that you could have a pan-African, one size fits all policy to tackle FGM,” says O’Kane. “But the factors driving the cutting of girls vary. In Sierra Leone, you have the Bondo secret societies run by women, whereas in Somalia it is all linked to religion, and in Nigeria, it is the tribal chiefs who hold the power.” O’Kane says: “Our activists use little radio stations and cheap TV, they barter with their contacts. We have this whole unofficial network skilled at bargaining for air time.” Messaging platform WhatsApp is at the heart of activist networks, linking campaigners, who offer mutual support and ensure money is accounted for. “For this model to work, the accounts have to be impeccable,” says O’Kane. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the removal of part or all of the external genitalia for nonmedical reasons, as defined by the World Health Organization. There are different types of cutting: removal of the clitoris and/or its hood; removing the clitoris and the inner fold of the vulva (labia minora); and the narrowing of the vaginal opening by cutting and repositioning the labia minora through stitching. Also known as infibulation, this has the worst health consequences. The fourth type of cutting includes other forms of injury to the genitalia such as incising, scraping or cauterising. Since traditional practitioners use razor blades or knives, with no anaesthesia, girls experience excruciating pain and are at risk of severe bleeding and infections which can lead to sepsis. Some do not survive. For the girls, who are often married off soon after genital cutting, sex is traumatic and painful, and enjoying sex will always be difficult unless they have surgical reconstruction. In pregnancy, delivery is often risky due to obstructed and prolonged labour. Women are at risk of developing obstetric fistula (an abnormal opening between a woman’s genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum) which can cause incontinence – leading to shame, stigma and rejection from their partners. Bella is from Wanikin village in Osun, a state which has the highest rates of FGM in Nigeria. She says: “Often we see funds from big NGOs stopping in Abuja or Lagos.” Smaller grants have been supporting work to challenge deep-rooted beliefs in harder-to-reach communities. “For some people where I live cutting is a profession that has been handed down through generations. They want to protect their father’s legacy by continuing the practice so our work is to challenge that belief system.” Ifrah Ahmed has been using grants for radio projects in Somalia. The founder of the Ifrah Foundation has been working in camps for people displaced by hunger and war after hearing about women who had died in childbirth due to complications related to FGM. Ahmed distributes $10 radios and says she has already noticed a shift in attitudes. “Pregnant women who have had type three FGM are dying because of the way they have been cut. In some cases, we are hearing of both the mother and baby dying because the mother will be pushing for several days, but the baby is stuck. “Now we are using the airwaves to spread the word – often through interviews with doctors and midwives – to convince women who are having difficulties in labour to go to hospital.” The speed and effectiveness of local responses has convinced big funders that they can give money safely at grassroots level. In January 2020, it was estimated that it would cost $2.4bn to end FGM by 2030 in 31 countries. Mireille Tushiminina, coordinator of a joint programme by the UN Population Fund and the UN Children’s Fund on the elimination of FGM, says direct funding of activists is now key to reaching the UN goal to end FGM by 2030. “We have just completed phase three of our programme and the priority of our fourth phase will be working with the grassroots feminist movement and bringing more youth on board,” she says. “We don’t want to limit ourselves to funding country and regional offices. We are also looking at innovative funding streams that will reach those at local level.” This month the joint programme held an international youth summit . “Young people are bringing a lot of innovation. More important are those who are not afraid of disrupting the system – I personally see conflict as an opportunity for social change,” Tushiminina says. “Our roundtable events give us the opportunity to think differently about the approach. Anti-FGM campaigning has taken a considerable hit from the poverty brought by the pandemic. It is estimated that 2 million more girls over the next decade will be subjected to the practice than before Covid. In Kenya, for example, many families supplement their incomes with cash earned by relatives working in hotels or as cleaners. When tourism shut down and poverty closed in, families were left with few options. O’Kane says: “One activist told me: ‘Everyone is poor and desperate – all they have is their girls.’ You can get eight cows for a girl. But if you are going to get a dowry, then the girls need to be cut.” But Covid did bring opportunities. “During lockdown in Guinea we saw the motorbike taxi drivers become the eyes and ears of the community,” says Tushiminina. “Due to the increase in gender-based violence, groups of men mobilised themselves to report harmful practices, including FGM. “The campaign expanded to 500 taxi drivers engaging in the spread of anti-FGM messaging. According to our Guinea country office, the initiative has the potential to reach 700,000 people. It has been so inspiring to see these young men join the fight.” But those who know the communities where cutting is prevalent say ending FGM by 2030 is a tall order. “We need to double up on our systems. We need more funds and we need more people working on the ground,” says Bella.

2/16/2022,"There is a case from Dr Morissanda Kouyaté’s career that stays with him. In 1983, Kouyaté, then 32, was working at a village hospital in Guinea when 12-year-old twins, Hassantou and Housseynatou, were brought in. Through wails, their relatives told Kouyaté that earlier that day, the girls had been taken into the bush to be submitted to genital mutilation. Now, they were barely conscious and bleeding heavily.  For the next 48 hours, Kouyaté and his colleagues worked to try to save them; his own wife came and donated blood. But the girls died. “We did everything,” he says. “I was very sad because at that time, I had my two daughters who were very young. I thought about the people who had lost their twins.” Kouyaté wrote a letter to the Guinean ministry of health, recounting what had happened and that this practice must be controlled. His letter ended up at the headquarters of the World Health Organization and Kouyaté was invited to Geneva to learn more about female genital mutilation (FGM). Since then, Kouyaté has dedicated much of his life to fighting FGM and was instrumental in founding the Inter-African Committee (IAC), which brought 16 countries together to focus on practices affecting the health of women and children. In 2003, the IAC organised a conference where several first ladies declared 6 February as a day to mark zero tolerance of FGM, something adopted by the UN in 2012. In 2020, Kouyaté, received the Mandela prize for his work. Kouyaté, who last year became minister of foreign affairs for the Republic of Guinea, was one of the few male campaigners in the early 1980s. Now, he says many more men are involved, something he believes is essential if FGM is to be eradicated by the UN’s target date of 2030. “If you consider FGM a female issue, that is minimising the effect of this practice,” he says. “It is a violation of human rights; men must be involved in the fight against that. Of course women and girls are direct physical victims but men are indirect victims – the consequences of the practice affect men.” In Somalia, where an estimated 99% of women have been mutilated – the highest level anywhere in the world, activist Hassan Istiila, 30, is often asked why he, as a man, is so involved in the anti-FGM campaign. “People say to me, ‘You are male, why are you talking about a women’s issue?’” says Istiila. “In Somalia, culturally, men dominate the house. They are the decision makers. If they don’t agree, women can’t refuse.” Istiila became aware of FGM and the resulting dangers to life and risks around childbirth while he was at university. As a campaigner he received training in 2017 from the anti-FGM Global Media Campaign and now works to change the narrative in a country where anti-FGM legislation does not exist. But there is a great deal of stigma around speaking about it. Over the past five years, he has noticed a change in attitudes. “There is an increasing number of people, especially women, who are talking about the issue on the radio or on social media. It’s not a big number but it’s good when you look back to five or six years ago,” he says. Istiila worked as a journalist, including on the story of Fartun Hassan Ahmed, 13, a girl who bled to death last year after being cut and whose loss was keenly felt by her blind father. “That story touched me. The girl was the right hand of her father,” he says. “I asked him why he submitted her to FGM and he told me his wife had decided and he accepted it. He said if he had refused, his daughter would still be alive.” A few months later, Fartun’s father joined the anti-FGM movement. In Kenya, Jeremiah Kipainoi, 29, an award-winning journalist, thinks the time for raising awareness is over. “There’s no need to keep sensitising people,” he says. “I don’t think there’s anyone who doesn’t know FGM is wrong.” He points to Kenya’s Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2011, which made FGM punishable by imprisonment or a hefty fine. President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to end FGM by 2022. In Kenya, 21% of girls and women aged 15 to 49 have had their genitals mutilated. Kipainoi is now doing what he calls accountability activism. “FGM is happening,” he says. “I have to task those people who are supposed to prevent it from happening to do their job.” When the pandemic hit, he started End FGM live, which broadcast over the internet, interviewing officials whose mandate it is to end the practice, and enabling people to directly address their questions and concerns to those in power. In December, when he heard that hundreds of girls in south-west Kenya had been cut, he called the county commissioner, who was on holiday at the time. “It was a little bit confrontational,” he says, “but from that we were able to get them to act and arrest people.” Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the removal of part or all of the external genitalia for nonmedical reasons, as defined by the World Health Organization. There are different types of cutting: removal of the clitoris and/or its hood; removing the clitoris and the inner fold of the vulva (labia minora); and the narrowing of the vaginal opening by cutting and repositioning the labia minora through stitching.

In pregnancy, delivery is often risky due to obstructed and prolonged labour. Women are at risk of developing obstetric fistula (an abnormal opening between a woman’s genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum) which can cause incontinence – leading to shame, stigma and rejection from their partners. Prof Wilberforce Oti, a lecturer and pastor, is similarly determined to end FGM in his native Nigeria. The UN Population Fund estimates 25% of female Nigerians aged 15 to 49 have undergone FGM. The 2015 Violence against Persons (Prohibition) Act makes it a federal offence but it has not been passed in all 36 states and, according to Oti, implementation is low. Oti’s resolve was sparked by a training session in 2016 for religious leaders. “That was the first time I got deep information about the adverse effects of FGM,” he says. “I began to imagine what my own mother must have gone through. She told me every time she gave birth they had to cut her open. She shared this with me and I found I was going to do everything in my power to not let anybody I know go through this and to stop it happening to as many people as possible.” He uses his position to talk to traditional rulers, the “custodians of culture and tradition”, and hosts a radio programme, Brand New Me. He says he has seen a drop in support for FGM and in his own state of Ebonyi – statistics suggest prevalence has fallen from 74% in 2013 to 53.2% in 2018; nationwide, prevalence has dropped from 25% to 20%. Oti is encouraged but doubtful over the UN’s 2030 goal. “If we are going at the pace we are going right now, we will minimise FGM, but this is not the same as eradicating it completely,” he says. “We are doing our best, but I wish we could do more.” Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:",News/Global development,"‘Men must be involved in the fight against girls being cut, it’s a violation’",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/16/fgm-men-must-be-involved-in-the-fight-against-girls-being-cut-violation-of-human-rights
2/16/2022,"A serving SAS soldier has told a court that at least two men were pulled from a tunnel inside a compound being raided by Australian SAS troops during a 2009 clearance operation in Afghanistan, a mission that has since become a key element of the defamation trial brought by Ben Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing.  Anonymised before the federal court as Person 42, the Warrant Officer Class 2 and veteran of more than two decades’ military service appeared in court as a witness for the Nine newspapers’ defence. Person 42 told the court he and other soldiers discovered the hidden tunnel during the raid on a compound called Whiskey 108. The soldiers called out in Pashto for anyone hiding inside to come out. “They came out unarmed, they came out freely, they came out relatively quickly once we gave them the commands,” he said. Person 42 said he took custody of one of the men and patted him down to ensure he was unarmed before passing him to the control of another soldier. He did not see the man again. The events at Whiskey 108 on 12 April 2009 – and the presence or otherwise of men in the tunnel – have emerged as central to the allegations made against Roberts-Smith in the newspapers’ defence of the defamation claim. Roberts-Smith is a Victoria Cross winner and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers. Roberts-Smith has been accused in the course of the newspapers’ defence of ordering the execution an elderly Afghan man and murdering another man who had a prosthetic leg, both of whom had been taken from the tunnel in the compound. Roberts-Smith denies the allegations and says there was no one discovered in the tunnel. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Two other soldiers have previously given evidence in the trial on behalf of the newspapers about the alleged executions of the two men at Whiskey 108. One soldier, Person 41, told the court Roberts-Smith and another soldier borrowed his suppressor which was then used in the execution of the elderly man. Person 41 also said he later saw Roberts-Smith “frogmarch” the man with a prosthetic leg outside a village compound, throw him to the ground and machine-gun him to death. Another soldier, Person 14, said he saw an Australian soldier carrying a distinctive weapon, a Minimi machine gun, throw a human-shaped object to the ground and fire a burst of bullets into it. He said he later saw Roberts-Smith carrying a Minimi during that mission. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied those versions of events, describing them as “completely false”. In his evidence last year, he said he never ordered an elderly man shot, and says he killed the man with a prosthetic leg outside Whiskey 108 because the man was a legitimate target, armed and running away, and was killed in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. He said no people were taken out of the tunnel in the compound. “There were no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108,” he told the court. Whiskey 108 was a compound in the village of Kakarak, known as an insurgent stronghold, on the western side of the Dorafshan River in Uruzgan province and near an allied forward operating base. In court on Wednesday, Person 42 said Whiskey 108 had been bombed by allied aircraft ahead of the Australian troops’ mission to ‘clear’ the compound on 12 April 2009, checking for insurgents, weapons, and bomb-making materials. They found some weapons, ammunition and grenades, but “there were no enemy combatants found as part of the assault”, he said. Shown pictures of the bodies of the men allegedly killed during the raid on Whiskey 108, Person 42 said he was unable to positively identify them. Under cross-examination, he said Australian troops discovered the tunnel after being alerted to it by women, and possibly children, who were in the compound. Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 42 that his evidence was not true “because you weren’t there”. “That is not true,” the soldier replied.

2/16/2022,"A promotion by the fast-fashion retailer Boohoo that used “sexually suggestive” images of a model in an oversized T-shirt and thong-style bikini bottoms has been banned by the UK advertising watchdog for objectifying and sexualising women. The online retailer used several images of the model, including a shot taken from the rear of her kneeling and another of her sitting with her legs apart, which prompted a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the promotion was offensive, harmful and irresponsible.  Boohoo, which has previously been censured by the ASA for an email promotion headed “Send nudes”, said that the way it presented garments “reflected the diversity of women in society and their customer base”. The watchdog said that while the advert was presented as part of the swimwear category, the actual advertised product was the T-shirt and the listing on the website appeared as a result of searches for T-shirts or tops. The ASA said that in each case the staging of the shots was “sexually suggestive”, with the model shown with the T-shirt folded in ways to expose her body, instead of focusing on the product. “We noted that neither the partial nudity nor the bikini bottoms were relevant to the product and that the images did not show the product as it would usually be worn,” the ASA said in its ruling. “For those reasons, we concluded that the ad objectified and sexualised women. It was therefore irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence.” Boohoo said that it understood the importance of the issues raised by the ASA and removed the images from its website before the publication of the ruling. “We told Boohoo to ensure that future ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society,” the ASA said. In 2019, the ASA banned a Boohoo email promotion that used the phrase “Send nudes” in a message to customers marketing a range of clothes coloured to resemble skin. It pictured a female model wearing a short, white dress and beige jacket with the words “Send nudes. Set the tone with new season hues” written across the image. The ASA said the phrase “send nudes” was likely to be understood as referring to requests for sexual photos and said it was irresponsible to make light of a “potentially harmful social trend”.",News/Business,Boohoo forced to drop ‘sexually suggestive’ images by watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/16/boohoo-forced-to-drop-sexually-suggestive-images-by-watchdog
2/16/2022,"Downton Abbey co-stars Michelle Dockery and Michael Fox are to release a debut EP later this year after signing to Decca Records. The pair, known musically as Michael and Michelle, first met on the hit period drama, in which Fox plays footman Andrew Parker and Dockery plays Lady Mary Crawley.  They soon discovered their shared passion for music, and a casual jam led to regular practices and time in a recording studio in Los Angeles. “There was something about that time after the series had ended,” Dockery said, “about looking at something with fresh eyes and feeling nervous about what’s ahead. Then suddenly we were just writing music.” Six years later, they have made their partnership official with the release of The Watching Silence on 6 May. Produced by Ian Grimble (Catfish And The Bottlemen), the EP consists of four original songs with Fox and Dockery singing and on dual guitars – recalling alt country partnerships Civil Wars and Angus and Julia Stone. The EP also features Mumford and Sons’ Chris Mass on percussion and Willy Mason’s Tommy Heap on piano and drums. “It’s a whole different set of skills and vulnerability,” Dockery said of the difference between music and acting. “Acting tends to start with what’s already written on the page. Music can begin anywhere. It’s different and very freeing.” Fox added: “I will always love acting but there is something about us, some part of our characters that we haven’t fully realised – and that’s happening now.” Growing up, Fox was in a number of bands ranging in styles from indie to folktronica and wrote his own songs. Dockery sang on various London stages, and was inspired by the music of Joni Mitchell, Alison Krauss and Indigo Girls. They will continue to juggle their music and acting commitments. According to the label, Michael and Michelle’s music is “both classic and utterly timeless: though more Nashville Americana than UK folk in melody and structure, their impressionistic songs are modern and immediate, free of pastiche, and are shot through with their own London realism.”. Laura Monks and Tom Lewis, co-presidents of Decca, said in a statement: “We are thrilled to have these two multi-talented artists join the Decca family. They are a perfect match and we fell in love with their sound and chemistry as soon as we heard them. We know their global fanbase will be as excited to finally hear them on record as we are.” Michael and Michelle’s first public show will be at Omeara London on 6 June. Downton Abbey, the British historical drama set in the early 20th century, premiered in 2010 and ran for six seasons. A film of the same name released in 2019, with the sequel, A New Era, due for release this spring. Dockery, who recently starred in Apple TV’s Defending Jacob, will also be seen on screen in the long-awaited Netflix adaptation of the bestselling novel Anatomy of a Scandal alongside Sienna Miller and Rupert Friend.",Arts/Television & radio,Downton Abbey’s Lady Mary to release folk EP with co-star,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/16/downton-abbeys-lady-mary-to-release-folk-ep-with-co-star
2/16/2022,"This week British bankers will start collecting the biggest bonuses since before the 2008 global financial crisis as their employers fight an “increasingly intense war for talent”. As most Britons face the biggest squeeze on their incomes since at least 1990, already very highly paid bankers are celebrating “particularly obscene” bonuses in the City’s pubs and wine bars.  “We have had quite the run on champagne – the poshest champagne we stock,” says James, a bartender at the New Moon on the streets of Leadenhall Market near the headquarters of many of the City of London’s banks. “They come here to celebrate when they get told their ‘number’ – the numbers seem to have been particularly obscene this year.” London’s mergers and acquisitions (M&A) bankers earned total fees of $3.5bn (£2.6bn) in 2021, according to research by financial data provider Refinitiv for the Guardian. It is the highest annual total for M&A banker fees paid since Refinitiv’s records began in 2000, fuelled by a frenzy of corporate takeovers sparked by a flood of private equity cash and acquisitive American buyers preying on undervalued British targets. That money is now set to be returned to bankers in their bonuses. London’s big four banks – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest – are expected to pay out bonuses totalling more than £4bn when they report their annual results in the next fortnight. Combined, the banks’ annual profits are expected to exceed £34bn – the most since 2007 in the boom before the financial crisis. The bankers’ huge paydays come days after the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, who was paid £575,538 last year, called on workers across the country not to ask their bosses for pay rises to help control inflation, which has soared to a 30-year high of 5.4%. Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, which represents 600,000 mostly frontline workers, said: “These sky-high banker bonuses are a kick in the teeth for everyone suffering with the cost of living crisis. I hope Andrew Bailey tells his banking mates to show the same ‘restraint’ he so readily demands from underpaid workers in the rest of the economy. “Essential workers, like our nation’s carers, often earn pennies above the minimum wage,” Smith said. “Mr Bailey should step out of his banking bubble and shadow these workers to see the people who actually deserve a proper pay rise.” The bumper bonuses will tip several hundred more UK bankers into the EU’s “high earners” warning report which details every banker earning more than €1m (£835,000) a year. The European Banking Authority (EBA) found that 3,519 bankers working in the UK earned more than €1m-a-year last year – more than seven times as many as those working in Germany which has the second highest number of €1m-a-year bankers. The EBA figures show 27 UK bankers earned more than €10m in 2019 (the latest year available). Two UK-based asset managers were paid between €38m and €39m, and one merchant banker was paid €64.8m. That banker received fixed pay of €242,000, topped up with a bonus of €64.6m. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the huge increase in bankers’ pay was “an insult to working families across Britain”. “While millions struggle with the cost of living, executive bankers are set to receive yet another cash windfall,” she said. “At a time when workers are being told not to ask for a decent pay rise, no such restraint is being asked of the City. We should be holding down bonuses, not ordinary people’s wages.” Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, which campaigns for executive pay restraint, said: “Decades of economic deference to the super rich have brought us to a point where bankers are raking in historic pay awards while the rest of the country is crippled by rising prices and wage stagnation. “This wealth isn’t ever going to trickle down without action from policymakers. It’s in the interests of everybody, not least the banks’ shareholders, customers and lower-paid workers who ultimately bear the cost of these awards, that we strengthen employment rights, corporate governance and progressive taxation to build an economy that works for everyone.” Figures released on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that average pay in the public sector rose by 2.6% between October and December 2021, while those working in business and finance saw their pay grow by 8.1% due to “an increase in bonus payments”. NatWest, the first of the banks to report its results, is expected on Friday to post a £4bn profit for 2021 compared with a £351m loss in 2020. The bank, which is still more than 50% owned by the taxpayer following its bailout during the financial crisis, is expected by analysts to pay bonuses of almost £300m up from just over £200m last year. Barclays is expected by City analysts to report profits of just over £8bn next Wednesday, which would lead to bonus payouts of more than £1.9bn – up £300m on the previous year. A big chunk of the bonus pool will be paid to Jes Staley, Barclays’ former chief executive who quit in November amid an inquiry into his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Staley is still in line for bonus payments of up to £22m over the next six years if the bank hits its profit and share price targets. Lloyds, which paid no bonuses for 2020, is expected to pay out hundreds of millions in bonuses for 2021 as profits exceed analysts’ expectations. HSBC, which cut its bonuses by 15% last year but still paid out almost £2bn, is expected to significantly increase its pool this year and double bonuses paid to junior investment bankers. Greg Guyett, HSBC’s co-head of the global banking and markets division, last month said that HSBC was feeling the industrywide “upward pressure” on pay. “We’ve got to keep pay across the board competitive,” he said. It is not just in the UK that banks are raising bonuses in a global war for talent in the highly competitive M&A world. French bank Société Générale last week said it would “massively” increase its bonuses in order to attract and retain talent. In Germany, Christian Sewing, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, the nation’s largest bank, said last month: “We are very concerned about the increasingly intense war for talent and the wage developments in our industry. But it is also clear that we cannot and do not want to avoid this competition, because we too want to have and keep the best talent in our bank.”",News/Business,‘We’ve had a run on champagne:’ Biggest UK banker bonuses since financial crash,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/16/weve-had-a-run-on-champagne-biggest-uk-banker-bonuses-since-financial-crash
2/16/2022,"America’s vast coastline is being assailed by rapidly encroaching oceans, with up to 1ft of sea level rise expected in the next 30 years – an increase that equals the total rise seen over the past century, a major US federal government report has found. The seas are rising significantly faster around the US than the global average, a situation that will cause a “dramatic increase” in the number of Americans, already numbering tens of millions, vulnerable to disastrous flooding, the analysis warns.  The trend, driven by the human-caused climate change, is stark – instances of “moderate” flooding at high tide, capable of damaging homes and businesses, have already increased by 50% across the US since the 1990s. This flooding is expected to become 10 times more common by 2050, on average, while major, potentially catastrophic floods are set to happen five times more often by this time. This “profound shift” in coastal inundation means that the sort of flooding an area could expect once every two to five years is set to hit multiple times in a single year in some places, even in the absence of storms or heavy rainfall, according to the study, which was jointly authored by Nasa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and six other US government agencies. “Sea levels are continuing to rise at an alarming rate, endangering communities around the world,” said Bill Nelson, administrator of Nasa. “Science is indisputable and urgent action is required to mitigate a climate crisis that is well under way.” Rick Spinrad, administrator of Noaa, said the report should act as a “wake-up call” to the perils of the climate crisis. The seawater lapping at the edges of the contiguous US has already risen by about a foot since 1920, a faster increase than the 6-8in (15-20cm) experienced, on average, around the world over the same period. This sea level rise is on track to double within just 30 years around the US, although the rates of change will vary significantly across different regions. While the US west coast is expected to get 4-8in of extra sea level by 2050, the east coast will get up to 14in of raised seas and the communities ringing the Gulf of Mexico will be hit by a severe increase of up to 18in. The uneven rate of sea level rise will influence flood risk – the western part of the Gulf coast will see 10 times as many moderate flooding events a year compared with now, for example, while the risk of such flooding will edge up only slightly in Alaska and Hawaii. Certain communities will feel the brunt of this increasing flooding, with risks exacerbated by substandard housing, poor flood defenses and a shift in population that is seeing more people move into low-lying areas, such as Florida, that are vulnerable to the rising seas. There will be a 40% increase in flood risk in areas where at least 20% of the population is black, according to a recent study. The seas are rising globally due to the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases that help heat the atmosphere and oceans. As glaciers melt away under soaring temperatures – the huge ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have lost more than 6tn tons of ice since the 1990s – the meltwater causes the oceans to creep upwards. The seawater itself is expanding, too, as it heats up. The US government scientists said an improved understanding of ocean dynamics means there is confidence that the US should expect around 1ft of sea level rise over the next 30 years, with a total of 2ft expected by 2100, due to emissions already released. But much will depend on how quickly the US, and the world, is able to slash emissions and avoid disastrous climate change, with the risk of sea level rising by up to 4ft becoming far more likely if global temperatures are allowed to escalate to 3C, or more, beyond the pre-industrial era. The world has already heated up by about 1.2C since the advent of heavy industry. Joe Biden’s administration said the report underlined the need to slash planet-heating emissions, although the president has seen his climate agenda stall in Congress, his green reputation damaged by the continued issuing of oil and gas drilling permits, and he is now facing a looming supreme court case that may severely limit his ability to use his powers to curb pollution. “This new data on sea rise is the latest reconfirmation that our climate crisis – as the president has said – is blinking ‘code red’,” said Gina McCarthy, Biden’s top climate adviser. “We must redouble our efforts to cut the greenhouse gases that cause climate change while, at the same time, help our coastal communities become more resilient in the face of rising seas.”",News/US news,US sea level to rise as much in next 30 years as in past century – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/us-sea-level-rise-study-flooding
2/16/2022,"The news that the longtime accounting firm for the Trump Organization has cut ties with the company and retracted 10 years of its financial statements is a new and serious blow to Donald Trump’s increasingly frenzied battle to fend off the legal investigations that are rapidly engulfing him. The revelation that Mazars USA last week ended its relationship with the Trump family comes at a perilous moment for the former president as he strives to protect himself, his family and his business from legal threats that are now coming thick and fast.  A Guardian tally this month found that Trump was facing a total of 19 legal challenges, six of which involve alleged financial irregularities. By withdrawing its stamp of approval from the documents, Mazars leaves Trump potentially exposed to substantial legal and financial trouble. The papers, known as statements of financial condition, were used by Trump and his family business to attract and secure hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. They are also at the centre of an escalating investigation by the New York state attorney general, Letitia James. Last month James tightened the screws on Trump and the Trump Organization by releasing details in a filing of several instances involving golf courses, real estate and other assets where the family had allegedly “falsely and fraudulently valued multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for economic benefit”. In a letter dated 9 February, Mazars’ general counsel, William Kelly, told the Trump Organization that the annual financial statements it had prepared for the family business between 2011 and 2020 were no longer reliable. The accountants said they had based their decision partly on their own investigation into Trump’s finances and on the “totality of the circumstances”, concluding that “we are not able to provide any new work product to the Trump Organization”. On the back of James’s latest attack, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney and an ex-vice president of the Trump Organization, told the Guardian that in his opinion “the House of Trump is crumbling”. James’s investigation is one of the most advanced and potentially dangerous of all the 19 legal actions bearing down on Trump. The inquiry is being pursued on both civil and criminal lines. James is working in tandem with a separate criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg. That inquiry is also looking into whether Trump and his family concern defrauded lenders or underpaid taxes by falsely representing his assets. The disclosure that Mazars had broken off relations with Trump was included in a new court filing from James on Monday as part of her ongoing attempt to force Trump and his two eldest children, Donald Jr and Ivanka, to testify under subpoena. Trump has consistently denied financial impropriety and has attempted to cast doubt on James’s investigation by denouncing it as a partisan witch-hunt. James is a Democrat, while Trump won the presidency in 2016 as a Republican. The Trump Organization said it was “disappointed” by Mazars’ decision but tried to spin the development in a positive light. It selectively cited a line in the Mazars letter that said that “we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies”, adding that the comment rendered the James and Bragg investigations “moot”. As Trump’s legal and financial woes deepen, he is also being assailed by a flurry of bad news surrounding the congressional investigation into the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Trump, who is at the centre of the House select committee inquiry given that his “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen from him drew thousands of his supporters to the Capitol building that day, has been trying to persuade his closest advisers not to cooperate. This week it was revealed that John Eastman, a conservative law professor who was integral to attempts to persuade the then vice president, Mike Pence, to delay certification of Joe Biden’s victory on January 6, has handed over 8,000 pages of emails to the committee. It has also become known that Rudy Giuliani, who as Trump’s lawyer was a key figure in the campaign to overturn the presidential election results, has opened a dialogue with the committee that could see him testifying in some form.",News/US news,Donald Trump’s legal woes threaten to engulf him as accountants abandon ship,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/donald-trump-mazars-accountants-legal-woes
2/16/2022,"There are rainforests in Britain. These are woodlands drenched in rain, humid and mild, with gnarled old trees covered in shaggy green blankets of mosses, lichens and ferns. Few other places in the world have these temperate rainforests, and in Britain they once covered much of the wet western side of the country, but are now reduced to pockets of woodland in steep gullies and slopes where they manage to cling on in parts of west Scotland, Wales, the Lake District and south-west England. And these rare habitats are threatened by farming, invasive plants and conifer plantations.But a project in Snowdonia national park in north Wales is restoring and expanding the rainforest there. Rhododendron ponticum is a shrub from the Mediterranean that can grow so vigorously it smothers other plants and can dominate woodlands. In a £7m project, the alien rhododendrons are being ripped out with all their roots, or the stems on each bush are injected with small amounts of herbicide to kill the entire plant. Once the rhododendrons are eradicated, a few highland cattle are used to keep down bracken and brambles and leave the ground open for native trees and plants to regenerate naturally.",News/Environment,Plantwatch: project under way to restore Britain’s rainforests ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/plantwatch-project-restore-britain-rainforests-snowdonia
2/16/2022,"Keir Starmer once claimed Boris Johnson was “not a bad man”, just “unserious”. He is close to reappraising that now after a fortnight of rows and threats over the prime minister’s false accusation that Starmer failed to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile during his time at the Crown Prosecution Service. That accusation – which the prime minister has “clarified” but never withdrawn – was a moment for many Conservative MPs. Though only a handful have spoken publicly, Starmer told the Guardian that dozens had been in touch with him privately to express distaste. “You can see the disquiet because as he drags people down by this way of acting.”  Starmer said it was clear the public were taking a new look at Johnson’s character since his repeated obfuscations over Downing Street lockdown breaches. Has he changed his mind since saying in his Labour conference speech that Johnson was not bad? “I don’t know how people judge whether someone’s a bad person or not. What I do know is he’s not fit to run the country,” he said. “And it’s not surprising that more people think he should now resign than don’t. So that’s a marked change, obviously, in four or five months.” Labour has held a robust lead in the polls since mid-November though party chiefs remain cautious over how much Johnson’s “partygate” troubles have inflated the lead, with voters still repeating that they do not know what Starmer’s Labour really stands for. Methodology changes from some pollsters have recently shrunk Labour’s lead, taking more into account how voters are switching to “don’t know”. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, has driven home in recent weeks that the party needs to be far more visible presenting its own agenda. It is recess in parliament and Starmer is spending most of it in the north of England and the Midlands: Sunderland, Burnley, Erdington. On Tuesday, he was on the factory floor of the plastics manufacturer What More UK, giving an amused Nandy a detailed tour of the toolmaking machines two decades after his toolmaker father used similar ones. Labour has made big promises to kickstart a renewal of British manufacturing and Burnley is a stark illustration of the north-south divide in industry. Census data shows that for each high-skilled manufacturing job, there are five low-skilled ones. In Cambridge or Crawley, it’s one for one. A major local employer, Studio Retail, called in administrators last week, putting 1,000 jobs at risk. One of the factory bosses who showed Starmer around estimated it was about one in 30 jobs in the local area. “If this were another part of the country, there’d be a government taskforce,” he said. Burnley has been a hostile environment for Labour politicians recently – it fell to the Tories for the first time in 100 years in 2019 – but for much of his visit, Starmer was in a comfort zone of sorts. He told his family history at length to any worker who would listen as he roamed the factory. His second stop was meeting law students at Burnley college, where he was questioned on practical routes to the bar, and about his first legal case defending careless driving: “I lost.” At one point, he relaxed enough to declare to the ambitious students “the next leader of the Labour party could be in this room” and then realised Nandy was grinning beside him and laughed. About 60 wavering voters met Starmer on Tuesday evening in the college to talk about Labour’s “contract” – security, prosperity and respect – which they were tasked with analysing. The mood was generally bleak. Just two raised their hands when asked if the town would be better off in five years. On a table of 10 younger voters, none said they planned to stay in Burnley. “It’s not a viable option,” said one. Another said: “If you want to do well, you can’t do it Burnley. I’m never proud to say I’m from here.” Older voters describe the housing stock as “decimated” and express fears for a generation held back by Covid. There was anger, too, at politicians, but not overtly at Johnson. “We keep hearing lies, all the time, from politicians,” one woman said. Starmer said he acknowledged Labour had to transform more voters turning against Johnson into making a positive choice to vote for his party. His first reply has been a radical overhaul of his party, including divisive policies at party conference, a reshuffle that reinstated many Labour heavyweights sidelined in the Corbyn years, tough stances on antisemitism and unequivocal backing of Nato, with a sideswipe at Stop the War coalition where his predecessor holds a leading role. Activists and MPs on the party’s left have spoken of feeling betrayed at this uncompromising attitude. But Starmer said his main focus was winning back trust from seats like Burnley. “When you lose former Labour voters, then you have to look at the Labour party and say – what do we need to change in the Labour party? – and we’ve made those changes,” he said. “We’ve got more to do and every vote has to be earned. And that’s why we’re here.” Nandy, the MP for nearby Wigan, is cautious about how far Labour has advanced in this part of England. “We’ve got more work to do,” she said. “We have to show them we can be trusted with a very scarce amount of money people have.” But still too few voters had heard their policies, she said. “When I talk to people in Wigan, in Leigh, they have been positive about our offer but they didn’t know about it. That’s why you have to be here, on their territory. “Voters talk about energy bills but they don’t know our policy of a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. We’re doing something wrong when we’ve been saying nothing but that for the last three months and people haven’t heard it.”",News/Politics,Keir Starmer hits the road on mission to win back voter trust,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/16/keir-starmer-hits-the-road-on-mission-to-win-back-voter-trust
2/16/2022,"Iam in the heady throes of a new relationship. That buoyant, lusty state that’s so electrified we sometimes mistake it for love. We are illegally in her cell, on her bed, mostly naked, so deep into our lovemaking that we are deaf to the guard’s keys jingling down the long corridor. By the time we realise, she is at the doorway, snatching down the curtain. We are scrambling to put on our clothes and sit up in some semblance of propriety. Sweaty, embarrassed, scared. “Give me your IDs,” she says, sternly. We hand them to her, knowing she is going to write us up for numerous charges that will lead to our being separated into different housing units, possibly removed from our jobs. “Get dressed, go to your rooms and stay there,” she says.  As she leaves, I say: “Let me go talk to her.” My partner is new to prison, but I have been here for over a decade. I know my way around. As I walk towards the officer’s station, I try to strike a balance between being contrite for breaking a rule and putting the guard in an awkward position, while remaining unashamed of my intimacy. I think back to my pre-prison years of coming out and fighting for gay liberation to help me keep my cool. I suspect that this guard is also a lesbian. I look her straight in her eye as I barter for our freedom. Finally, she gives me back our IDs and I promise her two weeks of cleaning tasks. I go back to my partner’s room to give her her ID and crow. I am giddy with relief. She is not. She is embarrassed and stressed. She is traumatised, and this trauma reverberates with so many prior traumas. As her fear morphs into anger, she snarls at me. It is a moment that does not last long, but will be repeated many times during our relationship, triggered by the distorted circumstances of sexual repression that define our lives inside. I want to talk about sex in women’s prisons. Not about sexual abuse. Not sex for the sake of mass audiences’ titillation. Not a sociologist’s study of ersatz family configurations in women’s prisons. I want to talk about how sex, sexuality and touch are human needs and human rights, denied and distorted, criminalised and repressed when we enter the prison system. I want to talk about what that does to those of us who spend our prime years inside; what that does to women whose experience of trauma paved their roads to harm, self-harm and prison itself. Even now, out of prison for almost three years, I feel dizzy as I write this piece. Four decades of forbidden lovemaking, closet quickies and silent, suppressed orgasms; of being forbidden to dance in my partner’s arms or hold hands while we walk down the hill to work. Four decades of longing and hiding, and always having to listen out. Of pat frisks and strip searches and squatting and coughing and spreading my butt cheeks, of urinating in front of uniformed strangers; of being threatened with misbehaviour reports for hugging a youngster in tears or in celebration; of only being allowed 15 minutes of a “privacy curtain” to undress in the non-privacy of my own cell. My neck and shoulders ache as adrenaline rushes through my body. Past and present collapse. I feel a giant lump in my throat of suppressed desire and unspoken fury, of woman love and woman rage, of the decades-long cry of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, demanding a voice that reverberates inside and out.

2/16/2022,"The three-part documentary series Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy (Netflix) opens with footage of Kanye West behaving exactly like a seasoned observer of Kanye West’s recent career might expect the 44-year-old rapper to behave. He is in the Dominican Republic, simultaneously recording a vocal, urging his people to push forward with his desperately ill-considered and disastrous 2020 presidential run, dealing with the contracts pertaining to the documentary you’re watching and tweeting something that’s clearly incautious. “Don’t tweet that?” he snaps at someone off-camera, who has evidently suggested he think twice, before firmly pressing the send button. Then the footage cuts out. According to the documentary’s makers Clarence “Coodie” Simmons and Chike Ozah, in the Dominican Republic they felt obliged to stop filming in order to spare viewers West’s notorious and long-winded rants: fuelled, Simmons has suggested, by West drinking on top of medication for his bipolar disorder, much against doctor’s orders.  It’s a choice that speaks volumes about their longstanding relationship with the rapper, which began more than 20 years ago, when Simmons was making a public access TV show about Chicago’s hip-hop scene and West was a local talent: Simmons suggested he follow West’s attempts to make it, and West agreed; the resulting footage accounts for most of Jeen-Yuhs’s running time. There’s something genuinely touching about Simmons’ actions – “He wasn’t himself,” he said later, “this is my brother right here.” The Kanye West that Jeen-Yuhs depicts via hours of video shot in the early 00s seems noticeably different to the popular image of Kanye West today. He is certainly self-assured, but he’s extremely charming and funny with it. It would take quite an effort on the part of the viewer not to warm to him, and a frankly superhuman effort not to love his late mother Donda. A constant source of support and wise counsel, her beaming pride in her son doesn’t preclude her giving him a talking-to on the difference between confidence and arrogance – a scene it’s hard to watch without thinking that her death in 2007 might have robbed her son of a few more lectures that wouldn’t have gone amiss. The film captures West attempting to transition from his role as a hotly tipped producer to a career as a rapper, initially with little success. You see him move to New York in pursuit of his dream, and recording the songs that would form his debut album The College Dropout, in his apartment and hotel rooms. Despite the fact that Jay-Z’s album The Blueprint – partly produced by West – had just sold 2m copies, West is reduced to wandering the corridors of Jay-Z’s record label Roc-A-Fella, rapping for uninterested secretaries in the hope of attracting attention. Other labels express fleeting interest but ultimately don’t sign him. Other artists are happy to provide a little encomium for Simmons’ camera about West’s talent, but not much else. In one quite heart-rending scene, West manages to get Houston MC Scarface into the studio with a view to him adding a guest verse to one of his tracks: there’s a palpable hint of desperation about West’s pleading, but no guest appearance is forthcoming. Even when Roc-A-Fella comes through with a deal, it seems designed more to stop West producing for other artists than actually making records of his own. The label’s co-founder Damon Dash is visibly uninterested in his efforts. On one level, all of this amounts to a heartwarming tale of persistence, struggle against the odds and justified self-belief. His record label eventually gave way. The College Dropout went on to sell 4m copies, spawn a string of hit singles and be nominated for 10 Grammys. The song the secretaries wouldn’t listen to West performing, All Falls Down, has now been streamed nearly 248m times on one platform alone; the track Scarface declined to contribute to, Jesus Walks, regularly makes lists of the best songs of the 2000s and the greatest hip-hop tracks of all time. However, West’s abilities as a musician are frequently close to being overshadowed by his image as an opprobrium-attracting blowhard, who is a Trump-supporting fan of rightwing crank Candace Owens. So there’s another, more troubling, interpretation of the story Jeen-Yuhs tells. West has charged through the rest of his career, evidently fuelled by an unshakeable conviction that he is always right and that refusing to listen is an untrammelled virtue. You can see how the events depicted in Jeen-Yuhs might have led him to those beliefs.

2/16/2022,"Workers are entitled to ask for a pay rise after a gruelling pandemic and faced with a severe cost-of-living crisis, Keir Starmer has said as official figures showed wages falling in real terms. The Labour leader’s call came in contrast to comments by the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, who warned this month that wage rises would fuel inflation, saying the UK needed to see “restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control”.  Data from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showed real wages fell behind increasing inflation, which is likely to exacerbate the cost-of-living squeeze from rising prices, high energy bills and a national insurance rise this April. In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday, Starmer also said: Labour would oppose the end of free Covid testing – though he stopped short of calling for mandatory isolation to continue in England beyond next week. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, made the right decision to force out Cressida Dick as commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Dozens of Conservative MPs had been in private contact with him expressing dismay at Boris Johnson’s false claim he had failed to prosecute the child abuser Jimmy Savile. In veiled criticism of Bailey’s comments on pay, Starmer said it was reasonable for workers to demand higher wages but said he wanted to put the main onus on the government to tackle the cost of living. “It’s very difficult to universally say to people – you are not entitled to even ask for a pay rise,” he said. Bailey’s remarks, which were prompted by fears that higher wage demands could push companies to increase prices further, sparked widespread criticism including from trade unions and the chair of Tesco, plus a rebuke from Downing Street. Official figures are expected to confirm on Wednesday an inflation rate of close to 5.4% in January – the highest level in three decades. The Bank has said the measure for the annual increase in the cost of living could peak at about 7.25% by April as surging energy prices feed through. Starmer said ministers should cancel the pending rise in national insurance and intervene more directly in the cost of families’ energy bills, repeating calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies who have outperformed projections. “The government is forever saying these are forces beyond its control, that it can’t do anything because this is all global,” he said. “Actually, those tax increases are the government’s own deliberate policy and half their own side don’t think they’re right.” Last week, BP’s chief executive dismissed calls for a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies but also described his company as a “cash machine” given gas prices reached all-time highs and oil prices hit a seven-year record. Starmer said the comments were a “a pretty honest reflection of the situation they think they find themselves in” but said the government had made the choice for the burden to be borne by working families. “To hear the prime minister say that he wants to protect oil and gas companies and their windfall profits at the expense of working families is a very clear answer to the question, you know, whose side are you on?” he said. Labour has been keen to draw a dividing line with the Tories on issues beyond the “partygate” scandal, while Westminster waits for the Met police inquiry to conclude. Labour sources said Starmer would keep his focus on divisive issues such as tax and the cost of living during prime minister’s questions to keep the heat on Tory divisions, as well as put the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the spotlight. Johnson, who has been given seven days since Friday to answer a police questionnaire along with at least 50 other staffers and aides, is expected to deny any wrongdoing and will make the argument that No 10 is both his home and workplace. Starmer said the public’s verdict on Johnson was likely to be the same whatever the Met’s conclusion. “There aren’t many members of the public that don’t think that Boris Johnson was involved in parties,” he said. “Not many members of the public think Boris Johnson has been honest about this. But if you take the public for fools, you’re making a huge mistake because people see through this.” Starmer admitted there was a wider concern that all politicians were tarnished by the recent scandals, saying “dozens” of Tory MPs had been in touch about Johnson’s remark that Starmer had failed to prosecute Savile a decade ago. Starmer did not take the decision as director of public prosecutions but did apologise for institutional failings. The Labour leader said Johnson wanted to “degrade the rules and drag everybody down with it”, adding: “And that degrades politics. And it means that more and more people feel disaffected, it ends up with a situation where too many people feel that politics simply can’t be a force for good.” The investigation into Johnson and Downing Street lockdown parties is expected to continue as the Met begins its search for a replacement for Dick, who resigned after Khan withdrew his backing following a string of police scandals. Starmer said Khan was right to take the action that forced her resignation. “It’s a huge job now in terms of the culture change that’s needed in the Metropolitan police. But this is not just the Metropolitan police. This is across the wider police force across the country. We need that cultural change, leadership change, training changes. So there’s a big job of work to be done now,” he said. Johnson will return to parliament next week to lay out plans for “living with Covid” with measures that are widely expected to lift all mandatory isolation periods after a positive test and end free testing for the virus. Starmer said it was “a mistake to end free Covid tests” – a measure which Sunak is pushing. But he said he would reserve judgment on ending isolation until the proposals are put forward next week.",News/Politics,"Workers entitled to ask for pay rise, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/16/workers-entitled-to-ask-for-pay-rise-says-keir-starmer
2/16/2022,"When a group in black fatigues called Alpha Men Assemble began practising paramilitary manoeuvres in a park in Staffordshire at the beginning of this year, it looked pretty threatening. These men, we were warned, were about to launch an insurrection against vaccines and in favour of “the sovereign citizen”. Since then, silence. It wouldn’t be surprising if the group had dispersed: a society of self-proclaimed alphas is bound to fall apart. This was just one example of the incoherent protests now sweeping rich, English-speaking nations. Others include the truck blockade in Ottawa and its duplicates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, and the angry men outside the British parliament, waiting to pounce on passing politicians. By incoherent protest, I mean gatherings whose aims are simultaneously petty and grandiose. Their immediate objectives are small and often risible, attacking such minor inconveniences as face masks. The underlying aims are open-ended, massive and impossible to fulfil. Not just politically impossible, but mathematically impossible. Listening to these men (and most of them are men), it seems that every one of them wants to be king.  The “sovereign citizen” theory is a powerful current running through these movements. Its adherents insist that they stand above the law. Some of them refuse to buy vehicle licences, or pay taxes or fines. They believe they are exempt from public health measures, such as lockdowns and vaccine passes. In other words, they arrogate to themselves sovereign powers that not even the monarch enjoys. They produce elaborate pseudo-legal documents to justify these claims. The “memorandum of understanding” published by two of the leading organisers of the Ottawa blockade, which makes impossible legal demands of the government, looks like a classic of the genre. It was supposedly signed by 320,000 people before the organisers withdrew it. What explains the appeal of this movement? Such claims of individual sovereignty arose in the 1970s with an antisemitic, racist agitation called Posse Comitatus. They appear to surge in hard times. Some people believe they can annul their debts or tax arrears by renouncing their citizenship. But I suspect it’s about more than money. The promise of capitalism is that one day we will all be alphas – just not yet. It is a formula for frustration and humiliation. The less equal the economic system becomes, the wider the gap between the promise and its fulfilment yawns. Humiliation, as Pankaj Mishra argued in his excellent book Age of Anger, is the motor of extremism. Noisy assertions of sovereignty look like an obvious attempt to overcome humiliation. There was a time, in the rich nations, when it seemed as if we could all triumph. From the second world war until the late 1970s, general prosperity rose steadily. The top 1% captured a decreasing proportion of total income. But then, in the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland and Australia, the curve suddenly turned, and the 1% began to grab an ever greater share. The trend has continued to this day, sustained by the neoliberal doctrines that were first imposed in the rich world by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The ultra-rich have gained most: since the beginning of the pandemic, the world’s 10 richest men have doubled their wealth, while 163 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Wages for many people in the Anglosphere have stagnated, but the costs of living, especially housing, have soared. But even during the “glory years” (1945 to 1975) the universal triumph capitalism promised was an illusion. The general rise of prosperity in rich nations was financed, in part, by poor ones. Decolonisation was resisted by the rich world with extreme violence and oppression, then partly reversed through coups and assassinations (such as the overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran in 1953, the crushing of Jacobo Árbenz’s government in Guatemala in 1954, the murder of Patrice Lumumba in Congo in 1961, Suharto’s coup in Indonesia in 1967 and Augusto Pinochet’s in Chile in 1973). Today, such extreme measures are seldom required, as the transfer of wealth is secured by other means. The rich world’s wealth continues in large part to rely on the exploitation of black and brown people. Incoherent protest movements tend to be infested with racism and white supremacy. Some of the key organisers of the Ottawa action are reported to have a grisly history of racist statements, and some of the protesters have flown swastikas and Confederate flags. When black and brown people assume positions of power and authority, and appear more alpha than those who expected tribute from them, this is perceived as an intolerable reversal. The current wave of incoherent protest began in the US with the reaction against Barack Obama’s government, and soon evolved, with the encouragement of Donald Trump and others, into undisguised white supremacism. Some of the Ottawa organisers also have a history of attacks on trade unions. The “independence” they demand means freedom from the decencies owed to other people, freedom from the obligations of civic life. In pursuing these selfish freedoms, they reinforce the neoliberal policies – such as the crushing of organised labour – that helped cause the impoverishment and insecurity suffered by those they claim to represent. Canadian truckers, for example, especially immigrant workers, now suffer from wage theft, unsafe conditions and other brutal forms of exploitation, caused in part by a loss of collective bargaining power. But the protest organisers seem uninterested. Sovereignty and solidarity are not compatible.

2/16/2022,"An application by mining company Glencore to build a massive toxic tailings dump on the edge of a sacred site has been rejected by the Northern Territory government. The controversial McArthur River mine, which is one of world’s largest zinc and lead mines, is roughly 900km south-east of Darwin and borders the Barramundi Dreaming sacred site, near Borroloola.  On Tuesday, NT heritage minister, Chansey Paech, tabled a decision in parliament to reject an application to build the rock dump – which would stand as the largest built structure in the Northern Territory – to within 35 metres of the site. Josie Davey, a Gudanji woman and traditional owner of the mine site, and her husband, Jack Green, a senior Garawa lawman, welcomed the decision saying the company would now have to negotiate properly with traditional owners. “It was the best thing,” Green said. “It should have happened before, properly, if they were to come and sit down and talk to the traditional owners of the area. All of us are happy now, it took us a long time to come to an agreement like this.” They described the proposal as a “new mountain” and Davey said significant damage had already been done by the company over the past two decades. “I feel sad at what they have done. Because this is my great, great-grandfather’s country. And for our people,” Davey said. Under its expansion plans, Glencore – which took over the mine in 2006 – sought to expand its tailings dump to within 35 metres of the Barramundi Dreaming sacred site, which rises to a height of 80 metres, and is one of 24 sacred sites on the mine lease. The dump would stand at a height of 140 metres, with a 6km square footprint, making it taller than the Sydney Harbour Bridge at 134 metres with an area larger than Uluru, which measures roughly 3.33km square. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The weight of the structure would have likely altered the groundwater table and would need to be monitored for 1,000 years due to the high acid content of the waste rock. The highly combustible rock dissolves easily and the chemical runoff can seep into groundwater and nearby river systems. There is also another valuable archaeological site in the area, an ancient stone quarry that is part of local songlines and where local Aboriginal people mass produced stone tools, axe heads, knives and spear tips. This site is not covered in Tuesday’s decision and Glencore has made a separate application with Paech to demolish it. The company continues to widen the tailings dump while it waits for approval to build higher. In making its application, the company claimed it had consulted with traditional owners but when the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA) reviewed the matter, they determined the agreement was invalid. None of the site’s 180 custodians had been consulted while the six signatories who had did not necessarily understand what they agreed to or were not given copies of the contract. AAPA CEO Dr Benedict Scambary said Tuesday’s decision demonstrated that negotiation with traditional owners was “not a box to be ticked”. “One of the things this decision will do is put other proponents of development in the Northern Territory on notice that murky deals done without representation, that are designed to disempower Aboriginal people in the protection of the sacred sites and cultural heritage, won’t pass muster,” he said. Co-director of the Environment Centre NT, Kirsty Howey, also said the decision was a “watershed” moment in the history of an “extraordinarily damaging mine authorised in extraordinary circumstances”. “We’ve never seen a Labor government minister in the NT back traditional owners on this mine which has been enormously destructive and damaging to traditional owners for years,” Howey said. “Minister Paech should be applauded for having the backbone to stand up to Glencore.” The NT Environment Centre is currently involved in legal action against the territory government over approvals given by Nicole Manison in 2020 for its expansion. A spokesperson for McArthur River mine said in a statement the company is in negotiations with the Northern Land Council, acting on behalf of traditional owners, but “remains committed to further developments at our mine site”. “We remain committed to these negotiations and broad consultation with traditional owners on a variety of matters, including sacred sites and cultural heritage protection, to ensure the benefits of our operations are shared with TOs and the wider community.” The McArthur River mine has been subject to several current and historical litigations, and was a suspected source of lead contamination in drinking water used by the Borroloola’s Aboriginal community until an investigation found there was no indication the contamination was related to the mine. An effort to keep the company from diverting the river in order to allow it to mine the riverbed was successful in court but ultimately overridden by the NT Government to allow work to proceed. The company apologised for its treatment of Aboriginal people and traditional owners in 2021, and specifically for the river diversion.",News/Australia news,NT government rejects Glencore bid to build toxic dump near sacred site,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/nt-government-rejects-glencore-bid-to-build-toxic-dump-near-sacred-site
2/16/2022,"Northern Territory senator Sam McMahon says a Darwin dog has tested positive for Covid, in what would be the first case of the virus in a canine in Australia. McMahon, who is a qualified vet, said the dog tested positive on a rapid antigen test.  Despite concerns about the reliability of RAT results for animals, McMahon said she was satisfied with the accuracy. “The owner was diagnosed with Covid, and the dog started having some symptoms, which were mainly a little bit of lethargy, a cough and just wasn’t quite herself. “The owner told me they’d done a RAT test and it had come back positive, so I made inquiries as to how they’d done the test and was satisfied that had all been done correctly. “This is highly likely to be the first reported case in Australia,” McMahon said. The NT senator said the dog spends much of her time with her owner, and that she was sick for four days, before making a full recovery. McMahon suspected there were unreported cases of Covid in dogs. “It’s unusual and uncommon, but there have been quite a lot of cases reported overseas of pets catching Covid from the owners,” she said. “It is quite possible that there have been other cases where you know, the dog or cat has coughed a couple of times for a couple of days and people haven’t really attributed that to Covid and haven’t tested for it.” But RSPCA Australia senior scientific officer, Dr Sarah Zito, does not advise pet owners use RATs on their animals. “Due to the lack of evidence on the accuracy, reliability or safety of using RAT tests designed for use in people to test animals for Sars-CoV-2, the use of these tests is not advised at this time.” Zito told the Guardian testing for Covid in pets should be undertaken “on the advice of human and animal health authorities” and that confirmatory testing should be performed in the event of a positive result. She said it would be rare for a dog to become seriously ill with the virus, but advised people to avoid their pets if they do test positive. “The current evidence suggests that even if they do get infected with Sars-CoV-2, most dogs infected have no symptoms or just mild disease. “It may be possible for them to become seriously ill, but this seems to be rare if it does occur. “If you are infected with Sars-CoV-2, eliminate or limit contact with animals as well as other people, including your companion animals. “Someone else should care for any animals, including companion animals.” The RSPCA say there is no vaccine for dogs because the disease only mildly affects them. Zito added there was no evidence dogs or other animals could transmit the virus, only that humans can infect their pets. “The current evidence indicates that dogs shed minimal amounts of the virus if they are infected, and they are thought to pose a very low risk of infection to other animals.”",News/Australia news,NT senator says Darwin dog returned positive rapid test in first Australian canine Covid case,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/nt-senator-says-darwin-dog-returned-positive-rapid-test-in-first-australian-canine-covid-case
