2/28/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories this morning. The west’s economic war against Vladimir Putin has gone into full swing today with punitive sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine prompting the rouble to crash 40% and raising the prospect of severe turmoil inside Russia. As its military struggles to gain the upper hand against Ukraine’s fierce defence, the Russian currency was in freefall and the country’s authorities kept financial markets closed to head off the prospect of a run on banks as people queued to withdraw money from cash points. Boris Johnson pledged more weapons for Ukraine after he spoke to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by phone. Amid reports of a huge column of Russian tanks heading for Kyiv this morning, the prime minister was told by Zelenskiy that the next 24 hours was a “crucial period for Ukraine”, according to No 10. The call is yet another illustration of Zelenskiy’s remarkable mobile-phone diplomacy which has seen him rally worldwide support from his Kyiv bunker. You can follow all the latest at our live blog, along with what we know so far here. Johnson’s message comes after Vladimir Putin responded to his increasing pariah status by announcing that he had placed Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert. Concerns about his intentions were compounded this morning by reports from Russian news agencies that Belarus, one of the Kremlin’s staunchest allies, has approved a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status. Such a move could pave the way for nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country, which borders Nato members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The fighting in Ukraine has led more than 360,000 people to flee Ukraine so far and prompted chaotic scenes at railway stations in a bid to escape westwards. A video has captured the agony faced by many families as they leave for safety while sons and fathers stay in cities to support the army or fight. Others are heading back from overseas to fight the invasion. Shaun Walker reports from Ukraine on the week that saw the country enter all-out war. Climate impact The climate crisis is having a much worse impact on the world than predicted, and governments must act more urgently or face disaster, the UK president of the UN climate talks has warned on the eve of a new scientific assessment. Alok Sharma, who led the Cop26 climate summit last year, said the “impacts on our daily lives will be increasingly severe and stark”. The report due today is expected to show that droughts, floods and heatwaves will increase in frequency and intensity, with devastating consequences, and all parts of the globe will be affected. Election battleground – The most important battles in the next general election will be fought in the north of England, according to research, which suggests Labour could win back 31 seats lost when its traditional support switched to the Tories in 2019. However, the thinktank Onward also concluded that some northern seats were still vulnerable to the Conservatives and that there is no evidence of a southern “blue wall” ready to fall. Russia crackdown – Boris Johnson has said that Russian oligarchs will no longer have a hiding place for their “ill-gotten gains” in the UK under legislation being introduced in parliament this week. The law is intended to stop the foreign owners of property in Britain from hiding their identity, and existing rules about unexplained wealth will be toughened up. Girls’ ‘deep distress’ – Thousands of girls as young as 11 are hiding signs of “deep distress” from their parents and teachers, according to an “alarming” study of 15,000 children that reveals a “growing gulf” between the mental health of girls and boys. Record numbers of children are seeking access to NHS mental health services amid the pandemic as detailed in multiple studies over the past year. Trump ‘whack jobs’ – The former US attorney general William Barr has delivered a stinging denunciation of Donald Trump, and says his former boss must not be the Republican candidate for president in 2024. In a new memoir, Barr says Trump has “shown he has neither the temperament nor persuasive powers to provide the kind of positive leadership that is needed”. The former president, Barr says, has surrounded himself with “sycophants” and “whack jobs from outside the government, who fed him a steady diet of comforting but unsupported conspiracy theories”. Meanwhile, Trump has ignored advice from Nigel Farage to stop harping on endlessly about the “stolen election”. Thousands of Ukrainians are flooding out of the capital. As the Russian invasion continues, the residents who remain are taking cover – and taking up arms, Emma Graham-Harrison reports.

Liverpool’s second-choice goalkeeper, Caoimhín Kelleher, repaid the faith shown in him by Jurgen Klopp as he kept his nerve in a penalty shootout as the Reds defeated Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley. Kelleher converted a penalty and then saw his opposite number Kepa Arrizabalaga blaze over the bar to settle the spot-kick drama 11-10 after the teams played out a 0-0 stalemate over 120 minutes. It was a bad day for Chelsea as Roman Abramovich’s stepping aside at the top of the club cast a shadow over the Blues’ future. Fifa’s handling of the Ukraine crisis has been criticised after the world governing body stopped short of kicking Russia out of the World Cup. fallout In the premier League, West Ham revived their top-four chances by beating Wolves 1-0, while Leeds sacked manager Marcelo Bielsa. Ireland pummelled Italy 57-6 in the Six Nations in Dublin but it was an afternoon of little real entertainment after the visitors were reduced to 13 men for most of the game. England have problems and are still a work in progress but remain in contention for the title after beating Wales on Saturday. Australia’s cricketers have arrived in Pakistan for the first tour there in 24 years, and it is a particularly special moment for Enfland’s Ashes tormentor Usman Khawaja, who was born in Islamabad. BP’s decision to sell its 19.75% stake in the Russian oil giant Rosneft will cost the company billions and has already seen its chief executive, Bernard Looney, stand down. BP said it would write down up to $25bn at the end of the first quarter of 2022 following its exit, which it will report to investors in May. The FTSE100 looks like slipping 2% at the opening amid jitters over Ukraine and BP, while the pound is on $1.335 and €1.197. The Guardian leads on “Putin puts nuclear force on high alert as backlash grows”, as does the FT with “Putin puts nuclear forces on alert”. It’s also the splash in the Telegraph, which says “Putin issues nuclear threat”, the Mail says “World outrage as Putin makes nuclear threat”and the Times has “Putin puts nuclear force on alert”. The Scotsman carries a very dramatic picture of a Russian army vehicle in flames and the headline “Putin raises nuclear threat as war rages on city streets”.

2/28/2022,"A major flood event has impacted communities from Maryborough in Queensland to Grafton in New South Wales, with Brisbane’s CBD inundated and a record-breaking flood in Lismore. Here’s a summary of events so far, and what is forecast to come: Eight people have now died in the floods. The bodies of a man in his 50s and his dog were found in a submerged car in the Currumbin valley on the Gold Coast on Monday. A 59-year-old man drowned on Brisbane’s north side on Sunday afternoon after being swept away by flood waters while on foot. It was the third death in Brisbane after men were killed in Indooroopilly on Sunday morning and Stones Corner on Friday night. There have been two deaths in Gympie, one in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, and a State Emergency Service worker who died while trying to rescue a family at Coolana, west of Ipswich. Police are searching for two more missing men, and there are reports of a car being swept away at Yatala. More than 15,000 homes are estimated to have been flooded in Brisbane. The Brisbane River peaked at 3.85 metres on Monday morning, below the 4.46 metres experienced in 2011. However, the two flood events are very different and some suburbs experienced worse flooding this time around. More than 54,000 homes are without power. The rain has largely stopped in Queensland. However, major flood warnings remain for the Mary, Logan, Brisbane and Bremer rivers, and Warrill Creek. Flood-prone Lismore in NSW has had a record-breaking flood. Thousands of residents required evacuating, with many rescued from their roofs after flood waters breached the levee before dawn. The entire CBD remains under water. The town recorded 181mm of rain in 30 minutes at one stage. At 3pm on Monday, the Wilsons River level was 14.37 metres and steady, more than two metres above the record flood level of February 1954 (12.27 metres). There were 15 evacuation orders current for NSW at 4pm Monday. As well as Lismore, evacuation orders were in place in Murwillumbah, Brunswick Heads, Billinudgel, Ocean Shores, Mullumbimby, Coraki and Southgate. The flood levee has been breached in Murwillumbah, and river levels there and in nearby Tumbulgum and Chinderah have already surpassed flood records from 2017 and 1974. Major flooding is occurring at Grafton, Ulmarra and Maclean, similar to the March 2021 event, with the BoM advising further rises are possible. The weather system is continuing to track south in NSW. Further riverine flooding is expected for the Northern Rivers and Mid North Coast on Monday, and will extend further south to the Central Coast, Sydney, Illawarra and South Coast catchments Tuesday into Wednesday. Major flood warnings remain current for the Tweed, Wilsons, Richmond, Clarence, Orara and Bellinger rivers. Rainfall totals have been as high as 1.5 metres in a week. “Some of the rainfall totals that we’ve seen over the course of this event have been approaching rainfall totals that we would normally expect over the course of a year,” said Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Diana Eden. Gympie also recorded its highest flood in a century. The Mary River was receding on Monday, having reached its highest level since 1898. Up to 3,600 homes could be affected. Nearly 1,000 schools are closed in south-east Queensland. A work-from-home order has also been issued. Some schools in northern NSW were also advising they would be operating under minimal supervision on Monday due to the floods. Hundreds of roads are closed, including the M1 at the Tweed River. Trains, buses and ferries have been suspended across much of south-east Queensland and other major highways have been cut by flood waters. However, the Bruce Highway north of Brisbane is set to reopen on Monday. Disaster assistance has been activated for 10 Queensland councils. The funds will go to clean-up efforts in the Fraser Coast, Gold Coast, Gympie, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Noosa, North Burnett, Sunshine Coast and Toowoomba LGAs, and will be jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Late on Saturday, the Insurance Council of Australia declared an insurance catastrophe. It is expected an announcement will be made about northern New South Wales regions in coming days. Water was still being released from Brisbane’s Wivenhoe Dam on Monday. The dam was at 180% of its drinking water capacity on Monday, despite water being released since Sunday morning. It rose rapidly from 59% capacity on Thursday. About 2.2 million megalitres of water, the equivalent of four Sydney harbours, has flowed into the Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams in recent days. In 2011, releases from Wivenhoe contributed to flooding in Brisbane and Ipswich. Flood releases were also occurring from Somerset and North Pine dams, while 20 ungated dams were overflowing on Sunday morning.",News/Australia news,"Floods in Queensland and NSW: what we know about areas affected, and what’s likely to happen next",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/queensland-floods-2022-nsw-flood-weather-forecast-brisbane-lismore-grafton-qld-flooding-what-we-know
2/28/2022,"The government is under pressure to safeguard Britain’s marine conservation areas after analysis showed the Dogger Bank protected site has seen a threefold increase in destructive bottom trawling since Brexit. A year ago, conservationists welcomed government proposals to ban trawling and dredging fishing practices, which involve dragging weighted nets over the seabed, in 14,030 sq km (5,400 sq miles) of English waters, an area equivalent to the size of Northern Ireland. The area includes Dogger Bank and three other marine protected areas (MPAs). The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) analysed fishing data tracked by Global Fishing Watch and found bottom trawling and dredging had increased at the site from about 1,700 hours a year between 2015 and 2018, to 5,500 hours a year between 2020 and the end of 2021. It accused the government of “broken promises and delayed action” over the proposed fishing ban, which is not yet in place a year on. The ban was introduced via a bylaw, which is typically passed within 12 months. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said new bylaws to ban bottom trawling in the four MPAs were “being finalised”, but did not give a timescale. The Dogger Bank MPA, one of the largest sandbanks in Europe, at 12,300 sq km, is a vital breeding ground for commercial species including cod and whiting, as well as sand eels, which are a food source for puffins, porpoises and kittiwakes. It is also an important site for blue carbon, the CO2 sequestered and stored in coastal and marine ecosystems. Nearly a quarter of UK territorial waters are covered by MPAs, set up to protect vital ecosystems and species, including harbour porpoises and dolphins. This network is a symbol of the government’s target to protect 30% of ocean biodiversity by 2030. However, more than 97% of British MPAs are being dredged and bottom trawled, according to data shared with the Guardian. Dr Jean-Luc Solandt, principal specialist in MPAs at the MCS said: “MPAs are currently a lie. There has been an incredible increase in damaging fishing in the Dogger Bank since we left the EU. Are we really ‘taking back control’ of our waters? “The government promised this a year ago. We were very optimistic but nothing has happened. There is no sign of the promised timetable to ensure management for England’s entire list of 40 offshore MPAs.” At current rates, it would take more than a decade to get management in place for all MPAs, Solandt said. Frith Dunkley, MPA researcher at MCS said: “In the year since this bylaw banning bottom-towed fishing gear from Dogger Bank MPA was proposed, the sandbank habitat and the species it was designated to protect have continued to be damaged by fishing activity, degrading marine life and removing ecologically important species such as sand eels.” This week, the MCS is launching a social media campaign with the hashtag MarineUnprotectedAreas, calling for the public to tweet their MPs and MSPs to ban bottom trawling and dredging in offshore MPAs. Ministers also face pressure to safeguard the seabed from within the Tory party. On Tuesday, the former transport secretary, Chris Grayling, will raise a 10-minute motion in parliament for a bill introducing a duty on the secretary of state to ban bottom trawling in MPAs. Charles Clover, executive director of the Blue Marine Foundation, which will back the MCS campaign, said: “If we have learned anything in marine conservation it is this: meaningful protection allows for significant and swift regeneration. In order to protect our fish stocks and low-impact fisheries the UK must wake up and efficiently protect these ‘protected areas’, from the seabed up.” The government has argued that, before Brexit, it did not have control over fishing rights. When George Eustice, the environment secretary, announced proposals to ban bottom trawling in the four MPAs last year, he said: “Now that we have left the common fisheries policy, we are able to deliver on our commitment to achieve a healthy, thriving and sustainable marine environment.” Citing the Fisheries Act’s power to further protect Britain’s seas, Eustice added: “This proposal to introduce bylaws to safeguard four of our precious offshore marine protected areas shows how we are putting these powers into action.” Located about 75 miles east of Hull, the Dogger Bank has been heavily fished for decades. Bottom trawling releases carbon from the seabed into the ocean, reducing its ability to buffer climate breakdown. Dogger Bank has the capacity to store the most carbon out of all English MPAs, according to the MCS. Last September, Greenpeace dropped giant boulders from its ship into the Dogger Bank MPA in order to create an exclusion zone for trawlers. A Defra spokesperson said: “We are focused on ensuring all English MPAs are being effectively managed as quickly as possible – 98 in-shore MPAs now have management measures in place to protect sensitive features from bottom-towed fishing gears. “Following our 2021 consultation, new bylaws protecting offshore MPAs are being finalised for the first four high-risk sites identified.”",News/Environment,Bottom trawling triples in key marine protected area despite Brexit promise,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/bottom-trawling-triples-in-key-marine-protected-area-despite-brexit-promise
2/28/2022,"Whatever else is going right or wrong with a TV show, it helps if we know immediately which series we’re watching. A shimmering brutalist landscape, “Russia”written in giant pastel letters, retro-reverb beehive pop on the soundtrack and a woman in biking leathers breaking into a government building wielding a gun and silencer? This can only be Killing Eve (BBC iPlayer). This is season four. If you didn’t catch seasons one to three, what have you missed? Well, there’s a diffident but determined intelligence agent called Eve (Sandra Oh), and a fearsome yet brittle assassin called Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and they’re obsessed with each other because … actually we’ve never fully established why. Anyway, since Eve began tracking Villanelle, what has happened is … do you know, I’m not properly across that either? A criminal network called the Twelve keeps murdering beloved minor characters, and Eve plans to destroy it, but what the Twelve wants or why we might care has remained murky. Killing Eve is funny, sexy and the source of numerous already brilliant actors’ best work, but it has made no sense for some time. When Phoebe Waller-Bridge originally dramatised the Codename Villanelle novellas by Luke Jennings, she filled the first season with one-liners so mischievous, an aesthetic so enviable and a main antagonist so exciting that television drama has rarely created such an overwhelmingly attractive first impression. Nothing before or since has felt as icily fresh as Villanelle, modelling vicious couture in a series of prime continental locations, dispatching victims with imperious calm. The problem was that Villanelle only worked as a mood, a vibe, a mythical beast. When season one climaxed with Eve – the MI5 desk jockey whose pursuit of the psychopathic Villanelle had awakened the carefree hedonist buried deep within her – stabbing her quarry in an outpouring of vengeance and lust, the only viable ending had been used up, but the show had become so intoxicating, it was bound to unwisely continue. But, not unlike Villanelle breezing out of a penthouse suite leaving bloody chaos behind her, Waller-Bridge sauntered off to work on other projects. Since then, Killing Eve has been a fiery training ground for female writers, with each season asking a new showrunner to attempt the impossible task of keeping the story going. Season four boss Laura Neal has the hardest challenge of all, not just because of Killing Eve’s generally diminishing returns – by this point we’re peering at a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy – but because this is the final season. A hint of where Neal is taking us comes in that first scene of the new run, when the armed biker we assumed was Villanelle removes her helmet to reveal that she is, in fact, Eve. Now free of the frustrating job and boring husband that used to tie her down by giving her something to live for, she is close to embodying the dark fantasy she used to covet from afar. She’s living in a hotel and enjoying a casual thing with a muscly colleague at the private security firm where she now works: he buys her burgers, sharpens her hand-to-hand combat skills, and cheerfully agrees to unfussy sex in a surveillance van, after a conversation about firing a weapon turns her on. Sandra Oh remains fantastic as Eve, whose gradual journey from nerdy safety to delicious self-destruction has been the only thing about the post-Waller-Bridge years that has ever really worked. Comer, on the other hand, is struggling as Villanelle, lost in the nonsensical idea of this stone-cold monster trying to find redemption. Season four reinvents her as working in a church, lodging in the vestry and undergoing baptism as part of her latest scheme to convince Eve, for reasons unclear, that she’s no longer evil. Mild carnage ensues, but her co-opting of Christianity is, compared to Villanelle at her awesome best, cheap and easy iconoclasm. The dull British setting prevents Comer from wearing any fabulous outfits, which, in a show that once unashamedly prized being beautiful on the surface, is another pleasure lost. The end of episode one hints at a solution to these issues that would certainly be ambitious, but looks more likely to come off as desperate. Before that, one of the series’ recurring motifs pops up yet again, when Eve and Villanelle share a confrontation that is not allowed to resolve anything: this time they are on either side of a fish tank, with Comer all in white. While the children of the 90s who make up the bulk of the audience might chuckle at the homage to Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, that sort of direct reference feels like something that the show in its pomp wouldn’t have resorted to. It’s still recognisably Killing Eve and it’s still kinda cool, but it’s out of new ideas.",Arts/Television & radio,Killing Eve review – Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer struggle to keep the final series afloat,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/killing-eve-review-sandra-oh-and-jodie-comer-struggle-to-keep-the-final-series-afloat
2/28/2022,"Less than a week into the war, it seems increasingly likely that Vladimir Putin is heading towards a historic defeat. He may win all the battles but lose the war. Putin’s dream of rebuilding the Russian empire has always rested on the idea that Ukraine isn’t a real nation, that Ukrainians aren’t a real people, and that the inhabitants of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv yearn for Moscow’s rule. The Russian despot has told this lie so many times that he apparently believes it himself. When planning the invasion of Ukraine, Putin could count on many known facts. He knew that militarily Russia dwarfs Ukraine. He knew that Nato would not send troops to help Ukraine. He knew that European dependence on Russian oil and gas would make countries like Germany hesitate about imposing stiff sanctions. Based on these known facts, his plan was to hit Ukraine hard and fast, decapitate its government, establish a puppet regime in Kyiv, and ride out the impotent rage of western sanctions. But there was one big unknown about this plan. As the Americans learned in Iraq and the Soviets learned in Afghanistan, it is much easier to conquer a country than to hold it. Putin knew he had the power to conquer Ukraine. But would the Ukrainian people just accept Moscow’s puppet regime? Putin gambled that they would. After all, as he repeatedly explained to anyone willing to listen, Ukraine isn’t a real nation, and the Ukrainians aren’t a real people. In 2014, people in Crimea hardly resisted the Russian invaders. Why should 2022 be any different? With each passing day, it is becoming clearer that Putin’s gamble is failing. The Ukrainian people are resisting with all their heart, winning the admiration of the entire world – and winning the war. Many dark days lie ahead. The Russians may still conquer the whole of Ukraine. But to win the war, the Russians would have to hold Ukraine, and they can do that only if the Ukrainian people let them. This seems increasingly unlikely to happen. Each Russian tank destroyed and each Russian soldier killed increases the Ukrainians’ courage to resist. And each Ukrainian killed deepens the Ukrainians’ hatred. Hatred is the ugliest of emotions. But for oppressed nations, hatred is a hidden treasure. Buried deep in the heart, it can sustain resistance for generations. To re-establish the Russian empire, Putin needs a relatively bloodless victory that will lead to a relatively hateless peace. By spilling more and more Ukrainian blood, Putin is making sure his dream will never be realised. It won’t be Mikhail Gorbachev’s name written on the death certificate of the Russian empire: it will be Putin’s. Gorbachev left Russians and Ukrainians feeling like siblings; Putin has turned them into enemies, and has ensured that the Ukrainian nation will henceforth define itself in opposition to Russia. Nations are ultimately built on stories. Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will tell not only in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come. The president who refused to flee the capital, telling the US that he needs ammunition, not a ride; the soldiers from Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”; the civilians who tried to stop Russian tanks by sitting in their path. This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks. The Russian despot should know this as well as anyone. As a child, he grew up on a diet of stories about Russian bravery in the siege of Leningrad. He is now creating more such stories, but casting himself in the role of Hitler. The stories of Ukrainian bravery give resolve not only to Ukrainians, but to the whole world. They give courage to the governments of European nations, to the US administration, and even to the oppressed citizens of Russia. If Ukrainians dare to stop a tank with their bare hands, the German government can dare to supply them with some anti-tank missiles, the US government can dare to cut Russia off Swift, and Russian citizens can dare to demonstrate their opposition to this senseless war. Unfortunately, this war is likely to be long-lasting. But the most important issue has already been decided. The last few days have proved to the entire world that Ukraine is a real nation, that Ukrainians are a real people, and that they definitely don’t want to live under a new Russian empire. The main question left open is how long it will take for this message to penetrate the Kremlin’s thick walls.

2/28/2022,"The sagest advice given to Donald Trump all week came from a man who is neither a Republican nor an American. Nigel Farage, the British politician, broadcaster and demagogue whose Brexit campaign coincided with Trump’s rise to power, warned his old pal against endlessly fixating on the 2020 election. “This message of a stolen election, if you think about it, is actually a negative backward looking message,” Farage told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida. “There is a better, more positive message the Republican party needs to embrace and it’s this: ‘We are going state by state, vote by vote to make sure that America has the best, the cleanest, the fairest election system anywhere in the western world.’” Urging an end to the “big lie” obsession is heresy at places like CPAC, the Woodstock of the red meat right. Perhaps no pro-Trump Republican would dare breathe it to the former president, lest he slap them with a demeaning nickname, endorse a primary opponent or blackball them from his luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. But Farage, as foreigner and fellow traveller, may have felt liberated to speak an inconvenient truth: that endlessly re-litigating the last election with false claims of voter fraud could prove a serious liability for Republicans in November’s midterms. The former UK Independence party and Brexit party leader went on: “That negative anger must be turned into a positive. You’ve got to offer the voters of this country a shining city on the hill. You’ve got to give them a vision. People want dreams, people want hopes, and the deliverers of that message are you guys.” The audience sounded receptive enough. And while some CPAC speakers did promulgate “the big lie” – Ohio Senate hopeful Josh Mandel declared, “I want to say it very clearly and very directly: I believe this election was stolen from Donald J Trump” – they generally gave greater emphasis to winning Congress in 2022 and, of course, Trump returning to the White House in 2024. Jim Jordan, an Ohio congressman and close Trump ally, declared: “I believe President Trump is going to run again … I think if he runs, he’s going to win.” But the annual CPAC straw poll testing who should get the Republican nomination raised more questions than answers. Of course Trump won with more votes than everyone else combined. But his 59% was not quite the overwhelming show of force he might have hoped for in what is usually the capital of Trumpistan. There is now a clear alternative. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, finished second on 28%, well clear of Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, on 2%. In a separate poll where Trump was removed from the equation, DeSantis won by a landslide 61%. On the other hand, Florida is DeSantis’s home state, so he might expect to punch above his weight here. The governor gave a well received speech on Thursday that notably failed to mention Trump. But the audience for Trump’s address on Saturday was appreciably bigger and brimming with “Trump 2024” badges and caps. Even those sporting DeSantis regalia were not quite ready to back him. David Duffy, 57, a retired insurance worker sporting a giant “DeSantisLand” flag, said: “We want to keep President Trump as our president. We believe he still is our president and, with DeSantis being 42 years old, we want to give him a little bit more time.” Asked for her 2024 preference, Marnie Allen, wearing a “DeSantisLand” cap, said: “Trump, only because I owe him. I think we all owe him to make up for the disasters and because he’s going to go in with a vengeance this time and take care of our fourth level of government: career bureaucrats. He will go in this time and he will take a machete to them.” The 51-year-old from Orlando, who works in higher education, felt compelled to add: “Not a real machete, of course, but a figurative machete.” Unless something dramatic happens – a criminal indictment in New York, say – the nomination remains Trump’s to lose. On Saturday he dropped his strongest hint yet that he does intend to pursue it. He clearly did not get Farage’s memo. Trump told the audience: “The Rinos [Republicans In Name Only] and certain weak Republican politicians want to ignore election integrity also but we cannot ignore it. We have to fix it. Make no mistake, they [Democrats] will try to do it again in ’22 and ’24, and we cannot let them do that. “And the way we [let them do that] is to come to a very powerful conclusion as to what happened in 2020. We stand down to stop talking about it, we stop making Americans aware of the cheating and corruption that went on. That’s really saying, ‘It’s OK, you can do it again.’ We can’t let that happen.” The slapping sound you heard was a hundred Republican midterm candidates planting their hands on their foreheads.

2/28/2022,"The constellation of Gemini, the twins, is well placed at this time of year from the northern hemisphere. It sits to the south-west of Orion, the hunter, in-between Cancer, the crab, and Auriga, the charioteer. The chart shows the view looking south from London at 2100 GMT on Monday night. Gemini is named after the twins Castor and Pollux. In Greek mythology, they were born as twins even though both had a different father. Castor was the mortal son of the king of Sparta, while Pollux was the divine offspring of Zeus. The two brightest stars in the constellation are named after them. Castor is a blue-white star, 53 light years from Earth. Although it appears singular to the naked eye, telescopes have revealed that it is a collection of six stars in orbit around each other. Pollux is an individual star that shines with a faintly orange hue. It is 34 light years from Earth. Together they mark out the heads of the twins. The constellation itself is one of the 48 star patterns noted by Ptolemy in the second century AD, and is also visible from the southern hemisphere.

2/28/2022,"The impacts of the climate crisis are proving much worse than predicted, and governments must act more urgently to adapt to them or face global disaster, the UK president of the UN climate talks has warned on the eve of a landmark new scientific assessment of the climate. Alok Sharma, who led the Cop26 climate summit last year, said: “The changes in the climate we are seeing today are affecting us much sooner and are greater than we originally thought. The impacts on our daily lives will be increasingly severe and stark. We will be doing ourselves and our populations a huge disservice if we fail to prepare now, based on the very clear science before us.” In a report to be published on Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is expected to show that droughts, floods and heatwaves will increase in frequency and intensity, with devastating consequences, and all parts of the globe will be affected. Sharma also said climate talks must continue this year at international forums such as the G20, despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is a member of the G20, after being ejected from the G8 over its annexation of Crimea. Sharma said he spoke to his Russian counterpart some weeks ago before the current escalation, but they have not spoken since. More than seven years in the making, and drawing on the work of thousands of scientists, the latest report from the IPCC – the UN-convened body of the world’s leading climate scientists – is expected to show climate breakdown is pushing the world close to the brink of catastrophic change, and urgent work is needed to protect against drastic impacts that are now inevitable and in some cases already happening. Speaking before the publication, Sharma told the Guardian: “Based on the science [of recent years], there is an expectation that the report will tell us that over the past decade, climate change impacts have been much greater than anticipated. Policymakers need to see this as another wake-up call to take action now.” He added: “Countries need to take action now. If we don’t take action now, the costs will be much higher, and the impacts higher, in future years.” Sharma pointed out that at Cop26 governments of rich countries agreed to double their aid to the poor world for adaptation to climate change by 2025. “We made more progress than previous Cops,” he said. Rich countries must also protect themselves, he added. “The UK is spending £5bn on the impacts of flooding, and preparing our national adaptation plan.” Some of the IPCC’s findings are likely to be politically controversial. One of the biggest bones of contention at Glasgow was over “loss and damage”, referring to the worst impacts of the crisis, which cannot be adapted to – such as villages being swept away by hurricanes, or land lost to rising seas. Poor countries want the rich world to recognise the loss and damage they suffer, and provide funding accordingly. But rich countries, already falling behind on a longstanding pledge to provide $100bn (£75bn) a year to help poor nations cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts, have been slow to agree to any additional finance. Some developing countries and civil society groups are calling for action this year, ahead of Cop27. Sharma dampened those hopes, pointing to an agreement at Cop26 to set up a four-year programme examining loss and damage called the “Glasgow dialogue”. He said: “Countries have been asked to make formal submissions on all this … We have to see how those discussions go, where that dialogue takes us.” Monday’s IPCC publication is the second of four parts of the “sixth assessment report”, the latest in a series of comprehensive summaries of the world’s knowledge of the climate, stretching back to 1988. The first part, published last August, showed that climate change was unequivocally the result of human actions and was causing “unprecedented” and in some cases “irreversible” changes. A third part, to be published in April, will set out the means of dealing with the crisis, such as investing in renewable energy and novel technologies such as carbon capture, and this October a summary of all three parts will draw together the lessons for policymakers before the Cop27 summit. As IPCC reports take between five and seven years to compile, the current assessment is likely to be the last while there is still time to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Emissions must halve by 2030, to stay within 1.5C, the IPCC has previously warned, but after the plunge caused by the lockdowns global carbon dioxide emissions have bounced back and are set to rise strongly again this year.",News/Environment,"Impact of climate crisis much worse than predicted, says Alok Sharma",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/impact-of-climate-crisis-much-worse-than-predicted-says-alok-sharma
2/28/2022,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is made up of the world’s leading climate scientists, charged with publishing regular comprehensive updates of global knowledge on the climate crisis, intended to inform government policymaking. Each “assessment report” takes about five to seven years to complete, involving hundreds of scientists reviewing the work of thousands more experts. The current report – being published in four parts, from August 2021 to October 2022 – is the sixth since the body was set up in 1988. The three working groups that make up the IPCC each publish their own reports. The first looks at the physical basis of climate science – that is, how the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere are changing and are likely to change in future, and whether human influence is responsible. The second – the group producing the latest report – assesses the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather, droughts, floods and temperature rises, and how humanity can adapt to these. The third group looks at ways of cutting emissions, and the fourth report is a synthesis, to be published in October, ahead of the Cop27 UN climate summit, to be held in Egypt in November. The warnings are likely to make for grim reading. The first part of the sixth assessment report, last August, concluded that major “unprecedented” changes were being seen, many were likely to be “irreversible”, and they were “unequivocally” the result of human actions. This second part is likely to go into more detail on how these changes to the climate will play out in people’s lives, including the melting of glaciers, the reductions in crop yields, the impact on health. Emphasis will also be placed on the need to adapt to the inevitable changes, for instance by protecting key infrastructure, building seawalls and river barriers against flooding, early warning systems for storms and “nature-based solutions” such as growing trees on hillsides to stop landslips. The world has so far failed to make much effort to adapt, and questions of social justice will also come to the fore: the poorest countries have contributed the least to the climate crisis but face the greatest damage. IPCC reports run to thousands of pages, incorporating data from years of research. But the key document that emerges at the end of the process is a distillation of all this knowledge known as the summary for policymakers, which contains the key messages. It is pored over line by line by the lead scientific authors but also by representatives from governments, a process open to all states who want to contribute. Critics say this process waters down key messages; defenders say the scientists take a robust line and few significant changes are made. This second part of the report is likely to be the most politically sensitive, because it deals with the probable real world impact of the climate crisis, including issues such as the potential for food shortages. One of the most contentious issues is over how the world adapts to the climate crisis and the question of “loss and damage” – the impacts of the climate crisis that are too great for countries to adapt to. This issue has dogged the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate negotiations for more than a decade, and at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year many countries were disappointed that rich nations failed to agree a programme to issue funding to poor countries for the loss and damage they sustain. Concerns have already been raised by some campaigners that “loss and damage” has been changed to “losses and damages”, but analysts say this change is minor and does not change the substance of the findings. The substantive issue will be what the report says about adaptation and the global need to adapt to extreme weather that, as the first IPCC working group found in August, is becoming inevitable.",News/Environment,What is the IPCC climate change report – and what will it say?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/what-is-the-ipcc-climate-change-report-and-what-will-it-say
2/28/2022,"It’s easy to miss the storefront that is home to the “world’s first NFT vending machine” in Manhattan’s Financial District. Squished between a sandwich shop and a tailor, the windows are bathed in pink neon light, with glowing letters that announce “NFT ATM.” When you walk through the entryway, you enter a tiny booth with the vending machine, filled with rows of little paper cartons, looking almost like cigarette packs. There are only two products: a “color” for $5.99 and a “party pigeon” for $420.69. I was here to spend some of the Guardian’s money on an NFT, or non-fungible token. NFTs are based on a blockchain feature called the “smart contract,” which is kind of like a virtual vending machine. Send some of your crypto to a smart contract, and it’ll print a unique token – basically a digital receipt – that says you now own this cat pic. Anyone else can still right-click-save and share Mr. Whiskers, but you’ll know, and anyone else looking at the blockchain will know, that the image is yours. Or so the logic goes. The main problem facing users is that blockchain is too complicated, according to Jordan Birnholtz, the Chicago-based co-founder of Neon, the startup behind the vending machines. When he called me, the 30-year-old introduced himself by telling me he was using a skillet to heat up green tea, because he doesn’t have a pot or a kettle. (“I think my ex took them when we broke up,” he explained.) And kind of like how you can boil water in a frying pan, Birnholtz is determined to prove you can buy NFTs without crypto. Birnholtz, who used to work in progressive politics (a “totally different” side of his life), said Neon’s target customer doesn’t want to get into “19th and early 20th century lessons about economics,” they just want to support artists they like, and in return get a little token of “conspicuous consumption” they can show off, like a digital version of a band t-shirt. Neon’s stated goal is to make buying an NFT “as simple as buying a toothbrush,” – which means using an old-fashioned credit card, and instead of fiddling with smart contracts: a literal, physical vending machine. I didn’t think my editor would be thrilled with the pigeon, so I bought a color. This, it turns out, meant a piece of paper inside the carton with a randomly generated code, that would allow me to “mint” an NFT claiming ownership over one of 10,000 different colors. Birnholtz tried to clarify: “It’s impossible to own a color. What you own is a ledger on the Solana blockchain that represents that particular color. And we allow people to collect those colors to trade them, and sell them.” I still don’t fully know what that means, but I wasn’t about to let those silly anxieties get in the way. As if buying a bag of Cheetos, I punched in my selection and tapped my credit card. The machine beeped, the metal coil began to turn – and then, nothing. My NFT was stuck. I banged on the glass, but it refused to drop. I noticed two security cameras watching me, and felt self-conscious. Was I the first person in the world to lose money while physically buying an NFT? Without other options, I bought another one to push the first one off. Now I had the first one, but the second one wouldn’t drop. I didn’t want to keep buying them, so I left the second one there. I knew in my heart that I owned it, but I had no real way to prove it. I told Neon’s co-founder what happened. “That sucks, I am so sorry,” he said. “Vending machines remain, um, not perfect.” He offered to send me a refund if I sent him an email with the approximate time I had made the purchase and the last four digits of my credit card number. I began wondering if crypto would’ve been easier. There was another snag when I redeemed my prize. I scanned my QR code, which directed me to a website and told me to create an account on the Neon marketplace. Then I had to enter a 12-digit sequence on my little slip of paper to mint my NFT. But instead of getting a color, based on a random six-digit “hex code” used by web designers, I got a five digit string that resulted in a blank square. “That’s embarrassing, it sounds like you might have got a misprint,” said Birnholtz. But maybe, I suggested, the flaw could make my NFT more desirable? “Yeah, perhaps future generations will look upon your error in the same way they looked to numismatic errors with joy,” he offered. Other than list it for sale – and I wasn’t convinced anyone would buy it – it didn’t seem like there was much else I could do with the NFT. “That is correct. You are buying it to show it off,” the co-founder told me, adding, “We make no promise of future value. I would never sell something to someone as, oh, this is a great investment. That’s bullshit. I think you should buy something if you like it and you connect with it.” On the topic of investment: Birnholtz’s company has received $3 m in seed funding. The co-founder said he plans to open more vending machines in half a dozen cities over the summer, likely including Las Vegas, Chicago, LA, and Miami. The idea is that the machines will attract enough attention to turn Neon into a bustling platform. “Like, people having fun, collecting things, showing off their taste, flexing, and connecting with other people online. That’s awesome. It makes me happy. I get up every morning excited to talk to artists who want to sell on Neon.” I wasn’t sure who I could flex to, though. As I lingered outside of the ATM for about half an hour after my purchase, on a busy street during lunch hour in FiDi, hundreds of people walked by, but only one other person stopped to look at the booth. “Oh my god,” he said, snapping a picture on his cell phone. I approached and asked him if he owned NFTs. “A few,” he replied, but was already walking down the street.",News/Technology,What did I just buy?

2/28/2022,"The Russian rouble has crashed more than 40% after trading began on Monday in the wake of unprecedented international sanctions against the country’s financial system over Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The news came as Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the British prime minister that the next 24 hours would be “crucial” for his country and amid reports that a column of Russian tanks was heading for the capital. With restrictions in force limiting how much the Russian central bank can do to prop up the currency, the rouble plunged 41.5% to a record low when the markets opened, sinking to as low as 119 per dollar from 83.7 at its close on Friday. It recovered a little ground later on Monday to stand at 107 to the dollar, a fall of 28%. Analysts at Rabobank in Singapore said that Monday could see a “complete collapse in the rouble” after the asset freeze on the Central Bank of Russia means it cannot sell foreign currency reserves to support the rouble. The economic turmoil unfolded amid fresh signs of nuclear brinkmanship by Vladimir Putin and his allies. Early on Monday, Belarus claimed that a referendum on Sunday had seen enough public support for constitutional changes that would revoke the country’s neutrality and its nuclear-free status. The changes would allow Russia to station nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil. Putin earlier ordered his military to put its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, a move criticised by the US as a “totally unacceptable” escalation, and as “dangerous rhetoric” by Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Zelenskiy told British prime minister Boris Johnson on Sunday evening that the next 24 hours would a “crucial period” for his country. Johnson “said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine”, a No 10 spokesperson said. Other developments include: Belarus is reportedly preparing to send soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion. The Washington Post spoke to an unnamed US administration official on Sunday evening who said the deployment could begin as soon as Monday. “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin,” they said. Kyiv Independent reported the move was likely after Putin failed to secure a swift victory. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the claim. Blasts were heard in the capital Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv early on Monday morning, Ukraine’s state service of special communications reported. Ukraine’s interior ministry said 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. It says an additional 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded. Ukraine has agreed to send a delegation to meet Russian representatives on the border with Belarus, which would be the two sides’ first public contact since war erupted. Zelenskiy said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but that he would try. “I’ll say frankly, like always, that I don’t believe in the result of this meeting,” he said. “But let’s try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was even a chance.” A rare emergency special session of the UN general assembly is due to be held on Monday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the first time in 40 years the security council has made such a request. The new sanctions against Russia, which also mean that some banks are now barred from the Swift international payments system, were likely to deal a devastating blow to the Russian economy and make it hard for Russian banks and companies to access the international financial system. Signs of the first commercial casualties came on Monday when the European Central Bank (ECB) said that Sberbank Europe, a fully owned subsidiary of Sberbank Russia, which in turn is majority owned by the Russian state, is failing or likely to fail along with its Croatian and Slovenian units. “Sberbank Europe AG and its subsidiaries experienced significant deposit outflows as a result of the reputational impact of geopolitical tensions,” the ECB said in a statement. There were “no available measures with a realistic chance” of solving its liquidity crisis, the bank said. The fall of the rouble marked the beginning of what promised to be a turbulent day on financial markets all over the world. The US dollar gained against all other currencies, Brent crude oil futures soared another 4% to more than $102 a barrel. Stock markets in Asia fell on fears of a prolonged and intensifying conflict in Ukraine, while the German Dax is set to plunge 3.75% at the open and the FTSE100 more than 2%. Russians waited in long queues at ATMs on Sunday, worried that the measures by western countries to punish Putin’s invasion would trigger cash shortages and disrupt payments, bringing home the gravity of the crisis for many ordinary Russians. “The situation is dire for the Russian economy,” said Christopher Vecchio, senior strategist with IG Group’s DailyFX.com in New York. “Now unable to import or export goods and services thanks to the Swift sanctions, unable to sell foreign currency reserves thanks to the [central bank] asset freeze, and a Russian economy ringfenced from the global financial system, a currency crisis has emerged for Russia. High inflation is coming, as is an immediate lurch into recession.” “It will be something we have not seen before,” said Sergei Guriev, economics professor at France’s Sciences Po and former European Bank for Reconstruction and Development chief economist. “Sanctioning the central bank is unprecedented,” said Maria Shagina of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and the Geneva International Sanctions Network. “I think for one of the largest economies in the world – the size matters here. Previously it was only Iran, Venezuela, Syria that were under a maximum-pressure campaign.” On Sunday evening, Russian state TV hosts were exhorting their listeners to hold the line despite the tough economic times ahead, describing a period of economic isolation and autarky that recalls some of the world’s most troubled pariah states. “I know some of you are finding this tough,” said Vladimir Solovyov, a Russian TV host who was sanctioned last week. “We’ll overcome it all, we’ll endure it all. We’ll rebuild our own economy from scratch, an independent banking system, manufacturing and industry. We’ll rely on ourselves.” Russia’s central bank announced a range of measures on Sunday to try to support domestic markets and limit the damage dealt by sanctions. The central bank said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market and provide unlimited liquidity for domestic markets in order to keep the financial system afloat. It also said it would ease requirements for collateral to get loans, and order institutions to block attempts by foreign clients to sell Russian bonds and stocks in order to try to keep prices stable. The steps came after western allies ratcheted up sanctions on Saturday, including blocking certain banks from the Swift international payments system and targeting the Russian central bank, committing to imposing restrictive measures that would keep it from deploying its international reserves to undermine sanctions. The Russian central bank said it would continue to monitor changes in currency positions “in order to guarantee the normal functioning of the currency and money markets and the financial stability of lending institutions”.",News/World news,Ukraine war: sanctions-hit Russian rouble crashes as Zelenskiy speaks of ‘crucial’ 24 hours ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ukraine-war-sanctions-hit-russian-rouble-crashes-as-zelenskiy-speaks-of-crucial-24-hours
2/28/2022,"An eruption of quacks from a female mallard draws my gaze up the River Lagan. Two pairs. Further on, two single males. Familiarity can breed a dismissal of “Oh, it’s just a …” but the mallard drake is a splendid creature. My stare lands on a bottle-green head, its sunlit iridescence melding with the water’s reflected sheen to shimmer through his feathers. The primary-yellow bill. The thin white collar over his chocolate-coloured breast. The finely vermiculated porcelain-grey and taupe that sweep down to the rump, with its upturned kiss-curls and white wedge of tail. His mate’s plumage is an embroidery of browns, but she shares with him a bright blue flash on the wing’s secondary flight feathers, called the speculum. The reeds stir. Three more drakes emerge on to the open water. A loitering female swims quickly to catch up with her mate. Her caution is wise. This tranquil scene masks a dark contest. The sex ratio of mallard populations is skewed towards males, and surplus males gang up to bully females into what biologists coyly term “forced copulation”. It’s something that I still find disturbing. Female mallards usually resist, but can even end up drowning. Sticking close to one’s mate offers some protection until the ducklings hatch; whereupon their father decamps, perhaps to join a gang of marauding bachelors. Drakes succeed in mating with unwilling females partly because, as an evolutionarily ancient group, duck species have retained the avian penis, which is highly unusual among birds (for most species, sperm transfer relies on a cooperative genital “kiss”). But that’s not the whole story. Nature has contrived to provide female mallards with inbuilt contraception. The vagina has a spiral that counters unwelcome penetration by a male’s corkscrew-shaped penis (a spiral that apparently relaxes when a female solicits copulation). It also has dead-end “pouches” to receive unwanted sperm. An undesired male may win the battle, but he usually loses the war. So, while some mallard matings may be forced, only a tiny proportion of such matings successfully father ducklings. The female’s discerning choice prevails. And it’s that choice – what gladdens her eye and, over the generations, likewise gladdened her foremothers’ – which has evolved to this extravagant male beauty.
