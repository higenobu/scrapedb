2/7/2022,"We asked readers what they wanted to know about the energy cap price rise. Hilary Osborne, our money and consumer editor, has the answers. I’m on a fixed deal, will any part of my bill/charges increase? Susan, OxfordNo, not while the deal lasts. The cap relates to the energy providers’ standard variable tariffs – these are the tariffs that customers are on as a default and have traditionally been more expensive than the fixed-rate deals on offer. The reason the energy cap was introduced was to stop these customers paying high prices because of their loyalty.  If you are on a fixed deal, you will carry on paying the same rate until the end of the term – unless your provider fails and you get switched to a new company. Households are in a strange place at the moment because moving to a new fixed deal would mean paying higher prices. It is likely that if your deal ends soon you will be better off moving on to your provider’s standard tariff than going on to a new fixed rate. Does the price cap refer to the combined cost of gas and electricity as in a dual fuel cost? How is it applied if a different supplier is used for gas and electricity? Also, if the fixed dual deal has just ended is it better to renew or revert to price capped variable contract? R Price, retired, HampshireThe annual prices that are being widely quoted are for what a dual fuel customer with average energy use might expect to pay – they are not the caps themselves. So no household is currently guaranteed that their bills won’t go above £1,277. What is capped by the regulator, Ofgem, is the unit price that can be charged for gas and electricity (see above), and these apply to any supplier you use. If you do use an average amount of gas and an average amount of electricity, you can expect to pay around that figure. According to Ofgem, average use is 12,000 kWh of gas a year and 3,100 kWh of electricity. British Gas publishes averages on its website that are based on different-sized households and properties – these suggest that one or two people living in a flat will use 8,000 kWh of gas and 1,800 kWh of electricity while four or five people in a five-bedroom house will typically use 17,000 kWh of gas and 4,300 kWh of electricity. Currently you are very likely to be better off reverting to the price-capped deal. Lots of energy providers are quoting very high prices on their fixed rate deals – above even the new price cap. What’s the planned capped pence per kWh for electricity and for gas? And the current capped price? Using arbitrary increases of £600-700 annually makes it hard to compare the cap v fixed plans. Padraic, 31, works for the NHS, West YorkshireThe price cap varies around the country and according to how you pay for your energy. Customers who pay by direct debit pay the least, followed by those who are on prepayment meters, then customers who settle their bills with cash or a cheque. The caps are based on the cost of supplying the energy, along with other factors. The cap for electricity paid for by direct debit averages out at 28p a kWh across Britain, including VAT. On top of that are standing charges (a fixed daily charge just for being a customer), capped at 45p a day. For cash and cheque customers the cap is 30p, while standing charges are 51p and for prepayment the unit charge cap is 28p, while standing charges are 50p. Direct debit customers in London pay the lowest standing charge, at 31p while customers in northern England and Yorkshire have the lowest usage cost at 26p a kWh. The caps for gas follow a similar pattern. The average across Britain for direct debit customers is 29p, plus a standing charge of 27p, while cash and cheque customers pay 30p a kWh and 32p a day, and prepayment customers 28p and 37p respectively. I want to know how prepay customers will get their £200 loan in October. You always forget us. We don’t get a bill. Will it be a cheque? A voucher? AnonymousThe Treasury says prepayment customers who have remotely accessible smart meters will receive the money automatically. Those who have older prepayment meters will get a voucher issued by email or post, a cheque by post or a special action message to a retailer where they top up which will credit they key. Customers who pay by cash or cheque will have their accounts with their energy provider credited in the same way as direct debit customers. Will there be any way not to take part in the government’s proposed council tax rebates and the £200 cut in energy bills to be repaid in the future, and just pay now? Ana, LondonThe Treasury says this will not be an option – it says having an opt-out will complicate the process and delay money getting into people’s accounts. If you pay by direct debit this may not be an issue – you could make sure that don’t reclaim or run down any credit in your account so when bills go up to cover the £40 you will have the money. It is not yet clear exactly how the energy rebate and repayment scheme will work but – probably because there are all kinds of potential problems around linking the clawback of the money to individuals or properties – the government has said it is expected to be through an increase in standing charges. That option, which would add about 11p a day to standing charges, would mean for five years all brand-new energy customers would be paying for this year’s rebate. If you are in the position where you can afford the £200 toward your bill now but are worried that you might struggle to pay £40 more over the next five years you could tuck away some cash now in a savings account to draw on at a later date. You won’t get much interest but as there is no interest on the loan that should not be too much of a concern. Why isn’t oil included, when so many rural-dwelling people already have greater expenses than townies. Julie Switsur, 80, retired, KirkwallHeating oil costs are not regulated by Ofgem, so aren’t included in the price cap – which could be why as you point out, more than 1m homes using heating oil have been left out of some of the plans to help with rising bills. Another reason is likely to be because the mechanism for helping households that the Treasury has come up with uses domestic and gas electricity providers to pay and recover the assistance. Arranging a £200 loan to customers will be harder than doing so for people with accounts with an energy firm, because the debt cannot be recovered through standing charges. These households will be eligible for the £150 council tax discount – assuming they meet the criteria of living in a band A-D home in England.",News/Business,Energy price cap: your questions about the rise answered,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/your-questions-about-changes-to-the-energy-price-cap-answered
2/7/2022,"Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestling star known as The Rock, has retracted what had seemed his unconditional support for Joe Rogan, amid continued fallout from the controversial podcaster’s use of racist language.  Rogan apologised after the singer-songwriter India Arie posted to social media a video montage of him saying the N-word about 20 times on his podcast. The video includes Rogan making a joke about the movie Planet of the Apes and Black neighbourhoods. Johnson had publicly praised Rogan’s response to a growing Spotify boycott triggered by the dissemination of Covid misinformation. But in response to a tweet from the author Don Winslow, reprimanding him for defending Rogan, Johnson, who has almost 16 million followers, wrote: “I hear you, as well as everyone here 100%[.] I was not aware of his N-word use prior to my comments, but now I’ve become educated to his complete narrative. Learning moment for me.” Rogan said he was wrong to use the N-word but insisted he was not racist. “I can’t go back in time and change what I said. I wish I could. Obviously that’s not possible, but I do hope this could be a teachable moment for anybody that doesn’t realise how offensive that word could be coming out of a white person’s mouth, in context or out of context,” Rogan said in a video statement. That mea culpa did not stop the former presidential candidate Andrew Yang defending the host – at least briefly. The tech entrepreneur and politician, who appeared on Rogan’s show in 2019, during his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, published and then apparently deleted a tweet defending Rogan. “I don’t think Joe Rogan is a racist – the man interacts with and works with black people literally all of the time,” Yang said on Sunday. “Do I know black friends of Joe’s who would swear by him? Yes I do.” Yang did not immediately explain why his tweet had disappeared. The racism scandal comes on top of growing pressure on Spotify to censor Rogan for including on his podcast dangerous Covid misinformation including anti-vaccine content, as the US pandemic death toll has hit 900,000. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are the most prominent musicians to remove their music from Spotify in protest. Backlash against Covid misinformation knocked more than $2bn off the streaming platform’s market value last week. While Rogan’s guest lists have long included a wide variety of political and “expert” opinions, white men have been given disproportionate airtime. Over the weekend, Spotify deleted around 70 episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience. The company’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, later said it was the host’s decision to remove them after the racist slurs were broadcast. In a statement on Sunday, Ek said: “While I strongly condemn what Joe has said … I want to make one point very clear – I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer … We should have clear lines around content and take action when they are crossed, but cancelling voices is a slippery slope.” Rogan, who signed an estimated $100m exclusive deal with Spotify in 2020, reportedly brings in an estimated 11 million listeners per episode.",Arts/Culture,Dwayne Johnson appears to withdraw Joe Rogan support after N-word video,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/07/dwayne-johnson-rock-joe-rogan-n-word
2/7/2022,"A million UK adults went an entire day without eating over the past month because they could not afford to put a meal on the table, according to research highlighting how the cost of living crisis has driven up food insecurity. Soaring energy and grocery prices – along with the removal in October of the £20 Covid top-up to universal credit – were having a devastating impact on the food consumption of millions of people, the Food Foundation thinktank said.  More than one in five households said they have already faced a ”heat or eat” dilemma, cutting back on the quality or quantity of food to pay energy or other essential bills, while 59% of households fear the cost of living squeeze will leave them with less to spend on food in the future. Altogether, nearly one in 10 UK households reported experiencing some degree of food insecurity over the past month – defined as skipping meals, going hungry or not eating for a whole day – because they were unable to afford food. “There is little doubt that the cost of living crisis is putting very real pressure on the ability of many to afford a healthy diet and is set to widen health inequalities,” the foundation said. Millions of households are under increasing financial pressures as a result of soaring energy bills and rising inflation. Gas and electricity bills will rise by an average of £700 a year from April, pitching 5m households into fuel poverty, despite measures introduced by the government to ease the strain. Grocery bills have also risen sharply, up 3.8% in January and potentially adding an extra £180 a year to the average household’s grocery bill this year. The strain on low-income family budgets is reflected in soaring demand at food banks and cut-price food clubs. The anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe recently revealed how food price rises had pushed up the price of the cheapest 500g bag of pasta in her local supermarket from 29p to 70p (an increase of 14%), rice from 45p a kilo to £1 (344%), and baked beans from 22p to 32p (45%). The Food Foundation survey was undertaken online between 18 and 20 January, polling 4,200 adults. It found 8.8% of all households, containing 4.7 million adults, reported that they had experienced food insecurity, up from 7.3% in July, when the last survey was undertaken. About 2 million children were living in households that do not have access to a healthy and affordable diet, putting them at risk of diet-related diseases such as obesity, and poor physical growth, the foundation said. Some groups were more likely to have experienced food insecurity over the last six months than others. People with serious disability were five times more at risk than those without a disability. People on universal credit were five times more likely to be food insecure than those not claiming. “The rapid escalation in disabled people experiencing food poverty is truly shocking. It is disabled people facing the biggest barriers to independence and inclusion that are in the worst situation; how can this possibly be acceptable?” asked Kamran Mallick, the chief executive of Disability Rights UK. The Department for Work and Pensions was approached for comment.",News/Society,1m UK adults ‘go entire day without food’ in cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/1m-uk-adults-go-entire-day-without-food-in-cost-of-living-crisis
2/7/2022,"Labour has dropped an investigation into an 82-year-Jewish woman for alleged antisemitism after she threatened to sue the party for unlawfully discriminating against her based on her belief in anti-Zionism. Diana Neslen, who regularly attends her local synagogue and keeps a kosher home, was being investigated by the party for the third time in less than three years for tweets she posted about Israel and Zionism.  In a letter to the party, her lawyers, Bindmans, said the investigation was unjustified and disproportionate, resting on a single tweet by Neslen from 2017, which said “the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavour and I am an antiracist Jew”. The letter said that if Labour did not back down, Neslen would bring a lawsuit for discrimination and harassment, claiming anti-Zionism is a protected philosophical belief under the Equality Act. Labour did not initially respond to Neslen’s lawyers, but after the Guardian published details of the case it told her it was discontinuing the investigation. “It is a big victory,” said Neslen. “I’m pleased that they dropped it because it exposes the fact that they shouldn’t have done anything in the first place. But I also feel that I would have liked the issue of protected belief to have been addressed because I believe there are a lot of people who also, like me, are anti-Zionist, believe that it’s a perfectly legitimate belief, and they have no recourse.” Neslen was sent a “reminder of conduct” by Labour in 2018, the same year that the party – under pressure to act on allegations of antisemitism – adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA’s) definition of the term. The IHRA definition of antisemitism includes as an example: “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour.” In February last year Neslen was given a formal warning, again relating to comments on social media. Bindmans said all bar one of the tweets cited in the latest investigation were excluded under party rules either because they dated to before she rejoined the party in 2015 or had been considered in the previous investigation. Neslen said Labour had not apologised, despite her request for it to do so, and had told her she was not entitled to talk publicly about it. But Neslen, who says she was a “committed Zionist” before she visited Israel, said she would not be silent. “I want the conversation to continue, I want Jewish people to be able to be as free talking about anti-Zionism as they are about Zionism,” she said. “You shouldn’t silence people who you disagree with, and although Zionism is for many Jews a sense of identity, [it’s] not for all and we all have a right to our views.” Neslen called on Labour to withdraw complaints against other party members under similar investigation. Jewish Voice for Labour, of which Neslen is a member, says it knows of 46 Jewish Labour members, two of whom have since died, who have faced or are facing disciplinary charges relating to allegations of antisemitism. “To say that we are insulting Jews is wrong,” said Neslen. “We are acting in accord with what we regard as Jewish values and Jewish ethics, and I’m not going to change that.” Labour did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Politics,Labour drops case against Jewish woman for alleged antisemitism,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/labour-drops-case-against-jewish-woman-for-alleged-antisemitism
2/7/2022,"A once vilified royal mistress perceived as a threat to the stability of the monarchy, Queen Camilla, as she will be crowned, is now seen as a guarantor of that institution’s future smooth running. The Queen clearly believes the Duchess of Cornwall possesses key traits of past successful consorts, such as quiet supportiveness and a determination not to outshine the principal.  The monarch stressed in her 70th accession day message – when she expressed her “sincere wish” that Camilla would be queen consort – the crucial support she and her father had received in marriage. “I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign,” she said. Hugo Vickers, the royal historian and author, said: “I think that was probably one of the strongest points that the Queen made.” Seventeen years after Camilla – whom the Queen reportedly once referred to as that “wicked woman” – married Prince Charles, her public image is worlds away from “the rottweiler” she was portrayed as after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Those who have observed her transformation at close quarters believe she has not put a foot wrong as the royals’ second most senior woman, and will not do so as queen consort. “When you consider how horrible people were about her before she married Prince Charles – they hurled abuse at her, they accused her of everything – she is not vindictive or vengeful,” said Vickers. “She has never given a hint of being anti anyone who was nasty about her before. “She seems to have a laid-back quality, which I think comes from what you might loosely call the Gloucestershire hunting set, which is a world of its own, where they rise above the jibes of the media and just get on with life.” When Camilla has publicly addressed the abuse, it has been with humour. The broadcaster Gyles Brandreth once recalled an occasion when, as president of the Oscar Wilde Society, he invited her to make a toast at the group’s annual meeting. She plunged in: “There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about,” quoting Wilde, before adding to laughter: “One of the few maxims of the great 19th-century writer Oscar Wilde that I am not sure I would entirely agree with.” The BBC’s former royal correspondent Peter Hunt believes Camilla has played a “canny game”. “She has kept the media close and the Daily Mail even closer,” he wrote. She is far more relaxed with the media than Charles, those who cover the royal family would attest, joking with photographers, and happy to comply with requests for quotes on subjects she feels strongly about. “She understands the game and gives them what they want without losing any dignity in the process,” Vickers said. Subjects close to her heart include promoting literacy, and the campaign highlighting violence against women, the latter a particularly gritty subject that she has embraced and championed, often well away from the cameras. As the daughter of a major, she is well schooled in the military, which is also a handy attribute for a queen. She has progressed from being a nervous bride – evident at the blessing of her 2005 marriage to Charles at St George’s chapel, Windsor – to confidently undertaking her own solo engagements. But it is at Charles’s side where, observers have noted, she is particularly effective, and will remain so when he becomes king. “Prince Charles has very good qualities, he also has occasional tendencies towards petulance. And I know she is very good at defusing that,” said Vickers. He recalled one incident when Charles was taken aback as someone suddenly shook his hand. Charles did not immediately respond, “but her hand shot out and with ‘how very nice to see you again’ she just defused the thing completely”. “I think all she really wants to do is make things easier for him. I don’t think she’s got any particular personal ambitions. There is no evidence she will be political at all. She will not outshine him. And he looks much more relaxed. She’s matter-of-fact and straightforward, and that’s exactly what he needs.” Charles now has what he wants.

2/7/2022,"Long delayed by coronavirus, Kenneth Branagh’s latest Agatha Christie movie puffs effortfully into harbour. It’s the classic whodunnit about a murder on a steamer making its way down the river in Egypt with an Anglo-American boatful of waxy-faced cameos aboard. The horrible homicide means that one of the passengers will have to spring into action, and this is of course the amply moustached Hercule Poirot, played by Branagh himself. It is Poirot who interviews suspects, supervises corpse-storage in the ship’s galley freezer cabinet and delivers the final unmasking – and all without the captain insisting that the Egyptian police should possibly get involved. Screenwriter Michael Green has adapted the 1937 novel with some new inventions: some people of colour are introduced, and Christie’s intense dislike for her wealthy-hypocrite leftwing character has been dialled down. Most startlingly, Green invents a very good prelude showing the young Poirot’s service in the trenches of the first world war, and the origin of that moustache. Nothing in the rest of this rather stale and two-dimensional tale matches the brio of that opening.  Among the passengers, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders play lady’s-companion Mrs Bowers and her wealthy socialite-turned-socialist employer Marie Van Schuyler, and the presence of this venerable comedy duo makes the movie look weirdly like a laugh-free version of the spoof they might have created for their erstwhile TV show. Russell Brand keeps his comedy stylings under wraps as the deadpan Dr Linus Windlesham. Sophie Okonedo and Letitia Wright play jazz singer Salome Otterbourne and her manager-slash-niece Rosalie, who is also a boarding school pal of glamorous heiress Linnet Ridgeway-Doyle, played by Gal Gadot, who is on the cruise with her new husband Simon – unfortunately played by Armie Hammer in what may be the last movie role of his career. Emma Mackey is Simon’s jealous former fiancee Jacqueline, Ali Fazal is Linnet’s lawyer and cousin. Rose Leslie is a regulation pinch-faced lady’s maid and Tom Bateman returns as Poirot’s cheery helpmeet Bouc (last seen on the Orient Express). He is here with his intimidating mother Euphemia, played by Annette Bening. After one of these people is offed, the clockwork grinds into action, bringing up in due course more dead bodies like the ship’s paddlewheel, but there is no sense of crescendo and climax. Branagh brings something spirited and good-humoured to the role of Poirot, but the film’s attempt to create some romantic stirrings to go with the activities of those little grey cells is not very convincing. He’s incidentally supposed to have been a would-be farmer in his extreme youth – whereas screenwriter Sarah Phelps, in her adaptation of The ABC Murders for BBC TV, more interestingly made Poirot a former priest.

2/7/2022,"The government agency charged with protecting the marine environment has dropped its case against Greenpeace over a protest intended to obstruct destructive fishing practices in UK coastal conservation areas. The judge in the case rebuked the Marine Management Organisation over the case, saying that the licensing regime, under which the case was brought, “could be better used as a source of protection against those who actively seek to harm the marine environment”.  Greenpeace has called for the government to ban the practice of bottom trawling, and other heavy industrialised fishing, in response to the ruling. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are designated by the government to protect marine life in UK waters by curbing fishing and allowing species to recover. Ministers have pledged to protect 30% of the UK’s sea areas, as part of a wider commitment to conservation. But some fishing is still allowed, including the practice of bottom trawling, which tears up the seabed and which experts have said is extremely destructive to many species. Bottom trawling is also a significant source of releasing carbon, as the seabed normally acts as a valuable carbon sink to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but turns into a carbon source when disturbed. In 2020, Greenpeace protesters dropped large boulders on to the sea bed in the Dogger Bank marine protected area, a key fishing area for bottom trawlers, and the following year dropped more in the Offshore Brighton MPA. The large granite rocks were harmless to marine life and surface fishing, but they get entangled in the weighted nets of bottom trawlers, obstructing the practice. The MMO took out a prosecution against Greenpeace, arguing that the licensing regime prohibits protesters from taking such action. However, the judge in the case, Edward Bindloss, criticised the body. He asked: “The 2009 Act introduced a licensing regime to protect the marine environment and Greenpeace were also seeking to protect the marine environment. Should the MMO be prosecuting in the name of marine protection the defendants’ actions in trying to raise awareness of the government’s perceived failures in relation to marine protection?” He added: “One of the ironies of this litigation is that both the MMO and Greenpeace are committed to improving the marine environment.” “The parties in this case should be allies, not antagonists. They should be acting in harmony given their stated purpose and objectives are the same. Greenpeace should be a supporter of the licensing regime and the MMO should support the prevention of any harmful deep sea fishing methods over important marine seabeds. It touches on the absurd that this litigation is happening at all.” On Monday morning, the MMO decided to offer no evidence against Greenpeace, resulting in verdicts of not guilty being recorded. John Sauven, the outgoing executive director of Greenpeace, who was charged under the prosecution, said: “The MMO’s role is to protect our marine ecosystems, a vitally important job in a climate and nature emergency. Our action was designed to safely protect nature from destructive fishing in an area designated as protected but where the MMO is miserably failing to do its job. For them to waste court time and public money prosecuting us for doing exactly that is, as the judge said, absurd.” He added: “This is a clear signal for the environment minister to take the urgent action needed to actively protect our oceans from industrial fishing and stop licensing destructive ships and fishing methods in all of the UK’s MPAs.” The MMO said in its submission: “Very exceptionally, the MMO has, in all the circumstances and taking particular note of the depth and the extent of the learned judge’s comments on the matter, decided that the appropriate course of action is to propose to offer no evidence to all charges on the indictments against both defendants.” Last year, the conservation group Oceana argued that licences for bottom trawling in UK waters could be unlawful. The government has taken the first steps towards curbing bottom trawling in conservation areas, but Greenpeace said more was needed. An MMO spokesperson said: “The findings of law in this case made clear that the MMO had jurisdiction to prosecute, and that Greenpeace are expected to comply with the marine licensing regime. It is noted that since initiating proceedings, Greenpeace have not carried out any further unlicensed activity. “The MMO has decided not to continue with the prosecution. In doing so, we fully expect that Greenpeace will, in accordance with the comments made by the learned judge, support and comply with the marine licensing rules in future. “Should unlicensed activity occur in the future we will continue to investigate and will consider enforcement actions in line with our published compliance and enforcement strategy.” The MMO did not respond to a Guardian query asking how much the prosecution had cost, but the cost to taxpayers is likely to be at least in the tens of thousands of pounds.",News/Environment,UK drops ‘absurd’ case against Greenpeace for dropping rocks in sea,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/greenpeace-rocks-sea-bottom-trawling-marine-management-organisation

2/7/2022,"The far-right French presidential candidate Eric Zemmour has said of all world leaders he is compared to he feels most like the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. The former journalist, who is often compared to Donald Trump, was speaking on France Inter’s morning news programme when asked about “populist” foreign leaders. The interviewer mentioned Trump, the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and Italy’s former prime minister Matteo Salvini and asked if they were models for Zemmour.  “You have not mentioned Boris Johnson and I am astonished because he is without doubt the leader I feel I am closest to, culturally, intellectually … and he’s obviously a European like me but English,” Zemmour said. It is not the first time Zemmour has rejected comparisons to Trump and likened himself to the British PM. He has pointed out that both he and Johnson are former journalists, both have written history books – Zemmour on the history of France, De Gaulle and Napoleon, Johnson on Winston Churchill. He said in November: “We do have a lot in common and above all he pulled off an electoral strategy that I propose to implement: an alliance of the working class and that part of the patriotic bourgeoisie who wish to restore French sovereignty and defend an identity tragically under threat.” Zemmour did not meet Johnson when he visited London last year, ostensibly to publicise his new book La France n’a pas dit son dernier mot (France hasn’t had its last word) but also to drum up support among expatriate French voters. His team said “there were phone calls” between his advisers and members of the British cabinet. On returning to France, Zemmour told journalists: “I met a lord and I revisited the historical English parliament, the mother of all parliaments.” Zemmour is running on an ultra-nationalist, French first programme calling for “zero immigration” and warning of a clash of civilisations “not just between east and west, but between Islam and the Christian world in Europe”. Zemmour told France Inter: “I am not part of an international populist (movement). For a long time my definition of populism has been it’s the cry of people who don’t want to die and I am the candidate of the French people who don’t want to die.” The latest opinion poll by Ipsos suggest Zemmour and the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) candidate, Marine Le Pen, could both reach 14% of the vote in the first round of the April presidential election behind Emmanuel Macron and the centre-right Les Républicains candidate, Valérie Pécresse. A second Ifop poll suggests Pécresse, Le Pen and Zemmour are all hovering around the same level.",News/World news,French far-right presidential hopeful likens himself to Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/french-far-right-presidential-hopeful-eric-zemmour-likens-himself-to-boris-johnson
2/7/2022,"As high-wire openings to a standup show go, this will take some beating. David Cross begins I’m from the Future with the narrative of a woman’s journey to, and experience in, Auschwitz. The anticipation in the room ebbs into anxiety: what’s he up to? Distressing details pile up, and you feel queasy that he’s using this material, presumably, just to tee up a punchline. Can he pull it off? He does: the tension is released, and it’s not Cross who is left looking crass for abusing the memory of the Holocaust. Neat trick, that – although you’re soon reminded that Cross can do crass too. Much of the show addresses Covid, and the schism between law-abiders and libertarians. There’s some fine, heavily sarcastic material here, as the Brooklynite turns vaccine phobia on its head (who wouldn’t want to have magnet powers?) and, ranting in character as an anti-vaxxer, flags the paranoia of those who bang on about their refusal to live in fear.  Points duly scored, with some cathartic laughs for liberals along the way. But sometimes Cross’s contempt for his ideological opponents is a little off-putting. It’s about fine margins. The direction in which Cross takes a routine about vaccine-sceptic blowhards who then die of Covid (“It’s OK to wish them dead”) feels legit, just about, as a riff on liberal schadenfreude and the confrontational tenor of the times. But when a substantial section of the show is delivered in the same sneering register, the fun starts to wane. I felt similarly when Cross (born Jewish, now atheist) gratuitously mocks Orthodox Jewish men for being ugly, which – even if he wants to expose religious fundamentalism to ridicule – feels beside the point. There are more weak jokes about excrement, too, than you’d expect from a Grammy nominee – or from a grownup. I prefer the title routine, when Cross travels back in time to tell rightwingers’ childhood selves what they’ll grow up to be. Its qualities of human sympathy and self-mockery – as Cross sends up his suitability as a life coach – give it a basic likability not always conspicuous in this smart but cynical show.

2/7/2022,"Boris Johnson has said he is “absolutely not” worried about Rishi Sunak’s loyalty as chancellor as they made a joint appearance to announce two new targets for reducing cancer waiting times after the pandemic. The prime minister said nobody would have to wait for more than two months for a cancer diagnosis and they wanted the “vast majority” of people to get a diagnosis within 28 days.  After the Treasury delayed publication of the plan to reduce the post-pandemic backlog, the prime minister made a joint visit with Sunak to a cancer centre in Kent to announce the targets related to cancer, but not the wider plan for reducing waiting times for operations. The numbers of cancer patients facing delays in seeing a specialist for the first time and starting their treatment have hit record highs in England, amid fears that overstretched NHS services can no longer provide prompt care. The elective care plan to deal with 6 million delays is now likely to be revealed later in the week, amid rows about how stretching the targets should be and what they might cost to address. The disagreement centres on the deadline by which NHS trusts will have to have treated all those who have been waiting either one year or two years for care, usually an operation. “Conversations about the targets have become protracted and difficult. The Treasury wants a certain scale of ambition, they want tougher targets than NHS England thinks is feasible,” said an NHS source. Tensions between Johnson and Sunak have arisen over the No 10 parties, with the chancellor giving only lukewarm support to the prime minister. Sunak also distanced himself from Johnson over the prime minister’s slur against the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, falsely linking him to a failure to prosecute serial child sex abuser Jimmy Savile. Tory MPs said Sunak is on manoeuvres, drumming up support for a potential leadership bid – in common with many other cabinet minister including Liz Truss and Michael Gove, even though he denies wanting to run. But speaking to broadcasters at the Kent oncology centre at Maidstone hospital, Johnson said: “Everybody in No 10 and the Treasury are working together in harmony to deal with the big problems that the country faces and clearing the Covid backlogs.” After weeks of turmoil in No 10 over the parties during lockdown, which are now under police investigation, Johnson claimed people wanted the government to focus on life “beyond Westminster”. His premiership is still under threat, but the prime minister attempted to steady his operation by making new appointments over the weekend. Asked if he has had to reassure new Downing Street staff that their jobs have good long-term prospects, Johnson told broadcasters: “I think what people want is for the government to focus, not on stuff going on at Westminster, but to focus on life ... beyond Westminster, and to focus on the needs of the country. And that is what we’re doing.”",News/Politics,Johnson ‘absolutely not’ worried about Sunak’s loyalty,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/johnson-absolutely-not-worried-about-sunaks-loyalty
