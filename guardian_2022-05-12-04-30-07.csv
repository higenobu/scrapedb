5/12/2022,"Babis Anagnostopoulos, the Greek pilot accused of killing his British wife as she slept in their Athens home, had waited for his moment in court and, a year to the day after she took her last breath, he got it. For almost eight hours on Wednesday the UK-trained aviator stood in the dock relating the alleged events that led to the fatal moment on 11 May 2021 when he “lost control” and smothered Caroline Crouch, 20, to death with a pillow. The couple’s dog was also found dead. No detail was too small for the court now tasked with determining whether the 34-year-old Greek should spend the next two decades in prison for a crime that has gripped the country. “There is no excuse [for my actions] … what has been lost is irreplaceable. Neither Caroline nor our dog deserved it,” he told the three-member panel of presiding judges at the start of the deposition. “There are not enough times that I can say sorry. I will tell you in detail, and sincerely, what exactly happened.” During his testimony, Anangnostopoulos claimed he had unwavering love for the student he had met as a 15-year-old on the island of Alonissos. Over the course of their four-year relationship the couple had enjoyed “fairytale” times including an idyllic, spur-of-the moment wedding in Portugal “that you only see in films”. “My absolute priority in everything was her happiness,” he said describing his joy when Caroline, who had previously suffered a miscarriage, gave birth to their daughter Lydia. “She may have been younger but she was very mature and she was maturing fast.” The judge repeatedly interjected, cajoling the defendant – described by psychologists who had also testified in the court as narcissistic and controlling – for speaking of his wife in the present “when she is dead and cannot be brought back” and urging him not to “overanalyse”. For 37 days Anagnostopoulos had tried to pin the murder on a botched break-in by ruthless foreign thieves, prompting police to speak of the pilot’s skills as a consummate actor. On Wednesday his self-described goal was to prove that Crouch’s death had not been premeditated but was instead the result of being in a “blurred state of mind” that should be considered a crime of passion and treated more leniently. He had previously attempted to lay the blame on the Briton’s “dangerous outbursts” saying he had also been a victim of her physical abuse when, in heated moments, she had lunged out and “punched and kicked me”. On the night in question, he had got especially angry, he recalled, when she refused to apologise for her part in a row and had threatened to hit their daughter – who he subsequently placed next to her dead mother’s body. “I got on top of her [in the couple’s bed] so she couldn’t hit me so easily,” he told the Athens court, saying he believed he had been pushed to the edge by the woman he had otherwise loved. “I told her to calm down … she was saying ‘get up, leave me, go away’ and other swear words which I’d rather not say. Then I took my pillow and I placed it over her head.” When asked by the judge how such love could suddenly transition into such violence he responded: “I had not purpose. There was no logic in my blurred mind at that moment … and when I saw her in profile and understood she was dead from her eyes which were open and her pulse, I lost it, I began to weep and pull my hair and go back and forth across the room …. From the day I lost Caroline I lost everything, I lost my life. ” The son of a schoolteacher and civil engineer, the pilot stands accused of premeditated murder, the unprovoked killing of an animal and perverting the course of justice by repeatedly lying to police – charges that carry life in prison. On Wednesday, he conceded he had hung Caroline’s seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple’s two-story maisonette to make the crime look more credible. “It was impossible to look, I left and went into the kitchen so I couldn’t see or hear [it die].” The defendant broke down and wept on Tuesday when excerpts of Crouch’s handwritten diary were read out to the court. She had described her feelings of powerlessness in a marriage that had increasingly left her feeling trapped and suffocated. She was the 17th woman to be murdered at the hands of a partner in Greece last year.

5/12/2022,"Google has announced a series of new products as it looks to compete with Apple on tablets and smartwatches. It has unveiled a lower-cost smartphone, high-end earbuds and a watch due later this year, as well as Android updates. During the keynote kicking off its IO developer conference, Google set out its intention to build a broader collection of own-brand devices rather than rely on third parties such as Samsung using its software. “We’re going for the ecosystem,” said Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of consumer hardware. “We want people to know where Google is headed with devices as an organisation over next few years.” The Pixel 6a is Google’s new smaller, mid-range Android phone, costing from £399 ($449/A$749), shipping on 28 July. It has a 6.1in screen and the same recycled aluminium body, two-tone colours and camera bar across the back as the firm’s high-end phones. It has Google’s top-end Tensor processor, 5G and the Titan M2 security chip from the Pixel 6, with 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage. It will be supported with software updates for at least five years, making it one of the longest-lasting Android phones. The 6a has a pair of wide and ultra-wide 12-megapixel cameras on the back, which support the same improved skin tone and magic eraser features as Google’s top models. Google announced its first Bluetooth earbuds with noise cancelling, called the Pixel Buds Pro, which will ship on 28 July costing £179 ($199/A$299). The earbuds use Google-designed chips, algorithms and speakers, competing directly with Apple’s pricier AirPods Pro. They have IPX4 sweat resistance and the same smart features as Google’s previous earbuds such as hands-free voice assistant, walking directions and instant translation abilities. The Buds Pro can connect to two Bluetooth devices at once, such as a phone for calls and a laptop for music, including iPhones, Macs and PCs. They last up to seven hours with noise cancelling, and up to 20 hours with their charging case. Google showed off its first own-brand WearOS smartwatch, called the Pixel Watch, which will ship in the autumn. It has a round, domed design, is made of recycled stainless steel, and has optional 4G connectivity. It features various Google apps and services including Assistant, Maps and Pay, and the Play Store for third-party apps. It will also feature a suite of Fitbit health and activity-tracking services, after Google’s purchase of the firm, which completed last year. The watch will work with most Android phones, not just Pixels. Google unveiled its upcoming top Pixel 7 and 7 Pro smartphones for later this year. They will feature premium polished aluminium and glass bodies and the firm’s next-generation Tensor processor, shipping with Android 13 in the autumn. Google also announced its intention to return to making Android tablets in 2023 as companions for its Pixel phones. The premium Pixel Tablet will have Google’s Tensor chip and will take advantage of Android 13 with additions for better split-screen multitasking and use of space on tablets, including updates to 20 of Google’s apps, with third-party apps such as TikTok, Zoom, Facebook and others gaining new tablet-optimised designs. Google showed off some new software features coming later this year, including the ability to request removal of search results containing your contact details, automatic summarisation of key points in Google Docs and Chat, and the ability to speak to Google Assistant just by looking at the Nest Hub Max smart display. Later this year Google Maps will gain a new immersive view, which combines street and aerial images to create digital models of cities including London, Los Angeles and New York. Users will be able to virtually walk through the cities at various times of the day with information overlaid, such as weather conditions, traffic and how busy a place is. Android 13 will also be released in the summer as a free update, bringing with it greater customisation and privacy options including the ability to force apps to ask whether they can send you notifications before doing so, similar to iOS, and further restrictions to location access for apps. Google’s Material You colour theming from Android 12 will be expanded across more of the interface, including custom app icons. Now more than one language can be used on a phone at the same time, such as English in a social media app but Spanish in a banking app. The new Google Wallet will be able to collect payment cards, loyalty cards, transport tickets and boarding cards in one place, with various kinds of identification such as student IDs and driving licences in the US later this year. Users keen to try the new features can test out the software in beta form on Google’s Pixel phones and others from third-party manufacturers.",News/Technology,"Google IO: Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch and Android 13 unveiled",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/11/google-io-pixel-6a-pixel-watch-and-android-13-unveiled
5/12/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has denied being willing to lie under oath in the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial, as she admitted allowing her agent to access Coleen Rooney’s private Instagram posts. Giving evidence on Wednesday, the second day of the trial, Vardy also accepted she had attempted to leak a story about the arrest of Premier League footballer Danny Drinkwater to the Sun – accompanied by the note: “I want paying for this x.” Vardy told the high court this leak was a one-off incident motivated by the desire to expose a drink-driver. She also insisted that multiple other WhatsApp conversations with her agent, Caroline Watt, concerning leaking stories to the Sun about other celebrities – including Rooney, model Danielle Lloyd and unnamed footballers – were jokes that should not be taken seriously. In response, Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, said this was “completely untrue”, and it was impossible to believe Vardy and Watt were just joking about selling stories to the Sun. He also claimed there were discrepancies between Vardy’s written witness statement and her spoken evidence in court. “What this shows, Mrs Vardy, is that you are prepared to lie under oath,” he said. Vardy replied: “No.” Sherborne alleged there was an established pattern of behaviour, where Vardy passed story tips to Watt, who then gave them to journalists at the Sun. He told Vardy: “It’s not that you didn’t want to do the dirty, it’s that you didn’t want to be seen to be doing the dirty.” The court also heard how Vardy – the wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy – shared her Instagram account with Watt. This enabled her agent to view posts on Rooney’s locked private Instagram account, which had only about 300 trusted followers. Rooney’s legal team allege Vardy and Watt worked together to pass these private Instagram updates to journalists at the Sun. Sherborne said it was “quite clear” Watt was monitoring Rooney’s private Instagram posts using Vardy’s account, and the duo would sometimes discuss Rooney’s Instagram updates on WhatsApp. “You knew what she was doing and you condoned it,” he told Vardy. “No that’s not true,” she replied. At one point the court heard that Rooney had briefly blocked Vardy from the private Instagram. Watt sent a WhatsApp to Vardy, asking: “Babe, has Coleen unfollowed you?” Vardy replied: “Oh wow I just saw, wow, what a cunt. I’m going to message her.” Sherborne told the court that it was difficult to know for certain if Watt had sent messages to journalists because Watt’s phone – which he wished to search – had fallen off the side of a boat off the Scottish coast. “We will never know because her phone sits at the bottom of the North Sea,” he told the court. The disclosures were made as part of the libel case Vardy is bringing against Rooney, after Rooney alleged Vardy leaked stories from the private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney – the wife of Derby County manager Wayne – went public with the accusation in October 2019, claiming to have run a sting operation to find the leaker and concluding: “It’s .......... Rebekah Vardy’s account.” Vardy has always maintained the accusation is false and defamatory, and she has brought the libel case in a bid to clear her name. Late in the afternoon, Vardy – who spent the entire day in the witness box – dabbed at her eyes when questioned about the abuse she and her family have received while in the public eye. The proceedings were watched intently by Rooney and her husband, both of whom are expected to later give evidence in the trial. The court also heard accusations that Vardy leaked private information about her husband’s then-teammate Riyad Mahrez to the media in 2018, potentially destabilising the players’ club, Leicester City. In messages shown to the court, Vardy told her agent: “Mahrez not turned up to training again, the lads are fuming.” Watt suggested contacting a Sky Sports reporter but Vardy replied: “I just don’t want it coming back on me.” Watt then said “I can tell someone,” to which Vardy replied: “Yes, do it.” Sherborne pressed Vardy on whether her husband was the source of the messages about Mahrez: “Did you or did you not know that the lads were fuming?” Vardy insisted she was just gossiping and did not have a source in the Leicester City changing room. “Jamie and I never discussed whether the lads were fuming,” she said. The footballer’s wife told the high court she did not systematically leak stories to the media and the idea of seeking payment from the Sun for the story about Drinkwater crashing his car was a “fleeting thought”. She said her real motivation in wanting to leak the story was to expose a drink-driver to public scrutiny. When told by Watt the Sun had already learned about the arrest from a source at the police station, Vardy said she was “fuming I didn’t give it to you earlier”. Watt replied to say “that would have been a fortune 😂” and instead suggested finding out where Drinkwater lived and sharing the information with the paparazzi agency Splash News. Vardy’s evidence is set to continue on Thursday after it was cut short by a fire alarm.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’ trial: Rebekah Vardy denies being willing to lie under oath,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/wagatha-christie-trial-rebekah-vardy-denies-being-willing-to-lie-under-oath
5/12/2022,"Australia are expected to be confirmed as the host nation of the 2027 Rugby World Cup on Thursday and could target Eddie Jones to help their bid for success on home soil. World Rugby’s council will meet in Dublin to confirm the host nations of the 2027 and 2031 tournaments – the latter is set to break new ground in the US – as well as the next three women’s World Cup tournaments. Australia has been identified as the preferred bidder for the 2027 men’s tournament and after the union secured the necessary financial backing from the federal government in March, it is little more than a formality that they will be confirmed on Thursday. World Rugby overhauled its bidding process after the controversial decision to award France the 2023 tournament five year ago, after South Africa had been recommended in an independent evaluation, and another late U-turn is inconceivable. Australia last hosted the World Cup in 2003, when England were crowned champions following Jonny Wilkinson’s famous drop goal against Jones’s Wallabies in the final. Jones’s contract with England ends after the 2023 tournament and, though he has recently been linked with a move to Racing 92, his future after ending ties with the Rugby Football Union is unclear. Dave Rennie is the incumbent Australia head coach and it is thought that could be extended until the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia in 2025, depending on how his side fare at France 2023. The Brumbies head coach, Dan McKellar, is being lined up as his potential successor – though flopping in France would no doubt lead to a rethink – and Jones’s experience and track record at World Cups is not lost on Rugby Australia. Indeed, the governing body could seek Jones’s assistance in a broader capacity for the 2027 tournament. In 2019, before Rennie was appointed, Jones was linked briefly with a move back home following the Japan World Cup. His departure in 2005 was acrimonious but the 2027 bid team have expressed a desire to have Jones on board. Last month the former Wallabies hooker and bid leader Phil Kearns said: “I think it would be awesome if Eddie had a role in the future of Australian rugby. I think those [broken] bridges should well and truly be rebuilt and pave the way for Eddie to come back in some role.” The decision to award the 2031 tournament to the US, meanwhile, will be hugely significant as rugby union seeks to expand into new commercial markets. The US president, Joe Biden, has given his written endorsement of the bid but there is nonetheless scope for embarrassment if the US team fail to advance through their playoff against Chile and reach the 2023 World Cup tournament. The World Rugby council is also expected to confirm England as hosts of the 2025 women’s World Cup and award the 2029 and 2033 tournaments to Australia and the US respectively. The delayed 2021 tournament will take place in New Zealand in the autumn with England the favourites to reclaim the title they won in 2014. The council will also vote on whether to make the five global law trials – including the 50:22 and the goalline drop-out – permanent. While the 50:22 law has received popular support and is expected to gain the 75% majority to be adopted long-term, it is understood there is some opposition to the goalline drop-out from within the home nations, which could lead to it being ditched. It was recently identified by the current England captain, Courtney Lawes, as the one law he would do away with if he had the chance. It is also understood that World Rugby has abandoned any plans to trial the 20-minute red card law on a global scale amid widespread opposition from within the northern hemisphere. All the while, discussions continue in Dublin over the proposal for a north versus south “Nations Championship” to be launched in 2026. A concrete decision would be made at World Rugby’s next council meeting in November but stakeholders perceive this week as crucial for progress to be made if the tournament is to come to pass.",Sport/Sport,Australia set to target Eddie Jones for role at 2027 home World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/australia-set-to-target-eddie-jones-for-role-at-2027-home-world-cup
5/12/2022,"Boris Johnson’s offer of British written security assurances to Sweden and Finland was more than a piece of symbolism designed to nudge the two countries over the line into making a joint application for Nato next week, Swedish security experts said. Although Johnson’s key guarantee is necessarily a political declaration, as opposed to an international treaty guarantee, the British commitment was of high value at a time of great tension, Anna Wieslander, the Atlantic Council’s northern Europe director said on Wednesday. Johnson’s visits were designed to reassure the populations of both countries that in practical military defence terms key Nato countries, if not Nato collectively, are committed bilaterally to the Nordic countries’ defence if subject to attack or sustained Russian intimidation. The UK statement goes further than any bilateral guarantees made so far by any other Nato country and is designed to cover the potentially vulnerable transition period between Nato membership application and full membership, the point at which Nato’s full article 5 collective defence protections kicks in. That transition is perceived as the moment of maximum risk for Stockholm and Helsinki and could last as long as 12 months as each of the 30 Nato states must ratify their membership. In a visit to Washington last week Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, was given a broad security assurance by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor also promised to back the Nordics’ Nato membership when the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, travelled to Berlin last week. Björn Fägersten, senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said the British offer “gives an extra layer of assurance in the event of an attack. It is written down and Boris Johnson was quite specific in terms of talking about increased deployments by the military, air force and naval operations.” Wieslander said “at a time of very high tension in the region, it is of great value, and partly because it builds on what exists already through the agreements made at the time of the setting up of the joint expeditionary force in 2015. It also sends a signal to Russia that a nuclear power is willing to do this. I would expect the US to do something similar.” The declaration could not come in the form of a fully fledged treaty since that might take as long to ratify as Sweden’s Nato membership. In a decision that cuts deep into Swedish self-identity, the ruling Social Democrat board will decide on Sunday whether to end 200 years of neutrality, although many say the cooperation between Finland and Sweden with Nato members has been so close it was tantamount to Nato membership. Leftwing critics have said Sweden is behaving like a reindeer in a herd, running in the same direction as the rest. Fägersten said the meeting of the Social Democrats governing board was “the key decision point”, and predicted the party would join the non-left opposition parties in backing membership. “The statements from former foreign ministers such as Margot Wallström and the fact that Social Democrats have brought forward the decision to coincide with Finland’s timetable suggest there will be support.” Asked if he thought Johnson was the best message carrier to take into the Swedish social democratic debate, he said: “I don’t think Brexit or Partygate will affect Sweden’s thinking. We have seen that Britain has been pretty supportive of Ukraine from an early stage, and that has increased its credibility. Britain is a pretty popular country here. We would still like you to be EU members, but we cooperate a lot.” Support for Nato membership has not trailed off in Sweden since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A poll conducted by Demoskop for the daily newspaper Aftonbladet showed support for Nato membership still rising and reaching 61 %. The same organisation’s poll published on 20 April showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining Nato, up from 51% in March. In addition, more than two-thirds of the Finnish parliament, according to surveys, now supports Nato membership. Finland, an EU member, has managed to balance criticism of Russia with a bridge-building role with Moscow, but may find that role harder to play once inside an alliance seen as Russia’s enemy. Defence experts are stressing that Sweden could maintain its special role in advocating peace and disarmament by following Norway and Denmark, two founding Nato members, in making a condition of membership a ban on their soil of both nuclear weapons in peacetime and permanent foreign troops. In practice this does not prevent near permanent rotational forces or pre-positioning of supplies. Security service chiefs have been surprised by the lack of direct Russian disinformation efforts in the Nordic debates, and Fägersten said it was possible that future Russian interference would focus instead in one of the 30 Nato states that would have to ratify the treaty possibly over the next 12 months. He said it was also possible Russia, preoccupied by the Ukraine front, simply did not have the resources to respond to the unforeseen emergence of a new Nato flank. Asked what kind of disruption was possible, Wieslander said: “The expectations are cyberattack, disinformation campaigns, electronic jamming, intrusions in our airspace, even something more official, that they have moved Iskander missiles into Kaliningrad [a Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast], but they have played with this card before. Their methods are designed to be ambiguous.”",News/World news,Johnson’s security assurances to Sweden and Finland not just symbolic ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/johnson-security-assurances-sweden-and-finland-not-just-symbolic
5/12/2022,"The chief executive of the insurer Aviva has hit out at sexism in the industry, saying “unacceptable behaviour” has only increased since she took more senior roles in the sector. Amanda Blanc, who became the company’s first female chief executive in 2020, published a LinkedIn post thanking people for their support after shareholders made sexist remarks at the company’s annual general meeting on Monday. Investors said Blanc was “not the man for the job” and should be “wearing trousers”. “In all honesty, after 30-plus years in financial services I am pretty used to sexist and derogatory comments like those in the AGM,” she said in the post. Blanc continued: “I would like to tell you that things have got better in recent years but it’s fair to say that it has actually increased – the more senior the role I have taken, the more overt the unacceptable behaviour. “The surprising thing is that this type of stuff used to be said in private, perhaps from the safety of four walls inside an office – the fact that people are now making these comments in a public AGM is a new development for me personally.” Blanc, 54, is well known for being a female pioneer in male-dominated industries including the insurance sector, having worked her way to the chief executive role at Aviva after stints at Zurich Insurance, Axa and the Association of British Insurers. She has also served as chair of the Professional Rugby Board and sat on the board of the Welsh rugby union until November. Blanc was appointed the government’s women in finance champion in March 2021, succeeding the former Virgin Money chief Jayne-Anne Gadhia. The initiative asks City signatories to set voluntary targets towards gender diversity. Blanc said she hoped the insurance sector would achieve gender equality and could “slowly eradicate this type of occurrence for the next generation. But in truth that seems a long way off; even with the help of some fantastically supportive men who speak out on the issue.” The chair of Aviva, George Culmer, was one of the first to hit out at the sexist comments from shareholders, first reported by the Financial Times, saying they were “simply inappropriate” and should not be repeated at any future AGM. “I’m flabbergasted,” he said at the end of Monday’s meeting. The storm at Aviva has added to the perception that insurers have failed to address sexism and bullying across the sector. In March, the insurance market Lloyd’s of London was forced to issue its largest fine in its 336-year history over a bullying and harassment case involving one of its member firms, which hosted an inappropriate “boys’ night out” event for staff. Those parties took place annually for a number of years until 2018 – a year before the former shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds accused the insurance market of being “institutionally sexist”.",News/Inequality,‘Used to it’: Aviva CEO responds after sexist comments at AGM,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/may/11/used-to-it-aviva-ceo-responds-after-sexist-comments-at-agm
5/12/2022,"The Conservative party long ago stopped listening to Theresa May, but that doesn’t mean her view counts for nothing. When she warns, as she did earlier this week, that the unilateral abandonment of the Northern Ireland protocol would damage the UK’s international reputation, she speaks with the authority of a former prime minister whose time in office was consumed by the attempt to get a workable Brexit agreement. She failed. But so, it turns out, did her successor. If Boris Johnson’s deal had met the durability test, he would not now be getting ready to renege on it. Hardline Brexiters have talked about changing the Northern Ireland protocol almost from the moment it was enacted. It has never been implemented as written because the UK government has lacked the will to meet its treaty obligations. Now Liz Truss is reported to be preparing a total rupture, declaring the protocol inoperable. The EU has warned that such a move would collapse the foundations of the wider Brexit settlement. That could lead to tariffs and a suspension of cooperation in all but the most essential areas; a trade war, in other words. The crisis has a proximate cause in Northern Irish politics and deeper roots in Mr Johnson’s approach to Europe. Elections to the Stormont assembly last week, where Sinn Féin overtook the Democratic Unionists as the largest party, have brought simmering resentments to a boil. In second place, the DUP loses the right to nominate a first minister. It is entitled to a deputy with equal status in law, but the symbolic loss of primacy is immense. The DUP is refusing to re-engage with power sharing for as long as the protocol stands. Its requirement for customs checks in the Irish Sea represents another huge symbolic affront to unionist sensibilities. Unionists are entitled to feel let down by Brexit, but the object of their rage should be Mr Johnson. He used their resistance to Mrs May’s deal as a weapon against her in his campaign for power, and later betrayed them with a deal that did the opposite of what he had promised. Then he lied about it. He claimed that there would be no Irish Sea border, indicating that he either didn’t understand his deal or didn’t intend to honour it; most likely both. A responsible prime minister would have set about trying to reconcile unionists to the deal, while negotiating adjustment to level the controls. The EU is amenable to soft-touch implementation, but not ripping up treaties. Instead, Mr Johnson has stoked the DUP grievance, trying to use its intransigence as a lever to exert pressure on Brussels. His casual duplicity has sabotaged Northern Ireland’s delicate political settlement and he is desperate to deflect blame on to Europe. It is a disreputable, dangerous manoeuvre that can only aggravate a domestic crisis and harm Britain’s standing abroad. On that point, Mrs May is right: the Tories should pay more heed to the leader they deposed for sincerely trying to make Brexit work than to the one they put in her place to do a deal in bad faith.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Northern Ireland protocol: make it work | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-northern-ireland-protocol-make-it-work
