2/9/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing questions over his support for a company that employed Guto Harri, his new communications chief, after it emerged the firm signed a £150m deal in Downing Street with the endorsement of the prime minister. Harri, a former adviser to Johnson as London mayor, was a director of Hydro Industries when he accompanied a team from the water technology firm to No 10 in February 2020.  While in Downing Street, a press release from Hydro Industries revealed they signed a £150m deal with an Egyptian gas company and were provided with a supportive quote by the prime minister, with Johnson saying it was “exactly the type of contract in the post-Brexit era that showcases the best of UK industry”. The Hydro Industries team also attended a St David’s Day reception at No 10 that day, where the chief executive spoke to Johnson directly. Tweeting a picture of the team and Harri in Downing Street, the firm said: “Grateful for the PM’s support and encouragement.” Labour accused the prime minister of cronyism and questioned whether Harri had facilitated “privileged access to government” for the firm, which has given about £70,000 to the Tory party since 2015. They called on past communications between Harri and the government to be disclosed. Harri, who has known the prime minister for decades, returned to work for his old boss this week to help him deal with the fallout of the “partygate” scandal and try to refocus his premiership on the challenges facing the UK. But days into the new role as director of communications, he has come under scrutiny over his business interests, including lobbying No 10 on behalf of Huawei, a Chinese telecoms company that is currently being removed from the UK’s 5G network amid security concerns. Hydro Industries was also one of 16 firms in Wales to get funding from the government’s Future Fund to help with pandemic recovery, which was later converted into equity worth £3.5m. This has given the government-owned British Business Bank a stake in the firm. Executives from Hydro also met and were pictured with the prime minister at Conservative party conference last year but it is understood Harri was not present on that occasion. Hydro is a prominent company in Wales, with its chairman, David Pickering, a major figure in Welsh rugby, and the £150m deal was to build a water treatment plant in Egypt to service an oil terminal on the Red Sea coast. No 10 declined to answer questions about whether Harri had facilitated access to Johnson for Hydro Industries. A spokesman for No 10 said: “Guto resigned as a director of Hydro Industries on taking up a position for No 10.” Harri has previously made clear on social media that he is proud to have worked for the company and its work on clean water. Harri stepped down from his non-executive board position at the firm on Monday and has also resigned his position at Hawthorn Advisors, the lobbying firm that represents Huawei. However, No 10 has not disclosed whether Harri retains any equity in companies he has worked for. He would likely be advised by the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team on whether he is allowed to keep any private business interests. Links between Johnson, Harri and Hydro Industries have previously been reported by Voice.Wales and OpenDemocracy but Harri’s appointment to Johnson’s top team raises fresh questions about the revolving door between private business and government. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said it was an example of “cronyism” and called for “full transparency from Harri about any shares, profit or ownership arrangements he maintains with Hydro Industries and disclosure of all contact he had with government before he took up his new appointment”. She added: “It’s vital that anyone entering government service leaves their private sector interests at the door. The prime minister needs to make clear to Guto Harri the restrictions on his interests outlined in the special advisers code of conduct. The rules are there for a reason and they have to apply to everyone.” Hydro Industries did not answer questions about its past dealings with No 10. Wayne Preece, the chief executive of the company, said: “We can confirm that Guto has this week resigned as a board director and we all wish him the very best in his new appointment.” Following questions about Harri’s lobbying for Huawei, No 10 defended his appointment saying he had previously “provided advice to the clients of a private company, and that is entirely legitimate”.",News/Politics,PM faces questions over £150m deal involving firm that employed Guto Harri,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/pm-faces-questions-over-150m-deal-involving-firm-that-employed-guto-harri
2/9/2022,"The question in this nimble murder-mystery spoof is not so much whodunnit as just how do they do that? Two actors play a dozen or so characters, while taking turns on the piano, in a fun production with an irresistible sense of invention. Its finely synchronised stars, Lee O’Reilly and Sam Denia, have a strong comic rapport and come across as partners in crime, with the former portraying an ambitious sleuth and the latter quick-changing through roles as a lineup of suspects. Bryan Hodgson’s production relocates Joe Kinosian and Kellen Blair’s American musical from New England to Gloucestershire, with local references for this Cotswolds audience and a blizzard of other accents, including a Wirral boys’ choir (performed, on his knees, by Denia). The setting is the country mansion of novelist Arthur Whitney, who gets bumped off at his own birthday party. Was it one of his bickering neighbours, Barb and Murray? His own wife, Dahlia? Or did prima ballerina Barrette fire the pistol pointe-blank?  Kinosian and Blair intended the musical to be staged with minimal, if any, production elements – presumably to showcase the ingenuity of the performances. Here, it’s told within the extra setting of a film studio’s prop store. Denia and O’Reilly first appear as janitors who pull a dust sheet off back-to-back pianos. Sam Rowcliffe-Tanner’s lighting design gives a comic flourish to a set by Justin Williams that is crammed with canny touches, including lyrics and stage directions written out on props and enough weapons for a game of Cluedo. A vivid sense of the mansion is lost within this framework, which never fully amplifies the way several characters harbour thwarted showbiz dreams. The musical has an awareness of its own transportive art form – the officer coaxes one suspect into a duet to get him to confess and another betrays herself while lost mid-song – so it’s a shame the tunes themselves never achieve a deliriously giddy effect. The show unfolds at a brisk pace, in just about real time, and would work better without its interval. Some of the repetitive gags about the titles of, and clues in, Whitney’s novels could be jettisoned and sometimes simply too much is happening at once to savour Blair’s often witty lyrics. But perhaps striving to keep up is part of the fun, and you’re never more than a couple of minutes away from a clever touch. Unlike, say, the high-concept mystery musical City of Angels, it never quite adds up to more than the sum of its parts. However, it’s a delight to see performers give it such welly. O’Reilly and Denia prove both deft and daft as each wrings as much as they can from this daffy murder mystery with a constant risk of corpsing.

2/9/2022,"Good morning. Former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins will make a speech at the National Press Club today with former Australian of the Year Grace Tame, following Scott Morrison’s apology for the “terrible things” that happened in parliament workplaces yesterday. Families separated by Australia’s strict travel restrictions are counting down the days to long-anticipated reunions when the country’s border opens after almost two years on 21 February. The border rules have been progressively relaxed since November but some groups remained cut off from exemption-free travel. While there’s hope for families, many Australians could still be waiting months for international parcel deliveries. Some countries with strict Covid quarantine rules, such as China and Hong Kong, may not initially have enough passengers to support freight-carrying passenger flights, according to industry experts.  The Coalition has been accused of “hiding negligence” by refusing to release a major report into the state of the care workforce in Australia it has had since September. The national skills commissioner, Adam Boyton, undertook an “in-depth study on the factors affecting the supply and demand of care workers” and delivered the final report to the employment minister, Stuart Robert, in September. The government is yet to formally respond. The Health Services Union secretary, Gerard Hayes, called for the report to be made public saying “the government can’t keep hiding its negligence on wages and training”. Emmanuel Macron says he has received personal assurances from Vladimir Putin that Russia would not worsen the crisis over Ukraine after a whirlwind diplomatic mission to Moscow and Kyiv on Tuesday. But Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was sceptical about his Russian counterpart’s apparent commitment to peace. “I do not really trust words. I believe that every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps,” Zelenskiy said. Scott Morrison has secured the support of the Coalition party room for amendments to the government’s religious discrimination bill that only partially protect gay students and overlook trans students entirely. Labor MP Stephen Jones gave a powerful speech to parliament on Tuesday while debating the bill, paying tribute to his gay nephew who took his own life recently. “The thing that every parent of every gay or trans kid knows is that the love and protection that we provide for them inside our homes and families is not enough.” Former foreign affairs minister Alexander Downer privately boasted that Timor-Leste was an “open book” to the Australian government in the year 2000, well before the infamous bugging scandal revealed by Witness K, a tribunal has heard. A journalism academy set up by News Corp Australia and former foe Google Australia at a university business school has angered academics who say the move is “reflection of antagonism News Corp has for university journalism”. Conservationists claim the Queensland government acted with a lack of urgency after water and gas were found bubbling “uncontrolled” from former exploration bores near Chinchilla. A dispute between neighbours involving the use of leaf blowers, 17 CCTV cameras and an easement quickly grew “out of all proportion” and has ended up in a New South Wales court. Two suspected Islamic State recruits, one of them carrying a British passport, were seized by the Taliban when they tried to slip into Afghanistan last autumn through its northern border, the Guardian can reveal. Chagos Islanders exiled from their homeland by the UK government 50 years ago are heading to the remote archipelago on a Mauritian-chartered survey ship without British supervision for the first time. Victims have lamented a lost opportunity for healing as former Pope Benedict has acknowledged errors in his handling of sexual abuse and asked for forgiveness but his lawyers argued he was not directly to blame. A gay kiss caught on a live news report, evading Singapore’s ban on LGBT content, has been hailed as “act of revolution”. This year’s Oscar nominations have been announced, with The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s Montana-set drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a threatening rancher, leading the pack, nominated for a dozen prizes. “The Academy has responded to the classic quality of The Power of the Dog: the way it speaks to US culture and history and positions itself unambiguously in the heartland, but a heartland coloured and contorted by anger and sadness,” writes Peter Bradshaw. See the full list of nominations here. A collective of Aboriginal photographers working across different styles launches this week. Formed by Michael Jalaru Torres, Blak Lens aims to provide support for talented photographers across Australia, building a professional and cultural network to amplify each other’s work and to change perceptions. Check out our gallery with a selection of some of the work from Blak Lens photographers. Michelle Brasier has a knack for making sad things very funny. Her last musical comedy show, Average Bear, was about living in the shadow of hereditary illness – a family history of cancer means that Brasier has a 97% chance of developing the disease that claimed the lives of her father and brother. Her history of loss has left Brasier with a conflicted relationship to physical objects. She tells us why she is afraid of holding on to sentimental items, as well as the story of a few significant personal belongings. How did the Northern Territory lose control of Covid? Aboriginal organisations have labelled the government response a “catastrophic failure” as cases in the NT hit a record high. However, the chief minister, Michael Gunner, says the territory’s response “remains the best in the world”. In this episode of Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam about what went wrong in the Northern Territory.

2/9/2022,"My friend Adrian Reith, who has died aged 66 of oesophageal cancer, was a radio advertising executive who later founded Street Child United, a charity harnessing football to promote the rights of street children. Born in Southwick, West Sussex, the youngest child of Elisabeth (nee Walkey), a nursing sister, and the Rev Ivor Reith, a clergyman, Adrian lived in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) until the age of eight. On the family’s return to Britain, his evangelical parents sent him to Christ’s Hospital boarding school in Horsham.  In 1974 he went to Delhi, where he worked in the Dilaram Community, helping western travellers who had become drug addicts on the hippy trail. Later he moved to a similar community in Heidebeek, in the Netherlands. On his return to the UK in 1977 he became art director on a children’s film, Tanglewoods’ Secret. In 1979 Adrian began working in advertising for Capital Radio and Hobo Radio. With Ian Mactavish, in 1987 he became co-owner of Commercial Breaks advertising agency, based in Soho, London, where he wrote and directed commercials for companies including Guinness, Carphone Warehouse and HMV. Seven years later Adrian and Ian established Jungle, which became a leading post-production recording studio for TV and radio advertising. In 1989, Adrian married Judy Williams, a coach and writer; they settled in Cambridge and had three daughters. Adrian left advertising in 2006 to become a life coach. The following year Adrian, Judy and their daughters were among four families who travelled for a month to South Africa with a UK-based charity, the Amos Trust, to see a project, Umthombo, run by former street children and a charismatic English surfer, Tom Hewitt, reintegrating undocumented street children with their families. Playing beach football with these youngsters proved an epiphany for Adrian. In the months following the visit, in conversations between Adrian and others, the idea of a football world cup for street children emerged. Adrian persuaded the Amos Trust to back this vision. The first Street Child Football World Cup took place in Durban in 2010, promoting birth registration, access to education, protection from violence and gender equality; it was endorsed by David Beckham, Prince William and Pope Francis. The tournament now takes place in the host country of every football World Cup a few months before the main event. A Street Child Cricket World Cup is being planned in India in 2023. Street Child United is now an independent charity. With Judy, Adrian wrote a book, Act 3: The Art of Growing Older (2020), trying to inspire those over 50 to reimagine their lives. They also gave Guardian Masterclasses on the subject. Adrian was still delivering life coaching when he became ill in early 2021. He is survived by Judy, their children, Phoebe, Tilly and Rosie, and his sisters, Meriel and Angela.",News/Society,Adrian Reith obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/08/adrian-reith-obituary
2/9/2022,"A PhD student has expressed her sadness in court over what she claims was “intimidation” from transgender rights activists at her university. Raquel Rosario Sánchez has launched civil action claiming the University of Bristol failed to protect her from harassment and bullying over her involvement with the campaign group Woman’s Place UK.  Bristol civil and family justice centre heard how the student notified the Russell Group university on 1 February 2018 that she wanted to make a complaint about “malicious rumours” she said were being spread about her. The court heard that activists had protested against a talk by Rosario Sánchez ahead of her hosting it, labelling her a “Terf” (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and claiming she was “spreading hate about trans people”. Rosario Sánchez said: “I just felt very sad because I just want to live my life, go to campus and go to my centre and not have to face intimidation. In March 2018, I thought I was going to get that, but now knowing how long this has taken is making me sad.” The district judge Alexander Ralton told the court he would assess whether the university handled the conflict between Rosario Sánchez and the activists correctly, and would not be making a judgment about gender rights. He said: “Some might regard proceedings as about trans rights and feminist rights, but the proceedings are not about that. This case is about Bristol University’s handling of conflict. I am sure counsel would say it’s a lot more complicated than that, and indeed it is, but this is the heart of the matter.” Rosario Sánchez began her PhD course at the University of Bristol in January 2018. A Woman’s Place UK describes its aim as “to end to violence, harassment and abuse of women and girls”. Critics argue that the campaign seeks to limit trans people’s rights and dismisses the validity of some trans people’s gender identity. On a crowdfunding page set up to raise money for her legal battle, Rosario Sánchez describes herself as a “feminist writer, campaigner and researcher”. In a blogpost written ahead of the hearing, she claimed: “Ideological puritans staffing the university’s diversity and inclusion office have sought to erase virtually any term that communicates the reality of female biology.” She said a whistleblower at the university told her she had been reported to human resources for saying: “You have to have a uterus to give birth.” A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Ms Rosario Sánchez has chosen to take legal action against the university. Given this, we will not comment further. All concerns about harassment or bullying are taken seriously and action taken in accordance with our university policies. If staff or students have concerns or complaints, we encourage them to raise them directly with us. “We are committed to making our university a place where all feel safe, welcomed and respected, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability or social background.” The trial is due to last for five days.",News/UK news,Bristol student tells court she faced ‘intimidation’ from trans rights activists,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/bristol-student-tells-court-she-faced-intimidation-from-trans-rights-activists
