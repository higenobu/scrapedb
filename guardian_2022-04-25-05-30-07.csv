4/25/2022,"Anzac Day, marking the anniversary of the landing of Australian and New Zealand troops on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915, has long been a day for many New Zealanders to reflect on their country’s involvement in wars. But until recently the wars commemorated were exclusively foreign ones, not those fought closer to home, on Aotearoa’s own shores. In recent years that has begun to change, as many non-Māori also come to learn about and acknowledge the 19th-century New Zealand wars fought between the crown and various Māori communities between 1843 and 1872 – defining conflicts for land and sovereignty whose consequences continue to be felt today in multiple ways. How Pākehā (European) New Zealanders have engaged with this “difficult” history has undergone radical transformation since the last shots were fired. In the early 20th century a burst of nostalgia for the pioneering period saw the New Zealand wars reframed as chivalrous and heroic conflicts between two worthy foes. In this mythologised version of the wars, mutual respect forged on the battlefield sowed the seeds for future harmony. New Zealand had the “best race relations in the world” because of these wars, so the story went. Many of the 50th-anniversary events held during this period were even described as “celebrations”. That imagined narrative, reflected in films, books and elsewhere, endured for much of the 20th century. A similar approach was still evident in the 1960s, when the centenary of many of the major conflicts were commemorated. But the dominant Pākehā version of this history had never been widely shared by Māori. It was hard to feel nostalgic about events from the past where your own ancestors had been killed, your lands taken, your economy destroyed and future generations condemned to lives of poverty as a result. While Pākehā publicly celebrated, many Māori continued to privately grieve. By the 1970s more forceful Māori voices, combined with powerful revisionist accounts of this history, had all but discredited the dominant Pākehā interpretation of the past. It was no longer acceptable to celebrate the New Zealand wars. The problem was that no new narrative of the wars emerged, or at least none that gained widespread Pākehā acceptance, and so we were left with a kind of uncomfortable silence. When that was challenged in various ways, such as in The Governor, a highly ambitious and ultra-expensive six-part drama series about the life and career of Sir George Grey that screened on TV One in 1977, significant controversy arose. From the perspective of many Pākehā, it was easier just to forget the New Zealand wars had ever happened. The paltry crown funding and support for many of the 150th-anniversary commemorations of the battles of the New Zealand wars over the past decade stood in marked contrast with the lavish ceremonies and events staged to mark the centenary of Gallipoli in 2015 and various other first world war conflicts. That left some observers to wonder why Pākehā New Zealanders could not get enough of foreign wars but seemingly went out of their way to deliberately forget those fought closer to home. What would it take to remember these wars? Gallipoli and other overseas conflicts provide a ready opportunity to rally around the flag, instilling warm and fuzzy feelings of patriotism. So much so that occasionally there are calls for Waitangi Day to be replaced by Anzac Day as New Zealand’s national day. Whereas Anzac Day is perceived as a straightforward celebration of heroic sacrifice and other desirable national traits, the Waitangi anniversary is seen by many Pākehā as divisive, complicating efforts to celebrate the nation through awkward reminders of a more troubled past. But the purpose of remembering our past, warts and all, in an honest and upfront manner has never been about making anyone feel guilty or ashamed about the actions of their ancestors. It has not been about creating discord or division but rather binding us together as a nation that can honestly confront its own past. That is not and has never been about assigning blame. It is just about taking ownership of our history. Fortunately, there has been progress on this front in recent years. Thanks to the efforts of rangatahi (young people) especially, a national day of commemoration for the New Zealand wars is now held each year on 28 October; a new history curriculum to be introduced in 2023 will for the first time ensure all students leave school with some basic awareness of the history of their own country; and even Anzac Day has become more inclusive of these internal conflicts. These are all positive steps on the path towards a more historically aware, engaged and mature Aotearoa.

4/25/2022,"With eight minutes to go in a petty and ill-tempered Merseyside derby, Michael Keane received a pass in his own penalty area. Normally Keane is a pretty decent ball-playing centre-half, with the ability to advance out of defence and spring quick attacks. But then, very little about his afternoon had been normal. Keane’s sole job here was to destroy: to clear crosses and then boot the ball as far away as possible. He completed three passes all afternoon. And so as Dele Alli rolled the ball casually towards him you could see a certain horror rising in him, the flustered panic of a man who had absolutely not prepared for this turn of events. With red shirts hunting him down, Keane simply fled towards the sanctuary of his own corner flag, gingerly carrying the ball with him as if it were a leaking bin bag. Still, when you are in a relegation fight, sometimes the ends justify the means. Sometimes you just have to sit deep, make it ugly, and make sure you only lose 2-0 with 17% possession. And as Liverpool ploughed on in pursuit of the Premier League title, it was hard not to feel a certain small pity for their opponents, who came with a plan, executed it perfectly, and still ended up comfortably beaten. Everton tried everything to derail Liverpool here, except play football. But then, when the other team is so lavishly and embarrassingly better than you, perhaps the only tactic left is to take the football out of the equation entirely. When you are leaking goals from all directions, perhaps there is little point in coming here and playing like Graham Potter’s Brighton. Everton essentially conceived this game in two dimensions: time and irritation, and for an hour at a restive and restless Anfield it looked tantalisingly as if they might get what they came for. There was grappling and timewasting, bawling and brawling, diving and pratfalling. Richarlison seemed to spend most of the game lying on the ground like a cow preparing for a rainstorm. Jordan Pickford deliberated over his goal-kicks as if he was choosing a mortgage. There were chances too, particularly for the sprightly Anthony Gordon on the left wing, and with a little more luck and a more amenable referee they could quite conceivably have pulled off an almighty upset. It was callous and cynical and – for all the grousing of the Anfield crowd – darkly brilliant in its own way. There was plenty of tactical intelligence on show too, from the way Abdoulaye Doucouré shackled Thiago Alcântara to the way Gordon and Vitalii Mykolenko double-teamed Mohamed Salah. As a fuming Liverpool worked the ball around in unsatisfying semicircles Everton were resolutely winning the numbers game. You can try decoy runners, you can try quick switches, you can feint and shimmy in an attempt to move defenders out of position. But none of it really works if they’re not actually going anywhere. Fortunately, Jürgen Klopp had a contingency. In case of emergency: break glass for Divock Origi. With 30 minutes left the Belgian trotted on for his sixth Premier League appearance of the season and almost immediately his directness helped conjure the breakthrough for Andrew Robertson: holding off Allan and laying the ball off for Salah to cross. And so, with their blueprint in tatters, Everton finally deployed Plan B. On came Alli and Salomón Rondón. Frank Lampard urged his defensive line higher up the pitch, a command which was heeded only gingerly. Mason Holgate, in particular, crossed the halfway line as if it were the 38th parallel into North Korea. But with five minutes remaining Origi claimed another goal against his favourite opponents, the latest milestone in a Liverpool career that essentially consists of a handful of unforgettable moments and a hell of a lot of post-match warm-downs. Finally, the Kop felt secure enough to break out the “going down” chants that had not been heard since the first 20 minutes. And for all Everton’s sweat and sacrifice, no points and no goals, and the very real threat of a first relegation in 71 years. These things happen, of course, and need not be disastrous. Villarreal were relegated a decade ago and are now in a Champions League semi-final. Schalke and Werder Bremen are currently in the second tier of the Bundesliga and are poised to bounce straight back. But given their size and means, the £561m spent in transfer fees since Farhad Moshiri’s takeover – more than Liverpool, both in total and net outlay – an Everton relegation would surely be one of the most spectacular fiascos in the modern history of football. And really, the scale of their plight was illustrated by the smallness of their gameplan, a full-on spoiling exercise that was still only good enough for an hour’s respite. Right now this is where Everton are, and this is who they are. In a way, their approach here was a rejoinder to Liverpool’s growing indifference, a determination to meet apathy with antipathy. You will notice us again. You will hate us again. But when will they next meet again? The next four weeks will provide all the answers.",Sport/Football,Everton execute cynical Anfield plan perfectly but still comfortably lose | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/24/everton-execute-cynical-anfield-plan-perfectly-but-still-comfortably-lose
4/25/2022,"Frank Lampard claimed Everton were denied a blatant penalty at Anfield where a 2-0 defeat by Liverpool left his club in the relegation zone for the first time since December 2019. Liverpool maintained their title challenge with second-half headers from Andy Robertson and the substitute Divock Origi but had to overcome an obstinate Everton. In the 53rd minute, with the game goalless, Anthony Gordon went down in the Liverpool penalty area under an apparent push by Joël Matip. He retweeted footage of the incident along with two emojis expressing his disbelief. The referee, Stuart Attwell, who had booked Gordon for diving in the first half, awarded neither a spot‑kick nor a second yellow card. “It is a penalty for me,” said Lampard, who has lost all seven away matches as Everton manager. “You don’t get them here. If that was Mo Salah at the other end he gets a penalty. I’m not trying to create conflict; it’s just the reality of football. I have played in teams in the top half of the league – you get them. That was a penalty for sure. It’s a clear foul.” Everton, who dropped into the bottom three after Burnley beat Wolves, have six games remaining to avoid a first relegation since 1951. Lampard insisted his players could take heart from their Anfield display: “It was a good performance against a difficult opponent. You have seen their recent games – we had to have a plan to stop them getting space and for 60 minutes we did that as well as you can. We did it with great discipline and created the best chances until that point. But a moment of brilliance from Mo Salah and an overhead kick [from Luis Díaz to set up the second goal] are difficult to combat.” Jürgen Klopp reserved praise for Origi after the striker’s sixth goal against Everton secured a victory that took Liverpool back to within a point of Manchester City at the top. The Liverpool manager said: “He is a legend on and off the pitch. He is a fantastic footballer for me, and I know it sounds ridiculous as I don’t line him up often, he is a world-class striker. He is our best finisher definitely. He always was and everybody would say the same. “When you see him do these kind of things in training, then you see the quality of the squad and other players and it’s really hard I imagine [for him]. “I have really hard decisions to make because the boys all want to contribute and are responsible for the situation we are in. “Everybody loves Div and rightly so. He was again very decisive. I’m very, very happy for him.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard says Everton denied a clear penalty against Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/frank-lampard-says-everton-denied-a-clear-penalty-against-liverpool
