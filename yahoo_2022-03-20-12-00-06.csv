3/20/2022,"A group of film, television and music industry figures, among them The Matrix: Resurrections producer Grant Hill, Oscar-winning director Stefan Ruzowitzky (The Counterfeiters) and Rammstein frontman Till Lindemann, have signed a petition condemning Vladimir Putin’s “war of aggression” in Ukraine and calling for an immediate end to the conflict. What sets the petition, posted on Change.org Friday, apart from dozens of similar calls from industry players large and small since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, is the group’s deliberately pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian stance.

And we love Ukraine and the people of Ukraine!” the petition begins. The group says it stands behind the people of Ukraine “who are defending their independence and young democracy” but also pays tribute to “everyone in Russia who has the courage to protest against the war” in the face of the Russian government’s brutal crackdown on dissent within the country. Since the start of the war, there has been a call among many in the international film and television industry to broadly sanction both Russia and Russian artists. In addition to a broad entertainment economy boycott — virtually every major film and TV company, including all the studios, Netflix, the BBC, ITV and others, have paused or stopped doing business in or with Russia — several industry bodies, including the European Film Academy, the Polish Film Institute and every official film organization in Ukraine, have demanded an all-out ban on Russian cinema. Among the initial signatories to the petition are DDA agency founder Dennis Davidson, German actors Anna Loos (The Weissensee Saga) and Jan Josef Liefers (Tatort), the French-Polish actress Elisabeth Duda (La Belle Époque), Cloud Atlas producer Alexander van Dülmen and Austrian actress Susanne Wuest (Goodnight Mommy). Europe’s major film festivals have taken a middle road. Cannes has barred the presence of any Russian government delegations at its festival but said it will not boycott movies by Russian directors. Berlin on Wednesday took a similar stance, saying it will ban official Russian state institutions and delegations as well as “supporting actors of the regime” from participating in the Berlinale “as long as the Russian government is waging this cruel war against Ukraine,” but drawing the line at banning Russian filmmakers, saying to do so would “suppress many critical voices” of the Putin government.

3/20/2022,"In Russia's latest swipe at foreign social media giants since it started a land war in Europe by invading Ukraine late last month, the country's internet censor has fired a warning shot at Google over what it describes as anti-Russian ""information attacks"" which it claims are being spread via YouTube -- accusing the U.S. tech giant of being engaged in acts ""of a terrorist nature"" by allowing ads on the video-sharing platform to be used to threaten Russian citizens. In a statement posted on its website today, Roskomnadzor claims YouTube has been serving targeted ads that call for people to disable railway links between Russia and Belarus. ""The actions of the YouTube administration are of a terrorist nature and threaten the life and health of Russian citizens,"" the regulator wrote [translated from Russian with machine translation]. ""The spread of such appeals clearly demonstrates the anti-Russian position of the American company Google LLC,"" it added. The regulator also warned Google to stop distributing ""anti-Russian videos as soon as possible"". Its statement goes on to accuse U.S. IT companies in general, and tech giants Google and Meta (Facebook's owner) in particular, of choosing a ""path of confrontation"" with Russia by launching a targeted campaign of ""information attacks"" that it says are intended to ""discredit the Russian Armed Forces, the media, public figures and the state as a whole"". ""Similar actions by Meta Platforms Inc. and Google LLC not only violate Russian law but also contradict generally accepted norms of morality,"" Roskomnadzor added. YouTube could not immediately be reached for comment on the warning from Roskomnadzor. The direct warning to Google from the state internet censor could be a precursor to Russia blocking access to YouTube. In recent days, Facebook and Instagram have both been blocked by Roskomnadzor -- as the Kremlin has sought to tighten its grip on the digital information sphere in parallel with its war in Ukraine. Facebook and Instagram were blocked after Meta said it was relaxing its hate speech policy to allow users in certain regions to post certain kinds of death threats aimed at Russia -- which Meta global affairs president, Nick Clegg, defended as a temporary change he said was designed to protect ""people’s rights to speech as an expression of self-defense"". In recent weeks, Roskomnadzor has also put restrictions on Twitter. But YouTube has escaped any major censorship since the Ukraine invasion, despite the company itself applying some limitations to its service in Russia -- such as suspending payment services for users (it took that action as a result of Western sanctions against Russian banks). In one signal that that could be about to change, a report in Russian press today suggests a block is looming, citing sources close to Roskomnadzor who told it YouTube could be blocked as soon as today or next week. RIA Novosti's sources told it a block of YouTube is ""most likely"" by the end of next week. In what may be another small indicator of the cyber war that's now fiercely raging between Russia and Ukraine, Roskomnadzor's website was noticeably slow to load as we were filing this report today. It also appears to have introduced a CAPTCHA request -- suggesting it may be trying to prevent and/or mitigate DDoS attacks.
