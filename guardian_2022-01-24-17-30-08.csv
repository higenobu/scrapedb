1/24/2022,"“The peoples of the Earth,” Henry Morgenthau said, “are inseparably linked by a deep underlying community of purpose.” In July 1944, Morgenthau, the US Treasury secretary, was closing the Bretton Woods conference with a reflection on extreme nationalism and the failures of cooperation that had led to war. Cautioning against the pursuit of national interest through “the plan-less, senseless rivalry that divided us”, he outlined an accord for new institutions grounded in an appeal to shared humanity.  Reading Morgenthau’s speech today is a jolting reminder of how a generation of political leaders sought to remake the world. The institutional architecture – the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and what became the World Trade Organization – that emerged from Bretton Woods may have been deeply flawed. But this was an attempt to underpin through practical financial and monetary cooperation the human rights and freedoms envisaged in the UN charter. Today we need institutions equipped to rise to the great challenges posed by Covid-19, poverty and the climate crisis. Yet political leaders gripped by vaccine nationalism, climate nationalism and economic nationalism are manifestly lacking the “community of purpose” their citizens and the world need in this moment of crisis. Nowhere are the failures more starkly evident than in the financial response to the pandemic. When Covid-19 struck, governments in rich countries acted decisively to contain the social and economic impacts. Fiscal rulebooks were torn up and monetary orthodoxies abandoned. Even the most conservative finance ministers responded to the crisis like Keynesians on public finance steroids. According to the IMF, economic stimulus measures equivalent to about one-quarter of GDP were implemented. Contrasts with lower-income countries could not be more striking. Most were unable to muster more than 1-2% of GDP in increased public spending, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected and economies trapped in a downward spiral. Recession magnified pre-pandemic debt problems, leaving more than half of low-income countries either in, or at risk of, debt distress. Amid the public health crisis triggered by the pandemic, 43 lower-income countries were left spending more on debt than public health. The financing disparities have fuelled what some commentators have described as a Great Divergence. While rich countries have all but recovered the economic ground lost during the pandemic, average incomes in the poorest countries will remain below pre-pandemic levels until mid-decade. Meanwhile, budget austerity is reinforcing inequalities within countries as vital public services are cut. The human consequences have been devastating. Progress towards the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) has been thrown into reverse. The number of people in poverty has increased by more than 90 million. Two decades of progress towards universal health coverage have ground to a halt, raising the spectre of setbacks in child survival and maternal health. Malnutrition is rising. Disruption to education systems could leave 70% of children in the poorest countries in “learning poverty”, lacking the skills they need to escape their circumstances. It would be folly for citizens in rich countries to imagine they will be immune to the instability and insecurity that will accompany these reversals. Yet their governments have responded with a trickle of increased aid, which gives new meaning to the phrase “too little, too late”, and a conservative approach to the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions. To be fair, the World Bank and IMF have demonstrated leadership. Commitments for the poorest countries under the bank’s International Development Association (IDA) rose by a fifth in 2021, to $36bn (£27bn). The IMF has scaled up its programmes, underwriting a surge in emergency financing, and providing $14bn in zero-interest loans to poor countries. The fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, navigated a new $650bn allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) – a central bank reserve asset – through the G20. None of which is enough. Financing from the World Bank and regional development banks will provide limited protection against the fiscal retrenchment now in prospect. IMF loans are short-term and must be repaid. Under current allocation rules, two-thirds of the new SDRs will be allocated to rich countries that don’t need them. In effect, we are fighting an SDG forest fire with financial water pistols. The IMF estimates that low-income countries alone will need an additional $550bn to get back on an accelerated recovery pathway. Meanwhile, recession and human development reversals have increased the SDG financing gap by 70% to about $4.2tn, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – and that’s without the additional $1tn needed to finance a green energy transition in developing countries. The time has come to reimagine a development financing system. More could – and should – be done on aid. The UK’s retreat on that front, most recently in slashing support for the IDA, has been profoundly harmful. But aid cannot substitute an international public finance system aligned to the SDG ambition. The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) should be deployed far more aggressively. Less risk-averse approaches to capital adequacy and modest increases in finance would enable MDBs to triple their lending portfolios to more than $1.3tn, helping to unlock the private finance for a green recovery and deliver investment in global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness. In a period of low interest rates, this is a no-brainer. So why is the G20 endlessly reviewing options instead of acting? The new allocation of SDRs has opened up opportunities now at risk of being squandered. Rich countries do not need the $433bn in additional reserves bestowed on their central bank balance sheets through the IMF. Recycling the SDRs through multilateral banks or other mechanisms could provide developing countries with the liquidity and finance they need to support an SDG recovery and a green transition. Debt relief is critical. If there is one lesson from the 1980s, it is that delayed action on debt is the route to a lost decade of development. With IDA countries scheduled to pay $35bn in debt servicing this year, much of it to private creditors, there is an urgent need to convert unpayable debts into investments in health, education and safety nets. The IMF and World Bank should now be equipped to buy back unsustainable commercial debts at a hefty discount. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, once dismissed the argument that Britain had reached the limits of affordable social provision with a simple rejoinder: “Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” As an international community we can afford to deliver on the SDGs and prevent climate catastrophe. What we can’t afford is the alternative.

1/24/2022,"Moments after Josh Allen’s 19-yard strike to Gabriel Davis deep in the fourth quarter, television crews cut to the quarterback’s family celebrating in a box at Arrowhead. The Bills led 36-33 and the champagne was about to be popped. Tears of joy streamed down Joel Allen’s face as he watched his son, who was having a perfect postseason, punch his ticket to the AFC Championship. Or so we thought.  Then the Allen family had to sit through the most excruciating 13 seconds of their lives. CBS’s Tony Romo actually joked about the improbability of what was to come, “What can Patrick Mahomes do with 13 seconds left? Probably nothing. [Pause] But maybe something…” Maybe something was right because thanks to his immense skill and Buffalo’s inexplicably bad prevent defense, Mahomes had two quick completions, the first a 19-yard pass to Tyreek Hill, followed by a 25-yard dart to Travis Kelce. In marched Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker to knock through a 49-yard field goal with no time in regulation remaining. 36-36. Buffalo were stunned. Arrowhead was deafening. Kelce later explained how he and his quarterback freestyled on the completion: “I told [Mahomes] I’m probably not going to run the route that’s called and I was going to run to the open area. And in his cadence he was yelling to me, ‘Do it! Do it!” Again, the Bills coaching staff are going to have a lot of regrets when they evaluate film of those final 13 seconds. And Bills fans will wonder why the team didn’t try a squib kick after scoring their final touchdown, something that would have taken vital seconds off the clock (instead, Tyler Bass’s touchback saved the Chiefs valuable time). Butker’s field goal was the culmination of perhaps the most exhilarating two minutes the NFL has ever produced. Yes, there were bad defensive calls from both teams. But above all, it was Allen and Mahomes showing every inch of their talent and heart, the best v the best. In the two-minute span, there were three lead changes and a tie. Twenty-five points scored. The quarterbacks combined for 221 passing yards and three touchdowns in the same period. Bills wideout Gabriel Davis, until Sunday barely known outside Buffalo, became a household name – he finished the game with 201 receiving yards and four touchdowns, an NFL postseason record. Mahomes made magical throws from every angle. Allen did the same and picked up a litany of first downs using his legs. Patrick Mahomes v Josh Allen is now the most compelling quarterback rivalry in football and will be for years to come. Allen finished the day with 329 passing yards and four touchdowns, Mahomes with 378 passing yards and three touchdowns. Neither quarterback threw an interception. But it will be those final moments that will define this epic duel. To recap a two-minute span like no other: 1:54 remaining. Allen to Davis on a 27-yard touchdown (two-point conversion is good): Bills 29-26 Chiefs 1:02 remaining. Mahomes to Tyreek Hill on a 64-yard touchdown (extra point good): Bills 29-33 Chiefs 13 seconds remaining. Allen to Davis on a 19-yard touchdown (extra point good): Bills 36-33 Chiefs 0:00 remaining. Butker’s 49-yard field goal is good. Bills 36-36 Chiefs Then there was overtime. If we learned anything from the final two minutes of regulation it was that the winner of the coin toss was marching down the field and winning the game. Kansas City got the ball and lo and behold, Mahomes led his teammates against an exhausted Bills defense, found Kelce in the end zone and voila, the Chiefs will host the AFC Championship for the fourth consecutive year. The NFL overtime rules, under which the team that receive the ball can win with a touchdown, will be under much scrutiny this offseason. It was a travesty to deprive Allen the opportunity to match Mahomes point for point just because a coin landed on the wrong side for the Bills. But that’s a debate for another day. For now we should sit back and thank the football gods for a phenomenal divisional weekend topped off by a Bills-Chiefs classic. How much longer do we have to wait for these two powerhouses – and these two brilliant quarterbacks – to meet in the playoffs again? Matthew Stafford, quarterback, Los Angeles Rams. OK, this should be a joint one for Mahomes and Allen but it would be a shame not to discuss Sunday’s earlier game. Sean McVay wasn’t going down without a fight. The tide had taken a drastic turn for the Rams, who had let a 27-3 lead evaporate in the second half against Tom Brady and the Buccaneers. McVay’s playcalling was timid. There were fumbles and a high snap that went awry. Meanwhile, Brady was doing what he’s done so often. He was laser-focused on destroying the soul of his opponent. But with 35 seconds remaining, McVay wasn’t messing around. He dialed up consecutive Stafford passes to Cooper Kupp, first a 20-yarder followed by the nail-in-the-coffin, a perfectly placed 44-yard strike to Cupp who had blown by safety Antoine Winfield. Gay knocked through the 30-yarder to send Los Angeles back home to host the NFC Championship. Stafford, who was almost flawless in the first half, threw for 366 yards, knocked off the Super Bowl champs, and is headed back to LA where his team will host the NFC Championship against the 49ers. “Lots of decisions to be made. I don’t want to be part of a rebuild if I’m going to keep playing.” – Aaron Rodgers following Green Bay’s 13-10 loss to San Francisco Rodgers’ season may have abruptly ended but that doesn’t mean we’ll get a break from nonstop chatter about where he goes from here. Rodgers has his ticket out of Green Bay in the form of a restructured deal last summer that saves the team $20m if he’s traded before June 2022. The Packers are about to be $44m over the salary cap, leaving the future of many key players – including Davante Adams who will be a free agent and command a massive paycheck – in doubt. Despite the off-the-field distractions this season, Rodgers is still an elite quarterback whose departure would command high draft picks at the very least, and put the Packers in a strong position to rebuild. (Not to mention a notable reduction in stress.) But there’s also a disparity in success between the regular and postseason versions of Rodgers. That the 38-year-old Rodgers has only played in one Super Bowl at this point in his career is underachieving at its finest, from both the player and his team. Perhaps he’ll have better luck in Pittsburgh, Denver or New Orleans. What an authentic moment of joy between Robbie Gould and Jimmy Garoppolo following the 49ers’ dramatic win at a snow-covered Lambeau Field. In the video, captured by NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales, Garoppolo called Gould “a fucking legend.” Hard to argue with the quarterback’s assessment given that Gould is now 20-for-20 on field goals in the postseason, including Saturday’s game-winner. Garoppolo also let out an audible curse directed at the Packers. The emotions were perhaps not surprising from a quarterback raised in Illinois and a kicker who played 11 seasons in Chicago. More ice from Gould: Robbie Gould does not care about your player introductions pic.twitter.com/xL2wKFBACF 9. The Tennessee Titans pass rush was ready for its close-up, sacking Joe Burrow nine times. Defensive end Jeffery Simmons was unstoppable, collecting three sacks. Yet the Titans still lost 19-16. Racking up nine sacks in a playoff game and still losing is not an easy feat; in fact, the Titans are the first team since the 1970 merger to earn the honor. But when Ryan Tannehill throws an interception on his first pass of the game, his first of the second half, and his last of the season, it’s a scenario that starts making more sense. The Bengals weren’t exactly offensive juggernauts but the final 32 seconds was a masterclass in clutch. A Logan Wilson interception. A 19-yard pass from Burrow to Ja’Marr Chase that set up the game-winning field goal. Evan McPherson nailing the 52-yarder. It’s on to the AFC Championship for Cincinnati. -- Tom Brady’s future will now take centerstage after an ESPN report suggested the 44-year-old is mulling his future. Brady was non-committal when asked about his future following the Bucs’ loss to the Rams on Sunday: “I haven’t put a lot of thought into it. I’ll just take it day by day. And we’ll see.” -- Bengals defensive tackle DJ Reader had a spectacular performance shutting down Derrick Henry and the Titans rushing game all day. When he wasn’t creating space for the linebackers, he was making tackles of his own. After the game, Reader spoke about a recurring theme for his team whose motto has been Why Not Us. “We’ve been getting slept on the whole year. It’s something we take pride for in this locker room. We take it as disrespect every time.” -- When San Francisco beat the Rams in a Week 18 thriller, SoFi Stadium looked and sounded like a 49ers home game. The Rams are trying to prevent a repeat in the NFC Championship game by restricting ticket sales. I’m sure no one will figure out a workaround.

1/24/2022,"Icame across this recipe in Anna Del Conte’s memoirs, Risotto with Nettles. Now, there are so many recipes I could borrow from her, and many I have, but this is the one I have to show you here. She introduces it as “hardly a recipe, but I wanted to include it because I haven’t as yet found a child who doesn’t like it”. The minute I read its title – once I’d got over my crossness that she hadn’t told me about it during many years of friendship – I was charmed. Of course it helps that, being a Marmite-addict, I knew it would work. And how it does. I have recently turned traitor and shifted towards the Vegemite side of the world, and this works as well, unsurprisingly, with the antipodean ointment. I know the combination of pasta and Marmite sounds odd to the point of unfeasibility, but wait a moment. There is a traditional day-after-the-roast pasta dish, in which spaghetti is tossed in chicken stock, and I have eaten shortcut versions of this in Italy (recreated guiltlessly in my own kitchen) which use a crumbled stock cube, along with some butter, olive oil, chopped rosemary and a little of the pasta cooking water to make a flavoursome sauce for spaghetti. If you think about it, Marmite offers saltiness and savouriness the way a stock cube might.  I’m glad this recipe is here, and I thank Anna for it. But even when it’s not an Anna-recipe, I think of her whenever I cook pasta, remembering her two ordinances: one, that the water you cook pasta in should be as salty as the Mediterranean; and two, that pasta should not be too officiously drained, but rather be “con la goccia”, that’s to say with some cooking water still clinging to it, as this makes it easier to incorporate the sauce. It was she who taught me to scoop out some of the cooking water just before draining the pasta, to help the sauce amalgamate later if necessary.

1/24/2022,"As Boris Johnson and the Conservative party anxiously tread political water while repeatedly being pulled under by strife and disgrace, two plotlines are unfolding. One is about the immediate moment, and will reach another key juncture with the imminent report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, which may finally focus wavering Tory minds on the impossibility of the prime minister’s position. Meanwhile, amid new allegations of blackmail, rumours of yet more illicit gatherings and Dominic Raab’s characteristically clever insistence that his boss is “like a seasoned prizefighter” who has “taken some knocks”, another story is in danger of being lost: the dire implications of Johnson’s antics for people’s trust in politics, and a gap between Westminster and the country that may now be bigger than ever. All those Downing Street and Whitehall parties – along with the prime minister’s evasions, half-apologies and desperate attempts to shore himself up – have been reported in terms of shock-horror revelation. But for many voters, they will confirm longstanding ideas about the kind of people who run the country, or aspire to.  In 1944, about a third of Britons endorsed the idea that MPs and ministers were merely “out for themselves”, but late last year that figure was put at 63%. According to pollsters and academics, the first phase of the pandemic saw political distrust briefly fall before it reverted to pre-pandemic levels. They may have dutifully followed the government’s rules and restrictions, but millions of people evidently have much the same view of politics and power as ever: either indifference or a tendency to outrage and a readiness – fair or not – to assume the worst of politicians, whichever party they represent. The real tragedy of Johnson’s fall is that it will send that alienation soaring: when Sajid Javid recently conceded that the accounts of all the parties have “damaged our democracy”, this is presumably what he meant. In 12 years of political reporting, I have never felt that the reasons for such disaffection are all that complicated. Any meaningful sense of a social contract has long gone; many people’s lives are so precarious and chaotic that politics sounds like white noise, and its practitioners inevitably seem cosseted and privileged. Episodes such as the Iraq war, the crash of 2008 and the MPs’ expenses scandal only accelerated that estrangement. To cap it all, Facebook, Twitter and the rest have fostered a bitterly angry and divisive public discourse, and created a spectrum of disengagement that runs from an extreme outer edge to the heart of public opinion. At one end are people who think the world is run by a secret order of vampiric lizard people or worse; beyond this hardcore lie various shades of the belief that politicians are a strange and hypocritical clique, and most of what governments get up to confirms this. Some politicians have said they want to prove all this stuff wrong and restore the reputation of both their profession and the state. Johnson, by contrast, is one of those figures who surveyed the ferment and saw mouthwatering possibilities. Notwithstanding his first, aborted run for the Tory leadership, he soon made it to the top of his party, thanks to the EU referendum of 2016 and the success of a leave campaign that tapped into millions of people’s feelings of distance from power, raising their hopes with promises that everyone involved must have known would quickly turn to dust. His thumping election victory in 2019 was at least partly based on the selling to the public of a politician who supposedly wasn’t a politician, with a contempt for convention that held the key to Brexit’s impossible puzzles. Since then, most of his behaviour in office has apparently been based on the belief that if people’s faith in leaders and institutions was so low, old-fashioned “delivery” would hardly matter, and he would have the moral latitude to get away with just about anything. As proved by the panicky rag-bag of policies he recently floated – attacking the BBC, sending the armed forces into the English channel, somehow tackling NHS waiting lists – to look for coherence, or to imagine many of his ideas being implemented, is to miss the point: his political approach is as chaotic and volatile as the public mood that gave rise to it, and really about nothing but him. As many have long known, what we have basically been dealing with is a political-psychological cousin of Trumpism, rooted on the playing fields of Eton rather than suburban New York – and it is all about defying the demands of traditional politics by using turmoil, misinformation and endless performance. But this is not America – yet – and Johnson has discovered that even if the public are jaded and cynical, some things remain beyond the pale. Perhaps, like an initial crack on a car windscreen, the disgrace of partygate will shatter just about every aspect of his record. But here we hit one of the most glaring consequences of his misrule: the fact that even if he is forced out, the ramifications of his time in office will spread far further than him and his inner circle. Some of his Conservative colleagues evidently think that after he has gone, a new leader will be able to announce a completely fresh start. On that score, I would direct them to the opinion of a first-time Tory voter in the newly Conservative constituency of Bolton North East, whose opinions were recently recorded by the former Downing Street pollster James Johnson: “They’re all up there backing him, most of them. That’s my worry now, with the [Conservative] party: ‘Oh, he’s apologised, let’s just get on with the job.’ No – you’ve lied about doing the job.” Even if they have kept their distance, whoever succeeds Johnson will be faced by lingering anger about his rule-breaking and deceit, and how much he was indulged by his colleagues – not to mention the consequences of Brexit, the fallout from his largely disastrous handling of Covid, and the cost-of-living crisis, which by raising National Insurance and scrapping the £20-a-week rise in universal credit his government has managed only to deepen. There is a rather naive view that as Johnson’s popularity tumbles, Labour’s will carry on rising, and – by some as yet unexplained miracle – Keir Starmer and his party will eventually win enough seats to take power. But like all Labour leaders, he will depend on the public being open to his ideas, and prepared to believe that government can make a difference to their lives. His current leads in the polls aren’t bad, but you can find similar numbers in the history of plenty of Labour leaders who went on to lose – which perhaps suggests that the disaffection and anger spread by Johnson’s misconduct and broken promises may partly bypass Labour and feed into something much more insidious and grim. This is the prospect that should worry people on all sides of politics. Long before partygate, years of public disengagement gave us Nigel Farage, Tommy Robinson and millions of people concluding that the system was broken and simply switching off. In those circumstances, the first duty of anyone in high office should have been to try to heal the breach. But, having become prime minister in the midst of a crisis of trust, Johnson then made it even worse, sometimes as a matter of deliberate design, with consequences that will long outlast his time at the top. Whenever he goes, this will be his most lasting legacy – which is surely the greatest disgrace of all.

This is a sort of soupy dish, a bit like risi e bisi. Serves 2fregola 150gfrozen peas 100glight olive oil 1½ tbspsmoked streaky bacon 60gbanana shallot 1, finely slicedwhite wine 100mlchicken or vegetable stock 400mlbutter 30g (2 tbsp)parmesan 30g, freshly gratedmint 3 sprigs, leaves picked and finely chopped  Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the fregola for half its cooking time, about 8 minutes, adding the peas for the last 2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water, then set aside. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat. If your bacon has the rind still on, remove and reserve. Using scissors, snip the bacon into 1cm pieces directly into the hot oil – adding any reserved rind for extra flavour – then let it sizzle and give off its fat. Once the bacon is cooked and a bit crispy, lift out with a slotted spoon and set aside; discard the rinds or give them to the birds. Add the shallot to the residual fat in the pan and cook over a low heat for about 5 minutes, or until soft, stirring so it doesn’t catch too much colour. Stir in the fregola and peas, then pour in the white wine. Once the wine has evaporated, add the stock. Bring to a simmer and cook until the fregola is just cooked, about another 6 minutes. Return the bacon to the pan, then add the butter and all but a tablespoon of both the parmesan and the mint. Stir over a low heat for a couple of minutes, then cover and remove from the heat. Let it sit for another minute before spooning into bowls. Scatter over the remaining parmesan and mint, then inhale – this is super-delicious.

1/24/2022,"Ebrima Darboe is reflecting on the sharper edges Gambia have brought to this Africa Cup of Nations and lands upon the influence of his club manager. “He’s helped me a lot with my character,” says the young Roma player of José Mourinho, who has kept him close to the first-team squad this season. “I was such a good person and he taught me that in football you don’t have to be too nice, you have to be nasty.” The point is relevant to Gambia’s eye-catching Cup of Nations campaign. They are debutants and nobody would, on the face of things, have expected much from a side representing the continent’s smallest mainland country. But the Scorpions had an excellent group stage, beating Tunisia and drawing with a fancied Mali, and face Guinea on Monday in an extremely winnable last-16 tie. They have done it by boxing clever: once maligned, Gambian players are making their way in Europe’s bigger leagues and discovering the streetwise edge of winners.  “We used to play tiki taka, just trying pretty football, and in the end we’d lose 2-0 or 3-0,” reflects the Sampdoria defender Omar Colley, who joins Darboe among six Italy-based players in Tom Saintfiet’s well-travelled squad. Colley was in the Gambia team that won the African Under-17 Championship in 2009 but never expected them to make the next step. For scouts and agents, the country was a blind spot engulfed by its glamorous neighbour Senegal; a two-year ban from continental competitions in 2014, handed down for fielding overage players at under-20 level, did not help – but the new generation are in demand. “If you look at our previous youth teams, most of the guys eventually stopped because of limited opportunities to turn professional,” Colley says. “After three or four years trying to go abroad you need to find solutions to help your family and yourself. But now people are coming to Gambia to find players: things are changing.” The electric Bologna forward Musa Barrow is another of Gambia’s Serie A contingent and Colley believes that, in tandem with Sainfiet’s rigour, Italian habits are making a difference. “We know that in Italy you have to be tactically disciplined, and that defending is one of the features of the game there,” he says. “Maybe it helps in our games if the coach wants to defend and counterattack; with his experience it’s the perfect match. We don’t have possession a lot but our tactics are always coherent.” Seeing their compatriots operating at the top level tells younger players that, one day, they may do too. Such role models have been rare for Gambia since the era of Biri Biri, who thrived at Sevilla in the 1970s, and things have not come easily to the present-day success stories. Darboe undertook a perilous, deeply traumatic unaccompanied journey to Italy aged 15, spending three months travelling by bus to Libya and then boarding an inflatable craft to cross the Mediterranean. A lifeboat helped him complete the voyage, which is a topic that does not lend itself readily to words. Darboe weighed just 50kg by the time he arrived in Sicily. “When I took the journey I did it to go and chase my dream, to have a better life, to continue learning and playing football,” Darboe says. “I had no other choice. It was hard and I don’t like to talk about it much, but believe me it was not easy. I thank god that today I am here.” Thousands of people have not been so lucky. Darboe began to make his way in football: after playing for a club in Rieti he attracted offers from lower-division clubs but could not believe his ears when his agent said Roma would like to take him on trial. “I asked: ‘You mean a local team in Rome or the Roma I know in Serie A?” he remembers. A 15-minute glimpse was enough to earn him a deal and, although he could not play for the youth teams for the following 18 months while his refugee status was registered, his blossoming has been worth the wait. The same can be said of Gambia’s performance in Cameroon. “We aren’t surprised by it, we know our value,” Darboe says. “Everyone is talking about ‘underdogs, underdogs, underdogs’ but we believe it is our time to shine,” Colley agrees. Saintfiet has moulded a team from locations as diverse as Forest Green Rovers and Ifo Bromolla in Sweden; Darboe and Colley both speak glowingly of his motivational qualities, evident when he stops for an affectionate exchange with them during the conversation. “He wants to change the mentality and make sure we believe in ourselves,” Colley says. “We believe we can do what Senegal are doing.” Now they would like to be treated with the same respect as Africa’s more feted names. Their hotel for the three days before they face Guinea, nestled among idyllic foothills in Cameroon’s north-west, is easy on the eye but not on the basics needed for match preparation. Players have been sleeping four or six to a room, which risks being a particular issue during the Covid-19 pandemic, and they were initially required to share lodgings at their group stage accommodation in Buea. Tales of slapdash team hotels at the Cup of Nations are a reliable trope but arrangements of this kind seem beyond the pale. “If my club saw this they would think it was a joke,” Colley says. “It’s not what we are expecting. It’s our first time and you want a memorable experience, we thought everything would be perfect. We are underdogs from a small country but we are a good team and deserve to be treated better: you wouldn’t treat the bigger sides in the same way.” Against a moderate Guinea side that will be missing the suspended Naby Keïta, though, Gambia will use it as further proof they have developed the thick skin worn by potential title contenders. “Even if they put us 10 to a room we will go out there and show them we are extra-motivated and better than this,” Colley adds. “Every day is a party in Gambia at the moment and we want it to continue.”",Sport/Football,Darboe and Colley leading streetwise Africa Cup of Nations debutants Gambia ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/darboe-and-colley-leading-streetwise-africa-cup-of-nations-debutants-gambia
1/24/2022,"Antonio Conte forcing his available players into a rigid 4-4-2 formation was his way of making a point to the the Tottenham hierarchy. The Italian has not been particularly enamoured with what he found at the club when he arrived, spending plenty of time tinkering with his selections in the hope of finding the right mix. Tanguy Ndombele and Dele Alli have been given chances but failed to provide evidence they can be relied upon in the long term. There were issues all over the pitch at Stamford Bridge, implying that Spurs face a difficult final week of the window. A new right-back, central midfielder and a striker are necessities for a side devoid of ideas against the top sides in the division. Whether the club can move quickly enough to do everything Conte wants is another problem for the Italian and as Internazionale found out, if he is unhappy he is willing to go. Will Unwin  Match report: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Eddie Howe swiftly identified Jonjo Shelvey as the playmaker he wants at the heart of his Newcastle rebuild. In scoring the winner with a clever free-kick and producing a fine second-half performance, Shelvey played a pivotal role in the team’s second victory this season. He improved dramatically after Sean Longstaff replaced the injured Joelinton shortly before the break. Longstaff’s form has disappointed lately but he looked reborn against Leeds. If Saturday’s result is not to prove a one-off, hemust keep this standard up – or Howe must sign a midfield anchor capable of offering a protective framework within which Shelvey can utilise his passing range. As Newcastle headed to a Red Sea training camp near Jeddah, a dominant but blunt Leeds reflected on yet another reminder of how much they miss the injured Patrick Bamford. Louise Taylor Match report: Leeds 0-1 Newcastle After Marcus Rashford’s late showstopper of a winner lifted Manchester United above West Ham into fourth, Ralf Rangnick made sure to keep his feet in the ground regarding the race for a top-four finish. “We have to see the table realistically,” said the interim manager. “Spurs have played three games less than us. And there are other teams involved in that race, it’s not only Spurs or Arsenal. Even Wolves are pushing from behind so it will probably be a race until the last couple of fixtures. But for us now it’s important to know that we can win games – even if it’s in the last second of the game, that we can control a team like West Ham. We had 16 shots on goal, they had six or seven. So that was a big difference and this is important – that we are able to compete with those teams.” United’s next league game is a trip to Burnley on 8 February. Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 1-0 West Ham Steven Gerrard said it was important Aston Villa “showed the crowd and Everton that, if they wanted a war, we were prepared to do the same”. Everton are at war but, ominously for a team that has taken six points from 42 and whose next league game is away at Newcastle, it is of the civil kind. The second caretaker coming of Duncan Ferguson ended in defeat and with a possible FA investigation into the disgraceful scenes when Villa players were pelted with objects thrown from the crowd. There was a sit-in protest after the final whistle that lasted over an hour and called for the departures of Bill Kenwright and Farhad Moshiri’s board. Kenwright, flanked by police officers, spoke to angry fans on Goodison Road afterwards and rejected claims that Everton’s decline predates Moshiri. There have been good times too, the chairman said. Everton are currently enduring the longest trophy drought in the club’s 144-year history. Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 0-1 Aston Villa “Maybe we can drag some other teams into the relegation scrap, that’s all we can do,” said Dean Smith. Norwich’s win at Watford on Friday probably hastened Claudio Ranieri’s departure but do Norwich have enough quality to survive? They need to keep scoring goals; they have still scored just 13 all season. In Smith, they have a manager with recent experience of escaping relegation – with Aston Villa two seasons ago. Teemu Pukki’s better days seem behind him but he ably assisted Josh Sargent’s “scorpion kick”. Adam Idah is even less adept in goalscoring than his Finnish partner but significantly quicker. From midfield, Milot Rashica buzzed around dangerously at Vicarage Road and it is hoped that Josh Sargent’s goals can inspire him to live up to advance notices from Germany and America. Such players give Smith something to work with but the relegation situation still looks dependent on how successful Newcastle can be in the January window. John Brewin  Match report: Watford 0-3 Norwich Six months on from Jack Grealish’s £100m move to Manchester City, it feels as though we are still waiting for him to assume centre stage and take a game by the scruff of the neck. Grealish was largely ineffective as a false nine at Southampton, where he was flanked by Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling – both of whom were also in muted form – but Pep Guardiola staunchly defended the forward’s performance. “The best game he [Grealish] has played since he has been with us, by far,” the City manager said. “An exceptional performance. He played really, really well. I think he’s the perfect player to play between the lines. He’s so aggressive, he makes incredible runs, he dropped the Southampton team to the byline, his decision-making is excellent.” Perhaps Guardiola knows better but it was hard to concur with his glittering verdict. Ben Fisher Match report: Southampton 1-1 Manchester City Patrick Vieira’s renovation job at Crystal Palace has been swift and effective, his side totting up more possession, more chances and more goals than last season. And all while staying on course to finish higher, too. But with half an hour gone at Selhurst Park, the new-look team’s weaknesses had been badly exposed. Virgil van Dijk had scored the easiest goal of his career and Palace’s insistence on playing it out from the back had kept them pinned in their own half. Yet by the final whistle Palace’s best qualities had come to the fore, with only the idiocy of VAR and the excellence of Alisson denying them a well-earned point. On the sharp end of all their best moves was the electric Michael Olise, while Eberechi Eze was sent on to continue his comeback from serious injury. It wasn’t long ago that Wilfried Zaha was by a mile the best attacker in the Palace team. These days, he might not be an automatic choice. Alex Hess Match report: Crystal Palace 1-3 Liverpool How good is James Maddison? It is not so long ago that he and Jack Grealish were in hot competition for an England place. Maddison has been returning to something approaching his best form over Leicester’s difficult winter however and on his 200th league appearance he pulled the strings when his team were on top. He looks better than Grealish right now. Thirteen of his 15 goal involvements – scoring or directly assisting – have come in his last 12 games and that is not including his role in the 1-1 draw with Brighton where he ran at the defence, played a one-two off Ademola Lookman andtook the shot off that led to Patson Daka scoring. The 25-year-old is playing with a swaggerand, with Gareth Southgate a frequent visitor to the King Power Stadium, it would be no surprise to see him return to the England squad in March. Peter Lansley  Match report: Leicester 1-1 Brighton ‘So, are Arsenal good now?’ The answer is laced with nuance. In Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe they have a homegrown pair on which to build an empire. Martin Ødegaard is flourishing, while Gabriel Martinelli might just prove the best of the bunch. Mikel Arteta’s side have limped out of one cup at the first, fallen at the penultimate hurdle of the other and, in drawing a blank against Burnley, squandered a chance to occupy the top four. Against Liverpool , they resembled schoolboys throwing punches while being held at arm’s length by the playground bully. Understandable given recent history. But Sunday was a chance to prove their worth. After a slow start, came a period of pressure. But following Alexandre Lacazette’s glaring miss, they fell away. And so, for the second time this season, Arsenal find themselves. Surely, they have come too far to start limping? Sam Dalling Match report: Arsenal 0-0 Burnley With Tottenham expected to return with an improved offer for Adama Traoré this week after having their opening bid of £15m turned down, the Spaniard’s cameo off the bench against Brentford could end up being his last Wolves appearance. Traoré scored his first Premier League goal of the season against Southampton in midweek but was denied a second late on by VAR as Wolves made it four wins from their last five matches, and Bruno Lage refused to comment on the 25-year-old’s future. “The most important thing is the way he plays for us,” said Lage. “He played again with energy and scored the third goal again. He scored last week and scored again, and the way he celebrated with his teammates and also with me. He’s a team player, a big professional and a lovely guy. I’m very happy with him.” Ed Aarons Match report: Brentford 1-2 Wolves",Sport/Football,Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action
1/24/2022,"The inspiration for this recipe came from a conversation I had with a Yemeni refugee on the Greek island of Lesbos who had walked almost all the way to Turkey to escape the war in his home country. This is an absolutely extraordinary feat by any standards, but even more so given he was injured from the war. We spoke about oshaar, a preserved lemon pickle, and zhoug, a spicy coriander relish, both frequently used in Yemeni food, and it was these discussions that led me to create this dish. My version of zhoug is quite mild but, if you want to up the chilli, feel free. The garlic in it is also quite intense if you eat it immediately, but the acidity mellows it out after an hour. Any leftover zhoug can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three days. To make this more substantial, I sometimes add a few halves of hard-boiled eggs. Serve at room temperature.

Bring to the boil, then cover, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until they are soft but still have some bite. Depending on the age of your lentils, cooking times may vary. To make the zhoug, toast the cumin and cardamom seeds in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for a minute or so, until their aromas are released. Transfer to a mortar and pestle, and crush the seeds. Then place them, along with all the other zhoug ingredients, in a small food processor and blitz with ¼ teaspoon each of salt and black pepper. To assemble the dressing for the lentils, toast the cumin seeds in a small dry frying pan as before, then crush them in a mortar and pestle. When the lentils are ready, drain them in a sieve, return them to the pan and stir through the cumin, lemon juice, olive oil, preserved lemon, salt and black pepper. It’s important to do this while the lentils are still hot, as they soak up the flavours better. Stir in the beetroot and parsley and taste to adjust the seasoning. Place the lentils in a shallow dish and spoon a few tablespoons of zhoug over and around, serving the rest on the side.

1/24/2022,"The film and photographic images that emerged from the Holocaust, often in a blurrily dark monochrome, instantly became the visual definition of evil in the 20th century. So to set this brutal iconography against the cheerily crisp colours of modern English suburban homes in springtime – complete with armchairs, French doors on to patios, bright tulips in pots – might risk accusations of superficiality, or worse. But when the people in these apparently mundane locations are themselves survivors of the Holocaust, the sheer joyful fact of their existence becomes a triumphant rejoinder to the unimaginable cruelty and depravity of three-quarters of a century ago. The new images are collected together in Generations: Portraits of Holocaust Survivors, which opens later this week to coincide with world Holocaust day, at the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) gallery in Bristol after a showing at the Imperial War Museum in London.  The exhibition was initially intended to run in 2020, to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps in 1945, and plans were made to photograph the 70 or so Holocaust survivors living in the UK. “Of course lockdown ensured that didn’t happen,” says the RPS project curator, Tracy Marshall-Grant. “Then in spring of last year, when things were looking a little more open, we tried again and it came together remarkably smoothly.” Marshall-Grant has invited fellows of the RPS – as well as its patron the Duchess of Cambridge, who, in an unexpected juxtaposition, shares wall space with the Sun’s longtime royal photographer Arthur Edwards – to capture the survivors at their homes, often surrounded by their families. “There was no uniform brief,” says Marshall-Grant. “All the photographers know what they are doing so I just asked them to treat it as one of their own projects. The result is fascinatingly diverse. There are some very traditional portraits but also things that look like they are out of glossy magazines. And the photographers often became close to their subjects and kept in touch. Sian Bonnell’s picture of Tomi Komoly – someone simply in their garden wearing their good clothes – has such a warm and personal feel that you wouldn’t be surprised if it was a family picture.” This family aspect cuts to the heart of the project. The survivors were young during the Holocaust and down the years have become parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. “Along with their families there have also been businesses and charity work and all the other elements of productive and useful lives,” says Marshall-Grant. “Here they are, products of the lives they have built. Of course the horrors of what they and so many others endured is always there, sometimes directly in these photographs in terms of personal effects from the time and so on. But ultimately it has been such a privilege to work with these people and with this material because what actually comes out of it is not only a sense of revulsion at what happened, but huge admiration and gratitude for the positive legacies that have been allowed to be passed on down the generations.” Sir Ben Helfgott (main picture, above) photographed by Frederic Aranda with his grandson Sam at his home in London, was born in Poland in 1929 and incarcerated in the Buchenwald and Theresienstadt concentration camps. After the war he came to the UK and became a weightlifter, representing Great Britain at the 1956 and 1960 Olympics. He was knighted in 2018 for his contribution to Holocaust education. “My experience may have hardened me, made me more realistic about human nature,” Helfgott has said, “but I was repelled by the evil I witnessed. I despaired but I did not let cruelty and injustice break my spirit.” Dorothy Bohm (above) was living in Lithuania in 1939 when she was sent to the UK to escape the Nazis. She didn’t see her family again for 20 years. Bohm went on to become a leading photographer, was a co-founder of the Photographers’ Gallery and worked into her 90s. This was taken in her home in Hampstead where she talked to photographer Jillian Edelstein about her father. “Their separation during the war had been particularly painful,” says Edelstein. “We decided to use this photograph of him to commemorate that time and to have in the image, almost as a symbol of their survival.” Tomi Komoly (above) lost many family members in the Holocaust. He came to the UK in 1956 as a refugee and had a long career in the chemical industry. Photographer Sian Bonnell wanted the image to share the “wisdom of his experience and his incredible strength”. In 2020 Komoly was awarded the British Empire Medal for his work telling the story of the Holocaust in schools, and his contribution to the fight against hate crime. Eve Kanner-Kugler (above) left Germany with her mother after the anti-Jewish attacks of Kristallnacht in 1938. She arrived in New York in 1941 and moved to the UK in 1990.

It is based on borrowed flavours from Chinese cuisine but has been embraced as one of the most popular dishes of the unique Indo-Chinese cuisine.

Remove the stalk, seeds and white membrane of the red pepper and cut in 2.5cm chunks. Wash the ginger well, no need to peel, and coarsely grate it. Peel and coarsely grate the garlic. Finely chop the Thai chillies – you can use small scissors to cut them. Always wash your hands after handling chillies! Cut the paneer into cubes of 2.5cm, or a little smaller. Place in a large bowl. Add 4 tablespoons of the cornflour, ½ teaspoon of the black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce. Toss and coat the paneer pieces well. Keep aside. In a small bowl, add all the sauces, vinegar, and sugar. Stir and keep aside. In a small bowl, add 1 more tablespoon of the cornflour and 5 tablespoons of water. Mix well to make a slurry. Keep aside. Place a large frying pan on medium heat. Add 4 tablespoons of the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the paneer, cook in two batches, tossing and turning in the pan for a minute or two just to get some colour around the edges. Remove to a plate and repeat with the second batch. Using the same pan, add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Now add the chopped garlic. Sauté for a minute on medium heat till the garlic is fragrant – be careful not to burn it. Then add the ginger and Thai chillies (or chilli flakes, if using). Sauté for a minute, then increase the heat and add the onions, red pepper and the white part of the spring onions. Give a stir and cook for 2-3 minutes on high heat. You don’t have to cook the onions or the vegetables right through. The texture should be crisp and fresh. Moving quickly, add the rest of the soy sauce, the tomato ketchup, the sugar and the vinegar mixture. Add black pepper and stir well. Add the prepared paneer. Stir gently to coat the paneer in the sauce, then add the prepared cornflour slurry. Give everything a gentle stir. Taste for seasoning and adjust if need be. Switch off the heat. Transfer to a serving bowl, finish with the spring onion greens you chopped earlier. Add the julienned ginger and red chilli slices, if using. Serve the chilli paneer on its own or with noodles or rice for a more substantial meal.

1/24/2022,"Ganesh Pant worries about the future. While he delights in the stunning conservation accomplishment that has seen the numbers of greater one-horned rhinos in Nepal jump from 100 in 1965 to 752 in 2021, he wants to be sure that success will continue. Before the 1950s, as many as 1,000 rhinos roamed the grasslands and forests of Nepal. But by 1965, rampant hunting, poaching and changes in land use had brought the species close to extinction in the country. Then, the national park was established in 1973 and thanks to concerted conservation efforts, the rhino population began to bounce back.  Today, Chitwan national park has the second-largest concentration of one-horned rhinos after India’s Kaziranga national park, with the two parks accounting for 70% of the species’ global population. Besides playing a key role in the ecosystem, Chitwan’s rhinos help attract huge numbers of tourists each year, contributing considerably to the country’s economy. In 2019, there were 185,000 foreign visitors to the park. But the greater one-horned rhino is still classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and a new threat has emerged. While there were only about five confirmed deaths due to poaching between 2016 and 2020, more than 100 rhinos were reported to have died of natural or unknown causes. “Poaching used to be the reason for rhino mortality. But in recent years, the government has done an excellent job in protecting rhinoceroses from poaching,” says Pant, a conservation officer working for the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Nepal. “At this point, we cannot say that [these deaths are] only due to the impacts of climate change,” says Pant, who is studying for a PhD with the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. But he believes that the climate crisis could be one of the underlying causes. Pant and a team of researchers developed a set of 21 indicators to assess the vulnerability of the rhinos in Nepal to climate change. They concluded that they were “moderately vulnerable” to the impacts of global warming, primarily due to the likelihood of invasive species and extreme flooding in prime rhino habitat, along with habitat fragmentation, droughts and forest fires. “I’ve tried to look at the likely shift in the habitat of the rhinoceros in Nepal in the next 50 years in different climate change scenarios,” he says. “And to find out what would be the adaptation measures – to enhance the resilience of the rhinoceros in the context of likely impacts of climate change.” Rhinos are a highly adaptive species, hence their categorisation as moderately vulnerable. “That means it’s not at risk of immediate extinction due to climate change, but we have to consider it at the moment if we are to sustain the population for the long run,” says Pant. Wendy Foden, a conservation biologist, agrees: “We are currently experiencing the fastest rate of climatic change in 65m years. If conservation planning efforts are to remain relevant and strategic, they must include the best available science on anticipated future impacts.” Recent studies have shown several species of animals are already feeling the impact and are responding by shifting their habitats and even growing appendages or larger beaks, legs and ears to better regulate their body temperature in some cases. However, predicting the effects of the climate crisis on biodiversity is a challenge, in part because of the lack of long-term observational data. Our biosphere – the thin film of life on the surface of our planet – is being destabilised by temperature change. Extreme weather events are becoming more common, with flooding, sea level rises, droughts and storms all affecting biodiversity and its ability to support us. In the ocean, heatwaves and acidification are stressing organisms and ecosystems already under pressure from human activities such as overfishing and habitat fragmentation. The landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed that extreme heatwaves that would usually happen every 50 years are already happening every decade. If warming is kept to 1.5C these will happen approximately every five years. The effect of the climate crisis on the Earth’s biodiversity is already being seen. The distributions of 47% of land-based flightless mammals and almost a quarter of threatened birds may already have been negatively affected by the climate crisis, the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) warns. Five per cent of species are at risk of extinction from 2C warming, climbing to 16% with a 4.3C rise. Scientists increasingly argue the climate and biodiversity crises are linked. The destruction of the planet’s carbon-rich habitats, such as peatlands, forests, wetlands and grasslands, is damaging biodiversity and releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases. If 15% of the world’s most degraded land was restored, and the remaining habitats which are still in good condition protected, it could store a third of all greenhouse gas emissions created by humans since the Industrial Revolution, according to researchers. “It would be very unwise to plan species conservation actions before thoroughly assessing what can go wrong for that species, the mechanisms of potential impacts, how sensitive it is to these, and whether it is likely to be able to adapt of its own accord,” says Foden, who chairs the IUCN Species Survival Commission’s climate change specialist group, and led the development of IUCN guidelines for assessing species vulnerability to climate change. “These provide the foundations from which to build solid conservation plans. So in most cases, climate change vulnerability analysis is imperative for species conservation planning.” Pant’s research looked at the one-horned rhino’s climate crisis vulnerability according to sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity is how strongly a species is likely to be affected by climate change; exposure is the extent to which their physical environment will change; and adaptive capacity is their ability to overcome the negative impacts of climate change. While the one-horned rhinos fared well in the climate change vulnerability analysis, the changing climate is already threatening the rhino population in Chitwan national park. The species is dependent on a certain level of annual flooding to maintain its habitat. But over the last few years, extreme flooding has affected the park several times, sweeping rhinos downstream into India and bringing debris and rubbish from upstream. Drought is also occurring more often, leading to fewer of the ponds that rhinos wallow in to regulate their temperature. Invasive species such as the bitter vine (Mikania micrantha), and Chromolaena odorata, a flowering shrub also known as Siam weed, are spreading at an alarming pace, encroaching into the grasslands that are the rhinos’ prime habitat. Global heating is expected to exacerbate extreme flooding and prolonged droughts, as well as the rapid growth of invasive species in the future. According to Naresh Subedi, conservation programme manager at Nepal’s National Trust for Nature Conservation, better population and habitat management are crucial in the fight against the climate crisis. “Currently, our rhino population increment rate is 5%, for example. If we maintain 8% rhino population increment annually, then even if we lose 3% of the rhino population by the annual flood or climate-induced incident, they still will be in a good position.” Pant agrees, noting that while floods are only seasonal, maintaining a suitable habitat all year is vital to sustain a healthy population. Another recent study by his team found that more than a third of rhinoceros habitat in Nepal could become unsuitable within 50 years due to mostly to climactic changes, but also land use changes. Pant has proposed seven adaptation measures to secure the one-horned rhino’s future that include: maintaining the ponds rhinos need for wallowing; managing the impacts of floods; creating “refugia”; and actively managing habitats to provide a mosaic of grasslands and wetlands. “We are talking about adaptation because mitigation might take a long time and also depends on several factors,” says Pant. “It’s not under our control, so the only thing we can do is safeguard the rhinoceros under these extreme conditions. That’s our priority at the moment.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Leading the charge: wildlife experts plan for future of Nepal’s rhinos,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/24/wildlife-experts-plan-future-rhino-nepal-aoe
1/24/2022,"Early this month, China’s state news agency Xinhua posted a video reminding young Chinese men born in the year 2000 that they are now finally eligible to get married. “Post 00s have reached legal marriage age,” it declared. The hashtag swiftly popped up in the “top-searched list” of Weibo hot topics, but many read it as the government’s attempt to put pressure on them. “Who dares to get married these days? Don’t we need to make money?” one questioned. “Stop nagging me!” said another.  Under Chinese law, men can marry from 22 and women from 20. Young Chinese people’s mixed response to state media’s message came as the country faces what some analysts described as a “demographic timebomb”. Last week, China’s government reported its population growth rate had fallen to a 61-year low, with births barely outnumbering deaths in 2021, despite efforts to encourage Chinese couples to have babies in the last few years. “Young Chinese’s attitude towards marriage poses a big threat to Beijing’s effort to alter the looming demographic crisis,” said Liu Ye, a senior lecturer at King’s College’s Lau China Institute in London. “Coupled with a higher level of education and economic betterment, this will become a bigger headache in the years to come.” A growing number of young people across east Asian societies are delaying their marriage as the region becomes more prosperous. Yet in urban China, this change has been especially swift, said Wang Feng, a sociologist professor at the University of California, Irvine. Comparing Chinese census data in 1990 and 2015, Wang said that the share of never-married Chinese women in their late 20s shot up by eight times in the span of 25 years. Census data from both 2000 and 2010 show that college-educated young Chinese between 25 and 29 are most likely to be single. And women in developed Chinese cities, in particular, have fewer ambitions to get married. On social media and in daily life, the resistance to early marriage is strongly on display. In 2017, for example, a Shanghai-based chamber choir performance struck a chord with millions young Chinese facing the same dilemma across the country. The viral song Spring Festival Survival Guide – or What I Do Is For Your Own Good in English – told insisting Chinese parents: “My dear family, please just let me live my own life.” Vicky Liu, who is from Northern Tianjin and was born in 1997, is one of those young Chinese. She said as soon as she graduated with a masters degree in England last year, her parents began to arrange blind dates for her. “But I am an adult woman. I want a career and a good circle of friends. I just don’t want to be tied into a family life too soon.” The attitude alarmed the authorities further as the decline in population growth has become more evident in recent years. To reverse the trend, Beijing scrapped the decades-long one child policy in 2015, and last May it introduced a three-child policy. One economist, Ren Zeping even suggested the government should print more money to fund a baby boom (Ren has been banned from posting on social media following this comment). But Liu said that these policies are “masculine” and they are “disconnected” from the reality facing China’s generation Z today. “What they want is a better career future, an opportunity to have it all-career and family as well as self-fulfilment. Without these, it’s hard to convince them to have babies first,” she said. This is particularly the case with young Chinese women, Liu added. “Gen Z Chinese women have more education than previous generations. They are more likely to prioritise their career rather than get married after a university education.” Wang agreed and said that in reality, Chinese women are “severely under represented” in political and economic power. “China has a long way to go to create a more gender equitable society. But the difficulty here is that it is not achievable simply via the state issuing policy documents.” Yet Yi Fuxian of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also the author of Big Country with an Empty Nest, said there’s still something tangible the government can do to assuage the situation at least. “For example, job opportunities for young Chinese and help with the cost of living - in particular, the cost of property. The government should also make it easier for young couples to raise children.” For Liu, there is more to it. “[My parents’] logic is that as a woman I don’t have too long to find an ideal husband. For them, I have to get married, be pregnant and become a mother as soon as possible. Chinese parents simply won’t accept their daughters remaining single for too long.” With assistance from Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,‘Stop nagging!’: why China’s generation Z is resisting marriage and babies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/china-generation-z-resisting-marriage-and-babies
1/24/2022,"National disability insurance scheme participants will be able to dip into their core funding to purchase rapid antigen tests for themselves and their support workers, but critics have warned the change is still inadequate.The policy shift, confirmed by the Morrison government on Monday, is aimed at addressing an inequity in the system that meant some NDIS participants who lived in their own home, rather than in a group home, were being forced to spend hundreds of dollars on rapid antigen tests for their support workers, as revealed by Guardian Australia last week. In one particularly shocking case, Carolyn Campbell-McLean, who has muscular dystrophy, and as a result limited lung capacity, had spent $1,300 on tests for her carers, just so they could continue to enter her home and help her with tasks like getting out of bed, showering and dressing herself.  However, the new policy still falls short of demands from disability advocacy groups, who say the tests should be free, and was criticised by the federal Labor opposition on Monday. The new scheme means NDIS participants will use their existing “core” budget funding funds to buy the tests. This pool of money is allocated for use on core services, such as support workers, transport and other everyday items related to a person’s disability. The government said NDIS participants would be able to use these existing core funds to buy tests for themselves or their carers. About 18% of all NDIS participants, including Campbell-McLean, are not eligible for the 10 free tests over three months that are being provided to concession card holders, a measure that came into force on Monday. The NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, said the change to allow participants to buy RATs with their funding was “another example of how we are supporting participants to use their funding flexibly during the Covid-19 pandemic”. “We know that rapid antigen tests are an important tool for ensuring that participants continue to access their disability-related supports,” she said. “NDIS participants can claim rapid antigen tests to ensure their continuity of services.” Campbell-McLean welcomed the change as a “fantastic outcome”, though the Physical Disability Council of NSW, which also raised the issue last week, noted a need to increase plan budgets “when funds are used prematurely to cover this substantial additional cost”. Guardian Australia has sought further comment from Reynolds. Max Burt is an advocate who is immunocompromised and has multiple disabilities following a head injury sustained in car crash in London 22 years ago. He now requires daily care and told Guardian Australia he had spent about $1,000 on rapid antigen tests for his team of several support workers. Burt said allowing NDIS participants to use their allocated funds to purchase RATs prompted the question of whether the government would be increasing funding packages to cover the extra costs. “And priority is an issue,” he said. “If the government is not prioritising concession card holders access to RATs via their pharmacist, and is now prioritising teachers and school children with free and available RATs directly supplied to schools, then where does that leave NDIS participants? In the queue with the general public? “Buying them via normal retail channels – left behind at the back of the queue again?” Burt said the free tests for concession card holders, which he was able to access, were insufficient and also not particularly helpful, due to the limited supply. “If you’re in my position as well, in a wheelchair, [going out] to shop at a chemist is just not that easy,” he said. Labor’s NDIS spokesman, Bill Shorten, said rapid antigen tests should be free for all NDIS participants. “It is not the job of NDIS participants to do the Morrison government’s job of continuing services. Providers and carers should be able to access rapid tests easily and at no cost.” Unlike the aged care sector, NDIS providers do not have access to the federal government’s national stockpile of rapid tests, meaning they have been forced to compete with other businesses to source them in the free market. One provider told Guardian Australia this month it had only been able to source seven rapid antigen tests for its entire workforce in Tasmania.",News/Australia news,"Coalition shift on rapid antigen tests for disability carers still falls short, advocates say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/coalition-shift-on-rapid-antigen-tests-for-disability-carers-still-falls-short-advocates-say
