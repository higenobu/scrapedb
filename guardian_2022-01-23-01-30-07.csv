1/23/2022,"The long-awaited first meeting between Shishkin and Energumene lived up to every expectation here on Saturday, as two exceptional chasers duelled around two miles at Ascot before Shishkin edged in front in the final strides, having jumped the final fence with a length still to find. There was a huge roar from the stands as the two horses battled towards the line, with Energumene attempting to cling on to a lead he had held from the off. Ultimately, his first trip to Britain ended in defeat by a length, but a pulsating and unforgettable race has now set up a rematch in the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March which will surely be the race of the Festival.  Money had arrived for Energumene throughout the day and he set off as the 5-4 second-favourite, from 13-8 on Saturday morning, with Shishkin at 4-5. Willie Mullins’s chaser was odds-on in running until the final strides, however, as Paul Townend set a fierce pace in front and Shishkin made the first jumping error early on the second circuit.

Great champions always find a way of winning and he is just that.” At Haydock, Henderson’s Jonbon maintained his unbeaten record in the Grade Two Rossington Main Novice Hurdle but his performance was far more solid than spectacular and several bookmakers eased him slightly for the Supreme Novice Hurdle in March as a result. Richmond Lake and Might I still had every chance at the final flight but the 2-5 favourite found an extra gear on the run-in to finish three lengths in front at the line. “It was a different test today, a speed track, very soft ground,” Henderson, who watched from Ascot, said. “They quickened once in the straight and you thought he’s got something to do here, but … then he quickened again and I like horses that can quicken twice.” Tommy’s Oscar is 25-1 (from 50-1) for the Champion Hurdle after making a smooth transition from handicapping to Graded company later on the card, while Royale Pagaille is 16-1 (from 25-1) for the Gold Cup after carrying top weight to victory in the Peter Marsh Chase for the second year running.",Sport/Sport,Shishkin gets better of Energumene in classic Clarence House Chase duel,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/22/shishkin-gets-better-of-energumene-in-classic-clarence-house-chase-duel
1/23/2022,"The topic of Covid has proved so divisive at the women’s healthcare business run by Julie Čolan that she has banned all mention of it during team meetings. The pandemic has been a “nightmare” for company owner Čolan, after she saw trade fairs and exhibitions cancelled, leaving her with money tied up in unsold stock. On top of that, she has been worrying about the wellbeing of her staff.  Despite differing views about the jab among her three employees at Secret Whispers, based in Market Harborough in Leicestershire, Čolan has decided not to require them to be vaccinated. “They are very respectful but everyone has a different opinion,” Čolan said, adding: “I have asked them to be informed and do their research before they make up their mind. But it is their decision to make.” UK companies large and small are debating the vaccine question, and whether to differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated members of their workforce. Even as plan B measures are due to be lifted in England this week, employers are still anticipating some level of disruption to their operations from Covid, including higher levels of staff absence. This comes at a time when many are trying to claw back the costs of keeping business going during the pandemic. Like Čolan, the vast majority of employers have decided not to mandate vaccination for their staff, fearing it could risk resignations or even leave them open to legal claims of unfair dismissal or discrimination. Yet firms are divided over how best to proceed. In recent days, Next, Ikea and Ocado are among the firms to raise their heads above the parapet. The retailers have changed their company sickness policy and will be treating jabbed and unjabbed workers differently. They follow a move by supermarket chain Morrisons, which last September became one of the first businesses to cut company sick pay for periods of self-isolation for unvaccinated staff, as part of a bid to stem rising costs after a slump in profits. Unvaccinated workers at the retailers who have to isolate but do not test positive for the virus will only be eligible for statutory sick pay, now set at £96.35 a week – significantly below what the average worker would earn. Meanwhile, engineering and consultancy group Wood is mandating its staff be vaccinated – unless they have an exemption, including those which are medical or religious. Any of the energy service company’s 6,500 UK workers who choose not to get vaccinated will be expected to discuss this with their manager. They may end up working from home indefinitely, or have to undergo more frequent Covid testing before attending the workplace for meetings with colleagues or clients. Current rules in all UK nations now make a clear distinction in self-isolation requirements for vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. In all four nations, the unjabbed have to isolate for 10 days, even if they do not test positive for the virus. In theory, there is no limit to how many times an unvaccinated person might come into contact with Covid, and be required to spend 10 days in isolation. It is perhaps unsurprising that the impact of isolation requirements is being felt acutely in retail, where workers tend to have customer-facing jobs, which they cannot carry out from home. Employment lawyers believe companies may introduce new sick pay policies as a way to exert subtle pressure on unvaccinated staff to get the jab. While some sick pay schemes are at the company’s discretion, businesses must also consider whether their decision could leave them open to legal claims. “Lots of businesses will be weighing up the pros and cons of this. They’ll be looking at the financial implications, their health and safety obligations to their staff and customers,” said Fudia Smartt, an employment lawyer at law firm Spencer West. “They will be weighing that up against a theoretical risk of, say, 5% [of staff] bringing claims. They may decide the risk is worth it.” Most trade unions have encouraged their members to get vaccinated, but have also warned that cutting company sick pay could backfire, and potentially risk workplace outbreaks, if unvaccinated staff decide that they cannot afford to self-isolate. Companies had already been struggling with a staffing squeeze for several months before the rise in Covid cases, said Matthew Percival, programme director for skills and inclusion at business group the Confederation of Business Industry (CBI). “Higher levels of sickness absence and self-isolation caused by Omicron are adding to the pressure of labour shortages right across the economy,” Percival said. Despite this, the vast majority of UK employers have shown themselves to be reluctant to mandate vaccination among their staff, preferring encouragement over coercion. This is partly due to high levels of vaccine uptake across the population, and also because employment rights are enshrined in UK law. In the UK, employment lawyers and trade unions have warned that businesses requiring staff to be vaccinated – a so-called “no jab, no job” policy – is a moral minefield and also legally contentious. This is a marked contrast with the US, where large employers including Wall Street bank Citigroup and tech giant Google have told their staff they need to be vaccinated or could face losing their job. The government had to pass legislation to compel care homes to make sure all workers in England without medical exemption were fully vaccinated. Health secretary Sajid Javid has also told NHS staff and care-home workers that they are at risk of being sacked if they are not fully jabbed by April. Employers who decide to obtain data on their workers’ vaccination status will have to handle this with caution. Vaccination status is classed as sensitive personal information, known in legal language as “special categories of personal data”, and has to be carefully stored and kept private to avoid breaking GDPR regulations.",News/Law,UK firms weigh risks of forcing their staff to get coronavirus jabs,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/22/uk-firms-weigh-risks-of-forcing-their-staff-to-get-coronavirus-jabs
1/23/2022,"The Keel, a converted former HMRC office block overlooking Liverpool’s waterfront, is billed as the solution to dull, impersonal renting. Tenants in the block of 240 new flats can fake a sun-kissed glow on video calls by dialling in from its new “Zoom room”. According to its interior designer, Jasper Sanders, the effect created by the tinted windows is a friendly nod to many Liverpudlians’ love of a year-round tan. At the Wembley Park development in north-west London, renters can work from retro camper vans or sheds custom-made for home working.  Welcome to the fast-growing world of “build to rent”, an asset class that is shaking up the housing market, luring renters with the promise of more professional management than individual private landlords, and sucking in a flood of money, from banks, pension funds and even retailer John Lewis. Tempted by the prospect of stable returns, these blocks are developed, owned and operated by large companies with deep pockets. Yet there is growing unease over the boom in this new class of rental property, with concern that the poorest in society will be priced out. Rob Wall, a 34-year-old communication coach, moved to Wembley Park, the biggest build-to-rent complex in the UK, lured by the perks. In return for pet-friendly but small apartments that come with communal benefits, such as gym access and a cinema room, tenants part with monthly rent starting at £1,770 (plus utilities of roughly £200 a month). Developer Quintain’s all-inclusive package meant Wall no longer had to sort out his own utilities or arrange repairs. “We don’t have to be too hands-on with it,” he says. “As a drummer and football fan, it’s a real bonus being next to the SSE Arena and stadium.” Institutional landlordism is relatively new to Britain, but the sector has boomed as property prices spiral upwards, pushing the prospect of buying a home further out of reach for many. Build to rent now accounts for 20% of all new housing in England, a figure that rises to 40% for London, according to research consultancy Molior. Research from estate agency Ascend Properties shows that planning permission requests for build-to-rent units across the UK rose 52% during the pandemic. “For a long time, residential property hasn’t been seen as a viable asset class; it’s really messy to manage, with huge operational costs,” said Frances Brill, a University of Cambridge geographer specialising in build to rent. But with interest rates so low, commercial property yielding shaky returns, and Britain facing a chronic housing shortage, it had become an attractive bet. “Investors sense there’s money to be made if you’re able to provide quality housing,” she said. Well-established players such as US developer Greystar – which last month partnered with Abu Dhabi in a £2.2bn deal to build London rental homes – have led the charge. Macquarie, the Australian bank that stripped out huge dividends during its ownership of Thames Water, has set up a rental business, Goodstone Living. US private equity giant KKR is funding 4,000 luxury homes. High-street names such as John Lewis, Lloyds Bank and Legal & General (L&G) are also joining the goldrush. Lloyds plans to own 50,000 homes within a decade, under a strategy developed by new boss Charlie Nunn, the Financial Times reports. Investors ploughed a record £4.1bn into the sector last year, according to property adviser CBRE. The boom is set to continue, as demand for rentals outstrips supply. In Leeds, L&G is turning Tower Works, the city centre’s Grade II listed former factory, into 245 rental apartments. Developers are also eying suburban areas, rolling out pet-friendly, larger homes designed to encourage longer-term contracts. L&G has announced a 117-home scheme in Peterborough for families seeking out-of-town properties with office space and gardens. Experts say while interest from private equity firms comes from experience, the biggest draw for pension funds is they can raise the rent roughly in line with inflation. Dan Batterton, head of build to rent at L&G, said investors took about 4% from annual rent income linked to inflation. “The need for housing makes the rental market less volatile,” said Batterton. For tenants, there’s the promise of well-managed homes for people who cannot afford to buy, and are fed up with rogue landlords. In the UK, there are almost twice as many people looking for rentals as there are spots available – a ratio that rises to 10 to one in Salford, according to research by insurer Admiral. “Especially in such a new market, a big pension fund can’t afford to become known as an awful landlord,” said Brill. “No one wants to kick a granny on to the streets.” She sees Switzerland – where 60% of households rent – as a success story: pension-fund-owned housing there is well kept, with stable rents. “There’s a glimmer of hope of what the UK market could be, if build-to-rent landlords’ actions are sufficiently regulated.” But not all communities can afford to buy into the lifestyle. “While build-to-rent developers are obliged to provide nominally ‘affordable’ homes, this doesn’t mean they are building more social housing,” said Brill. “It doesn’t address the affordability crisis, because it’s so expensive.” Homelessness charity Shelter has warned that build to rent is likely to be aimed at the higher end of the market, making it unaffordable to lower-income households. And while it has boomed during the pandemic, affordable housing starts fell by 16% in England in 2020-21, according to government data. In Elephant and Castle, London’s ‘“Latin American quarter”, a £3bn regeneration project including a big slice of build to rent is driving out the current population of social housing tenants. About 4,000 social housing units have already been demolished in the area, with many residents forced to move to suburbs more than six miles away. Delancey, the developer best known for its partnership with the Qatari royals to buy and develop London’s former Olympic village, will replace the shopping centre with homes to rent. It has permission for 979 build-to-rent homes, of which 116 will be social housing. Its initial proposal, for just 33 affordable homes, was rejected by the council. Corporately branded and just streets away from the demolished Heygate council estate, the block, due to be completed in 2030, is a metaphor for the borough of Southwark’s socioeconomic tensions. With 16,000 households on Southwark’s housing waiting list, families are often pushed into overcrowded properties. Down the road from the Delancey development, Milton, 53, his wife Cecilia, 50, and two children live in a private rented studio flat. They have been waiting on the council register for a three-bedroom flat for three years. “It’s been a very hard time, not only for me, but for my children since they translate for me and help me with the documents I present to the council,” said Milton, who declined to give his full name. His children eat, sleep and do their homework in the same room. “Housing shouldn’t be an asset,” said Elizabeth Wyatt, from campaign group Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth. “Good quality social housing, where communities can thrive and build roots, should be a right.” Southwark council said: “The 35% affordable housing offer, which included 116 social rent homes, was the maximum we could reasonably secure for the Elephant and Castle development. We are committed to providing 2,500 new council homes across the borough by May 2022.” Others think these expensive developments will take more refining. “There is some smoke and mirrors happening with these developers,” said John, a marketing manager and resident of Hurlock Heights, a new tower in Elephant and Castle (he declined to give his full name). The building hosts a mix of properties; build to rent, shared ownership and homes for sale. He feels his flat doesn’t match the leafy, high-spec complex in the brochure, and residents have complained about high service charges. “Our rooftop garden is kept in such a poor state. Because residents are walking their pets there, the grass is all dead,” said John. He said not being a pet owner was even more frustrating because when he originally bought the flat, nothing in the advertisement or contract said animals were allowed. There are lessons for the build-to-rent developers from elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, Berliners last year voted on a controversial property expropriation bill to take 240,000 properties, or 11% of all apartments in Berlin, from corporate landlords.",News/Business,Build to rent’s glitzy goldrush raises fears for social housing,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/22/build-to-rents-glitzy-goldrush-raises-fears-for-social-housing
1/23/2022,"Afew years ago, aged 24, Anouar Kaddour Cherif found himself in exile from his native Algeria and living in Switzerland, which he describes as “a refuge for my musical fingers to find expression”. His debut album is a deft blend of jazz and Arab-Andalucian tradition, led by his own mandole – a 10-stringed lute – alongside bass, drums and bass clarinet, the last an unusual instrument skilfully handled by one Clément Meunier. The quartet conjure a variety of moods from that configuration. Opener Sans Pap (a pun on no paper/no pope) is exuberant, led by Cherif’s rippling runs, and there’s a similar joyousness to tracks such as Savage Butterfly and Virgule, with its Indian melody and driving drums. It’s a communal effort, with Meunier’s burbling woodwind (with none of the clarinet’s usual shrillness) offsetting the twang of the lute. The record’s more meditative pieces are just as engaging.  The first of two vocal outings, Call of the Night, conjures a humid North African evening, with glimpses of “staggering bodies in the shadows”. Better still is the waltz-time Amiret Erriyam, where Cherif slips between nostalgia, despair and the determination to start anew; like the rest of the album, a piece of musical autobiography.",Arts/Music, Anouar Kaddour Cherif: Djawla review – a deft Arab-jazz blend,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/22/anouar-kaddour-cherif-djawla-review
1/23/2022,"I’ve just been standing for 10 minutes at a moderately quiet junction near where I work in Cambridge. During that time I’ve seen six electric vehicles (EVs) – three VW ID.3s, a Nissan Leaf, a Nissan white van and a Renault Zoe. Three years ago, if I’d been standing at the same spot, I’d have seen precisely zero such vehicles. And what that brought to mind was Ernest Hemingway’s celebrated reply to the question: how does one go bankrupt? “Two ways,” he said. “Gradually, then suddenly.” Something similar is going on in relation to adoption of EVs in Britain. The hockey-stick graph is common in consumer technologies. We saw it in the early years of mobile phones, when text messaging was ignored by adults as an inferior form of email. But when pay-as-you-go tariffs arrived and teenagers could have phones, SMS use suddenly shot skywards. The arrival of kids represented a tipping point – a point in time when a group rapidly changes its behaviour by widely adopting a previously rare practice.  Britain hasn’t reached a tipping point with EVs yet, and so the first question is: when is it likely to occur? It needs to be earlier than most people think, because the government has decreed that sales of new petrol and diesel cars must cease by 2030. The second question, then, is: what will persuade – or force – people to change their cars? The best place to look for answers is Norway, the one country that has been through the tipping point. Ten years ago, diesel cars accounted for 75% of new sales there. Today they make up just 2.3%. Two-thirds of all new cars sold there in 2021 were EVs and the predictions are that proportion will reach 80% this year. Ye olde internal combustion engine seems destined for extinction in that particular part of the frozen north. How did Norway do it? Partly through luck: it’s a small country (population 5.5 million) which has abundant supplies of hydroelectric energy and – ironically – massive fossil-fuel reserves, the income from which is placed in a sovereign wealth fund and can be invested in all kinds of better ideas than burning them. The second factor was public opinion: people have been campaigning for EVs in Norway since the 1990s when a celebrated pop star and an environmentalist put an electric motor into a Fiat Panda and continually drove it through motorway tolls without paying until the resulting publicity made electrification a public issue. But the third – and most significant – factor was government action. Norway, like all the Scandinavian democracies, is a high-tax society, and the taxes on imported cars were high – 25% VAT and a hefty registration fee. Both were waived for EVs. Motorway toll charges were removed for electric vehicles in 1997, city parking was made free for EVs in 1999 and access to bus lanes granted in 2005. The country installed 16,000 public charging stations (including 3,300 fast chargers). In the end, if you were a Norwegian contemplating buying a new car, going electric became a no-brainer. And Norway is well on its way to being an EV-only society by 2025. So that’s how to do it. You just need lashings of money, a political system that responds to public opinion and a government that knows what it’s doing. Which is why it would be unwise to bet on the UK meeting its deadline of being an EV-only society by 2030 – a failure that would have pleased Douglas Adams (of blessed memory). “I love deadlines,” he once said, “I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.” And the great thing about EVs is that they don’t growl, they merely whoosh.

1/23/2022,"Royal Mail received more than a million complaints from householders last year, the highest level for a decade. An analysis of Royal Mail quality service reports reveals that it investigated 1,135,441 consumer complaints in the year to 28 March 2021. This is an increase of nearly 50% compared with the previous year.  The surge in complaints is revealed as the company is under fire for delays in postal districts across the country. The Observer last week revealed that more than 120 postal districts experienced delays over the Christmas and new year period. The regulator Ofcom has said it is closely monitoring the situation and will take action if necessary. In 2020-21, Royal Mail also missed many of its key targets. It delivered about 75% of first-class letters the next working day, compared with its target of 93%. The price of a first-class stamp has risen 21% during the pandemic and is now 85p. Royal Mail has a near-monopoly over letter deliveries to the front door and has faced claims in parliament that it has prioritised parcels over letters because it is in fierce competition with rival operators, including Amazon. Royal Mail said it warned customers that its service was likely to be disrupted by Covid-19 because of an increase in parcel volumes, social distancing requirements and staff absences. Customers have complained of delays of up to an hour when phoning Royal Mail customer service agents to complain about missing post. Lorna Scott Fox, 67, a writer who lives in east London, said her postal deliveries had stopped for about three weeks in December and she had still not taken down her Christmas cards because they only arrived this month. She said that when she phoned Royal Mail to complain, she faced a wait of about 50 minutes to speak to a customer service agent. “The delays are dreadful, but it’s not surprising because there must be hundreds of people ringing up. I still have not had any response to my complaint.” Residents in East Dulwich in south-east London have launched a petition complaining about delays after the closure of a mail depot. It says: “It would be easy to blame all this on Covid but the problems existed long before Covid and they are likely to continue long into the future unless something is done. We demand a plan of action from Royal Mail to solve this.” Citizens Advice said the postal service needed to improve information to customers, including the length of likely delays. Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: “Royal Mail must do more to reduce these delays and, if these issues become a long-term trend, the regulator Ofcom must be ready to take action.” The most recent quality-of-service reports for Royal Mail show it is still failing to hit regulated targets, but the company said its performance is improving. An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We know how important a reliable postal service is to customers, and we can take action if Royal Mail fails to meet our annual targets.“We closely monitor its delivery performance throughout the year, and have made it clear to the company that it must improve as the impacts of the pandemic subside. We will assess Royal Mail’s compliance after it has reported on its overall performance for the whole financial year.”Royal Mail bosses said postal workers have done an “extraordinary job” but the service has faced a significant increase in workloads. It says its policy is to treat parcels and letters with “equal importance”. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “The overwhelming majority of all mail is safely and correctly delivered by our postmen and women, with just one complaint for around every 10,000 items of mail handled by Royal Mail in 2020-21. “Where something goes wrong, our aim is to promptly deal with the problem and rectify it as soon as possible. We are the only UK delivery company that publishes an annual complaints report, as well as a quality of service report which is subject to some of the most rigorous standards of any major European country.”",News/Business,Royal Mail hit by decade high of more than 1m complaints,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/22/royal-mail-hit-by-decade-high-of-more-than-1m-complaints-last-year
1/23/2022,"A British-Iranian man imprisoned in Iran is to start a hunger strike on Sunday in support of a 77-year-old American who is protesting outside nuclear talks in Vienna against Iranian hostage taking. Anoosheh Ashoori, who is being held in Evin prison in Tehran, is staging the strike in an act of solidarity with Barry Rosen, who started his own four days ago. He told the Guardian he was humbled by the support, as well as other messages being sent to him by Iranians in jail.  Anoosheh, who was arrested in August 2017, has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for espionage. Rosen is protesting in Vienna outside the talks about the Iran nuclear programme, where discussions resumed earlier this month. The US has said that the longer Iran fails to comply with the 2015 Vienna accord – intended to rein in Tehran’s nuclear programme – the closer it would get to being able to build an atomic weapon. But a European Union spokesperson said on Friday an agreement was possible. Rosen and others have expressed a hope that hostages would be released as part of the deal, or alongside it. Rosen has also been joined on hunger strike by a Lebanese US resident, Nizar Zakka, who was detained by Iran between 2015 and 2019. “I am receiving heart rending messages from Iranians, and I am absolutely humbled that Anoosheh is doing this in support of me. I support him completely in return and I urge him to be careful and look after himself,” he said. Rosen, as the then US press attache to the US embassy in Tehran, was himself held hostage by Iran for 444 days between 1979 and 1981 after hard-line students stormed the embassy. Rosen admitted: “I am starting to feel tired and weak, but I am determined to continue.” He said: “I am here to call on the Americans and the Europeans to make the release of the hostages a condition of any agreement to renew the Iran nuclear deal. This has been going on for 40 years, and people are being thrown in jail with no evidence. There has to be an agreement that this will end.” He added he was struck by how ill coordinated western nations are over the hostage taking issue. “It is like herding cats. Each country seems to deal with its dual national hostages on its own. There is no sense of commonality, so they leave Iran to pick each country off. Something is missing here. The Iranians seem to be dividing and ruling. “I decided to do this two weeks ago. I am just an individual, and thought I might be a lone eagle, but it feels like a movement might be starting.” He said it was possible others would take over the hunger strike when he is unable to continue. Anoosheh’s wife, Sherry, said: “We are extremely concerned for his health as he approaches his 68th birthday, but having failed to see any progress in the Foreign Office’s efforts to secure his release and no sign of the welfare of hostages held by Iran currently being a priority of western governments, he will begin his hunger strike.” ",News/World news,Anoosheh Ashoori to start hunger strike in protest against Iran hostage-taking,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/anoosheh-ashoori-to-start-hunger-strike-in-protest-against-iran-hostage-taking
1/23/2022,"Aryna Sabalenka threw her hands into the air, clapped them together and then punched the sky. “I’m really happy right now,” she said, “and mostly really happy that I made only 10 double-faults.” She was laughing, the crowd was laughing and cheering. Marketa Vondrousova was probably doing neither, having lost the third-round showdown despite starting the stronger. The No 31 seed had taken the opening set, just as Sabalenka’s previous two Australian Open opponents had done. In much the same manner as those matches, the world No 2 had closed out the contest with ease.  “It feels like I’m warming up in the first set and then I start playing,” she said. “I really want to win it in two sets and that’s why I’m getting so much emotional on the first set, and that’s why I’m over-trying and I’m missing a lot. “And after the first set when you’re losing, you’re: ‘OK, maybe I don’t have to overhit or panic like [I did] earlier.” At Margaret Court Arena on Saturday she finished almost flawlessly, which will not be lost on the Estonian Kaia Kanepi, who will face her in the last 16 after beating theAustralian wildcard Maddison Inglis. Vondrousova broke Sabalenka twice in the opening set. Sabalenka, though, started landing the big first serves for which she is also known. Vondrousova found herself on the back foot, forced to take more risks than desired and finding not enough were paying off. These past few months Sabalenka has relied on other areas of her generally imposing game to compensate for her well-documented serving troubles, which peaked in round two when she served 19 double-faults against Wang Xinyu, including six in her opening service game. Her 10 against Vondrousova bring her tournament tally to 41. She spent much off the off-season working on this issue and accepted help from Mark Philippoussis this month after totalling 38 double-faults in her opening two losses of the season in Adelaide. “It’s more mental,” she said. “Because I put a lot of pressure on myself about my serve and the last matches I was trying to control everything on my serve; my legs, my arm, the ball toss. I was overthinking, so I just stopped thinking. “Like today, for example, I was focusing only on the good jump and that’s it. Because I have this muscle memory, and I just trust myself today, much more than in the first matches.” That trust will be put to the test against Kanepi, who relied on her own resilience to go the distance against Inglis. The Western Australian, who has never progressed past the first round of a grand slam, appeared to be on her way to a stunning upset when she stole the first set in emphatic fashion. But it was short-lived, and her failure to hold serve for seven straight service games gave Kanepi the ascendancy to win 2-6, 6-2, 6-0. “This week, I really proved to myself and to the people around me that I do have it in me,” Inglis said. “And belief does a lot for your game and how you play.” It followed the day’s trend of comebacks in the women’s singles, with American Danielle Collins prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 after also losing the first set to emerging Danish star Clara Tauson, and the French veteran Alizé Cornet seeing off Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 – but not without a tense exchange with the umpire. Cornet, who in round two upset the world No 3, Garbiñe Muguruza, was down a set with the second delicately poised at 4-4 when the umpire took away her first serve for a time violation when she appeared to be checking the sun’s position. “This is insane, I didn’t do anything,” she told the umpire, Katarzyna Radwan-Cho. “I took my towel, I took the ball and I went. I didn’t even wait for one second.” After some back and forth Cornet walked away and then returned, starting with: “Don’t say anything, just listen to me.” Cornet later said she “had to tell her what I had on my heart”. “We’ve been fighting on the court for two hours in the heat, playing such a long game, be a little bit understanding,” she said. “You’re in the shade, you’re seated. I was a little bit, maybe not really nice, but I told her sometimes you have to be a little bit human with the players.” Simona Halep made light work of Montenegro’s Danka Kovinic 6-2, 6-1 and the Romanian will meet Cornet in the fourth round – the seventh time she has made it to the second week in Melbourne. The Polish seventh seed Iga Swiatek set up a fourth-round date with Romanian Sorana Cirstea after a comfortable 6-2, 6-3 win over Daria Kasatkina. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova went out, the 10th seed falling to Cirstea 6-3, 2-6, 6-2.

1/23/2022,"Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the crisis surrounding Boris Johnson is just how long it has taken to happen. Almost by definition, any party to which 100 people are invited is not a secret event. And that “almost” can be dispensed with if the invitees work in politics. Yet for more than 18 months, the public was ignorant of the prime minister’s attendance at the infamous No 10 social gathering on 20 May 2020 – and indeed of the gathering itself. The journalist who first wrote about Downing Street parties during lockdown, the Daily Mirror’s political editor, Pippa Crerar, initially heard about them almost a year earlier. She said it took 11 months to stand up the story, though the Mirror may also have been waiting for an opportune moment. With Johnson under pressure after the Owen Paterson fiasco, that moment duly arrived.  The key point, however, in the age of social media, is that the story didn’t leak. It’s said in Westminster that a couple of Tory-supporting journalists also attended social gatherings in Downing Street. Rumours circulated. Nevertheless, there were no Instagram photos or revelatory blogposts, no viral internet rumours. New media played little part in uncovering the egregious flouting of government rules and national laws by Johnson and his staff. Rather, what finally brought to public attention that boozy May day and the various other lockdown parties was the work of the often-derided mainstream media. As media academic and commentator Jane Martinson says: “The relationship between Fleet Street and Downing Street is an interesting one, but we wouldn’t have found out about any of these stories without journalists.” It was ITV News that broke the story of the email sent by the PM’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, to scores of No 10 staff, inviting them to “make the most of the lovely weather” and bring their own booze to the garden party. The Guardian ran the photo of another wine-and-cheese get-together that took place five days earlier in No 10’s garden; the Independent discovered that the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, attended a gathering, which meant he had to recuse himself from the inquiry now being led by Sue Gray; and the Daily Telegraph told us about two parties held by Downing Street staff that took place on 21 April, the night before the Queen attended Prince Philip’s funeral, sitting alone. Aside from placing Johnson’s position under question, “partygate”, as it has inevitably been labelled, has also shown the old-fashioned strengths of the broadcast media and the press when it comes to establishing the facts. We may have to wait for Gray’s report to discover if Johnson knew that a gathering of 40 or so people drinking alcohol was (a) a party and (b) against the rules he’d instructed the rest of the nation to follow, but it’s thanks to TV and press journalists that we know there was a gathering, that Johnson was there, and that so were 40 others. That, ironically, is Johnson’s potential lifeline. The PM, after all, is a former journalist, someone who knows all about news cycles and the various ways of distracting and distracting the press’s attention. If he and his allies can portray partygate as a media confection, as gossip dressed up as news, while focusing on the success of the booster drive, falling Covid numbers, and the relative health of the Britisheconomy among G7 members, he may be able to ride out the storm. Veteran broadcaster and journalist Andrew Marr believes that, although the story has entered a lull, it’s far from over, and won’t be until Gray’s report is delivered. “It might be a damp squib and the rebellion against Boris Johnson collapses like an elderly meringue,” he says. “Or it could get everything going. I don’t think anybody knows at the moment.” But if Johnson’s attempt to shift the agenda is to work, he will need the media to disseminate his message. This is where intrigue develops, and news values are weighed against political expediency. A study of two Daily Mail front pages a week apart illustrates the point. On 12 January, it ran with the ominous question: “Is the party over for PM?” The piece was gloomy and spoke of “draining support”, a “ferocious backlash” from aggrieved families, and Johnson being “engulfed” by the crisis. Eight days later, it placed a leader comment on the front page denouncing a “narcissistic rabble of Tory MPs” trying to topple a PM “who’s leading us out of Covid” and ended with the demand: “In the name of God, Grow Up!” There was a visible progression from a recognition that Johnson was a deeply flawed leader to a realisation that he might actually be forced out. With its cloak-and-dagger comings and goings of senior figures, Associated Newspapers has of late resembled the court of the Medicis. But it seems Ted Verity, the editor of the Mail, perhaps with the support of his editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, has done the moral calculus and decided that an untrustworthy and hypocritical PM is preferable to the alternatives – in particular, a resurgent Keir Starmer, about whom the Mail ran two scolding front pages. Whatever the reason, it’s a significant decision. The Mail prides itself on taking a strong moral line in tune with “middle England”, and here it has gone against its instincts. Presumably, the thinking is that the public will soon tire of the party revelations. That might be an optimistic assumption. Marr believes details of the parties amount to much more than a fanfare of gossip. “It’s a very rare story, which is certainly about events deep inside the Westminster village but goes to the heart of millions of people’s ordinary experiences during the pandemic. That’s why it was so dangerous for Boris Johnson,” he says. The reason it has kept going is not because of any great appetite for knowledge of the social arrangements within No 10, but because it exposes the double standard of “do as you are told, not as I do”. That’s never an attractive look. During the sacrifices of lockdown it could turn out to be fatally ugly. One of the complexities in the media’s reporting of this story is the position of the BBC. With Johnson’s most devoted loyalist, culture secretary Nadine Dorries, preparing to scrap the licence fee, the corporation has never been under greater threat of being dismantled. Martinson says it’s “desperately difficult” for the corporation, and wonders if the hovering axe has had a subconscious effect on its response. Another media observer is adamant that the corporation has been timid in pursuing the story. “They’ve shown little appetite for it,” he says. Marr, who left the BBC last year after 21 years, disagrees. “You’ve got several hundred top-rate journalists competing to break these stories and you can’t turn to any one organisation and say they didn’t get the stories so therefore they’re not trying. I think the BBC has done fine.” The same can be said for most newspapers. Although staunchly Tory and a supporter of Johnson’s, the Telegraph has actively pursued this story. It exposed the parties which arguably did most damage with traditional Conservative supporters: the two boozy events held in Downing Street the night before the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral. After the veteran MP David Davis’s intervention last week, calling on Johnson to resign, it led with a sober assessment of Johnson’s plight and ran a sympathetic interview with Davis inside. Likewise, the Sunday Times and the Times, less to the right than the Telegraph but still firmly Conservative, have not shied from putting Johnson and his flailing No 10 regime under the spotlight. A conspicuous exception to this robust approach is the Times newspapers’ stablemate, the Sun. When Johnson was avoiding saying whether he attended the No 10 garden party, the paper ran a rather lame front page with the headline “It’s my party and I’ll lie low if I want to”. Inside it suggested he should go if he didn’t sort out the problem, but last week it was back to solid support, with feelgood front pages about dropping Covid restrictions. Instead, its main target has been another character who has also had to apologise to the Queen recently: Prince Andrew. That may well be because royals sell more tabloids than politicians, even one as populist and media-savvy as Johnson. But there could also be another disincentive for the paper to make a fuss. One of the two events that took place on 21 April last year, on the eve of Philip’s funeral, was a leaving do for director of communications James Slack. By all accounts it was a lively affair, with staff sent out to fill a suitcase with alcohol as lockdown measures remained in place. Shortly afterwards, Slack began his new job – as deputy editor of the Sun.",News/Media,Scooped: it was the ‘mainstream media’ that brought Boris Johnson low,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/22/how-boris-johnson-alienated-the-whole-british-media
