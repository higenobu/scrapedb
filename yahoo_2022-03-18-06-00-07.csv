3/18/2022,"Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, proposed cutting the IRS budget in half. IRS chief Chuck Rettig said ""you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely."" The IRS is grappling with underfunding and understaffing amid new pandemic responsibilities. The IRS is currently contending with a reduced budget, staff, and new pandemic-era responsibilities, with the agency trying to dig itself out of a hole of millions of unprocessed returns and late refunds. Both the Treasury Department and the IRS have said that the agency needs much more long-term funding to get running at an acceptable capacity. Then there's Republican Sen. Rick Scott's solution: Shrink the IRS's budget by 50%. That formed part of his ""Rescue America"" plan that he rolled out last month. He pitched it as a Republican agenda, though one that he introduced as a rank-and-file Republican instead of in his role as the head of the party's Senate campaign fundraising arm. Democrats are pummeling its proposed tax hikes for Americans ahead of the midterms. In a Thursday Ways & Means Committee hearing, Representative Lloyd Doggett asked IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig about the potential impact of halving the agency's budget. ""If the IRS budget was cut by 50%, you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely,"" Rettig said. ""We account for 96% of the gross revenue of the United States of America! How are you going to fund what we need to fund and what every American deserves?"" Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, said that ""perhaps shutting it down is exactly what those who'd make this outrageous proposal have in mind."" But the architect of the plan didn't see it that way. Scott defended his agenda and argued he didn't intend to shutter the IRS by proposing drastic budget cuts. ""We got to make this system where we don't need a big IRS,"" the Florida Republican told Insider in a brief interview. ""We got to make the system simple. I mean the IRS, it's so complex. If you can get lawyers and accountants you can figure out how to not pay taxes, it shouldn't be that way."" As Scott noted, tax evasion is a potentially trillion dollar problem. The Treasury Department has said that the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers dodge $163 billion in taxes annually. But the answer to cutting down on that tax evasion might be the opposite of Scott's proposal. The Treasury has said that allocating $80 billion in funding to the IRS for enforcement — the amount President Joe Biden proposed in the currently defunct Build Back Better Act — could bring in $700 billion in tax revenue in the next ten years. The IRS and Treasury Department have repeatedly sounded alarm bells over the agency's funding, or lack thereof. Heading into 2022, the IRS was still sitting on over 6 million unprocessed refunds, according to national taxpayer advocate Erin Collins. Rettig has been outspoken about the ""severe limitations"" that the IRS faces ""without long-term, predictable funding,"" and the burden that that places on taxpayers waiting for checks.

3/18/2022,"LONDON – A British air-defense system that has only been in service for a few months is being deployed to Poland to bolster that country’s capabilities, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced during a visit to Warsaw March 17. The move is part of a wider upgrade of NATO assets in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, which has seen personnel and equipment deployed to the region to deter possible Russian aggression. “The deployment of Sky Sabre medium-range, anti-air system to Poland with 100 personnel will help protect her airspace from any further aggression from Russia,” Wallace said following a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Blaszczak. Late last year London and Warsaw announced they had signed a letter of intent to develop a Polish air defense system based on Sky Sabre. The British have yet to announce when they expect to field the system, but it is thought likely the deployment will not last longer than six months. Provision of the system for duties in Poland is possible because a long-planned delivery to the British Army is being accelerated. The Sky Sabre deployment is the second British initiative to bolster Eastern European nations’ air defenses. Earlier this month the British revealed they had agreed in principle to provide StarStreak short-range air defense missiles to the Ukraine, Poland’s neighbor to the east. The MBDA-developed Sky Sabre system officially took over from the Rapier missile as Britain’s medium-range, anti-air weapon at the start of this year. The weapon is already to be deployed in the Falkland Island as part of the British territories’ defenses. The system comprises the Sky Sabre missile alongside a Saab-built Giraffe agile, multi-beam surveillance radar and Rafael command-and-control equipment. Meanwhile, the German defense ministry announced Thursday it would supply Poland’s southern neighbor Slovakia with Patriot air-defense capabilities. Officials in Berlin declined to provide details, citing security concerns. Slovakia shares a border with Ukraine measuring roughly 60 miles north to south. The commitment follows through on a pledge by Germany to also deploy a company-strong Army formation for an “enhanced vigilance activity battlegroup” to Slovakia. The unit is expected to grow to a full battlegroup size by April.

3/18/2022,"Russian oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich is on the move—and so are his superyachts. After being slapped with sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the billionaire was last seen on March 14 at an airport in Israel, where he has dual citizenship, according to Reuters. More from Robb Report UK Bans the Export of Luxury Goods to Russia Amid Ukraine Invasion Mercedes-Benz Could Lose $2.2 Billion in Assets if Russia Moves Forward With Its Nationalization Plan Porsche Is Reportedly Halting Production Because of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine Abramovich, who is currently worth an estimated $7.1 billion, according to Forbes, appears to be moving his yachts to safer waters. His 533-foot superyacht Eclipse, normally anchored year-round in the Caribbean, has been sailing east towards the Mediterranean since February 21, according to global ship tracking platform MarineTraffic. As of Wednesday, the ship is located off the coast of Algeria and is still sailing east with no port destination specified. The yacht, estimated to be worth over $600 million, is one of the largest and most expensive in the world, and seems to be cruising towards Abramovich’s other yacht, Solaris, in the Ionian Sea. Courtesy Lloyd Werft The 461-foot Solaris is currently located in the Ionian Sea off the western coast of Greece and heading south. Solaris was most recently at a port in Barcelona, where it had reportedly been receiving repairs since late 2021. The ship left without declaring a destination. However, it’s possible both Solaris and Eclipse are heading towards each other and are even eyeing ports in Israel where Abramovich is considered safe from sanctions. Though a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Abramovich has denied having close ties to the Kremlin. This hasn’t stopped dozens of nations, including the US, UK and several EU countries, from implementing sanctions and asset freezes on the oligarch. The sanctions are part of a concerted multinational effort to pressure Russia’s wealthiest and most powerful individuals to help bring Russia’s war on Ukraine to an end. Perhaps sensing the economic pressures to come, Abramovich made headlines just days after the Ukraine invasion for stating his intention to sell his beloved Chelsea Football Club in London for $2.5 billion. The billionaire said all proceeds would benefit Ukrainian refugees and “victims of the war,” which, notably, may also include Russian soldiers. Associated Press Russians own up to 10 percent of the world’s megayachts, so Abramovich is just one of many Russian billionaires who are moving their assets to avoid seizure by international authorities. This week, Italian police seized Russian oligarch Andrey Melnichenko’s 486-foot Sailing Yacht A, and earlier this month, France impounded the yacht Amore Vero, owned by Russian oil billionaire Igor Sechin. Other Russian billionaires have had their yachts impounded in other EU countries. This isn’t the first time Russian oligarchs’ whereabouts have been made public. Florida teen Jack Sweeney, who once tracked Elon Musk’s jet, created a Twitter account—@RUOligarchJets—dedicated to tracking the private jets of Russian oligarchs, which is updated daily.

3/18/2022,"The clearly deranged boyfriend of Gretta Vedler, a Russian model who famously accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a “psychopath,” has reportedly confessed to murdering her and keeping her corpse hidden for a year inside a suitcase, according to Russian media reports. Vedler, 23, vanished soon after criticizing Putin in January 2021, and friends quickly grew concerned for her safety after she continued to post on her social media account without responding to their calls. “Given the fact that Putin went through a lot of humiliation in childhood, he could not stand up for himself due to his [slight] physical form, it is not surprising that he left after law school and joined the KGB,” Vedler wrote in a now-removed social media post, according to the Mirror. “Such people are timid and fearful from childhood, afraid of noise and darkness, strangers, so traits such as caution, restraint, and lack of communication are developed early in their character. I can only assume, in my opinion, a clear psychopathy or sociopathy is seen in him.” She disappeared shortly after the post, which was apparently removed by Russian censors. This week, Vedler’s erstwhile boyfriend, Dmitry Korovin, confessed to strangling her to death after the two argued not over politics but over money in Moscow in February 2021. He said he continued to post old photos on her social accounts to not arouse suspicion that she might be dead, according to authorities. Since her disappearance, many Russian activists expressed concern that she was either taken into custody or worse after her anti-Putin post, which coincided with a crackdown on dissidents in the country. Her friend Evgeniy Foster, a Ukrainian blogger who lives in Kharkiv, was fearful that Putin had ordered her demise, posting a number of accusations on his Instagram account. Instead Korovin told Russian authorities—who published a video of his confession in Russian media—that he slept by her corpse for three days after strangling her to death, and then bought a suitcase to dispose of her body, which he kept in the trunk of his car for nearly a year. It is unclear when he abandoned the car, but authorities found it this week after being tipped off by a friend of Korovin who filed a missing-person report, reportedly at his insistence. The suitcase with Vedler’s body was found some 300 miles from Moscow. Vedler’s friends said she told them that Korovin was “abusive” and angry. Read more at The Daily Beast.
