4/7/2022,"A video purports to prove that Russian troops dug trenched in Chernobyl's ""Red Forest."" Russian troops may have exposed themselves to dangerous levels of radiation by digging there. The video, shared by the Ukrainian military, is undated and its origin is unclear. A video shared by the Ukrainian military purports to show proof that Russian troops dug trenches in the Red Forest, the most contaminated area of Chernobyl's exclusion zone. The video, which is not dated and of unknown origin, seems to show drone footage. It depicts land that looks dug up, in a continuous shot that pans to an image of the sarcophagus covering the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the distance. The video was shared by the Ukrainian military on Twitter on Wednesday. It came with the text: ""Video proof. Russian command did order its soldiers to dig fortifications near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in the radioactive Red Forest in March, 2022."" Chornobyl is an alternate spelling. The tweet can be seen below: A road can be seen in the video which appears to correspond with a location on maps of the region, which would put the recording site about 3.5 km (2 miles) from the power plant. The Russian troops left the site last week, five weeks after invading the Chernobyl exclusion zone on February 24. Energoatom, Ukraine's state power company, said that Russian troops dug trenches while they were there and subsequently suffered signs of radiation sickness. The International Atomic Energy Agency, an organization affiliated with the United Nations that offers advice on radioactive safety, has said that it is investigating the claims. According to unnamed Ukrainian workers who were at the Chernobyl site while Russia occupied it, troops drove armored vehicles through the Red Forest without any protective gear and exposed themselves to radioactive dust. One worker said some troops seemed unaware of the 1986 disaster that made Chernobyl synonymous with nuclear disaster.

4/7/2022,"WORCESTER - A federal jury in Worcester has convicted an East Brookfield man of illegally flying a helicopter around his property and lying to the Federal Aviation Administration. Antonio Santonastaso, who authorities say previously participated in the theft of a helicopter from a Norwood airport, was convicted Tuesday following a three-day trial on three of four charges he faced, records show. More: FAA puts an end to chopper trips A jury convicted Santonastaso, 62, of one count of serving as an airman without an airman certificate, one count of making false statements to federal agents and one count of attempted witness tampering. It acquitted him of one count of making false statements to other agencies. According to a news release from the office of U.S. Attorney Rachael S. Rollins, Santonastaso flew a Robinson R-22 helicopter – taking off and landing from his backyard – more than 50 times between April 28, 2018, and Nov. 11, 2018, despite having no pilot’s license. Santonastaso had lost his license in 2000 after he participated in the theft of a helicopter from Norwood Memorial Airport, authorities said, but when questioned about that by the FAA, “made false statements regarding his eligibility to pilot the helicopter. “Specifically, Santonastaso falsely claimed that the events that gave rise to the FAA’s revocation of his license were a fabrication,” authorities wrote. “Evidence at trial also established that Santonastaso attempted to corruptly persuade an individual with the intent to hinder, delay and prevent that individual from reporting his illegal helicopter flights to law enforcement.” According to Rollins’ office, Santonastaso, who is due to be sentenced Oct. 5, faces up to 20 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. “Mr. Santonastaso demonstrated a blatant disregard for FAA rules and regulations by operating a helicopter out of his backyard without a license on numerous occasions,” Rollins said in a statement. “Every time he did so, he endangered himself, his community and the general public on the ground. “My office will continue our work to detect and hold accountable individuals who violate federal laws and regulations, as well as those who make false statements to federal investigators and who attempt to tamper with witnesses.” Rollins thanked the Northeast U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General for its work. Joseph Harris, the Special Agent-in-Charge for that department, said in the release that the case demonstrates it “will continue working with our law enforcement and prosecutorial partners to support the safety and integrity of the nation’s airspace.” The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Evan Panich and Danial Bennett.

4/7/2022,"By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -Russia has warned countries at the United Nations that a yes vote or abstention on a U.S. push to suspend Moscow from the Human Rights Council will be viewed as an ""unfriendly gesture"" with consequences for bilateral ties, according to a note seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The United States said on Monday it would seek Russia's suspension after Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly in New York is due to vote on the measure on Thursday. A two-thirds majority of voting members - abstentions do not count - can suspend a country from the 47-member Geneva-based Human Rights Council for committing gross and systematic violations of human rights. Russia's mission to the United Nations urged countries to ""speak out against the anti-Russian resolution."" It was not immediately clear how many countries received the note. ""It is worth mentioning that not only support for such an initiative, but also an equidistant position in the vote (abstention or non-participation) will be considered as an unfriendly gesture,"" the note read. ""In addition, the position of each country will be taken into account both in the development of bilateral relations and in the work on the issues important for it within the framework of the U.N.,"" it read. Russia's mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the letter because it was not public. Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the Human Rights Council. ""Russia blatantly and openly threatening countries who vote to suspend them from the U.N. Human Rights Council is only further evidence that Russia needs to be suspended immediately from the U.N. Human Rights Council,"" Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, said on Wednesday. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with 141 and 140 votes in favor. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. Russia denies attacking civilians in Ukraine and Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Tuesday that while Bucha was under Russian control ""not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence."" The General Assembly has previously suspended a country from the Human Rights Council. In March 2011, it unanimously suspended Libya because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to then-leader Muammar Gaddafi.
