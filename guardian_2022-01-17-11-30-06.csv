1/17/2022,"The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, says Novak Djokovic was deported because he tried to breach entry rules at the border, even though the immigration minister did not dispute the tennis star’s belief he had a valid medical exemption. The Serbian tennis player boarded an Emirates flight from Melbourne to Dubai on Sunday night, hours after the full federal court upheld the minister’s decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa.  Morrison said on Monday the world men’s No 1 had failed to comply with “the rules”, that to enter Australia that “you either have to be vaccinated or you have to have a valid medical exemption and show evidence of it”. “It’s as simple as that,” the prime minister told 2GB radio. “This is about someone who sought to come to Australia and not comply with the entry rules at our border. That’s what this is about.” The health minister, Greg Hunt, also argued on Monday that Djokovic’s medical exemption “wasn’t valid”. Minister for Health and Aged Care @GregHuntMP says Novak Djokovic's medical exemption ""wasn't valid"".""The rules are very clear. People can enter if they're vaccinated or if they have a medical exemption. He didn't have that... Prior infection is not a valid medical exemption."" But the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, did not make alleged non-compliance with entry rules a central plank of his reasons for cancelling Djokovic’s visa a second time on Friday. In his formal decision, Hawke said he assumed that Djokovic “entered Australia consistently” with Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) documents, even though the minister noted there was a dispute about this in the earlier court proceedings. “For present purposes, I will assume that Mr Djokovic’s position is correct rather than seeking to get to the bottom of this here,” Hawke wrote. Hawke said he weighed that up as a factor against cancelling the visa, but added: “That I am assuming he currently has a medical reason not to be vaccinated does not ultimately affect my reasoning on health and good order as explained below.” The immigration minister also noted Djokovic – who cited a recent Covid infection as a reason for not being vaccinated – had received a supportive letter from Tennis Australia. “I have taken into account that upon receipt of this letter, Mr Djokovic considered that he had a valid medical exemption to come to Australia, and that he would therefore be entitled to remain in Australia.” Hawke’s overarching argument for cancelling the visa was that Djokovic’s presence in Australia “may pose a health risk to the Australian community” because it “may foster anti-vaccination sentiment”. The immigration minister used powers under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel Djokovic’s visa “on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so”. Morrison denied on Monday that the decision to cancel the visa had the potential to encourage anti-vaccination elements even more. “Well, I don’t believe so, and because we’ve made it very clear that the rules are the rules,” he said. Morrison also denied a double standard, given that several Coalition politicians had been spreading anti-vaccination messages. The prime minister said 2GB host Ben Fordham was “conflating two different issues”. “In Australia, if you’re an Australian, you’re a citizen, you’re resident and you’re a citizen, you can be here and you can express your views,” Morrison said. Morrison left open the possibility that Djokovic might be allowed back into Australia at some point over the next three years. Asked what Djokovic would have to do to be allowed back into Australia next year, Morrison said: “I’m not going to sort of precondition any of that or say anything that would not enable the minister to make the various calls they have to make. I mean, it does go over a three-year period, but there is the opportunity for them to return in the right circumstances and that would be considered at the time.” The rules say that a person who receives an adverse decision will not be able to be granted a visa for a period of three years, except in certain circumstances including compelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia. Labor’s home affairs and immigration spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, welcomed the court’s decision to uphold Hawke’s cancellation of the visa, but said the Australian government “never should have granted Novak Djokovic that visa in the first place”. “This is a series of unforced errors on Mr Morrison’s part, and it’s a mess on our borders,” Keneally told ABC TV. “We are now an international embarrassment, thanks to Mr Morrison’s bungles.” Keneally said some of Morrison’s own MPs and senators have been discouraging vaccination “for months”. “Mr Morrison cannot pretend that he is a wolf, tough on Novak Djokovic, but a lamb in front of his own party room, unwilling to tell people like George Christensen to pull their head in,” she said. Djokovic arrived in Australia on the evening of 5 January. He believed that a visa granted on 18 November and a medical exemption approved by Tennis Australia and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. Djokovic’s visa was first cancelled by the Australian Border Force hours after he arrived at Melbourne airport and he was taken to a detention hotel. Last Monday a federal circuit court judge restored Djokovic’s visa, concluding it was unreasonable for the ABF to renege on a deal to give him more time at the airport to address the exemption issue. Hawke then cancelled Djokovic’s visa on Friday on the basis Djokovic’s presence in Australia might risk “civil unrest” as he is a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment”. On Sunday, chief justice James Allsop announced the court unanimously dismissed Djokovic’s application to overturn the cancellation, with costs to be paid by the tennis star. Allsop explained the decision of the court did not reflect on “the merits or wisdom of the decision” but rather whether it was so irrational as to be unlawful. In a statement on Sunday, Djokovic said he was “extremely disappointed” with the ruling, but said he respected it and would “cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country”.",Sport/Sport,"Novak Djokovic deported for breach of Australia’s border rules, PM says, at odds with government’s legal case",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/novak-djokovic-deported-for-trying-to-breach-australias-border-rules-scott-morrison-says
1/17/2022,"As Omicron spread to at least 50 people in Hong Kong last week the government looked to one place in particular for blame – the city’s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific. Two crew were accused of breaching their home quarantine, going shopping or meeting friends, and spreading the highly transmissible variant in the city. As numbers rose, infection flow charts were published marking cases with the airline’s brand while the government launched inquiries and threatened legal action. Pro-Beijing figures and state media called for punishment. The airline had just come off a government ban on flying key international routes, a punishment for carrying Covid-positive passengers. Around the same time the ban was imposed in late December, quarantine rules were tightened after a pilot tested positive, and then again just days later after three crew also did, and then again after the latest incidents.  On Tuesday, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, described the airline as “a very big noncompliance case” and accused it of sending some crew back to the territory on empty cargo flights to access shorter quarantine periods. “This has to be put under full investigation, and we will take legal action once we have the full evidence of what wrong they went into,” Lam said. Seemingly in desperation to blame HK’s “5th wave” on Cathay Pacific, and deflect attention on the karaoke cluster of government A-list, the pro-Beijing camp appears to be circulating charts like this with great zeal. pic.twitter.com/FWAyFLK1E9 The accusations are the latest chapter in a troubled few years for Cathay, as it navigated Hong Kong’s Covid-19 measures as well as changing politics. The punitive action against the airline has damaged morale as staff face job requirements unheard of just three years ago. Last year, Cathay staff spent a total of 200 years – 76,000 nights – in hotel quarantine or in Hong Kong’s government facility at Penny’s Bay. The whole aviation industry suffered when international travel plummeted in 2020 and 2021, but Cathay was uniquely vulnerable with no domestic market to fall back on. Flights between Hong Kong and London were cut from five to at most one a day. The airline pivoted to cargo but that too suffered. Cathy reported a $2.8bn (£2bn) loss in 2020 and cut thousands of jobs, despite receiving a $5bn government bailout in June of that year. A $972m loss was reported in the first six months of 2021. Cathay had already found its way into the government’s bad books in mid-2019, when it refused to sanction any staff who participated in the pro-democracy protests. In August that year, the Chinese civil aviation authority banned Cathay crew members who had protested from staffing flights in or out of mainland China. After a management change, at least 26 staff who participated in the protests were later reportedly fired. “It’s quite obvious that the flag carrier for Hong Kong is in deep trouble,” said Frederik Gollob, the chair of the European chamber of commerce in Hong Kong. “Cathay is of course a corporate company but has also had a social function for Hong Kong for decades. “It’s certainly not a great sign seeing almost all flight activity for passenger flights [drop] and the significantly reduced capacity on the cargo side happening at the moment, as a result of very strict regulations for Covid-19. “We’re extremely thankful to all the Cathay crew and the company for doing everything they can to keep us connected to the outside world and keeping up goods flow. Also the international carriers who do the same.” Hong Kong’s pandemic border restrictions are among the strictest in the world, with bans on flights from seven countries and transit passengers from another 140. On a single day last week, just 165 people flew into what was once one of the world’s 10 busiest airports. Arrivals must go into 21 days of expensive quarantine, while thousands of close contacts are also forced into government quarantine at Penny’s Bay. After the Omicron outbreak the centres this week reached breaking point, with reports of power outages, food shortages and people confined for longer than ordered because staff were too overrun to release them. The breaches by crew were serious, but observers have also noted the pressure on Cathay appeared to grow as the government faced scrutiny on legislators who were also accused of breaching guidelines on avoiding large gatherings. Dozens of legislators were sent to Penny’s Bay after they attended a birthday party with a suspected case, including the pro-Beijing firebrand Junius Ho, who took to social media to rail against the government’s system having finally experienced it for himself. Questioned about the comparison, Lam distanced herself from taking responsibility for subordinates despite demanding Cathay’s senior management to do so days earlier. Cathay has said it will cooperate with both inquiries, and apologised for the “disruption and anguish” for the “unacceptable noncompliance” by the crew members, who have reportedly been fired. But the airline’s chair, Patrick Healy, said the alleged breaches overshadow the overwhelming majority who had been professional under “incredibly challenging conditions”. The rules for airline crews in Hong Kong have changed frequently, especially in the last month. Tightened quarantine rules have led to staff shortages, flight cancellations and the suspension of cargo services – the one arm still making money. On Christmas Day last year, 25 imported cases of coronavirus were found – Korean Air, Emirates and Cathay were banned from running particular routes. Also in December the government ordered flights operating in and out of mainland China could only be staffed by crew from a “closed loop” of flights and hotel quarantines for consecutive weeks before heading home after another fortnight in quarantine. “The crew who joined that are literally just travelling from hotel to aircraft, aircraft to hotel for months,” said Grace Siu, the external vice-chair for the airline’s flight attendants union. When the rules changed after the breach, there was little notice for staff, she said. “Many of us were not in Hong Kong, we were outside the city or in flight, and got the message that we have to go to the hotel to do quarantine and not home.” Siu said the union did not have data on staff who have left, but it does field plenty of queries from struggling members. She said most staff had complied with rules that have taken an enormous toll, as they have done on flight crews globally, adding that the crackdown over a couple of breaches had hit hard. “Of course it affects the whole crew’s morale,” Sui said. Earlier this month the airline union posted a meme to its Facebook page. In the retro illustration styled as a 1950s holiday scene, a young snorkel-wearing boy gives a thumbs up from the mouth of a great white shark. Below the image says: “Stay Positive!” On 31 December, Andy Wong, the general manager of corporate affairs at Cathay, said further restrictions would lead to dramatic disruptions to the supply chain, and could lead to reductions in flights in order to protect crew and maintain general safety. On Tuesday Lam told people to prepare for higher prices and item shortages because of the new rules, but that the city had no choice if they were to fight the outbreak. Gollob said the international business community had raised their concerns with government last year, but the continuing crisis worried them. It is increasingly difficult to maintain a life in Hong Kong with family abroad, or to attract staff to the city – including airline crews for either a permanent stationing or simply manning a flight that could end with them in Penny’s Bay for weeks. “I feel that the international community has been extremely resilient in those two years but energy levels are, I would say, close to zero, and it’s increasingly hard to maintain the status quo,” he said. In a video message to staff, Healy thanked them for their sacrifices during the pandemic, including extended time separated from family. “What you have been through during the past two years is quite simply unparalleled.”",News/World news,‘Deep trouble’: Cathay Pacific descends further as punitive pandemic worsens,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/deep-trouble-cathay-pacific-descends-further-as-punitive-pandemic-worsens
1/17/2022,"Banks in New Zealand are rejecting home-loans over minor frivolous spending, including a $187 Kmart Christmas shop and a daily drink bought at a corner store, and money spent on pets or petrol, pushing the government to investigate whether banks are overreacting to new finance rules designed to protect vulnerable borrowers from predatory lenders. The Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act (CCCFA), updated in early December, requires all lenders to complete thorough checks to ensure loans are suitable and affordable for their customers.  But finance leaders and opposition politicians say the rules have compelled banks to take an ultra-conservative approach to lending, pushing homeownership further out of reach for many as the country battles a housing crisis. There has been a sharp dip in home-loan approvals since the new rules were introduced – from about 30,000 a month to 23,000 in December – according to Centrix, a credit reporting agency. “One in five mortgage loan approvals appear to have been hit by the new CCCFA regulations. Consumers that were previously approved are no longer,” its managing director Keith McLaughlin said, adding that this amounts to a decrease in lending of $1.9bn from November to December. The chief executive of Financial Advice NZ, Katrina Shanks, said the new rules required banks and other lenders to go through an individual’s spending habits with a fine-tooth comb. Entertainment, food (including take-aways), gym memberships, clothing, personal care, childcare and more are included. Before the rule changes, the banks had the ability to determine some of these costs as “discretionary spending”. A December survey of Financial Advice NZ’s members revealed roughly 300 examples of lenders being restricted in the loans they could offer to would-be borrowers because of the rules, Shank said. “What has happened is the net is so wide on who this new prescription is applied to, that it has hit the average New Zealander. Most New Zealanders wouldn’t be considered vulnerable, but the way this legislation has been written, it captures all New Zealanders.” The rules also make directors and senior managers of lending organisations personally liable for up to $200,000 if found to be breaking the rules, which has made banks extremely risk-averse, Shanks said. The New Zealand Bankers’ Association chief executive Roger Beaumont told Stuff the law change meant banks had “much less flexibility or room for lender discretion than was previously the case.” The minister of commerce and consumer affairs, Dr David Clark, has now asked the council of financial regulators “to bring forward their investigation into whether banks and lenders are implementing the CCCFA as intended”. “Banks appear to be managing their lending more conservatively at present, and this is likely due to global economic conditions. It may also be that in the initial weeks of implementing the new CCCFA requirements there has been a decision to unduly err on the side of caution.” Clark added that a number of factors affecting the market have occurred at the same time as the rule changes, including increases to the official cash rate, changes to how much a bank can lend against mortgaged property compared to the value of that property, and an increase in house prices and local government rates.",News/World news,New Zealand banks reject home loans over spending on Christmas gifts and pets as tighter rules hit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/new-zealand-banks-reject-home-loans-over-spending-on-christmas-gifts-and-pets-as-tighter-rules-hit
