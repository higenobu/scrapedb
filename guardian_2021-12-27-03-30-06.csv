12/27/2021,"Boris Johnson is expected to examine crucial hospital data on Monday before any new announcement on Covid measures but has no plans to recall his cabinet, with ministers still deeply sceptical of further legal curbs. Sources said the prime minister would “take stock” after being encouraged by improving data on Friday, a sign that No 10 is leaning away from stricter curbs in England, but Downing Street sources said he would act quickly if there were new causes for concern.  Instead, Johnson will receive only his regular data briefing over the bank holiday with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty – expected to be knighted in the new years’ honours – and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Cabinet ministers are still highly sceptical of further legal restrictions, a week after a tense three-hour cabinet meeting in which the majority pushed back against any new curbs. One cabinet minister said the positive data on Omicron’s severity – a Health Security Agency analysis found those catching Omicron are 50% to 70% less likely to need hospital care compared with previous variants – proved they had been right to hold out. “The data so far is still struggling to be persuasive of legal changes to be required,” one cabinet minister said. Another said it was “right that we didn’t rush last time given positive, early data”. But a hospital doctors’ trade union urged ministers to implement further measures without delay to help the NHS, including limits on household mixing and table service only in hospitality venues. Dr Paul Donaldson, the general secretary of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, warned Johnson that “it would be ludicrous” not to respond more decisively to Omicron, and that Christmas mingling will inevitably have spread Covid. “There is a high probability we are moving too late,” said Donaldson, a consultant microbiologist. “We will soon start to see the impact of Christmas. We are holding out hope that hospitalisations are at the lower end of projections. But given the uncertainty we face it would be ludicrous not to take additional precautions,” he added. The HCSA also wants to see social distancing measures applied in retail and hospitality settings, such as mask-wearing, table spacing, limits on capacity and queueing systems, as well as social distancing and bubbles in all schools and continued working from home. The NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts in England, said any further steps would help the NHS, given the rising number of hospitalisations and staff off sick due to the virus. There were 1,171 people admitted to hospital across the UK in the previous 24 hours, the government disclosed on Friday. “Any new restrictions which are brought in to help ease the pressure on the NHS need to be clearly explained to the public. Confusion and complacency can make any new restrictions ineffective,” said Matthew Taylor, its chief executive. The prime minister has pledged to his restive backbenchers, a significant number of whom rebelled over the last set of restrictions, that he will recall parliament before implementing new restrictions but it is possible any vote could be retrospective, should the decision be taken later in the week. Johnson faced significant opposition from his cabinet before Christmas during a three-hour meeting where the decision was taken to delay any new curbs until after the festive weekend. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, were said to be the most sceptical of restrictions, while the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, and culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, have urged the most caution. On Friday, papers released from government scientific advisers showed modelling for the impact of implementing “step 2” restrictions from Tuesday – a date now unlikely to be practicable. That would mean an end to indoor gatherings and introducing the rule of six outdoors, with bars and restaurants only able to serve outdoors. The modelling suggested that restrictions could reduce deaths by 18% if kept in place until mid-January or 39% if retained until the end of March. Cabinet resistance to further restrictions is also likely be deepened by the collapse in Johnson’s own poll ratings over the scandal of No 10 Christmas parties and deep rifts with his own party over plan B restrictions to enforce home working, mask-wearing and new Covid passes for large venues. Speaking to the Observer on Sunday, Conservative MPs suggested those who wished to eventually replace Johnson should resist further Covid restrictions. Johnson and the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, are said to be determined that schools reopen on time in January. Step 2 restrictions would allow schools to remain open, as well as non-essential shops, subject to social distancing rules. New coronavirus restrictions come into force from Monday in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. From Boxing Day, a maximum of six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, as well as other restrictions on numbers for larger events. In Scotland, up to three households can meet, with 1-metre distancing between groups at indoor and outdoor venues such as bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and gyms. Table service is also required at places where alcohol is served. Northern Ireland is also recommending restricting socialising to three households, while up to six people can meet in pubs, bars and restaurants. However, there are serious concerns in the NHS that the large number of frontline personnel falling sick as infections spiral because of Omicron is hampering the service’s ability to provide care. Staff absences in England due to Covid have been soaring during December, the latest official figures showed last Thursday. The number of days lost to illness caused by Covid went up by 38% to 124,855 in the week to 19 December, while the number of staff off sick rose by 54% from 12,240 to 18,829, both compared with the previous week. At some hospitals in London, which has been hit first and worst by the new variant, the number of staff off ill with Covid has trebled since the start of the month, NHS England’s figures showed. Taylor said that the service was facing a “double emergency” of sharply rising staff absences due to illness at the same time as the demand for hospital care was rising. On Friday the government said that in the previous 24 hours, 1,171 patients had been hospitalised across the UK because of the disease. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, has said that the loss of frontline staff to sickness is “a big worry” for hospital bosses who are facing growing demand from patients, especially as the NHS in England has almost 100,000 vacancies anyway.",News/World news,Boris Johnson to examine hospital data before decision on Covid rules,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/boris-johnson-to-examine-hospital-data-before-decision-on-covid-rules
12/27/2021,"Boxing Day swimmers braved the cold weather to take their traditional dip after parts of England and Scotland woke up to snow on Sunday. Wintry weather that was forecast to produce blizzard-like conditions across the English-Scottish border gave way to rain, and the Environment Agency put flood warnings in place in North Yorkshire and Devon.  Families in Tow Law, County Durham, were among those who went sledging as the area was blanketed in snow. Across the United Kingdom snow fell overnight, with the highest parts of Scotland blanketed with a couple of centimetres and parts of the north of England seeing as much as 5cm at its peaks. On Saturday it had been a white Christmas for parts of the UK as people in Shetland and eastern Scotland woke up to snow. Swimmers at Ayr beach took part in a charity swim for Ayrshire Cancer Support on Boxing Day. And in Redcar, bathers braved the cold waters of the North Sea as they took part in their annual swim. The event attracts hundreds of people each year, some wearing fancy dress, as they help to raise money for a number of charities. Southern England experienced less dramatic weather, with people strolling along the Long Walk in Windsor Great Park on a wet and dreary Boxing Day there. The Met Office forecast cloudy weather with outbreaks of rain and drizzle across northern and eastern areas of the UK towards the end of Boxing Day. It said this would ease and be followed by a “good deal of low cloud with some fog patches developing”. It said there was a risk of frost in some western parts of the UK and further rain in the south-west later. The rain in the north was likely to clear on Monday. The Environment Agency said there was a flood warning for the North Sea at Scarborough Sandside on Sunday. “Overtopping waves and spray are expected as a result of strong onshore winds” on Sunday evening, it said. “Please be careful along beaches, coastal and estuary footpaths and roads in the area, as large waves and sea spray can be dangerous with debris.” In another flood warning, it said river levels remained high near Exeter after heavy rain on Christmas Day. A Met Office yellow warning was initially expanded to include an area from the Scottish borders to Derbyshire, as well as farther east over Durham and Northumberland, due to an increased chance of snow accumulating over the southern Pennines overnight. A second was in place for a smaller area north of Glasgow and across the Forth valley. These were removed later in the day.",News/UK news,Swimmers and sledders defy wet and chilly Boxing Day weather,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/26/charity-swimmers-take-the-plunge-on-wet-and-chilly-boxing-day
12/27/2021,"Rafael Behr’s verdict on the prime minister is compelling (The Tories said we could have our cake and eat it – now they are stuffed and voters are hungry, 22 December). But I wonder whether we are still in thrall to the alleged charisma of Boris Johnson, even as we reveal its function as a fig leaf. Behr claims, for example, that “Boris Johnson rose to the top by getting people to like him. His problems are the result of them subsequently getting to know him.” Though this makes sense superficially, in fact it lets too many people off the hook.  There must be many hundreds of thousands of us with only an armchair acquaintance of Johnson who were thoroughly unconvinced of his alleged competence; who needed only his pre-political CV to gauge his character; who needed only a glance at the reckless, destructive, unabashed indifference with which he discharged the one ministerial position he held (and lost) as foreign secretary, to know his appeal had all the magnetism of a catastrophic black hole. Behr’s claim for the erstwhile supporters of Johnson is redolent of the frantic back-covering manoeuvres deployed by the many friends of that former would-be mayor of London and darling of the Tories, the disgraced peer Jeffrey Archer. He, too, was a proponent of monumental lies too numerous to mention. It just is not credible for anyone to claim ignorance of Johnson’s obvious flaws, however enamoured they may have been with his charms. It took a prison sentence for the party to concede that its peerless fundraiser Jeffrey Archer was a fraud. Why on earth should we entertain the idea that enduring two years of misery was necessary to discover shortcomings in Johnson that were obvious, palpable and painfully apparent from the start?Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex  Thank you, Rafael Behr, for such a brilliant critique of Boris Johnson.

Statistics show the top order fairs poorly compared with other countries, and well adrift of their six main rivals.

12/27/2021,"I was surprised and delighted to read your article ‘A world first’: Devon calls victory in 27-year war on termites (21 December). Surprised because I assumed the story had long since disappeared into the mists of history; delighted because it is, as Damian McBride is quoted as saying, a classic illustration of public service at its best. As the minister responsible for setting up the Termite Eradication Programme in 1998, I can vouch for the sustained commitment of the team of experts, led since 2003 by Ed Suttie, who implemented the very challenging programme of activity necessary to eradicate what could have been a seriously damaging spread of termite infestation across the country.  In my book Substance Not Spin I described the early stages of the eradication programme, including the “nightmare scenario” of the particular species of termite at Saunton developing wings and escaping beyond the area in which at that time they were contained. Had this happened, it would have been almost impossible to halt the spread and consequent damage and cost. The fact that it has taken more than 20 years to get to a point where there can be confidence that the Saunton termite colony has been eradicated is a measure of just how challenging the process has been. It also provides a warning. The termites at Saunton are thought to have arrived in packing material around a plant imported from southern Europe many years before their presence was spotted. This could very easily happen again. If so, the lessons learned from Saunton will need to be applied quickly and with similar determination if Britain is to remain free of termites.Nick RaynsfordLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/27/2021,"The Guardian keeps the readership excellently apprised of the (mis)behaviour of some of our ministers and MPs. Surely the time is right to bring politics closer to the lived experience of more voters. I suggest two changes that could contribute to this. First, rather than MPs being able to tell us proudly that they are accountable every five years at the ballot box, what if they were required to participate in an annual independent appraisal process that would be published in the spirit of transparency?  This is a common way of monitoring performance and encouraging personal professional development. Among other things, any new paid positions would be declared and discussed, plus how the appraisee contributes to life in the House of Commons in terms of committee work and speeches, as well as a record of constituency activity. Second, to attempt to counter some of the misleading statements made in session or at prime minister’s questions, there should be a rapid fact-checking facility to try to make ministers and backbenchers more careful in their use of language and statistics both in the House of Commons and in interviews. Feedback would be delivered by the Speaker or in the media as soon as possible after the event, with a requirement for the person responsible to issue a correction. Gradually, it may become possible to have more confidence in our representatives, some of whom could state an aspiration to be better acquainted with the truth at their annual appraisal.Dr Andrew BatesWhitley Bay, Tyne and Wear  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/27/2021,"Cases of Covid-19 will continue to surge worldwide due to the Omicron variant, the US chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, said on Sunday, warning Americans not to get complacent amid reports that the variant is less harmful than others.  “If you have many, many, many more people with a less level of severity,” Fauci told ABC’s This Week, “that might kind of neutralise the positive effect of having less severity. “We’re particularly worried about those who are in that unvaccinated class ... those are the most vulnerable ones when you have a virus that is extraordinarily effective in getting to people.” Fauci also welcomed Donald Trump’s endorsement of Covid-19 vaccines and boosters, saying: “We’ll take anything we can get about getting people vaccinated.” But Trump prompted rebarbative anger among supporters and amid a huge case surge, with knock-on effects feared for the economy and schools, Fauci also admitted the US had “to do better” on providing access to testing. Speaking to Axios, Fauci said it was “conceivable that sooner or later everybody will have been infected and/or vaccinated or boosted”. “When you get to that point,” he said, “unless you have a very bizarre variant come in that evades all protection – which would be unusual – then I think you could get to that point where you have this at a steady level.” But he also suggested fourth shots might yet be needed. On ABC, he was asked why “we still don’t have affordable tests widely available to anybody who needs it”. “If you look at the beginning of the [Biden] administration,” Fauci said, “… there were essentially no rapid point-of-care home tests available. Now, there are over nine of them and more coming. Production has been rapidly upscaled. “… But the situation where you have such a high demand, a conflation of events, Omicron stirring people to get appropriately concerned and wanting to get tested as well as [a] run on tests during the holiday season – we’ve obviously got to do better. “I think things will improve greatly as we get into January, but that doesn’t help us today and tomorrow. So you’re right, [access to testing] is of concern.” Another leading public health expert said he did not think the case for possible fourth vaccine shots needed to be made right now. “If we need it I think our health system is prepared,” Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told Fox News Sunday. “But let’s actually talk about whether we need it or not. And at this moment, based on the data I’ve seen, I’m pretty skeptical that we’re gonna need a fourth shot. “Part of the question is that we have to ask ourselves what are we trying to do? Are we trying to block every single infection? Maybe that’s our goal. If that’s our goal then yes, maybe we need a fourth shot. Or are we just trying to prevent serious illness and death? Which, of course, I think should be our primary goal. “So I’m pretty unconvinced at this moment that we need a fourth shot … let’s get a lot more data before we even really start seriously thinking about it.” Jha also said school closures – feared by many parents – should not be increasing. “We know how to keep schools open,” he said, “we know how to keep them safe. This really shouldn’t even be on the table. I’m disappointed to see this happening. “We know that for kids being in school is the right thing for them, for their mental health, for their education. And we have all sorts of tools to keep schools open so I don’t really understand why school districts are [closing schools]. “… There could be times when you have such severe short staffing shortages that it may be hard to keep schools going. That really should be the only context I think at this point.” More than 816,000 have died from Covid in the US but resistance to vaccinations and other public health measures remains strongest in states and counties which voted for Trump. On ABC, Fauci was asked if he thought the former president’s supporters would listen to his support for vaccines. “Well, I certainly hope so,” he said. “We’ll take anything we can get about getting people vaccinated.” But Fauci also said he was “dismayed” when Trump followers in Dallas booed him for supporting vaccines. “I was stunned by that,” he said. “I mean, given the fact of how popular he is with that group, that they would boo him … tells me how recalcitrant they are about being told what they should do. “I think that his continuing to say that people should get vaccinated and articulating that to them, in my mind is a good thing. I hope he keeps it up.” Trump also backed vaccines in an interview with the conservative commentator Candace Owens, saying: “The vaccines work … the ones who get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take the vaccine … and if you take the vaccine, you’re protected.” On Instagram, Owens said Trump was backing vaccines because he was “old” and “came from a time before TV, before internet, before being able to conduct … independent research”. Last week, after Biden recognised his predecessor’s efforts to develop vaccines, Trump said he was “appreciative” . Biden also commended Trump for receiving a booster, saying it “may be one of the few things he and I agree on”. On Sunday, Vice-President Kamala Harris was asked on CBS’s Face the Nation if the unvaccinated were to blame for the Omicron surge. “I don’t think this is a moment to talk about fault,” Harris said. But she added: “It is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalisation if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster. And so I urge people to do that.”",News/World news,Fauci says Omicron surge will continue and Americans must not be complacent,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/fauci-trump-covid-omicron-vaccines
12/27/2021,"My friend Kev Reynolds, who has died aged 78, wrote dozens of walking and trekking guides that covered all sorts of terrains and geographies, from the South Downs to the foothills of Everest. His first book was Walks and Climbs in the Pyrenees, published in 1978 and now in its seventh edition. Many others followed, providing information on trails and routes in the Swiss Alps, the Bernese Oberland, the Valais region and many other areas. He also wrote guides to walking routes in Britain, including the North Downs Way and the Cotswold Way, and was author of the fifth edition of the popular book Trekking the Tour of Month Blanc (2020).  Born in Ingatestone, Essex, Kev was the middle son of Kathleen (nee Coombs) and her husband, Ronald , a painter and decorator. After leaving Moulsham secondary school in Chelmsford in 1958, he began to work in local government as a filing clerk in the local county hall, but escaped to the uplands of the Lake District, Snowdonia, and Scotland whenever he could, quickly becoming a strong, safe climber. In 1967 he married Min (Linda) Dodsworth, after which the couple worked in a hostel in St Moritz in Switzerland, where they were able to explore the mountains in the beautiful Engadine region in the east of the country. Returning to the UK in 1968, they took over the running of a youth hostel in Crockham Hill in Kent, and after contributing a few articles to magazines, Kev struck up a relationship with the writer and author Walt Unsworth, co-founder of the Cicerone Press, which publishes walking, climbing and mountaineering guide books. Kev’s breakthrough came in 1976 when Walt, famous for his slightly gruff but kindly development of authors, suggested that he expand some of the articles he had written about the Pyrenees into a full book for Cicerone. The result was the first edition of Walks and Climbs in the Pyrenees, which set off a host of other books across the next few decades. Much of Kev’s early output focused on Europe, but eventually he broadened his horizons to the Himalayas. A first trip to the region came in 1989, when he went on a trek to Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world, and over the next 30 years he made nearly 20 visits to Nepal and bordering areas in India. Min, too, became a Himalayan trekker, joining Kev on many trips , and books naturally followed – guides to Annapurna, Everest, Kangchenjunga, Langtang and Manaslu – the last of which Kev regarded as “the most beautiful walk in the world”. Kev and Cicerone had formed an unbreakable connection over the decades, so when Cicerone’s 50th anniversary approached in 2019, he gladly took on the orchestration of a book, Fifty Years of Adventure, celebrating that landmark. He supplemented the income he got from writing books by leading walking groups around the Alps for the tour operators Inghams and Thomson, and around the Himalaya with Sherpa Expeditions and Mountain Kingdoms. He was also a photojournalist for outdoor magazines and a lecturer, travelling around the country delivering talks on different mountain ranges. Full as it was, Kev’s outdoor exploration and writing was only a part of his life. As a husband, father and active member of his church and community in Crockham Hill, he touched many lives. He is survived by Min, their daughters Claudia and Ilsa, and grandchildren Charlie and Billy.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Kev Reynolds obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/26/kev-reynolds-obituary
