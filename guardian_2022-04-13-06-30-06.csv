4/13/2022,"Julia Child is having a moment, again. The cook, who brought French cuisine to the American masses, is the subject of a new feature-length documentary, plus a competitive cookery show called The Julia Child Challenge, in which archive footage of Child will serve as a Wizard of Oz-like instructor from a giant screen. And now, there’s Julia (Sky Atlantic), a dramatisation of Child’s move from cookbook author to television pioneer. Though Meryl Streep’s turn as Child, in the 2009 film, Julie and Julia, may have helped to spread her global fame this century, she remains more of an American institution than a British one, though I do hope there is still room in the food biopic canon for The Mary Berry Story. Julia is charming and warm, with all the appeal of comfort food, as unrefined as that can be. Sarah Lancashire is fabulous as Child, managing to neither replicate Streep nor do a surface impression of the real woman. It begins in 1961, just after Mastering the Art of French Cooking has been published and is about to be a huge success, and by the time the story kicks off in earnest, Child is famous enough for people – women, mostly, though also men speaking on behalf of their wives – to stop her as she goes about her business, to tell her that she has transformed their eating habits. At its most basic, Julia is about a successful woman’s rise to even more success, against the odds. This is a Mrs Maisel-esque world, in which men tell Child what she can’t do, and she goes ahead and works out a way to do it anyway. She has the idea to move into television after performing a spot of guerrilla omelette-making on a chatshow about literature. She is introduced as a departure from the presenter’s usual points of interest, “Steinbeck, Capote, Heller or even Rand”, and there is a frequent, occasionally laboured theme running throughout, that domestic pursuits are not frivolous, and women’s work is just as valid as that of the bookish, snobbish men in Child’s world. But there are more layers, with greater depth. David Hyde Pierce is Paul Child, whose career is dwindling as his wife’s continues to grow. While supportive of his wife, he is also one of those snobbish men, and Child’s subtle calculations about how to care for his ego struck me as an honest and complex portrait of a marriage. As Child goes through the menopause, she pushes even harder for her television show to be made. “I want to feel relevant. I want to be relevant,” she says, in a rare moment of vulnerability; it may be Paul who is railing against “the slow train towards death that is forced retirement”, but both of them are fighting the sense that they might be written off as they age. A young, black, female producer, Alice Naman (Brittany Bradford) has to fight the Joan Holloway fight in order to gain respect for herself and Child in the workplace. Child’s editor, Judith Jones (Fiona Glascott), must argue for Child’s relevance, at the cost of lunch with John Updike and the respect of her colleagues in the literary world. But Child’s show does get made, as we know, and it is a huge success, as we also know. That story alone would lack tension, however. Instead, there is a scrappy feel, to the first episode in particular. It has a skittish mood to it, lightly skipping between scenes, a dash of something here, a spoonful of something there, as if to force the narrative to dance. It settles in by episode three, and begins to feel like an indulgent treat, even if it remains a little uneven. The performances are wonderful, almost old-fashioned, reaching for a classic cinema feel. The script is wordy and busy, which adds to the effect. Isabella Rossellini appears as Child’s French co-author, and a testy exchange on the phone between the two of them is a lot of culture-clash fun. James Cromwell is Child’s father, John, whose suffocating expectations of what his daughter should be provide meaty family drama. “I am a lady, Dad, just not your type, and that’s OK,” says Child, tenderly. In among all the family and workplace dramas, and the fight for recognition, a much-needed lightness of touch comes from two places. It lingers lovingly on the food, and the pleasure of eating, and I’d be curious to know how many viewers can get to the end of this without making a snack. And while it is not quite as camp as I had hoped, there is still plenty of room for an innuendo or four. Child knows exactly what she is doing when she talks of “the best coq I ever put in my mouth”, and truly, everyone should witness Lancashire haughtily declaring that she will not be upstaged by a quiche.",Arts/Television & radio,Julia review – Sarah Lancashire’s wonderful performance is straight out of classic cinema,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/julia-review-sarah-lancashires-wonderful-performance-is-straight-out-of-classic-cinema
4/13/2022,"Two goals each from rampant winger Lauren Hemp and her Manchester City teammate Georgia Stanway guided England to an emphatic win over Northern Ireland in Belfast to all but guarantee England’s qualification for the Women’s World Cup. England ensured at least a playoff place for next summer’s tournament but will likely top the group with Austria needing to overturn the superior goal difference of 32 should the Lionesses take a single point from their final two games of the qualifying campaign. Manchester United forward Ella Toone provided two assists and scored England’s second as the Lionesses maintained their perfect qualifying campaign against a team they will meet in their final group game of the Euros in the summer. Northern Ireland were always going to offer a sterner test than North Macedonia had the previous week, not just in terms of the 10-0 score-line. The Lionesses swapped the close-to empty Tose Proeski Arena for a trip to the sold-out Windsor Park, the dry heat of Skopje for a bitterly cold Belfast, a record Northern Ireland crowd in full voice and were facing a team that had not conceded in the first half in six games prior. But it would have been naive to think that Sarina Wiegman’s side, serious contenders for the home Euros ahead, would not overturn a team of players that entered a first ever seven-month full-time spell in January in preparation for a first appearance at a major international tournament this summer. For Kenny Shiel’s team, a crushing 3-1 defeat to Austria, their main rivals for a 2023 World Cup play-off place, last week piled the pressure on for the visit of England – take points off the qualifying Group D leaders, who had won seven in seven prior, scoring 63 times without conceding, and there would have been a glimmer of hope. Instead, England punctured the first-half run of the home team. It had been coming. In the eighth minute England women’s record goalscorer, Ellen White, glanced the ball wide of the far post after a neat cross from Stanway on the right. Two minutes later and 34-year-old Durham defender Sarah McFadden cleared off the line after Beth Mead had pushed Hemp’s cross from the left goal-wards. The ball was in the back of the net midway through the half, after White poked in the rebound when Jacqueline Burns did well to save from Mead, but the flag went up. The goal that broke the deadlock came shortly after. Hemp went on a bursting run into the box on the left before a neat one-two with Toone and the Manchester City winger finished the move by lofting the return over Burns and into the far corner. It was Hemp’s fifth senior international goal, a staggeringly low tally given her influence in the England attack in the last year. England had made two changes to the side that cruised past North Macedonia. Newly-named Euros captain Leah Williamson was positioned alongside Millie Bright in the centre of defence, after sitting out the previous tie while following concussion protocol as a precaution. Jess Carter, who had filled in alongside Bright, was shifted to left-back in place of Demi Stokes. In the 52nd minute England doubled their lead against the team they beat 4-0 at Wembley in October. Right-back Lucy Bronze weaved into the box, evading four green shirts, before sending in a cross that Toone would sweep in at the back post. Northern Ireland almost hit back instantly, with Lauren Wade turning on the edge of the box before forcing England keeper Mary Earps to get down low to push away her effort. Wales kept alive their hopes of a Women’s World Cup qualification play-off place as Natasha Harding marked her 100th cap with a goal in a comfortable win away to Kazakhstan. With France in charge of Group I, Wales are competing with Slovenia and Greece for second place. Gemma Grainger’s side cantered to a 3-0 victory in Nur-Sultan as Kayleigh Green opened the scoring before Harding struck and Jess Fishlock sealed the win after the break. Harding was holding back the tears during the national anthem as she reached her century of appearances. It took Wales until just before the half-hour mark to break the deadlock, a low strike from Green setting the visitors on their way. Sophie Ingle then hit the crossbar before Harding toasted her landmark cap, doubling the lead with a close-range finish from Ceri Holland’s cross. Fishlock wrapped up the points with a well-taken third, opening up her body and scoring from 12 yards to leave Wales with the prospect of qualifying for their first ever World Cup. With a play-off place the most likely path, Wales face a trip to Greece and a home tie against Slovenia in September knowing two wins would still have them in the hunt for a place at the 2023 finals in Australia and New Zealand. A record attendance for a women’s international in Scotland watched the home side produce a much-improved performance against Spain as the visitors won 2-0. A crowd of 7,804 watched at Hampden as Scotland delivered a competitive display. It was not until the 78th minute when Spanish captain Jennifer Hermoso scored her second goal of the game that the visitors looked comfortable. Scotland threatened early on when Manchester City midfielder Caroline Weir got in behind but was denied by a last-ditch clearance.  The visitors stepped things up and went ahead in the 14th minute when Hermoso netted from the spot after Nicola Docherty had conceded a penalty. Lee Alexander made saves either side of the break and Spain had a goal disallowed for offside, while Rachel Corsie produced a couple of excellent blocks to keep the game in the balance. Erin Cuthbert saw a deflected effort spin just wide and Martha Thomas went through but the offside flag was raised as she rounded the goalkeeper and finished. The clincher came after Hermoso took a return pass and finished into the top corner. The win sealed Spain’s place in the World Cup finals but Scotland remain in second spot. By the hour mark though the visiting team were three up. Williamson’s perfectly weighted defensive-splitting pass found Hemp and the forward rounded Burns with a single touch before sending the ball rolling into the empty net. Stanway provided the goal that would match their Wembley tally but it was the mazy run of Toone on the left as green shirts stood back that deserved the credit, with the young United midfielder selflessly handing over for Stanway to hammer home. Stanway scored her second less than 10 minutes later, hooking into the bottom corner after scrappy play in the box. For England, this was somewhat routine but, with the team having struggled to break down lower-ranked teams that have sat back in recent years, this qualifying campaign has seen the end of a worrying trend.",Sport/Football,England on verge of making World Cup finals after rout of Northern Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/northern-ireland-england-womens-world-cup-2023-qualifier-match-report
4/13/2022,"Good morning. The election campaign is in full swing, with new health announcements from Labor and the Greens. Overseas, Boris Johnson is again under pressure after being fined for Covid breaches, and 20 people have been injured in New York after a gunman opened fire on the subway. NSW Liberal senator Hollie Hughes justified claiming a taxpayer-funded travel allowance on the day she attended the Melbourne Cup by saying the alcohol company that gave her a spot in its marquee had employees in her home state, making her attendance parliamentary business. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority accepted the explanation but also told the senator that she would need to be prepared to publicly justify her claim. In election news, Labor and the Greens will release major health commitments. Anthony Albanese is set to announce $135m to trial 50 new urgent care clinics meant to ease pressure on hospitals. And the Greens will announce a $7.5bn-a-year policy to include dental in Medicare, which could be funded by billionaires and large corporations paying their “fair share of tax”. “The Greens will make Clive Palmer pay more tax so you can fix your teeth,” says the Greens leader, Adam Bandt. Christian lobby groups are pressing both major parties to recommit to the unamended religious discrimination bill. Boris Johnson has rejected calls to resign after being fined for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a party for his birthday. His wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were also given penalty notices. Johnson and Sunak are thought to be the first sitting UK prime minister and chancellor to be criminally sanctioned, and were also accused of misleading parliament by previously denying they attended parties during lockdown. Johnson and Sunak have both issued apologies and paid the fines, but families of Covid victims say they are “disgusted”. “You paid a fine,” said the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. “Our loved ones paid with their lives.” Civilians have fled eastern Ukraine as Russian forces closed in on the ruins of Mariupol – where 21,000 civilians have reportedly died – and Vladimir Putin said Moscow’s invasion would proceed “calmly” and to plan until its “noble” goals have been achieved. Putin also dismissed Ukrainian testimony that Russian troops had killed civilians in Bucha as fake. Australia’s new gas export developments are likely to struggle economically after 2030 if the world lives up to commitments to limit global heating to 1.5C, according to a warning to major investors. Domestic travellers are being warned to arrive at airports early as staff shortages and Covid-related measures cause long queues across the country. Sydney airport warns delays will get worse before they get better as airlines and government health departments work to fix the problem. Australia’s official unemployment rate is predicted to fall below 4% as soon as Thursday, the lowest rate since 1974, as employers say finding workers is their ‘No 1 issue’, despite offering higher wages. There are fears health problems in babies could be going undetected as checks remain suspended in parts of Melbourne due to Covid-related workforce shortages, forcing some parents to rely on blogs to find health information. Ten people have been shot and more than 20 injured on the New York City subway after a gunman pulled a gas canister out of his bag, filled the train with smoke and began shooting at people in the carriage and on the platform. No one was considered to have life-threatening injuries and the shooting was not being investigated as terrorism. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has been questioned about why the country’s armed forces bought 30,000 Viagra pills. The navy and air force claim the drug is being used to treat pulmonary hypertension. Sunscreen chemicals are accumulating in Mediterranean seagrass, with fears the UV filters absorbed by Posidonia oceanica may have damaging effects on ecosystems, scientists warn. In 2017, as Australia was debating marriage equality, Jason Om struck a chord with a personal story about his father’s 16-year struggle to accept his sexuality and how his dad eventually came to vote yes in the plebiscite. A piece he wrote for the ABC is the basis for Om’s memoir, All Mixed Up. Om now lives in Sydney but once called Adelaide home, where he had an enviable collection of mid-century furniture. Only one piece, a Danish-designed armchair, made it with him in the move. He tells us why he’d scramble to save that chair in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. “The only people in Australia who can boost wage growth are employers and the only way they can do that is by giving people pay rises,” writes Richard Denniss. “The whole point of abandoning what was once called ‘centralised wage fixing’ and deregulating the labour market over the past 30 years was to put employers in charge of deciding how much they pay their employees. And, guess what, on the whole Australian employers have decided to boost their profits rather than boost their workers’ wages.” After 15 years of deep friendship, Patti Miller was dumped – and she never found out why. Her resulting book felt dangerous, like venturing into taboo. “Two things struck me as I started work,” she says. “One was how little had been written about friendship breakups, compared to the outpouring in films, plays, songs, poems and novels about romantic breakups. The other was the illusory nature of memory in relation to friendship, how unreliable it was.” New activist groups are on the rise, with a series of climate protests blocking roads, bridges and coal ports. In response, the NSW government has passed new laws that could see such protesters spend up to two years in jail. In today’s Full Story, Sam Noonan and Violet Coco, members of Fireproof Australia, speak about why they joined the radical group, and the journalist Royce Kurmelovs explores the rise in anti-protest laws.

It meant back-to-back wins for the Matildas in their two-game series, having won 2-1 in Townsville on Friday night. Queensland MP George Christensen has backflipped on his decision to leave politics, revealing he has joined Pauline Hanson’s One Nation and is seeking re-election, reports the Courier-Mail. The ABC says Warriors winger Marcelo Montoya has received a four-game NRL suspension after using a homophobic slur on-field.

4/13/2022,"Corrupt state officials and organized crime factions are to blame for Mexico’s soaring number of enforced disappearances, whose victims increasingly include children – some as young as 12, according to a new UN investigation. Just over 95,000 people were registered as disappeared at the end of November 2021. Of those, 40,000 were added in the past five years, according to the new report by the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances. “Organized crime has become a central perpetrator of disappearance in Mexico, with varying degrees of participation, acquiescence or omission by public servants,” said the UN delegation. During their 11-day visit last November, 112 disappearances were added to the registry. Impunity remains the norm, and is driving the growing number of disappearances and cover-ups. Just 2% to 6% of the disappearances had resulted in prosecutions, with only 36 convictions handed down at the national level. In Mexico’s most notorious case of enforced disappearances in recent years, independent investigators recently found the armed forces knew that 43 trainee teachers who disappeared in Guerrero in 2014 were being kidnapped by criminals, then hid evidence that could have helped locate them. No one has yet been convicted, and investigators have been blocked from even interviewing the military. “Impunity in Mexico is a structural feature that favours the reproduction and cover-up of enforced disappearances and creates threats and anxiety to the victims, those defending and promoting their rights, public servants searching for the disappeared and investigating their cases, and society as a whole,” the UN committee said on Tuesday. While men between 15 and 40 years old remain the most common victims, figures from the national registry show a significant increase in disappearances of boys and girls, as well as of adolescents and women. This has worsened since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with victims most likely trafficked for sexual exploitation or other criminal purposes – a trend also reported in neighbouring Guatemala. Civil society groups and reporters trying to expose wrongdoing are also being targeted. Of the 30 or more journalists who disappeared between 2003 and 2021, none has been located. Some human rights defenders have been disappeared because of their participation in searches and fighting against disappearances. The UN delegates visited 13 states, and heard allegations of disappearances that occurred in prisons and migration centres. In some cases, migrants were illegally detained at secret locations and had their mobile phones taken by perpetrators who then demanded money from families, sometimes with the support or consent of public officials. The report also highlights the forensic crisis facing the country. According to official figures, more than 52,000 unidentified deceased persons are lying in mass graves, forensic service facilities, universities and forensic storage centres. The national search plan lacks resources and coordination, resulting in inadequate searches and investigations. “In order for disappearance to cease to be the paradigm of the perfect crime in Mexico, prevention must be at the heart of national policy for the prevention and eradication of enforced disappearances”, the committee concluded.",News/World news,"Organized crime and corrupt officials responsible for Mexico’s disappearances, UN says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/organized-crime-corrupt-officials-mexico-enforced-disappearances-un
4/13/2022,"All good things must come to an end – particularly if that good thing is a beloved British sitcom. Like myriad comedies before it, Lisa McGee’s semi-autobiographical Derry Girls (Channel 4) – a knockabout schooldays farce set in mid-90s Northern Ireland – has opted to go out on a high with its third series. There’s a reason why UK shows tend to quit while they’re ahead: they often rely on a single creative force rather than a bustling US-style writers’ room, which means they are liable to exhaust their makers. On a less technical note, that the supposedly 16-year-old protagonists are currently being played by actors fast approaching 30 (one is 35) means Derry Girls has never been the most sustainable of enterprises. Even so, it will be a bittersweet goodbye. Over the past four years, Derry Girls has established itself as a cultural juggernaut: not only is it the most-watched series in Northern Ireland on record, it was recently honoured with a reference in The Simpsons (“I. Am. dead,” tweeted McGee in response). Its success is no fluke: the show is a masterclass in hitting the sweet spot between decades-honed sitcom tradition and refreshing nowness. Its nostalgia is bright and cosy like a jazzy 90s jumper; its portrayal of young women as morally ambivalent and intrinsically comic human beings a cathartic, satisfying relief. We rejoin the gang to discover that – in great sitcom tradition – little has changed. The girls remain their archetypal but not quite hackneyed selves: Erin (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is still a pretentious wannabe poet in the vein of Rick from The Young Ones (but with important global events to write about). Her cousin Orla (Louisa Clare Harland) is still the spaced-out eccentric; Nicola Coughlan’s Clare the neurotic and nerdy goody-two-shoes. Cocky party animal Michelle (Jamie-Lee O’Donnell) is still by far the funniest character: not just because she gets all the greatest lines, but also because O’Donnell has markedly superior comic timing, which means she doesn’t have to ham it up quite as much as the rest of the cast. Token boy James (Dylan Llewellyn), meanwhile, is still … English. The sense of place is as heady as ever, too. In the two episodes available to view in advance, the Troubles feature less prominently – partly because Ireland in this timeline is entering a period of relative peace. But McGee manages to preserve the tone that makes Derry Girls not only gratifyingly profane but also profound: conflict and terror may continually loom, but the finer points of teenage life always take precedent. In previous episodes, scenes that juxtapose the girls’ entirely self-absorbed moments – dancing euphorically on a school hall stage, for example – with their parents anxiously watching the news, end up being far more than the sum of their parts. As the third series opens, the Troubles continue to be mostly an inconvenience, with Michelle snapping at the mere mention of politics: “I’m so fucking sick of peace!” she growls. Luckily for Michelle, the plot that follows this outburst has nothing to do with the peace process. Or, indeed, anything even remotely noble or constructive. The gang are waiting for their GCSE results when they bump into Sister Michael, the sardonic headteacher of Our Lady Immaculate College (Siobhán McSweeney, imperiously understated as ever), who hints that the girls are in for a nasty surprise. Cue – obviously – a school break-in to intercept the offending grades, during which the group cluelessly abet some actual thieves. The climax involves an interview at the police station with Liam Neeson playing the frustrated detective in charge – a starry cameo that underlines the show’s heft, but also serves to temporarily burst the homely, wholly immersive bubble that is the Derry Girls universe. That puncturing is all the more noticeable because of how important the stifling nature of the girls’ world is, fuelling the giddy hysteria that permeates practically every scene. Its source is partly school life – Derry Girls remains excellent at evoking the atmosphere of an all-girls’ school: claustrophobic, yes, but also an environment that allows for much unselfconscious joy. But the show’s real secret is the way it luxuriates in the low-stakes, lower middle-class domestic minutiae of Erin and Orla’s home life. Derry Girls has never neglected its adult characters – Erin’s mother, father, aunt (Orla’s mother) and grandfather – and the place where mundane household tasks intersect with the family’s intense gossiping style has provided some of the show’s most perfectly observed and distinctive storylines (the big bowl affair from series two is a sublime bit of comedy writing). Previous triumphs in this area mean the series three opener’s stray cat plot feels a bit thin (on the upside, it does prompt a great 90s choker joke), but later episodes ensure the grown-up dimension is as fleshed-out as ever. Although this is nominally the end, McGee has hinted that she would like to make a Derry Girls movie – presumably keen to follow The Inbetweeners model (make three hugely popular series of a show, then rake it in with the highest-grossing British comedy film of all time). It doesn’t seem like a brilliant idea. If anything, Derry Girls’ return is a reminder that its airless setting, effusive acting and cosy kitchen-sink detailing combine into something approaching the platonic ideal of a TV sitcom. Derry Girls is that rare thing: a brand new classic, in the best possible sense.",Arts/Television & radio,Derry Girls review – this modern classic goes out on a high,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/derry-girls-review-this-modern-classic-goes-out-on-a-high
