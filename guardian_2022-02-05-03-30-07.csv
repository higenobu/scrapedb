2/5/2022,"The Democratic Unionist party pulled the plug on post-Brexit Irish Sea border checks this week and then resigned its joint leadership of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive. These were dramatic gestures. They are a reminder of the chronic instability that has continued to dog Northern Ireland governance, in spite of the Good Friday agreement. They are also a reminder of the particularly destabilising effects of Brexit for Ireland as a whole. But they are, above all, a sign of DUP political weakness, not strength. They are a foolish gamble that the DUP can get its way in a Brexit argument to which compromise is, in the long run, the only solution. In the short term, however, the DUP’s action has been provoked by electoral fear. An assembly election is due in Northern Ireland in three months’ time. The DUP’s positions as both the dominant unionist party and as the largest party in the assembly are under threat amid the anxieties triggered by Brexit. The party has been losing support to more moderate and more fundamentalist rivals alike.  All this has fuelled, and has been intensified by, bitter internal clashes. These led to the removal of Arlene Foster as party leader last May, and then of her successor Edwin Poots a month later, when he was replaced in turn by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Splits inside the DUP and within unionism are helping to provide an electoral gift to Sinn Féin, which may be poised to become the largest party, with the right to nominate the new first minister. This instability is fuelled by the Brexit settlement, under which a trade barrier in the Irish Sea was conceded by Boris Johnson as the price of maintaining a soft border between north and south. The DUP supported Brexit in 2016 but has proved incapable of dealing with its consequences. Sir Jeffrey came to power with a reputation as a DUP politician whom others could do business with. Early on, he talked of removing the flaws of the Northern Ireland protocol. But hostility to the protocol has increasingly become a litmus test of hardline unionist identity. Nowadays, Sir Jeffrey talks only of scrapping it. The party is now gambling that a more intransigent stance will restore its ascendancy among unionist voters and within Northern Ireland politics more widely. This is why Mr Poots, as agriculture minister, ordered the border checks to cease (a court stayed his decision on Friday) and why Paul Givan quit as first minister the next day (though other DUP ministers remain in place for the time being). It is possible that such stunts will prove a vote-winner when the election comes. But they also imply that power-sharing will not be resuming any time soon, before or after the vote. The DUP’s actions are not designed to make a settlement of the protocol dispute any more likely. The UK and the EU may nevertheless be edging slowly towards finding a solution to their differences. Any such settlement would clearly fall far short of the scrapping of the protocol that the DUP is demanding. But the DUP is out of step with majority opinion in Northern Ireland on Brexit – and always has been. Mr Johnson should not give in to its threats. Instead, he should reach a sensible compromise with the EU of the kind that the majority in Northern Ireland have shown they would be likely to support.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the DUP: signs of weakness and woe | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-dup-signs-of-weakness-and-woe
2/5/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg’s virtual reality business is to introduce a mandatory distance between people’s digital avatars after warnings that the social media tycoon’s plans for a metaverse will lead to a new wave of online harassment. Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, is making a multibillion-dollar bet on VR as the next source of growth for his empire but his strategy has already been dogged by warnings that virtual worlds are rife with abuse.  In December a user testing Horizon Worlds, a VR app owned by Zuckberg’s Meta business, complained of being groped online and called for a protective bubble around their avatar, or digital representation of themselves. “Sexual harassment is no joke on the regular internet but being in VR adds another layer that makes the event more intense,” said the user. Meta announced on Friday that it is introducing personal boundaries on two VR apps: Horizon Worlds, where people can meet fellow VR users and design their own world; and Horizon Venues, which hosts VR events such as comedy shows or music gigs. The company said the distance between people will be the VR equivalent of four feet. “A personal boundary prevents anyone from invading your avatar’s personal space. If someone tries to enter your personal boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary,” said the company. Meta is introducing the 4ft boundary as a default setting and will consider further changes such as letting people set their own boundaries. “We think this will help to set behavioural norms – and that’s important for a relatively new medium like VR,” said Meta. The UK data watchdog has also said it is seeking clarification from Meta about parental controls on the company’s popular Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, as campaigners warned that it could breach an online children’s safety code. The Information Commissioner’s Office said it would talk to Meta after research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, flagged multiple instances of abuse on VRChat, a top-selling social app for Oculus headset users. Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook Inc to Meta last year in a signal that the future of his business lies in the metaverse, a concept where the physical and digital worlds combine via virtual and augmented reality. Although the notion of a fully fledged metaverse is many years away, Meta already announced a $50m (£37m) investment programme to ensure the concept meets regulatory and legal concerns, distributing the money among organisations and academic institutions such as Seoul National University and Women in Immersive Tech.",News/Technology,Meta to bring in mandatory distances between virtual reality avatars,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/04/meta-to-bring-in-mandatory-distances-between-virtual-reality-avatars
2/5/2022,"The former fiance of the late television presenter Caroline Flack has been jailed for a campaign of harassment against the journalist Dan Wootton. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said that Andrew Brady’s claims that the former executive editor of the Sun newspaper was in some way responsible for Flack’s death were “wholly irrational”.  Brady, 51, of Cross Bedford Street, Sheffield, was jailed for four months after admitting harassment at a hearing earlier this week. Richardson told Brady at Sheffield crown court that his social media attacks on Wootton, a MailOnline columnist and GB News presenter, had “everything to do with your craving for celebrity status and your irritation that the press were not in the least interested in your somewhat uninteresting life”. “This must stop,” the judge added. He said that Wootton was actually a friend of the Love Island presenter, who died in February 2020 aged 40. Richardson noted that, given the time the defendant had served on remand, he would be released in the “very near future”. He imposed a 10-year restraining order banning Brady from contacting Wootton, posting anything about him online, or going within 200 yards of his home or workplace. Describing some of the social media posts and messages about Wootton as “utterly outrageous”, Richardson warned Brady he faces a prison sentence measured in years if he breaches the order. Last August, an inquest ruled that Flack took her own life after learning she would be prosecuted for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton, after a long struggle with “fluctuating mental health” that was exacerbated by the stress of fame.

2/5/2022,"My father-in-law, Abdul Quddus, who has died aged 80, was for many years a senior education officer at Leeds city council. He and his wife, Parveen, were also social entrepreneurs, setting up secular organisations that focused on enabling all communities to participate fully in the city’s social, cultural and civic life. During the 1980s and 90s, communities in Leeds originating from south-east Asia still had poor educational and work outcomes, with high unemployment and low-skilled jobs. Abdul worked to address that by securing government funding for and setting up Bangladeshi, Pakistani and other centres in the city, run by members of those communities and helping them access adult education, welfare and housing support. The centres were non-religious, with equal rights and responsibilities for women and young people.  Abdul and Parveen also helped to set up voluntary and community organisations such as the Bengali cultural society Purobi, a women’s empowerment project, Asha, and a Bengali language school for children. Born in Pabna, Bangladesh, Abdul was the son of Nurul Islam and Halima Nur. After school he gained a BA from the Agriculture College in Dhaka (1964), then a master’s (1968) from Mymensingh Agricultural University (now called Bangladesh Agricultural University). He married Parveen Akhtar in 1972, and they travelled to Leeds that year. He obtained an MA in economics from Leeds University in 1973, with a focus on rural economics of developing countries. While working towards a PhD he volunteered at Leeds Citizens Advice Bureau, leading to a job as an education officer at Leeds city council, from 1983, rising to senior education officer. As well as the usual duties he worked on specific projects to support those newly arrived from south-east Asia. In 1988 he created 40 teaching assistant posts for members of those communities so that parents could better support their children in school. He also helped to appoint a number of black and minority ethnic headteachers in Leeds. Thanks to his work, today many people of Bangladeshi descent living in Leeds are in professional jobs, in academia or successful entrepreneurs. Abdul also ensured more individuals from Bame communities gained the relevant qualifications to take up youth worker and education jobs in the council. After retiring in 1999, he undertook consultancy work on mentoring projects for disadvantaged young people. This was funded through the EU, and he travelled to a number of European countries, including Hungary, Greece and Norway. A humanist, Abdul loved Bengali classical music and poetry, and the writings of Rabindranath Tagore. He and Parveen would appear in Bengali plays through the Purobi cultural society. A role model for young people, Abdul would cite the words of Barack Obama “Don’t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope.” Abdul is survived by Parveen, their daughter, Archi, and grandson, Sobitha.

2/5/2022,"My father, David Mallinson, who has died aged 95, began his career as an artist in London in the 1950s, at first painting only at weekends and in the evenings, while during the day he worked as a teacher. But his paintings, many of London streets and squares, soon found a ready market at the Quadrant Gallery, then in Trafalgar Square, as well as being shown at the Royal Academy, Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Influenced by Nicolas de Staël, he turned to semi-abstraction and landscape, exhibiting at the Piccadilly gallery. His career prospered, and in 1980, he was made head of the Art School of Isleworth Polytechnic (now West Thames College) in west London, and built up a number of design courses, one of which, a higher national diploma in art and design, had an international reputation, with 90% of graduates obtaining a job with firms such as Saatchi & Saatchi within six months of graduation. David was elected as the West London secretary of the Greater London Arts Association (GLAA). He retired in 1990, and in 2003 had a retrospective exhibition at Sally Hunter Fine Art, where 26 of his 30 exhibited paintings were sold.  David was born in Carlisle, the son of William, deputy manager of the Midland Bank in the town, and Mary, a school teacher in the nearby village of Great Salkeld, where the family lived. While at Queen Elizabeth grammar school, Penrith, David was an accomplished rock-climber, runner and tennis-player. But he also realised that he wanted to paint, and in 1943 gained a place at the Slade School in London. His studies were interrupted by wartime service when the following year he was commissioned into the Black Watch. He was seconded to the Frontier Force Regiment, serving in Burma (where he was machine-gunned by the RAF in a friendly fire incident) and then in Kashmir, the Dodecanese islands, Egypt, Palestine (where he survived a terrorist attack) and Germany, where he was in charge of Bielefeld station. In Rhodes, he had briefly met his future (Greek) wife, Tina Tusgioglu, corresponding with her for four years from his postings until he married her in Rome in 1950, having decided to continue his studies at the Slade. The years following his graduation in 1952 were productive. While Tina began her career at the Foreign Office’s information research department, he began teaching art, first at schools in north London, and then at Isleworth Polytechnic. In 2007, David and Tina began dividing their time between London and the south of France. Following an exhibition at the town hall of Cagnes-sur-Mer, simple old age meant that he had to cease painting in his last four years. He is survived by Tina and by two sons, Adrian and me.

2/5/2022,"Boris Johnson’s inner circle imploded so spectacularly in recent days that only one close political confidante from the early days of No 10 remains: his wife, Carrie Johnson. The most powerful prime ministerial spouse in recent memory, the 33-year-old Johnson has a job of her own for a wildlife charity, but multiple sources from Downing Street past and present say her influence on the prime minister’s operation is undeniable.  In the recent clearout, two of her allies, Henry Newman and Simone Finn, appear – so far – to have kept their jobs. And those who know her say she is determined to keep Johnson in Downing Street, despite the scandals over No 10 parties – some of which she attended – and the funding of No 11 flat refurbishment, which was her project with celebrity designer Lulu Lytle. The flat refurb, involving gold wallpaper and a £112,000 price tag, has seen critics brand her “Carrie Antoinette”, a label she is known to dislike. But one former Downing Street insider says there was a different nickname for her – Ann Boleyn. Her rivals cast her as the much younger wife trying to have too much political say and manipulate an egotistical leader. Former Downing Street insiders report feeling Carrie could make her husband change his mind, sometimes overnight, on an issue they thought was already agreed. The prime minister would also tell aides that if he didn’t take a particular course of action, it would anger his wife. They also reported Johnson himself receiving scores of messages from her during the working day - and Carrie Johnson repeatedly calling his staff, insisting the prime minister be hauled out of meetings to talk to her. Those political aides who have crossed her – former strategist Dominic Cummings, and for a while, election guru Sir Lynton Crosby – have certainly found themselves cast out, while many on the right side of her have prospered politically, including friends such as Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. But there is more than a whiff of sexism about such descriptions, according to the female Tory MPs she has befriended. It is also acknowledged even by some of her friends, though, that she has tried to have her say on policy issues, texting or WhatsApping ministers directly to share her views. This is mostly about her interest in the environment, which has given her a bond with the prime minister’s father, Stanley, and the wealthy Tory peer, Zac Goldsmith. The most controversial claim is that she was behind the government’s decision to repatriate the animals of Pen Farthing from Afghanistan to the UK, which a Foreign Office email suggests was authorised by the prime minister – something he rejects. A friend says that she strongly denied having anything to do with it, telling them that women and children should be the priority and that it was a complex issue. One person who knows Symonds well says she is more interested in cutting plastic waste than net zero, but that she is “very genuine”. They claim her job for the Aspinall Foundation, a conservation charity behind two safari parks in Kent, is a consuming one, from which she is not taking maternity leave. Her focus at the moment is on the charity’s campaign to get elephants repatriated to Africa, and trying strike a deal with Netflix for a documentary about it. Friends say she is “tremendously fun and entertaining”, with definitive views of her own. They describe her as sending volleys of WhatsApp messages one evening, falling out the next day and then being back in touch as if nothing had happened after that. Another person who knows her from Warwick university days as a theatre and art history student says she has always been the “very definition of capricious”. In this context, the Mirror has described the prime minister’s wife as “addicted to parties” – with three she reportedly attended during lockdown named in the Sue Gray report and now under police investigation. These include a Downing Street garden party on 20 May 2020, a gathering in the Cabinet room for Johnson’s birthday on 19 June 2020 and a party in the No 11 flat in November 2020. This was the night of Cummings’s departure from Downing Street with No 10 staff reportedly hearing music blaring out into the room below, believing it to be a “victory party”. She is known to have a penchant for Abba, with Finn having hosted an Abba-themed 30th birthday party for her. This has led to awkward scenes with the prime minister, with one insider saying he had been “made to dance like a performing monkey to Abba” with her much younger friends. A few journalists have been known to socialise in the Downing Street flat and at Chequers, theprime ministerial country retreat in Buckinghamshire. During the Euros 2020 last year, the Johnsons entertained the Sun editor, Victoria Newton, and a political journalist there to watch the England v Scotland football game. No 10 said the rule of six was followed at all times. Those who know them say the Johnsons prefer to be at Chequers at weekends, and that on occasions, she stays on after he has returned to London. As well as having a one-year-old and a newborn, her own job, and a husband who is in serious trouble, a major part of her life is also Dilyn the dog. She is said to dote on the Jack Russell cross, despite those who have been around him describing him as a “handful”, who snaps at ankles and was once blamed for urinating in an aide’s handbag. Cummings and several other sources have spoken of her fury at a media story suggesting the Johnsons might want to rehome Dilyn , with time in No 10 discussing the possibility of a complaint to the press regulator. And as for her relationship with Johnson , an adviser who worked on the prime minister’s leadership campaign saw him occasionally frustrated with her, but also at that time having the appearance of a “devoted puppy” towards her. Certainly, he backed her over Cummings, when the pair clashed in November 2020, leading to his departure. Carrie Johnson’s spokeswoman said Mrs Johnson had “for some time been the subject of a targeted briefing campaign to discredit her”. She added that “Carrie had absolutely no involvement in the Pen Farthing evacuation” and that she did not discuss it with the campaigners, the prime minister or his aides. Since his departure from government, Cummings has been open about trying to remove his former boss and wife from No 10, describing her as a “wrong un” and someone who was leading the premiership towards “inevitable disaster”. More recently, Cummings has claimed she was initially a strong supporter of him joining the Downing Street operation as she had a “good sense of PM’s limitations”. But he added: “ I think she thought once the majority was won, she should take over as the main influence on him with her people in key roles below.” With almost all the prime minister’s most longstanding aides now gone, Carrie Johnson has little competition any more. But with Johnson’s premiership most likely entering its end phase, how much is that position of influence worth any more? Anna Soubry, a former Tory minister who has worked with Carrie Johnson in the past, said she thought it was a shame that she would now be forever associated with Boris Johnson’s likely short-lived premiership. “I think she is a remarkably talented, hugely able, lovely person, but she has hitched her wagon to this disaster of a man. And it actually shows you in a way that she is honourable, that she has stood by him.”",News/UK news,Carrie Johnson: puppet master of Downing Street – or easy target?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/carrie-boris-johnson-pm-wife-downing-street
2/5/2022,"Seventy years after becoming monarch far sooner than she could have anticipated, the Queen will mark the anniversary of her accession on Sunday at Sandringham, where her father George VI died aged 56 in 1952. Though it has long been her custom to mark this milestone at the Norfolk estate, this year has added poignancy. The Duke of Edinburgh, her “strength and stay” during 73 years of marriage, and who broke news to her of the king’s death while they were thousands of miles away at a Kenyan game lodge, is no longer at her side.  The times they spent together privately at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate were, perhaps, the nearest the couple ever got to normality, with a lack of formality, and where the liveried army of staff ever present at other royal residences are absent, allowing for greater privacy. So it is at Sandringham that she will spend the day in private, without him, and with none of the fanfare of June’s planned platinum jubilee bank holiday celebrations. But a platinum jubilee is unprecedented in British history, and rare elsewhere. So, to mark accession day, Buckingham Palace on Friday released images and footage taken two weeks ago of the monarch viewing memorabilia from bygone royal jubilees. Taken in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, they show the Queen, accompanied by her dorgi, Candy, laughing at cards, including a golden jubilee letter from a nine-year-old boy called Chris, titled “A Recipe for a Perfect Queen”. Its list of ingredients included “500ml of royal blood”, a “dab of jewels and posh gowns” and “a dash of loyalty”. “That’s quite fun, isn’t it,” the 95-year-old monarch remarked. Platinum jubilee cards were also on display, as was a fan presented to Queen Victoria to mark her golden jubilee in 1887 and signed by members of her family including her eldest child, the Princess Royal, known as Vicky to her relatives, and granddaughter Princess Alix, later the Tsarina of Russia, and the then prime minister, the Marquess of Salisbury. The celebrations come at a difficult time for the monarch, who has been seen less in public since being ordered to rest by doctors, and who spent a night in hospital in October undergoing tests. She will soon mark the 20th anniversaries of the deaths of her sister and mother, who died during her golden jubilee year in 2002; Princess Margaret on 9 February, and the Queen Mother on 30 March. The first anniversary of Prince Philip’s death, aged 99, is on 9 April. The Duke of York’s legal travails have also intensified in recent weeks as he fights a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the US, forcing his mother to make the difficult decision to strip her second son of his royal patronages and official use of his HRH style, to distance the monarchy from the court case. Prince Andrew has denied the allegations. The fall out from any trial, should it proceed in the autumn, threatens to tarnish her jubilee year. Another possible cloud on the horizon is the publication of the memoirs of the outspoken Duke of Sussex, also planned for the autumn. “Obviously 70 years is a massive milestone for a British monarch, but for the Queen on a personal level it is still, even after 70 years, a time for reflection, it also being the anniversary of her father’s death,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine. “Clearly, with the passage of time that becomes easier to bear, but nevertheless their bond was close and she has said herself he died far too young.” Her mind will, no doubt, cast back to the dramatic – and traumatic – time when, at the very beginning of an official overseas tour, she famously climbed up the ladder to Treetops Lodge, Nyeri, on the night of 6 February and descended the next morning a Queen, changing into mourning black during the hurried journey home. “The irony was, she was among the last to learn of the death of the king because of how isolated she was and how communications were at that time,” said Little. “This is a year of first for the Queen as a widow, I’m sure adding the poignancy for 6 February.” The extended four-day bank holiday platinum jubilee weekend will begin on 2 June and will include trooping the colour, a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s cathedral, a day at the Derby, a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace, and the Big Jubilee Lunch. In the tradition of royal jubilees, following coronation chicken and victoria sponge, a platinum pudding competition is under way to create a dessert fit for royalty. The Queen browsed through images of some early entries during the Windsor display. Her verdict? “Looks like they’re all going to end with crowns on them,” she said.",News/UK news,‘A time for reflection’: Queen prepares for first accession day without Philip,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/queen-prepares-for-first-accession-day-without-philip
2/5/2022,"Cutting green levies on energy bills, or watering down the UK’s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions, would fail to help households with high energy prices and store up problems for the near future, analysts have warned. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the E3G thinktank, said: “Cutting green levies to tackle the energy bills crisis would be utterly self-defeating. It would only keep the UK addicted to gas for longer. The only cure is to ramp up clean energy investment and eliminate energy waste. That is the permanent solution to bring down energy bills. Any politician working against that is directly undermining the interests of their constituents and likely to be in the pocket of the fossil fuel lobby.”  Green levies work to provide investment for insulation and other energy efficiency measures, and to support incentives for renewable energy. The energy company obligation, at about £1bn a year, provides insulation and other energy efficiency for poor households, and has saved about £11.7bn in total on fuel bills for lower-income households, but has been threatened by the Treasury in an effort to cut bills. Levies on bills that support energy efficiency and renewables are falling, from £172 last year, or 15% of fuel bills, to about £153 on bills, according to recent figures from Ofgem. Jan Rosenow, a director of the Regulatory Assistance Project, said: “Calls for cutting green levies are misplaced and a kneejerk reaction not supported by the evidence. Past levy-funded programmes have in fact reduced energy bills, as analysis has shown time and time again. Cutting levies now would leave customers paying more in the long term.” Reducing green levies has been tried before – the then prime minister David Cameron famously instructed his ministers to “cut the green crap” in 2013. That move, according to research from Carbon Brief, has meant the UK’s domestic energy bills are now £2.5bn a year higher than they would have been if the green incentives had been left intact. Yet even with the poor investment in insulation since Cameron’s decision, analysis shows energy efficiency has cut the UK’s energy bills by about £1,000 a year. Renewable energy is also now much cheaper, with the costs of wind turbines and solar panels plummeting in recent years. This has helped renewable energy companies make a significant net contribution to reducing the UK’s electricity prices, as the cost of gas has soared. Wind and solar paid back £160m in the final quarter of 2021 because they receive an agreed price, called a strike price, for their energy. When the wholesale price is higher than the strike price, generators pay back the difference, and this is reflected in lower bills for consumers in subsequent quarterly periods. The payback could reach £770m by the end of winter, or £27 per customer on the average bill. Blaming high energy prices on renewable generation is “seriously misinformed”, the chief representative of the UK’s wind industry has said. Dan McGrail, chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, said: “The UK needs to phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible to provide long-term energy security and certainty for consumers. Figures published by Ofgem show that green levies are falling, so any attempt to blame renewables and net zero [for high energy prices] is seriously misinformed. Let’s be clear: this is a crisis caused by the soaring cost of gas.” He added: “The escape route from volatile and uncontrollable gas prices couldn’t be clearer. Investing in our green future secures low-cost reliable power as well as getting the UK to net zero as fast as possible.” Producing more gas in the North Sea, which some have also called for, would do little or nothing to reduce energy prices in the UK, because any additional gas would be sold on international markets to the highest bidder, analysts added.",News/Environment,"Cutting green levies on energy bills is false economy, say analysts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/cuts-to-green-levies-on-energy-bills-is-false-economy-say-analysts
2/5/2022,"The rollout of Greater Manchester’s clean air zone has been delayed until July. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, had requested more time to allow local authorities to review plans after evidence suggested the city was unlikely to meet legal emissions limits by the original date of 2024.  Evidence provided by Greater Manchester authorities suggested the impact of issues such as Covid-19 on supply chains and the price and availability of secondhand vehicles will make it harder for people to upgrade to cleaner vehicles, the government said. In a statement, the government said it had “carefully considered” Burnham’s request and that the environment secretary, George Eustice, had “agreed to allow a short delay”. It said: “This will allow Greater Manchester to provide further evidence and a revised plan by July setting out how it will deliver legal levels of NO2 [nitrogen dioxide] as soon as possible, and no later than 2026. “In making this decision, the environment secretary has made it clear that it is his priority to fulfil the government’s legal obligations to deliver compliance with NO2 limits in the shortest time possible.” The scheme, which would impose daily charges on some high-emission vehicles, excluding private cars, had been due to begin at the end of May. At a press conference, Burnham told reporters the 2024 deadline could not be met due to the pandemic. He said: “The vehicles just simply aren’t available to get the change in that time frame. So the risk with that situation is people can’t get the vehicle so even if they want to change and do the right thing they can’t. So then they’re just left hit with the charge.” Greater Manchester’s clean air zone will require lorries, buses and coaches that breach NO2 emission standards to pay £60 a day, while vans, taxis and minibuses will be charged between £7.50 and £10 a day. About 285,000 private cars licensed in the region that already breach air pollution limits are exempt from the plans. Burnham said his office and the 10 other local councils in the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) would now look again at the scheme and present the government with another plan later in the year. On Wednesday, a war of words broke out in parliament over the scheme after Boris Johnson described the clean air zone plans as “completely unworkable” and said they would “do damage to businesses and residents”. Burnham said he had “never been the instigator nor the final decision-maker in this scheme”. The clean air zone was planned after the government ordered all regions to bring down air pollution by 2024. Campaigners have previously warned that pausing the clean air zone “would be a serious blow for people’s health”. There are 152 locations across the 10 local authority areas with illegal NO2 levels. Each year in Greater Manchester, more than 1,000 deaths have air pollution as a contributory cause, Burnham said.",News/UK news,Greater Manchester clean air zone rollout delayed until summer,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/greater-manchester-clean-air-zone-rollout-delayed-until-summer
2/5/2022,"Simon Parkin’s long read (‘I remember the feeling of insult’: when Britain imprisoned its wartime refugees, 1 February) very appropriately reminds us of how easy it is for the popular press to stir up hysteria and hatred against immigrants and to influence government policy. Hitler’s victory in 1933 forced thousands to flee Nazi persecution. It would have been relatively easy to separate the very few imposters from the thousands of Jews, communists and other persecuted minorities who would hardly be working for the Nazis. MI5 itself had files on many of the communists, and most of those of Jewish background could be easily identified. In my book (A Political Family – the Kuczynskis, Fascism, Espionage and the Cold War) about one German-Jewish family that escaped Hitler’s Germany, Jürgen Kuczynski explains how he was interned at Seaton camp in Devon, alongside those who were Nazis, but no distinctions were made. In fact, the Nazis were often given preferential treatment. Other less fortunate internees were shipped to Canada and had to run the gauntlet of Nazi submarines; dozens lost their lives in this way.  That period was not only traumatic for the refugees, as Parkin notes, but it also tarnished Britain’s reputation as a haven for those fleeing persecution. We should learn from that experience.John GreenLondon  Simon Parkin’s long read is a timely reminder of what happened to those seeking escape from conflict and death during the second world war. Mr Parkin will know that the difficulties and deprivations suffered by refugees and asylum seekers continued after 1945. Many who had been interned on the Isle of Man and elsewhere were classified postwar as displaced persons (DPs), towards whom the policy of the British and other allied governments was one of “repatriation”, often to the very places of oppression, torture and death people had fled in the first place. For example, the former Belsen concentration camp was used to house 12,500 DPs. Conditions there and elsewhere were miserable and dangerous. Now we see the horrors of Afghanistan, just to name one of the many humanitarian tragedies (an overused phrase, maybe, but distressingly poignant here) with us around the world, with millions and millions of displaced persons who won’t receive any kind of help or relief. Do we live in a better world than in 1945? For some of us, yes; for many of our fellow beings, certainly not.Bruce Ross-SmithHeadington, Oxford  My parents were interned too early to benefit from the married couples’ internment camp on the Isle of Man. My mother, a political refugee but not Jewish, was first arrested in September 1939 and spent nearly four months in Holloway prison, some in solitary confinement. She was never charged or tried and was only released because her fiance, my Jewish dad, enlisted the help of Fenner Brockway, an MP who, unlike their local MP, did not reject all Germans without finding out more about them. On her release, in March 1940, my parents married, but in May both were interned in segregated camps on the Isle of Man. They did not meet again for another year. They made the most of their time there and my mother even started a school in Port Erin. Of course, their gratitude on release and relief at having survived, unlike many friends and family, overtook any feelings of anger that they could not fight the Nazis, and the fear they felt at being perfect targets for any potential invasion. The dangers of propaganda highlighted in Simon Parkin’s article are clear and do long-term damage.Julia NelkiPrenton, Merseyside  My father, Josef, was one of those Germans who was interned on the Isle of Man in 1940 having come to Britain in the 1930s. By all accounts, though he had lost his liberty, he had a better time than most, working in the fields producing food. My mother, on the other hand, a Bradford lass, was not so lucky. Having married a German, she was regarded as “an enemy alien” and shortly after giving birth to my brother Dennis was marched to the police station with her two other children – Peter, aged four, and Geoffrey, aged two – and made to sign a declaration of “naturalisation”. It did not help when it came to the hatred and vilification from her fellow Bradfordians.John DuttineWorthing, West Sussex  Simon Parkin’s excellent piece summarised the terrible treatment of innocent immigrants from Italy and Germany in the early days of the second world war. He might have mentioned, in addition, the tragedy in July 1940 when the SS Arandora Star set sail from Liverpool, taking with it over 1,200 Italian and German internees for deportation to camps in Canada. The ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the Irish coast, and sank, with over 800 casualties. This tragedy is commemorated today in memorials in many British and Italian cities.Mark FlinnChester  The use of internment can be said to have started earlier, during the first world war, with the imprisonment during the Easter Rising of 1916 of 18,000 Irishmen in the wilds of north Wales, at Frongoch near Bala. An old whisky distillery site was chosen to house them. Notable among their number was Michael Collins. It has been argued that the IRA was born there under his tutelage and the camp was dubbed “Ollscoil na Réabhlóide” – the “University of Revolution” – by its inmates. Similar internment camps for American Japanese citizens were set up by the federal government – for their own protection rather than for active combatants – following the Pearl Harbor attack on the US Pacific fleet in Hawaii.John BentleyLedbury, Herefordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/5/2022,"When Bradford community radio profiled my friend Colin Lloyd in 2016, the interviewer listed his occupations thus: “Teacher, printmaker, artist, drummer, musician, actor, performer, gay activist and cultural observer of Bradford, the city he grew up in and loved”. Colin, who has died aged 64 of pancreatic cancer, was a hugely creative and compassionate man. He was born in Bradford, one of seven children of Florence (nee Whittaker), a care worker, and Vincent Lloyd, then working in the city’s textile industry. Colin went to Buttershaw comprehensive school, then notable for a drama department run by Janet Beard, who encouraged him to act and helped him improve his reading skills via Shakespeare.  Besides producing successful actors, Beard created the Barnstormers touring theatre company, and living and working with this troupe as a teenager, Colin was in a creative milieu that encouraged his talents and accepted his sexuality without stigma. He became involved with the Gay Liberation Front, beginning his lifelong passionate and articulate political engagement. Aged 20 and working at the Alhambra theatre in Bradford, Colin met Alan Richardson, an artist, and they became life partners (and in 2006 civil partners). They both then went to work at Yorkshire Television, Colin in the costume department, which brought stability and a house in Bradford. Ten years later, Colin opted for his other creative obsession and enrolled at Bradford College of Art. He had been making art since his adolescence, and welcomed the chance to become a mature student. Completing his fine art studies at Sheffield Hallam University, in 1992 he was invited back to Bradford to teach, an offer he gladly accepted: ever since his schooldays he was excited by the transformational possibilities of good teaching. After gaining an MA in printmaking, he worked from 2009 at Salford University, where he taught BA and MA students painting, printmaking and multimedia until his retirement in 2016. Colin understood the importance of new media for artists to communicate and show their work, deftly using digital media as a promotion platform for his own practice which, for a radical gay man who had lived through the Aids epidemic, was unsurprisingly concerned with memory, loss and queer sexuality. An inspiring mentor, he energetically contributed to Foldworks artist studios in Todmorden, set up to widen access to art facilities, the Positive Lives photographic exhibition run in collaboration with the Terrence Higgins Trust to document the impact of HIV/Aids, and Café Despard, a radical cabaret group founded in the 1980s with mostly LGBTQ+ members – three examples of creative Bradford ventures that generated international impact via programmes, collaborators and travelling venues. Colin is survived by Alan, by his mother, and by his siblings, Carol, Fred, David, Andrea and Susan. Another sister, Janet, predeceased him.",Arts/Art and design,Colin Lloyd obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/04/colin-lloyd-obituary
2/5/2022,"I was amused to read your editorial (2 February) about the internet game Wordle, created by Josh Wardle for his partner and subsequently sold to the New York Times. I used to play this game on paper in the 1990s with my wife at the time and have included a brief discussion of it in my book Sociology as Method. I describe the game as a recontextualisation of a board game called Mastermind, which was played with coloured pegs rather than words. One player placed an arrangement of pegs hidden at one end of the board, and the other had to try to deduce the arrangement before the board was filled with their incorrect attempts.  Some readers may remember this game; there was also an online version of it.Prof Paul DowlingDepartment of Culture, Communication and Media, UCL Institute of Education  Re the coverage of the purchase of Wordle, the game has been around since 1975, albeit in analogue form. My set of Word Mastermind in its battered box has players inserting letter tiles in four, rather than five, holes as they try to guess the word. Different coloured pegs indicate a correct letter in the right or wrong place. It allows up to 10 tries a game. You can play for free as many times a day as you like, too. But the main advantage is that it has to be played from a static position, so there is no chance of colliding with someone playing it on their phone while walking along.Janet FraserTwickenham, London  The invention of the extremely popular Wordle is not a new creation except as an online app-based version. My friends and I played the same game on paper or in our heads and called it Five-letter Word Mastermind. We would play several words at the same time and have as many guesses as needed, with the winner having the fewest tries. I remember it helped keep us awake on long night shifts at Frenchay hospital 50 years ago.Rob DoranCanon Pyon, Herefordshire  Around 55 years ago we were playing a very similar game in pairs against each other during a craze in our office.

2/5/2022,"Somebody at the Guardian seemed surprised that occasionally novelists and science fiction writers get the future right (Editorial, 30 January). Those of us who have loved, read, or even written science fiction can only chuckle quietly at their surprise. It is the nature of future-thinking authors to take an idea, even in embryo, and run with it. Sometimes, examples such as HG Wells actually predicting a city-destroying bomb and calling it an “atom-bomb” in 1913 can be a bit breathtaking. I’m still impressed with Ray Bradbury’s 1953 short story The Murderer, which predicts the mobile phone and house-computer, and Henry Kuttner’s Year Day (circa 1953) which predicts mass advertising and virtual reality. To me, a recent article about a visit to Donbas perfectly matched Orwell’s Airstrip One in 1984, even down to the ruined buildings, torture centre and bad coffee.  Belonging to a generation who hoped, by AD 2000, we would have proper self-drive flying cars, video phones, computers that follow complex voice commands and tourist trips to the Moon (Frank Hampson, drawing Dan Dare in 1950, promised much of that, and more), I find our 21st century to be something of a disappointment.

2/5/2022,"Jonathan Jones’s choice of Max Beckmann’s painting Die Nacht to illustrate “Weimar excess” was unfortunate (Bootleggers, bondage and law-breaking bashes! The scandalous history of the wild party, 31 January). Far from showing a “party from hell, with bondage, in a room that’s drunkenly shrinking”, it is in fact an allegorical depiction of the tragedy of war and revolution. The viewer is forced to witness the murderous assault on a family hiding in an attic. The fact that the artist depicts his own family renders the tragedy even more poignant: the man with a bandaged head is clearly Beckmann himself; the child abducted by a revolutionary was modelled on his son, Peter; the woman tied and with splayed legs after rape is his wife, Minna. Suffused with Christian imagery, the theme is martyrdom: the strangled man with upturned soles and signs of stigmata recalls Christ’s crucifixion on altar paintings of the old masters Beckmann so much admired.  Any number of examples or satirical portrayals of Weimar excess by George Grosz or Otto Dix et al might have been suitable for Jones’s argument, but Die Nacht definitely is not.Cornelie UsborneProfessor emerita of history, Roehampton University  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This was discovered by my partner, David Fry, in 1985 and was reported formally by the then county archaeologist, Barbara Harbottle. David was the resident potter at the arts centre, leading a team to make floor tiles for the whole complex when he noticed Roman pots being thrown into a skip during the renovation of the medieval buildings. David’s excavations revealed the route of the wall in the city centre, and the location of the milecastle, which had been puzzling people. So we agree that the route of the trail going along the riverside instead of through the west end and city centre is a missed opportunity to show people the real route of the wall and the exciting finds made.Sheila SpencerBenton, Tyne and Wear   Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/5/2022,"My wife, Gill Clisham, who has died aged 59 of heart failure, was the secretary of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) from 2001 to 2014. Though not an economist, she worked tirelessly throughout her career to ensure a wider understanding of the discipline and was instrumental in the inception and development of many successful initiatives, most notably the Westminster Economics Forum, a series of conferences she developed in partnership with the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council). Gill was born in Wigan, the daughter of Marjorie (nee Barton), a health visitor, and Arthur McCaffery, a post office engineer. She arrived in the world following her mother’s previous eight miscarriages, and was valued by her parents as an only child. This prompted Gill to embrace life to the full.  Gill studied government at the University of Essex, where she and I met as students. We married in 1983 and in 1987 settled in London, where she started working for NIESR. She then spent the next 27 years as a vital part of the NIESR team, first as PA to the economist Brian Henry, then very soon joining the publications team before becoming external relations manager. It was in this role that she started winning praise from all quarters for her warm personality and positive attitude, as well as her skilful organisation and calm approachability. Gill’s commitment to the world of socio-economic research was demonstrated when she became the secretary of ARCISS (the Association of Research Centres in the Social Sciences), with her work being further recognised when she was invited to become a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Coming from Wigan, Gill was an avid supporter of Wigan rugby league, a passion she acquired from her father. As well as attending numerous Challenge Cup finals, she could often be found on ice-covered terraces on either side of the Pennines attempting to extricate fizzy pop from a frozen can while warming the other hand on a rapidly cooling pie. She also loved music, and though her tastes were eclectic, Gill had what some might call an unhealthy obsession with Sting; attending numerous concerts both with him as a solo artist and as “the bass player” (as Stuart Copeland called him) with the Police. But more than the other passions, Gill’s biggest passion was for travel; she thought that life was for living and experiencing. She visited Brazil, South Africa and Malaysia, and had numerous trips to the Caribbean and the US, with one of her favourite places being Las Vegas. This was not necessarily for the gambling, which she did enjoy, but for the mixing pot it was for diverse experiences. This was most noticeable in her visits to a range of Michelin-starred restaurants, as well as experiencing more prosaic establishments. In 2014 Gill and I decided to dedicate our time to making the most of life and we retired to Greece. Having visited around 20 of its islands and many places on the mainland, we had bought a converted olive press on the island of Corfu a few years earlier. We both decided we could not wait any longer to make our frequent visits permanent. Gill was a true Grecophile, and many said, when we moved there, that she had achieved her dream. Gill is survived by me.",News/Business,Gill Clisham obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/gill-clisham-obituary
2/5/2022,"New details have emerged about a 22-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by police in Minneapolis during execution of a no-knock warrant, with police officials confirming the man was not named in any search warrant. During a press conference on Thursday held by the Minneapolis police department (MPD), officials confirmed that Amir Locke, who was shot on Wednesday morning during the search, was not named in any search warrant carried out by MPD police. Locke was shot by the Minneapolis officer Mark Hanneman, according to city officials and documents.  The video of the police shooting, which was also released on Thursday, seemed to contradict early claims from police officials that officers had “loudly made themselves known before entering the apartment”, where Locke was. The video instead showed officers announcing their presence once they were already inside the apartment. The video released by the Minneapolis police department shows officers entering the apartment unit by unlocking the door with a key, shouting “police, search warrant, get on the ground, get on the fucking ground,” as they entered the unit, reported Reuters. An officer then kicks a couch Locke was lying on underneath a blanket, appearing to wake Locke up. Locke, who was holding a handgun, looks up to see officers surrounding him and begins to stand, with the handgun becoming visible. Almost immediately, officers fired three shots, killing Locke who was still twisted up in the blanket. Locke’s parents, Andre and Karen Locke, declined to comment on the video, with his mother telling the Star Tribune, “We want justice for our son.” Nekima Levy Armstrong, a community organizer and a civil rights attorney, said that Locke’s family told her that Locke was a registered gun owner with a conceal carry permit who did not live in the apartment and was not being searched for by police, reported CBS. Armstrong also confirmed that Locke was not named in the search warrant carried out on Wednesday. Hanneman was hired by the MPD in 2015 and had received three complaints that were all closed with disciplinary action, according to city records. A fourth complaint from 2018 was also recorded according to data collected by the Communities United Against Police Brutality organization, reports CBS. Hanneman has been placed on administrative leave, which is routine, pending an investigation. The family is being represented by the civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has previously worked with the families of police shooting victims, including the family of George Floyd. In a statement, Crump compared the shooting of Locke to the 2020 killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, during a police raid. “Like the case of Breonna Taylor, the tragic killing of Amir Locke shows a pattern of no-knock warrants having deadly consequences for Black Americans,” said Crump. “This is yet another example of why we need to put an end to these kinds of search warrants so that one day, Black Americans will be able to sleep safely in their beds at night.”",News/US news,Black man killed by Minneapolis police was not named in no-knock warrant,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/amir-locke-police-minneapolis-no-knock-warrant
2/5/2022,"England will be greeted by improved safety measures on their return to Murrayfield on Saturday as Eddie Jones’s side make their first appearance at Scotland’s stadium since a disputed incident involving a beer bottle in 2020, the Guardian understands. Jones was left furious when one of his senior backroom staff members, Neil Craig, was struck on the head by a beer bottle as England made their way from the team bus to the stadium before their 13-6 win two years ago. Jones appeared to suggest that the bottle had been thrown in England’s direction by a supporter and the Scottish Rugby Union issued a swift apology before Six Nations organisers confirmed they were launching an investigation.  A subsequent video emerged, however, appearing to show the bottle blowing off the concourse, with Storm Ciara in its early stages, and in the direction of the England party rather than being thrown. Jones and England opted against making an official complaint, the SRU pointed to what the video seemed to show and that appeared to be the end of the matter. High winds are again forecast for Saturday’s match, however, and it is understood that netting will be put up to offer both sets of players and the match officials protection when they arrive. England’s arrival at Murrayfield has long since been a sideshow of Calcutta Cup matches in Edinburgh with slow-marching bagpipers traditionally part of the spectacle. More than half of England’s starting XV on Saturday have never played a Six Nations match at Murrayfield but Kyle Sinckler, who was part of the side two years ago, recently recalled his experience of arriving at the ground. “I remember coming off the bus once or twice and the fans are giving it to you straight away and chucking certain things,” he said. “Emotions from the fans overboil sometimes but for me it just shows how much it means to people and the power of sport. It was just Scottish fans I guess, just boozed up. It was quite funny actually with all the abuse, it was good fun.” The SRU has stressed that the netting is a safety measure, in line with protocols amid the expected poor conditions, rather than a beefing up of security. Jones revealed last week he was already bracing himself for abuse on Saturday. In 2018, the day after Scotland’s 25-13 triumph, Jones was subjected to torrid abuse from drunken Scotland fans at a Manchester train station as he made his way home via a planned trip to Old Trafford. Two years ago, as well as venting his anger at the beer bottle incident, Jones criticised Scotland supporters for booing Owen Farrell while he was kicking at goal. “I’m not very popular,” Jones said last week. “So I’m sure I’m going to get plenty of abuse and I’m happy to take that.” Fabien Galthié has tested positive for Covid-19 and the France head coach will not attend Sunday's Six Nations games against Italy in Paris. Les Bleus' general manager, the former captain Raphaël Ibañez, will head up the coaching team at Stade de France, with Galthié working remotely. ""This morning I tested positive for Covid-19. I am fine with mild symptoms,"" Galthié tweeted.""As a result, I am self-isolating and will act remotely this week. Raphaël and all of my staff, in whom I have full confidence, will be my relay on the pitch."" The French Rugby Federation said tests carried out on the entire playing squad, coaching and management team on Friday produced no further positive results. ""Fabien Galthié, who has only mild symptoms, continues to assume all of his prerogatives from a distance during this period,"" the Federation said. ""In accordance with Six Nations protocol, additional tests are scheduled for Saturday on the eve of the match. ""These will be the last tests before the first match of the Six Nations tournament scheduled for Sunday February 6 at 4pm at the Stade de France."" Antoine Dupont, the world player of the year, was among a number of France squad members to test positive for coronavirus last month. He will captain the side. The Toulouse scrum-half replaces an injured Charles Ollivon as skipper, while there is a start in the second row for Bordeaux-Bègles' Cameron Woki alongside Paul Willemse. PA Media Sam Simmonds, who is among the England players who have not played at Murrayfield, revealed the hostility they are expecting to face has been a hot topic of conversation this week. “We’ve just talked about the hostile environment and how we can use that and come together as a 15 and a 23, and also the boys who aren’t playing as well,” Simmonds said. “We’ve talked about results in the past and maybe we haven’t played to our full potential. This week we’ve trained well, mentally and physically we’re in a very good place.” Meanwhile, Scotland’s fly-half Finn Russell is equally occupying England minds. The defence coach, Anthony Seibold, who gets his first taste of the Six Nations, acknowledged the need to blunt the threat posed by the mercurial No 10. “He’s a super-talented player,” Seibold said. “You just have to watch his club form over there in Paris and he has been outstanding and he brings that to the Scotland team. How do you take away his weapons? Finn Russell wants time and space so he can ball play and use his really effective kicking game, both short and long. So you need to take away time and space from Finn. That’s easier said than done, of course. “I think it is a case of making sure we go after Finn Russell. Not outside our defensive system but making sure we put some pressure on him. You need to win the collisions, the ruck and the ruck speed to do that.”",Sport/Sport,England get improved safety measures before Six Nations clash in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/england-get-improved-safety-measures-before-six-nations-clash-in-scotland
2/5/2022,"Police in Canada have promised tougher action against the “unlawful and unacceptably dangerous” protests paralyzing the nation’s capital, but admitted the situation was increasingly out of their control. With 400 more trucks and 2,000 protesters expected to arrive in the city this weekend, Ottawa police on Friday announced that 150 additional officers will be deployed and concrete barricades set up to prevent more vehicles from reaching the city’s downtown core. Illegally parked vehicles will be towed and highways and bridges could be closed.  “The surge [of officers] will deliver a clear message to the demonstrators: the lawlessness must end,” said Peter Sloly, the Ottawa police chief. Police have asked counter-protesters not to come to the city, amid fears of violence. Hundreds of trucks have remained outside parliament for nearly a week in protest against public health measures. Sloly said that the police force took “no solace” in the fact that the current police strategy has so far prevented “riots, injuries and death”. “The demonstrators in this red zone area remain highly organized, well-funded and extremely committed to resisting efforts to end the demonstration safely,” he said, adding that the situation remained “very volatile” amid reports that a number of protesters are believed have firearms. Organizers of the “Freedom Convoy” said at a press conference that their occupation of the city would continue until all levels of government eliminated Covid-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates – a demand widely seen as unrealistic. On Thursday, protesters were seen building a wooden structure and stockpiling fuel. The city’s police force has faced mounting criticism over its “measured” approach to the protest, which has frustrated and terrorized residents. Senior officers admitted they were surprised by the size and scale of the protest. “If we knew it would seep into the neighbourhoods we would have deployed more resources into those communities,” said Steve Bell, the deputy police chief. Catherine McKenney, a city councillor for Ottawa’s Centretown neighbourhood, accused police of abandoning residents, and described receiving daily reports of residents being yelled at, followed, intimidated and assaulted by protesters. “What we have here is a federal government, a provincial government, a city and a local police force unable, or unwilling, to defend and to protect one residential neighbourhood in this entire country today. They either can’t or they won’t,” McKenney said. The city of Ottawa confirmed Thursday it had requested aid from the Royal Canadian Mounted police and Canada’s public safety minister confirmed resources from the federal police force would be sent to the nation’s capital. With the protests attracting significant attention and funding from the US, police say they are working with the FBI and US Department of Homeland Security to investigate online threats originating south of the border.",News/World news,‘Lawlessness must end’: Canada police pledge tougher action on truck protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/canada-ottawa-protests-trucks-police
