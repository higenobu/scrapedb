1/19/2022,"Sometimes a video game can be thoroughly entertaining, not for any new ideas it brings to the table, but for the way in which it combines a lot of old ideas into an excitingly fresh experience. The latest shooter from Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy interactive universe is a fine example. Set in an alternative Rainbow Six timeline where Earth has been invaded by a race of swampy, Lovecraftian aliens known as the Archaeans, it stars the spec-ops warriors from the multiplayer shooter hit Siege as they set out to kick ET’s ass. Players form teams of three operatives, each with their own special skills and weapons, and then go into alien invasion sites to kill monsters and get things done. Every site is divided into three escalatingly difficult zones, with different objectives, and players can choose to exfiltrate after each section or gamble on not getting killed and continue on to the end, for greater rewards.  The key is to take things slowly and carefully. Believe me, the run-and-gun approach is not an option here. As in Siege, you can send in a remote control buggy to check out unexplored areas and tag enemies and mission objectives before risking your own bodies, which is good because the aliens don’t mess about: some tear at you with blade-like limbs, some shoot blue spikes, some gambol up to you on all-fours and then explode like some sort of weaponised labrador. Plus, if you get into a noisy shootout, each environment is littered with boil-like seed pods that produce new enemies until you destroy them. Stealth, careful team management and the inventive use of gadgets such as motion trackers and sentry guns, is the key, especially in the early stages where your health gauge is puny and your body armour is apparently made out of balsa wood and hope. The zones themselves take in everything from New York hotels to San Francisco punk clubs and Alaska refineries. Locations are dark and twisty and multilevelled and as in Siege there are walls you can smash down and doorways you can barricade in order to control the flow of the action. When you complete a sub-zone you get awarded a bunch of points for completing tasks and doing extra challenges, and all this goes toward levelling up your equipment and researching handy new gadgets such as claymores and scan grenades, which highlight all the enemies in an area. What it feels like then is a tactical co-op shooter crossed with Call of Duty’s Zombie mode crossed with the XCOM turn-based strategy games. You’re not just hunting and shooting the aliens, you’re investigating their biology and using it to create new defences (which is very XCOM), but occasionally a mission will require you to defend a key section for several seconds as the monsters team toward you, which feels very like Zombies, or any frenzied horde mode shooter. The interplay between tense exploration and these moments of loud, lethal action is extremely well-handled, and trying to complete an objective when you’re all on 1% of health and you can hear the aliens breathing nearby is genuinely nerve-shredding stuff. As if that wasn’t enough pressure, there’s an extra resurrection mechanic ripped from the roguelite genre. When operatives are incapacitated during a mission, they’re left behind and you have to go back and rescue them on a later incursion. The rescue sequence involves you yanking the character from a horrible gooey tree-monster before it consumes them – am idea surely inspired by co-op horror title Dead by Daylight. Clearly, the developers of Extraction saw the old Oscar Wilde quote – “talent borrows, genius steals” – and nicked it for their design document. But honestly, it doesn’t matter. This is an enthralling strategy shooter with thorough world-building, a well-balanced progression system and atmospheric locations. The soundtrack, too, is excellent, a mix of John Carpenter-esque synth tracks and spooky cello sonatas that really immerse you in the fiction. Playing with two pals is the optimum experience, but you can choose to be placed with strangers or to go it alone – in which case it becomes a survival horror experience akin to the more shooty Resident Evil titles. There are plenty of co-op shooters on the market, and some intriguing titles on the way (Sons of the Forest, Gotham Knights, Redfall), but Extraction has military gadgets, dank horror and heart-stopping stealth, and those are qualities that, although not original, make for a heck of a game.

1/19/2022,"It’s common enough in theatre and opera to preserve a classic text and entirely reconceive its production; less so in ballet. English National Ballet director Tamara Rojo has excellent reasons for a new take on Marius Petipa’s 19th-century Raymonda, an orientalist crusader story of a virtuous maid, noble knight and evil Saracen. She shifts the action to the Crimean war, where a young Englishwoman has followed her soldier fiance, and discovers a sense of vocation in nursing. It sounds like a canny move, setting the scene for a Victorian costume drama about a woman’s choices, inspired by the spirit of national treasure Florence Nightingale – perfect BBC primetime material.Of course, score, sets, style, roles and steps had to be reworked to fitthe rethink, but never mind purism: does it work?In parts, but not as a whole. The highlight is Raymonda’s dream scene.It harnesses the essence of balletic magic – a stage flooded withmoonlight and dancers in gauzy white – but peoples this traditionallyfemale realm with both men and women, their ordered ranks, crossing runsand sighing spirals engendering an almost spiritual sense of the tenderwith the wounded. You believe that in nursing, Raymonda really has seena higher purpose.  But nursing, and indeed the war itself, are marginal to the ballet –sometimes literally, as when bouncy soldiers and smiley wenches hog thestage while casualties and carers remain discreetly on the sidelines.True, the figure of Sister Clemence (Precious Adams) is an intermittentcall to conscience, but Raymonda (Shiori Kase) is more exercised byanother dilemma: should she choose good English soldier John de Bryan(Isaac Hernández) – husband material, basically – or flashy Turkishambassador Abdur Rahman (Jeffrey Cirio)? Rojo introduces some effective ambivalence to these interactions, Kaseand Hernández in particular often starting their duets physically atodds with each other. But a lot of choreographic action is hard-codedinto the score and steps, and sprightly folk dancers in their finestkeep bounding in from all over to jolly things along, regardless.A bold concept, lavishly produced with great music and great dancing,but it’s not so great drama when the heroine finally chooses hervocation, and it feels like the most interesting part of her story isabout to begin.

1/19/2022,"There was purposeful work being done inside the expansive food bank warehouse, with Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean blasting from a small stereo near the loading dock to help spur the groups of volunteers inside the 60,000-sq-ft facility. Almost two years into the coronavirus pandemic, and now with inflation at a 40-year high, a typical day at the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama (CFBCA) reveals an abundance of activity and cheer belying the steep odds these neighborhood lifelines face.  It’s not just the price of food. On a recent Tuesday with dreary weather outside in Homewood, a suburb of Birmingham, CFBCA community engagement coordinator Steven Hatcher was told a delivery of the flat boxes his team assembles to distribute food hadn’t arrived. It was another supply chain problem, just one of many. Hatcher walked off in search of news as volunteers chatted while putting together the last few boxes left on site. They’re filled with pre-sorted food items by other volunteers, then loaded on to trucks and distributed to 265 smaller partner agencies serving thousands of families who need food donations across 12 Alabama counties. “Each box is designed to feed a family of four for a week,” said Hatcher. Without enough boxes, packing and moving donations to the public could be held up, wasting volunteers’ time and delaying food reaching hungry people. So when a forklift carrying a pallet of 500 boxes cruised through the warehouse at the last minute, there was a sense of relief. While the volunteers put them together, the food bank’s chief executive, Brett Meredith, was talking prices. “Pre-pandemic we used to buy a load of vegetables for $15,000 to $17,000. That same load of vegetables today costs between $27,000 and $29,000, from the same suppliers,” he said. And take peanut butter, which food banks across America rely upon as a nutritious, shelf-stable protein that’s easy to distribute. “We’ve not had trouble getting it,” Meredith said. “But two years ago we could buy a truckload of peanut butter for probably $45,000. That same truckload six weeks ago cost me $80,000 – and we’ve purchased more food in the last year than we ever have in our history.” Last year the bank had to pay for more of its food needs because of what Meredith called a six-month “slump” in federal supplies. The government had been buying farm industry surpluses and providing them to nutritional programs, including food banks, that were in shortfall because of international trade wars during the Trump administration – a Department of Agriculture (USDA) measure known as trade mitigation. That federal help stopped on 1 January 2021, but without the farm supplies returning as before. In the first six months of 2021, the bank was getting only 48% of its usual quantity of food arriving this way, and for the second half of 2021 they “gradually built up to about 80%” of what they were receiving in 2020, Meredith said. Extra work went into encouraging retail reclamation food supplies from partner grocery stores and more food drives with partners, such as the Birmingham Bulls hockey team, to increase community donations. But instead of giving out fewer boxes or smaller portions during these tough times, leaving the 428,000 people the bank said it helped in 2020 short, it has covered costs for the time being by leaning heavily on donors, grants and financial reserves. CFBCA distributed 21.9m pounds of food in 2020 compared with 13m in 2018. The total cost of food purchases will be above $3m in 2021, Meredith estimated, three times pre-pandemic costs. According to a 2020 national report commissioned before the pandemic, one in four children and one in six adults in America experienced hunger on a regular basis and an estimated 35,000 children fall within a “meal gap”, and rely on food banks. Black families in the US have gone hungry at two to three times the rate of white families over the course of the pandemic, a Guardian investigation last year concluded. On a chilly morning earlier this month, CFBCA’s supplies rumbled out of the warehouse and trucks fanned out across the region. One destination was Build-A-Bridge community pantry, a non-profit organization affiliated with Revival Center, a Christian church in Vincent, a rural town of 2,000 residents 30 miles from Birmingham. CFBCA staff and volunteers arrived bright and early, ready to distribute boxes stuffed with assorted nuts, pork loin, frozen vegetables, butter, cheese and more. Members of the public began arriving, themselves struggling withhigh food and gas prices and the virus making people sick and wiping out jobs, while government pandemic-related benefits and protections are petering out. Those picking up food skewed older and on this day were a relatively diverse crowd. Bonita McCrimmon, a Black senior who lives close by, drove into the lot. McCrimmon is involved with Build-A-Bridge and is also a client. She said she was there to pick up boxes of food not only for herself but for at least two other families. “What I get I also share with other people. I’ve got neighbors, older people, and a lot of them don’t have transportation. Some of them have Covid,” she said. Cars flowed smoothly through the center, boxes of food flying out of volunteers’ hands. Not all visitors were eager to talk about struggling to feed themselves or their children. Gladys Dennis, a white senior citizen, drove from Sylacauga, 20 miles south, with a friend. Both of them received a box of food and Dennis said she’d visited another mobile pantry a month earlier, each trip taking 20 minutes each way – with inflation-driven gas prices. “But we don’t have anything else,” she said of the food banks and community pantries. “It feels really good to know that they help a lot of people, especially older people.” Volunteer Angela Traweek helps lead Build-A-Bridge, which currently operates two days a week, serving Vincent and its surrounding cities with provisions sourced from the CFBCA. She said the pantry had 22,000lb of food to distribute that day, enough to feed 300 families. During a lull in traffic, before which Traweek had greeted everyone with huge smiles and inquiries about how they were doing, she said: “We have so many people. The list of clients is growing tremendously with inflation, the higher prices of groceries, and we’re getting more and more people that come in. So eventually, we may have more days.” Her voice broke as she talked of people’s hardship. “It brings tears to your eyes when you have the elderly come through and say, ‘We paid our rent and our light bills, but we didn’t know if we were going to have anything to eat because we had to buy our medicine.’” Then she turned, smiling, to the next car approaching. Back at the food bank warehouse, Meredith, who arrived in the job less than two years ago, said he had been in the process improving long-term planning at the 38-year-old bank when the coronavirus pandemic hit and, over time, supply chain problems mounted. “Food banks like Atlanta’s, Nashville, east Tennessee, Memphis, they’ve all developed, they all, you know, they kind of put their stake in the ground 10 to 20 years ago … we planned week-to-week … and we can’t do that any more,” Meredith said. He continued: “It does require much more planning, and that’s a good thing, because it forces us to do the things I think we need to do. In our 12-county area, the food insecurity rate is about 45.8m meals this year. We’re going to be able to provide between 15m and 16m meals, only about a third of the need. We have to grow that because within 10 years we need to be at 85 or 90%.” Right now, as the pandemic drags on and inflation fails to abate, the bank is also dealing with staff shortages, as are so many employers. “Drivers are in short supply. We had a driver who gave us two days’ notice before he left. You’re really put in a difficult position when you lose someone who’s been with the company for years in days’ time. If we were to lose three or four people in a short period of time – say, in operations – we’d be hard-pressed to be able to fulfill what we need to fulfill,” Meredith said. And in an echo of the erratic box delivery problem, efforts to reach donors has been hampered by, of all things, problems with paper supplies to send out letters, in a region where many, especially in more rural areas, often rely more on newspapers, snail mail and post office boxes than the internet. Nicole Williams, the food bank’s director of development, said of the organization’s holiday season fundraising efforts: “At this time of year we do a lot of direct mail asking for donor gifts that come in. There’s a paper shortage, so all our mailings were three weeks late, which means we haven’t brought in as much money as we usually do. So that’s been frustrating.” Despite the Omicron surge and other obstacles, staff and volunteers worked smoothly in unison, as Blackstreet’s Don’t Leave Me was blasting out and the food boxes were stacking up. Meredith summed up: “If I was a glass-half-empty kind of guy, I’d be wringing my hands. But I don’t think that serves any purpose. I believe that we just keep doing what we’re doing, and doing it very well.” ",News/Environment,‘We have to grow’: Alabama food bank struggles amid supply crisis and pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/19/alabama-food-bank-covid-supply-chain-crisis
1/19/2022,"Around 40 miles south of San Francisco, three futuristic structures rise from the earth. With sloping roofs clad in thousands of overlapping tiles, the buildings could be mistaken for the world’s most architecturally advanced circus tent.  They are, in fact, part of Google’s new Bay View campus, which is due to welcome employees this year – pandemic allowing – and is situated a few miles east of its existing HQ campus in Mountain View. The firm says the finished buildings will have 90,000 tiles which form a “solar skin” roof, which its designers have named “dragonscale” and estimate will generate almost 7 megawatts of energy or 40% of the electricity needs of the campus. It sees this as part of its efforts to hit the pledge made by CEO Sundar Pichai that Google will run every data center and campus on carbon-free energy by 2030. Corporations have never been under more pressure to follow through and make meaningful progress on carbon emissions from regulators and amid greater scrutiny around “greenwashing” from environmentalists – and their own employees. Demand for low-emission offices is larger than it ever has been, according to several US architects the Guardian spoke to. That’s especially true in California, where manifestations of the climate crisis are obvious: hotter summers, drought and an annual wildfire season. “Buildings are awful for the environment,” said Eric Corey Freed, the sustainability director at architecture firm CannonDesign. “If we’re going to solve climate change, we have to fix our buildings.” In the US, buildings consumed around 40% of the country’s electricity in 2020, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration, and are also one of the planet’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gasses, accounting for 37% of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions. That’s not including all the emissions from refrigerants – chemicals that maintain air conditioning systems and refrigerators – which have a global warming potential that’s hundreds to thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide. Designers must consider the “operational carbon” of running the building and the “embodied carbon” of creating it, such as the emissions from producing materials, constructing the project and transporting waste offsite. Freed is optimistic, however, because the costs of being sustainable are coming down. “Considering solar [panels] for your campus or your building is so much less expensive than it used to be,” added Maria Papiez, the director of sustainable design for EwingCole. “That really was only for the Googles in the past, who had the dollars to do that. And now, it’s the least expensive form of electricity in some places.” As well as the “dragonscale” solar panels, Google’s new campus also plans to have a geothermal battery underground where it will store heat to warm the building, Asim Tahir, the tech giant’s lead on its sustainable energy strategy, told Grist. The idea behind all the Bay View innovations is “to kickstart this market in the US by showing it can be done”, Tahir said. Google has been working on the project with architecture firms Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) as well as Switzerland-based company SunStyle, which has created arrays of solar panels on multiple buildings in Europe and wants to expand in the US. “I really do like the idea of a tipping point,” said Papiez of EwingCole. “Once we get enough critical mass, there’s this opportunity to really tip in the right direction.” Chris Chatto, a principal at architecture firm ZGF who has focused on sustainability for the past 15 years, says that he has seen a substantial uptick in clients requesting sustainable buildings. “Honestly, the amount of conversations I’ve had in the last three to six months is probably the same amount that I’ve had in the last few years,” he said. ZGF is currently working with Microsoft, which has also made major goals to cut down carbon emissions. “I think in some ways”, he added, “we’ve probably seen more consistent signals and interest from the tech industry on the west coast.” Architect Anthony Brower, a LEED Fellow and director of sustainability at architecture firm Gensler has seen this too, beyond just the big tech giants. “Some clients have very general requests,” he said, “They want to see sustainability integrated into their work. Other clients are getting very specific about exactly what they want in a very sophisticated manner.” Aside from contributing to global climate goals, sustainable architecture has increasingly become a recruitment strategy, specifically when competing for Gen-Z workers who deeply care about the climate and want to work for a company that embodies their values. Even Pichai, Google’s CEO, said that shifting to renewables will help the company attract employees. “If you don’t do this correctly, you won’t be able to attract talent,” Pichai told Bloomberg. “When I look at the younger generation, people who are teenagers now, I can’t see them making the choice to work for a company which they feel is polluting.” Freed agrees, noting that employees often enjoy the experience of being in a sustainable building more than a traditional office, even if they don’t know why, in part because sustainable spaces are often filled with light and natural materials. As Freed put it, “The spaces are just better to be in.” But this movement isn’t just about recruiting or doing something ethical. As laws and building codes are updated, companies face mounting pressure to put resources behind sustainable projects. By 2030, California has a goal to bring its greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels. Corporations also don’t want to be penalized for refusing to comply with potentially more stringent laws down the line. “There are carbon emission laws where building owners are being required to essentially increase their carbon efficiency … and if they don’t, they’re being fined,” said Chatto, the architect at ZGF. These signals are changing how investors think about their buildings. “At least some of our clients are recognizing they’re going to hold on to the building for 10 years. Then when they want to sell and recoup and make a profit on their investment, it could be a very, very different world 10 years from now,” he said. One of California’s recent building laws may incentivize companies to move away from some of the most polluting building materials. In July, the state gave the green light to mass timber buildings up to 18 stories high. Mass timber – smaller pieces of wood fused into strong slabs – is heralded as a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete, and has been widely used in Europe for two decades already. Before the code update, California limited mass timber structures for commercial use to six stories, making it impossible for many projects to use. Mass timber presents an exciting prospect in California. The material has a naturally lower carbon footprint than concrete and steel, and even sequesters carbon, pulling it out of the atmosphere, like trees, to turn a building into a carbon sink. California’s first multi-story, fully mass timber building, 1 De Haro, developed by SKS Partners and designed by Perkins&Will, was recently completed in San Francisco. With floor-to-ceiling glass windows paired with raw wood beams and ceilings, the space looks warm yet pristine. The project is zoned to be part office, part space for light manufacturing. With its pledge to become carbon free, Google is attempting a bold feat. The goal is a steep one, especially since it’s not only responsible for the output of its campuses, but massive data centers housing its servers. It’s worth noting that Google’s plan does not account for the company’s scope 3 emissions – emissions that tie back to the company, but that the company may not control. These include the manufacturing, production materials, and transport of Chromebooks and Pixel, according to Grist. Though this isn’t foul play, it’s a shortcoming of the net-zero metric and applies to companies across the board. To move the needle, architects continue to push sustainable workplaces as tools for change. “It’s been an exciting time to be in sustainability”, Freed said, “to see these pressures mounting, and companies now not only have to take it seriously, they want to, because they’re seeing these overarching trends.”",News/Technology,Google’s ‘dragonscale’ solar-powered roof signals growing demand for sustainable workspaces,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/19/google-dragonscale-solar-powered-roof-sustainable-workspaces
1/19/2022,"Vampire bats “have each other’s backs”, according to one of the extraordinary stories in this fascinating book. Should one bat be hungry, a roost mate will regurgitate a nutritious meal of semi-digested blood to help it live to bite another day. In a similar display of apparent altruism, a bee with a parasite will isolate itself rather than infect the rest of the colony – a Captain Oates-like sacrifice on the bee’s part. And, say what you like about rats; in experiments they will open a door to let a cold, wet stranger into their cosy nests. “We can trace direct and important parallels between our own societies and those of the animals with whom we share the planet,” writes Ashley Ward, a professor in animal behaviour. “By understanding animals on their own terms, we can understand ourselves so much the better.” Actually, he draws very few explicit connections between animal behaviour and our own, and is cautious about ascribing emotions or motivations to the creatures he studies – even in tear-jerking anecdotes about how elephants and wolves appear to mourn. But it’s hard not to take from some of his stories the idea that humans could learn a lot from social animals, for all our massive brains and our ability to pass knowledge down generations. “Our instinct for co-operation has provided the foundation for human civilisation,” he points out. We need that now more than ever.  Ward describes this book as his attempt “to distil the wonder that I still feel in the company of animals”, and it certainly does that. He seems intent on arousing sympathy for the creepiest of creatures, and while that means that you’ll read some chapters through your fingers as he describes the causes of homicidal locust swarms or the scent of “hyena butter”, any writer who can evoke the existential sadness of a lonely cockroach, or make krill thrilling, or describe a snorkelling colleague being engulfed in a “gargantuan cetacean bum detonation” is a real gift to science communication. Means of cooperation vary widely across species, and many of them have already helped humans to live better. Fish shoals and starling murmurations, for instance, inspired systems to prevent driverless cars from crashing. Swarm intelligence, or “the wisdom of the crowd”, explains the effectiveness of search engines such as Google. On the other hand, it is the natural tendency of fish to shoal that has enabled people, with our huge trawlers and vast nets, to push some species to the brink. If humans had more of a shoal mentality, would we be better able to think about what’s best for the future of the entire group? Some thought-provoking chapters about baboons, bonobos and chimpanzees show how humans could learn from our closest relatives, too. At their best, complex societies are often founded on networking rather than domination by strength, Ward suggests. The alpha male “must be a relationship-builder, rather than a despot”; those who cheat are often punished; and “the perception of fairness may be an essential part of the glue that binds them”. Ward also explains how bonobos greet foreign troupes with a feast in a fruit tree and an afternoon of promiscuous and pansexual genital rubbing, so it is important not to extrapolate too directly from animals to ourselves, after all. Perhaps humans could start by just trying to be a bit more bat.  The Social Lives of Animals: How Co-Operation Conquered the Natural World is published by Profile (£20).

1/19/2022,"KPMG has been fined £4.3m for failures during its audit of the Bargain Booze owner Conviviality and severely reprimanded in the latest blow to its reputation. The accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), found “a serious lack of competence” in KPMG’s 2017 audit of the company, which collapsed within nine months of the accounts being signed off.  The KPMG partner in charge of the audit, Nicola Quayle, was also fined £110,000 and given a severe reprimand. Quayle, who previously led KPMG’s Manchester office and sat on its UK board, will pay £80,850, after receiving a discount for admitting the failures. Conviviality was the owner of brands including Wine Rack and the high-end wine retailer Bibendum, and it also distributed drinks to major hospitality chains including JD Wetherspoon, Yates and Slug and Lettuce. It was worth £500m and had 4,000 staff in March 2018, but by early April it had collapsed into administration after investors realised that its series of acquisitions had left it overextended. It is the latest in a string of audit scandals for KPMG. It has also admitted misconduct over its audit of Carillion, the government contractor that went bust in 2018. A disciplinary tribunal heard on Tuesday that the partner leading that audit was deliberately trying to portray himself as negligent to avoid a charge of misconduct, according to counsel for another member of the audit team. The partner denied the allegation and denies misconduct. KPMG also received a near-record fine of £13m for misconduct in August related to a conflict of interest in the sale of the bed company Silentnight to a private equity firm. The FRC said “KPMG should have been more professionally sceptical” of Conviviality’s claims to have somehow exceeded earnings targets at the last minute. It also failed to check adequately for fraud and failed to obtain evidence of the company’s claims across five separate areas, the regulator said. The deputy executive counsel to the FRC, Claudia Mortimore, said: “The audit failings in this case were serious, spanned several significant areas of the financial statements and related to a number of fundamental auditing standards including the requirement to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, apply sufficient professional scepticism, and prepare proper audit documentation. The sanctions reflect the seriousness of the failings. “The sanctions also reflect the poor regulatory track record of each of the respondents and are intended to enhance the quality and reliability of future audits.” The regulator also found, however, that the failures were not “intentional, dishonest, deliberate or reckless”. The chief executive of KPMG in the UK, Jon Holt, said: “I’m sorry that our work wasn’t good enough in this instance. I am committed to resolving, and learning from, our past cases and this development marks another step forward in dealing with these matters. We have fully cooperated with the FRC throughout their investigation.”",News/Business,KPMG fined £4.3m for ‘serious failings’ in Conviviality audit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/kpmg-fined-43m-for-serious-failings-in-conviviality-audit
1/19/2022,"Yorkshire have appointed Ottis Gibson as their new head coach on a three-year deal as the county begins rebuilding in the wake of the racism abuse scandal. The 52-year-old, who has been head coach for the West Indies and South Africa as well as working as a bowling coach for England, is the latest new addition to a revamped backroom staff at Headingley.  Gibson will start work at the end of February, after his involvement with Pakistan Super League side the Multan Sultans comes to an end. Last month Yorkshire announced the departures of 16 members of staff, including the entire coaching team. That included the director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, and first-team coach Andrew Gale. The county is trying to change its personnel and culture after the damaging allegations of racial harassment and bullying raised against the club by former player Azeem Rafiq, which led to the loss of sponsors and the right to stage international matches at Headingley. Darren Gough has since been appointed as interim managing director of cricket, and Gibson will report in to him, the club said. Yorkshire plan to appoint two assistants shortly to work alongside Gibson. Lord Kamlesh Patel, who was appointed club chair in November, said: “We’re delighted to welcome Ottis to the club. His playing and coaching credentials speak for themselves and he has had a distinguished career performing at the highest level. “Ottis’s character and his commitment to buying into the process that we are going through at Yorkshire County Cricket Club shone through in our discussions. He is someone that I know will encourage dialogue and help foster a culture of inclusion at the club, as well as supporting and developing the world class talent we have here and pushing them to the next level. “I look forward to working with Ottis over the coming weeks and months as we continue our rebuild of the club.” Gibson’s playing career as an all-rounder included stints with Durham, Glamorgan and Leicestershire. He also played two Tests and 15 one-day internationals for the West Indies. “I’m extremely honoured and excited to be given the opportunity to join Yorkshire County Cricket Club as head coach,” he said. “This is one of the most prestigious roles in English county cricket, and I am really looking forward to working with this talented group of players to take the club forward. I’ve spoken at length with ‘Goughy’ about the direction the club is heading in and I’m excited to be a part of that future.”",Sport/Sport,Yorkshire appoint Ottis Gibson as new head coach on three-year contract,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/county-cricket-yorkshire-appoint-ottis-gibson-head-coach

You could tell by the way it swallowed and belched. Yet in The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian spin-off series currently streaming on Disney+, we’re expected to believe that the iconic bounty hunter (now played by Temuera Morrison) actually survived in the acid-filled belly of the sarlacc, having siphoned oxygen from a stormtrooper’s helmet, before burning his way out with the flamethrower on his wrist, then blindly clawing through several metres of sand. Improbable, you might think, but then no one ever really dies in Star Wars. There are action figures and sequels to sell.  There’s a precedent for Boba’s unlikely resurrection: plenty of non-canonical novels, comics and short stories have already depicted his escape from the sarlacc. But little did we know that this show was bringing him back only to kill him all over again. And by kill him I mean systematically take apart everything that ever made him the coolest and most mysterious character in a galaxy far, far away. In The Book of Boba Fett, the once-menacing freelancer has become a softie with a heart of gold. He has relinquished his title as a bounty hunter, become so curiously forgiving that he actually set free a Wookiee assassin just moments after it tried to murder him in his sleep, stroked a rancor behind its ear as if it were his oversized house cat and called a Tusken raider “mate”. It all started during an episode of The Mandalorian, in which Boba was properly reintroduced to audiences, where he spoke of his fear and disapproval of the Empire – one of his former and frequent clients. Within minutes, he was fighting for the light side for the very first time, having inexplicably been repositioned as a “good guy”. Or a guy with a moral compass, at least. Whatever he is now, he’s unrecognisable from the character that once fascinated Star Wars fans. This is the same Boba who previously had no problem working for notorious choker Darth Vader and notorious chokee Jabba the Hutt. When we were introduced to the live-action version of the character in The Empire Strikes Back (he actually made his first appearance in the animated segment of the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978), he was quite obviously a cold-blooded gun-for-hire with the sole aim of collecting his next bounty. It may have just been business, but he certainly wasn’t petting monsters and making friends. So why the sudden transformation? What originally made Boba the most interesting and mysterious character in the franchise was the fact that we knew absolutely nothing about him. Back then, he was just this cool, armoured bloke who stood on the side looking hard. He never took off his helmet and he barely spoke – he had a grand total of four lines in The Empire Strikes Back, and none at all in Return of the Jedi. And yet he still went on to become one of the most popular and talked about characters of the original trilogy. So much so that creator George Lucas even briefly considered making him the main villain in Jedi, with the ambitious intention of stretching out Luke Skywalker’s story over a number of subsequent trilogies. Making Boba Fett the main bad guy, or even a central character, would have diminished his all-important mystique, something that ultimately ended up happening anyway when he was dreadfully reintroduced as a child clone in Episode II: Attack of the Clones. And now it’s happening all over again. As this Disney+ series continues to examine his softer side in excruciatingly uninteresting detail, it feels as though the circle of bastardisation is almost complete. All we need now is a subplot in which he adopts a baby version of Yoda and spends at least two episodes wiping sick off its chin. Thanks to its treatment of the once badass, nihilistic bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett has turned out to be just another piece of bitterly disappointing, franchise-tarnishing tosh. Proof, if you ever needed it, that some parts of the galaxy are best left unexplored.",Arts/Television & radio,Boba Fett is dead: how Disney+ ruined Star Wars’ coolest character,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/19/boba-fett-is-dead-how-disney-ruined-star-wars-coolest-character
1/19/2022,"The Blundstone Arena in Hobart recently provided the scene for English cricketing humiliation, but England Women have happier memories there. In January 2014, Charlotte Edwards hit 92 not out to inspire her team to a nine-wicket win in a T20 that was, in the new multi-format era, an Ashes-winning knock. Edwards brushed tears from her eyes, lifted the trophy in triumph and England had a nice, deserved night out on the town to celebrate (and no police had to be called in to send them to bed, either).  For a while, Edwards was the heroine of the hour; but cricket is a fickle mistress. Eighteen months later she surrendered the Ashes to Meg Lanning’s Australia, losing the Canterbury Test by 161 runs, and the media called for her head. By May 2016 she had lost a World T20 semi-final to the old enemy; she paid for it dearly, robbed of the captaincy and her place in the England side. As Joe Root knows only too well, England captains can have all the success in the world against other opponents but they will ultimately be judged by their record against Australia – an adage that equally applies in the context of the women’s game. No England captain has won a Women’s Ashes series since Edwards triumphed at Hobart in 2014. Edwards’s successor, Heather Knight, is the latest to attempt the feat, in a series that begins on Thursday with three T20s, followed closely by a Test and three ODIs. Knight has won a World Cup, reached the final of another (2018), and was prevented from the chance to play in the final of yet another (2020) by inclement weather, but success against Australia has consistently eluded her. Since she became captain in 2016, England have won just four out of 11 T20s against Australia – a win percentage of 36%. In ODIs, that percentage is even lower (two won out of seven played). England have managed to cling on for draws in the Ashes Tests they have played under Knight – at Sydney in 2017 and Taunton in 2019 – but Australia were dominant on both occasions. Perhaps it is frustration at this poor showing that has inspired Knight’s new approach of “trying to punch first and be aggressive … fighting fire with fire”. Will it work? The signs are not good. “I wouldn’t say we’ve started that well, to be totally honest,” said the England coach, Lisa Keightley, on Monday, an early contender for understatement of the tour. First, the schedule was rejigged at the 11th hour due to Covid, with the T20s brought forward, rendering England’s focus on red-ball practice during their camp in Oman irrelevant to the first leg of the series and leaving them with 10 days to acclimatise after landing in Australia. Then England’s first outdoor training session in Canberra was conducted in pouring rain. Finally, over the weekend, they played two warm-up T20 games against the England A side that has accompanied them. They lost both, despite Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt being given two chances to bat in the second match. “We’ve got to get the players hitting the ball well and bowling in good areas and sharpening up,” Keightley said. Not much to do in the next three days, then. Admittedly, Australia’s own preparations have not been free from disruption. Several Women’s National Cricket League matches had to be called off due to the rapid spread of Omicron, leaving a number of their best players with little game-time since the WBBL ended in November. While Jess Jonassen (leg injury), Rachael Haynes (parental leave) and Megan Schutt (ditto) are returning to the side after extended periods of absence, the squad is far from full-strength. Frontline bowlers Sophie Molineux and Georgia Wareham are sitting out with injuries and the decision to bring in Alana King as leg-spin cover instead of Amanda-Jade Wellington has raised eyebrows. Alyssa Healy is fighting her way back from an elbow injury and a catastrophic loss of form at the back end of WBBL. The latest, most severe, blow occurred on Tuesday : news broke that Beth Mooney, Australia’s key in-form batter and leading WBBL run-scorer, sustained a fractured jaw during training and will have surgery. The Australian camp are suggesting she may still be fit by the end of the series, but that instinctively feels unlikely given the nature of the injury. The perpetual threat of a Covid outbreak hangs over the series. ABoth sides have already been affected, despite severe restrictions in place on socialising: a member of the England support staff tested positive on Friday. Ellyse Perry’s arrival into Adelaide to join her teammates was also delayed by a Covid scare, though her positive PCR test was later found to have been the result of a previous, asymptomatic infection and she has been cleared to join the squad. The challenge that Covid poses to the mental health of players should also not be overlooked. An Ashes series is always accompanied by extra scrutiny, but the intensity of this tour – which will immediately be followed by a 10-day quarantine in New Zealand before the World Cup – is bound to take its toll. “What I’ve learned on this journey of Covid is that everyone’s bucket gets full at different times and you can’t pick it,” Keightley said. “You think one day they’re OK and you talk to them two days later and they’re not coping. It is a challenge supporting teams and being an athlete over the last 18 months.” Perhaps more than ever before, the battle over the next few weeks will be being fought off the pitch, as well as on it.
