3/21/2022,"Down an unassuming street on the outskirts of Warsaw, among a series of warehouses, a hostel has been set up to host non-Ukrainian refugees among the nearly two million who have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion. In the entrance hallway is a poster with messages from recent Afghan guests: “Thank you to Poland,” reads one. “People don’t think about the fact that there are non-Ukrainian refugees from Ukraine and there are for sure some people who are afraid,” said Marianna Ossolińska, who is managing the hostel, an initiative of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia. “That’s why this hostel was created because we couldn’t accommodate or host people anywhere else. We have the entire world here,” she said, of the many nationalities. “It’s harder to find a place for single men and people are sometimes probably more willing to take mothers and children,” she said. “Most of our guests arrive very tired, they need a quiet place to rest and feel safe. Then they can start to think about what they will do next. I get the feeling that many of them have no idea.” Guests, Ossolińska said, typically stay for about three days while they plan their next steps. There have been no issues so far, but Ossolińska prefers that the location is not publicised due to safety concerns for guests, most of whom are not Ukrainian. In recent weeks it was reported that Polish far-right nationalists attacked groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern refugees who had crossed the Ukrainian border. Mustafa*, 24, from Algeria, is a current guest. A business student in Kharkiv, he fled to Poland and came to the hostel three days ago after running out of money and not having anywhere else to go. “I applied to the business school here. I want to stay if I can find somewhere [to live],” he said, “I wouldn’t go back to Algeria, it’s very corrupt. I don’t even have a thought to go back.” Mustafa is unsure about his immigration status. “I don’t want to be illegal. I called the Algerian embassy and they said it’s OK to stay here,” he said. Mustafa hopes to remain in Warsaw if he can find a job and enrol at a university in the capital. Yusup, 25, is originally from Turkmenistan and has lived in Ukraine for the past 10 years. A day before the Russian invasion he submitted his final documents for citizenship, which now feels like a dream. He arrived at the hostel with his Ukrainian wife after hearing through friends that it was a safe place. “We decided to come and ask if they had a space and the volunteers were so kind and they offered us a room,” he said. Arslan*, 29, also from Turkmenistan, and his Ukrainian wife, Daria, 25, also found the hostel through friends. Arslan does not wish to give his real name because he is worried for his family in Turkmenistan. “It’s not a good situation there,” he said. Arslan trained as a general surgeon in Ukraine and had learned to speak the language. The couple now hope to travel to Germany. Olga, 28, a Ukrainian from the Donbas region, arrived with a large group of friends from Turkmenistan who sought refuge in the hostel. “Since 2014 me and my family have known war, killing and what it is to die,” she said. While the hostel’s doors are open to everyone, Agnieszka Karol, 45, a Polish volunteer, said it was an important safe space for those who might not otherwise find accommodation. “Not every Polish family is ready to accept someone who is not of Ukrainian origin,” she said. “There are two women with children who arrived this morning who are Ukrainian nationals but are Roma so it also might be difficult to find a place for them.” Ossolińska, like many Polish citizens who have stepped up in response to the crisis, juggles volunteering with a full-time job. “I don’t know anyone who is looking at what is happening and is doing nothing,” she said. * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘We have the entire world here’: Polish hostel taking in foreigners from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/21/poland-ukraine-refugees-entire-world-hostel-everyone-welcome
3/21/2022,"Kimberley Kitching’s husband has, during her funeral service, criticised a “cantankerous cabal” over its treatment of the late Victorian senator. Family, friends, and state and federal politicians from both sides of politics gathered at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne on Monday to farewell the Labor senator who died suddenly on 10 March of a suspected heart attack. She was 52. Her husband, Andrew Landeryou, told mourners they married in the same cathedral two decades ago. “It feels like yesterday looking down on a grey Derby Day that I saw her walking in,” he said. “Her customary 45 minutes late, looking absolutely radiant, and as she did the sun streamed down directly on her as she stepped toward our married life.” Landeryou said when Kitching died there was, inside her car, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne she bought for a dinner party planned for that evening and a pie from a bakery she knew he liked. “It’s a poignant reminder to me of her thoughtfulness, that even when she had a lot on her mind, other than call me, I think it was the last thing she did,” he said. Some supporters have appeared to draw links between Kitching’s sudden death and political issues she was facing, including her preselection ahead of the upcoming federal election, and allegations she had been bullied and ostracised by senior Labor members. Landeryou made reference to the “unpleasantness” she had faced. “The simple truth of it is that Kimberley’s political and moral judgment was vastly superior to the small number who opposed her internally,” he said. “And of course, there’s a lot I could say about the unpleasantness of a cantankerous cabal – not all of them in parliament – that was aimed at Kimba, and the intensity of it did baffle and hurt her. “But I hope it’s sufficient to say she deserved so very much better. The truth is the vast majority of the Labor family were welcoming and supportive and encouraging and admiring of Kimberley and they told her so often.” He said he did not blame “any one person, or any one meeting, or any campaign of unpleasantness” for her death, describing it as “God’s will”. “Her friends and ferociously loyal staff are angry about how she was treated, of course they are, and I have no quarrel with them about that. They know what they saw with their own eyes,” he said. “If I am angry with anyone, I am angry with myself, I am angry I wasn’t driving her around that busy day as I often did, I am angry I didn’t meddle enough in her health, I’m angry I failed and failed again to persuade her to slow down, I’m angry I couldn’t and didn’t protect her from menace and I fear I attracted some.” Former Labor leader Bill Shorten, one of Kitching’s closest friends and who was instrumental in her securing her Senate position in 2016, urged the party to “channel their grief” into winning the upcoming federal election. “She understood – in the marrow of her bones – that the people who count on Labor count, above all, on Labor government,” Shorten said. “So I know if she were here with us still all her energy and activism and enthusiasm and the powerful force of her personality would have been dedicated to a Labor victory in May.” Shorten said her office put nearly 12,00 questions on notice to the federal government this parliamentary term and ferociously scrutinised its ministers during estimates, which he described as akin to Kitching “running out onto the MCG”. He said she was instrumental in Australia adopting Magnitsky-style laws and stood up for the people of Ukraine, China’s Muslim Uyghurs, the Tibetans and the pro-democracy activists of Hong Kong. Shorten said Kitching helped rescue 30 people from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control last August, including a Hazara woman named Roya, who was present at the funeral service. Kitching’s father, William Kitching, said his daughter was a bright student and a lover of literature and languages – she spoke five including Latin. He said she made a difference through “respectful, not vengeful, public discourse”. “Today we honour Kim’s good life and trust that our present sense of almost paralysing grief and deep melancholia will be gradually banished by joyful memories of an engaging woman and daughter whom we knew so well,” Kitching said. A statement from the Dalai Lama, who Kitching met in 2017, was read at the beginning of the service, as was a statement from the Senate president, Slade Brockman, who described her as “tough, determined and forensic – occasionally fiery”. “The Senate will be poorer without her,” Brockman’s statement read. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, the deputy leader, Richard Marles, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, the former premier Steve Bracks and senior Coalition figures including former prime minister Tony Abbott, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, the defence minister, Peter Dutton, the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, the government’s Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, and the Victorian Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, attended the service. Senators Kristina Keneally, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher, who were named in media reports as having allegedly “ostracised” Kitching, were also in attendance, as was the Melbourne lord mayor, Sally Capp, the Victorian state secretary of the CFMEU, John Setka, the Health Workers Union secretary, Diana Asmar, and Sky News’ Peta Credlin and Andrew Bolt. Diplomats from several countries including the US and Israel were also present.",News/Australia news,Kimberley Kitching funeral: Husband praises Labor senator’s thoughtfulness and criticises ‘cantankerous cabal’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/kimberley-kitching-funeral-husband-praises-labor-senators-thoughtfulness-and-addresses-cantankerous-cabal
3/21/2022,"Abloodied man empties his wallet to his creditor while being mercilessly attacked by an unprovoked assailant. This is the plight of Ukraine, which recently made a scheduled interest payment to private lenders as tanks rolled over its land and missiles struck its cities. Even before Vladimir Putin started bombing apartment blocks and maternity hospitals, Ukraine was Europe’s poorest country as measured by GDP per capita – significantly poorer than Albania. Yet this war-ravaged country is saddled with unsustainable debt – and as the piles of rubble grow, so do the repayments. That’s debt for Ukraine, but profits for western hedge funds. War, for some, is the ultimate money-spinner. Since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 – triggering a conflict in the east that had claimed thousands of lives before the current invasion – Ukraine has been forced to borrow $61bn (£46bn) from external lenders, according to calculations by the Jubilee Debt Campaign; a small sliver has been paid off, but what remains represents about a third of the country’s total economy. Ukraine was due to cough up $7.3bn this year alone – more than its annual education budget. For a rich country blessed with peace, that would be manageable, but Ukrainians are poorer today than when the Soviet Union collapsed three decades ago. At least $100bn worth of damage has already been inflicted to infrastructure – from roads to bridges, hospitals to schools – and, as you read this, that figure only mounts. Yet almost all of the financial assistance being given to Ukraine is in the form of loans. Precious funds will be diverted from rebuilding a shattered country, instead filling the coffers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and private bondholders. That’s why Ukrainian civil society organisations have launched a petition demanding Ukraine’s debt is cancelled. They note, too, that much of the supposed assistance given to the country has been accompanied by strict conditions: the IMF calls it “economic restructuring”, but it’s more honestly described as the imposition of free-market dogma, resulting, for instance, in a 650% surge in household gas prices since 2014. “Previous governments had two options: either to fairly tax the fat cats and bring them out of the shadows, or to borrow from the IMF and others,” Ukrainian economist Oleksandr Kravchuk told me. “They chose the latter.” The Jubilee Debt Campaign has taken up this demand and begun to lobby MPs in Britain. Like millions of us, executive director Heidi Chow had that gnawing, helpless sense of “we’ve got to do something”. For some, that manifested itself in the demand for a no-fly zone. But in practice, she tells me, that’s a “shoot Russian military aircraft out of the sky” zone, which could easily escalate into nuclear war. In contrast, this is a tangible and hugely impactful proposal with no risk of military escalation. So why hasn’t this commonsense demand been taken up by the powerful? In part, perhaps, it’s because Ukraine’s own government hasn’t officially called for it, although some high-ranking officials have. “They were quite keen before the war to pay debts and push forward their standing in Europe and the world,” suggests Chow. Applying for any form of debt relief is a complicated and drawn-out process. Any fears that their ability to borrow and their global reputation may be damaged clearly need alleviating. Yet the grisly fact is that as yet more loans are granted – even though now without conditions – vast profits are to be made. Ukrainian bonds are trading at about 25 cents in a dollar, and so if repayments continue, hedge funds and banks are set to make profits of more than 300%. That the profit margins of the already obscenely rich are being inflated by the bloody slaughter of civilians should surely be a cause of universal revulsion – and sufficient impetus to action. But if the IMF and World Bank cancel Ukraine’s debt, critics may ask, doesn’t that mean less money in the pot to lend to other poorer countries? But there’s a straightforward solution: richer countries, like our own, should contribute more to make up the shortfall. There is a precedent of sorts – the G20’s debt service suspension initiative suspended or cancelled nearly $11bn of poorer countries’ external debt because of Covid-19. If a pandemic is reason enough to write off debt, surely a war of aggression is too. When this all ends – hopefully in failure for Putin – then Ukraine will need a modern-day Marshall plan, made up of grants, not a reconstruction financed by loans. In terms of the current moment, as the Jubilee Debt Campaign suggests, there should be a mechanism to automatically suspend debt repayments for countries suffering severe external shocks. Ukraine is in the midst of existential crisis – as the Ukrainian social scientist Volodymyr Ishchenko told me: “Personally, it feels like the country in which I was born may simply disappear.” A country battered and bruised by war needs space to breathe. That’s in our power: cancel the debt.

3/21/2022,"Liverpool may have been under full strength but even in defeat it was a test emphatically passed by Steve Cooper’s burgeoning Nottingham Forest side. The hosts displayed impressive defensive discipline and shape to keep Liverpool out for 78 minutes, and arguably should have had a penalty soon after conceding. They almost certainly would have been awarded a spot-kick had Ryan Yates altered his direction slightly and aimed to draw more significant contact from Alisson, the kind of trick pulled so often by Premier League forwards for the benefit of the video assistant referee. The VAR decision to rule Diogo Jota onside for the winner was also very tight. Forest caused Jürgen Klopp’s men problems and had the chances to win the match outright but a lack of ruthlessness with the opportunities they created left Cooper’s side to ponder a couple of marginal decisions that could easily have gone the other way. As Joe Worrall said, Forest went “toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world”. Plenty of positives to take from that. Luke McLaughlin Match report: Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool Manchester City v Liverpool Chelsea v Crystal Palace The ties to be played at Wembley on 16/17 April. Eberechi Eze’s fine first season at Crystal Palace was soundtracked by the fond, paternal shouts of Ray Lewington, who seemed in some games to be present purely for the purpose of in-game coaching Palace’s left-sided attacker. Hopefully Lewington had a Sunday off to shout fondly at his television screen as Eze produced a fine, bold, effective display in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat of Everton. This was significant: Eze’s second start against Premier League opponents since May 2021; an assertive showing after a season struggling with the aftershocks of an achilles injury; and more simply a reminder of what an excellent player he is, so easy on the ball, so progressive in his movement and passing. Palace have a core of high-grade attacking players. Eze against Everton was a reminder that he might just end up the best of that group. Mainly he is just a rare pleasure to watch. Barney Ronay Match report: Crystal Palace 4-0 Everton Bukayo Saka made a point of telling the referee, Robert Madley, he needed more protection after feeling he had received rough treatment during Arsenal’s win at Aston Villa, but he was given short shrift by Steven Gerrard when his concerns were fed through. “It’s part of the game,” Gerrard said. “The last time I checked, it wasn’t a no-contact sport. I think tackles are allowed, physicality is allowed. He’s a good player, an outstanding talent. I love him. But he can’t complain about that side of it, that’s football. I’m sitting here now with screws in my hips. I’ve had about 16 operations. I’m struggling to go to the gym at the moment. That’s all on the back of earning a living in English football. He’ll learn and he’ll learn quick.” In fairness to Saka, he routinely gets up, dusts himself down and carries on; Gerrard was right that Villa had done little wrong, despite rancour over a fair tackle by Tyrone Mings, and the sense was that the England forward was expressing a longer-term frustration. Nick Ames Match report: Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal Whatever madness ensued at Molineux, Wolves allowed themselves to wobble, self-destructing in the wake of Raúl Jiménez’s controversial sending off. It was a decision that stung Bruno Lage but more so his players. Wolves were chasing a third goal that would surely have put the game to bed but Leeds exposed their frailty to devastating effect and Lage was critical of his team’s mentality, accusing his players of being too concerned about the injured Stuart Dallas; they wilted under pressure. Friday night was the first time they have conceded three goals this season. “We created a lot of chances to score more goals and this is how we need to grow up, we need to kill the game,” said the Wolves head coach. “It happened against Manchester United at home [when they conceded a late winner in August] and it’s happened again. These are the little things and we need to grow up as a team.” Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 2-3 Leeds At times it may have looked simple for Chelsea but Thomas Tuchel begged to disagree. According to the visiting manager, beating Middlesbrough 2-0 to reach the FA Cup semi finals took a “huge effort” from his players. It involved Tuchel adjusting his formation to 4-1-4-1 in order to combat Chris Wilder’s clever pressing game and, as Boro’s manager pointed out, the Championship side were never overrun by opponents who could afford to lose £900,000 a week under Roman Abramovich’s out-going ownership. If such losses explain why Chelsea’s sale may not be that straightforward they also highlight the excellence of the job Wilder has done on an infinitely tighter budget since succeeding Neil Warnock in November. After beating Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds Boro can now concentrate on securing a play-off place. They and Wilder would grace the Premier League. Louise Taylor  Match report: Middlesbrough 0-2 Chelsea Two years ago, Manchester City scored 10 against Ipswich Town to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. This season, in a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to West Ham, a team that has already achieved its best-ever WSL points tally, Joe Sheehan’s team showed how far they has come. “We’re such a young squad,” said Ipswich forward Natasha Jones. “Looking back two years ago, we played Man City and they beat us 10-0. We just know we’ve done that little bit better. Look at the scoreline: we’ve played our hearts out, we’ve given everything on the pitch, so we’re really happy with that. It was a great atmosphere and great to be involved in that.” Jones works 40 hours a week as a personal trainer. An impressive 10 players are on professional contracts and the club has some of the best talent in the country. With a top-level academy licence, the signs of progress keep coming. “They’re in the middle of the WSL table and yes, there was a difference there, but we know we can keep on closing that gap.” Suzanne Wrack Match report: Ipswich 0-1 West Ham Coventry United’s fairytale journey from being within eight minutes of going into administration to reaching an FA Cup quarter-final was ended by four goals from 14-time FA Cup winners Arsenal. The resilience of Jay Bradford’s players was on show at Meadow Park as they held the Women’s Champions League quarter-finalists at bay for 38 minutes before Stina Blackstenius opened the scoring. The gap between the WSL leaders Arsenal and the Championship’s bottom side is a big one, but a sturdy first half should give Coventry plenty of positives as they look to climb off the bottom after suffering a 10-point deduction for their financial difficulties at Christmas. The team have clawed back five points since then and sit nine points behind Watford – the team they face on the last game of the season. Suzanne Wrack Match report: Arsenal 4-0 Coventry It was a surprise to see Jan Bednarek omitted from the Southampton lineup for the FA Cup visit of Manchester City – and indeed the match day squad. Had the first-choice centre-back picked up an injury? It turned out it was something else, as Ralph Hassenhüttl would explain after the 4-1 loss. “Bednarek has a big game for Poland next week and it seemed to me he is not 100% with his mind for us here today,” the manager said. “I didn’t want to take the risk that he doesn’t make the last step to hurt himself.” It is certainly a big game for Poland. Bednarek’s team will face either Sweden or the Czech Republic on Tuesday week in a play-off for the World Cup finals. Hasenhüttl did not sound overly pleased with Bednarek and maybe it was because his replacement, Jack Stephens, had an uncomfortable afternoon, making errors, including a bad one for Raheem Sterling’s opening goal. David Hytner  Match report: Southampton 1-4 Manchester City After the final international break of the season, Leicester could suddenly have so much competition for places that, with three games in hand on the teams in seventh and eighth place whom they trail by nine points, they could set themselves up for a barnstorming finish in the Premier League and continue chasing glory in Europe. With PSV Eindhoven to come in the quarter-final of the Europa Conference League and Jamie Vardy, Jonny Evans, Timothy Castagne and Wes Fofana all nearing full fitness – and none of the current top four left to play in the league – Leicester could benefit from the opposite sense of momentum that cost them in the past two seasons. Peter Lansley Match report: Leicester 2-1 Brentford “You would never see West Ham being a top-four side,” said David Moyes after his team’s attempt at Champions League qualification suffered probably a terminal blow in Sunday’s 3-1 loss against Spurs. “I am a bit annoyed that I am getting asked it, but also I’m quite pleased because it’s telling me we were seen as a side that was getting seen for top four. It should be put as – how well have West Ham done to stay in the race until the last part of season.” Defeatism or realism from Moyes? Surely it was the latter: he is correct that West Ham have been punching above their weight, and his attempt to manage expectation is entirely understandable. It was also predictable that there would be a hangover from Thursday’s memorable Europa League win against Sevilla. Happily for the Hammers, they would get the best of both worlds if they can win the Europa League, booking themselves a place in next season’s Champions League via a different route. Luke McLaughlin Match report: Tottenham 3-1 West Ham",Sport/Football,Premier League and FA Cup: 10 talking points from the weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/21/premier-league-and-fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend
3/21/2022,"Let’s start with Ange Capuozzo’s break, one step, two steps, a swerve, a curve, a burst, 10, 20, 30, 40m and more past one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine flailing Welsh defenders. You knew Capuozzo must be good just from the look of him when he came off the bench to make his debut against Scotland the previous week –a man that small and pretty must have something about him to get ahead in Test rugby – but it’s been startling to watch him this past fortnight, when he has scored two tries and set up one of the greatest, and most famous, in the history of the competition. Even in Cardiff, 400 miles away from the Stade de France and four hours before kick-off in the grand slam match, there was a French flavour to the championship. They know all about Capuozzo down in France’s second division. He qualified for Italy through his father but he was born, raised, and plays in Grenoble (for now; he is moving to Toulouse next season). In England, where the Premiership is ring‑fenced, that kind of promotion has become almost unthinkable, but in France it is not nearly so rare. Capuozzo is not the only player who has stepped up to Test rugby from the second division in recent years. France’s full-back, Melvyn Jaminet, was playing there last season, so was the man from whom he took over, Anthony Bouthier, the season before that. The scrum‑half Léo Coly, who won his France first call-up at the start of the tournament, still is. Which speaks to the strength in depth of French rugby, yes, and the open-mindedness of their coaches, but also to the way in which winning the 2023 World Cup has become a national project for the French, one that has pulled in every last one of France’s 1,900-odd clubs. It is as if the next great player could come from anywhere. On Saturday night Fabien Galthié even made a point of explicitly thanking them all for their support. He said: “We share this moment with all the French clubs, we are aware of the people who are behind us, and sharing this with them makes sense of what we do.” Right now, it feels as if France’s 23 have the weight of their nation behind them. It’s no wonder they were shoving England backwards in the scrums. There’s an irresistible momentum to French rugby, a sense that after 10 years of bickering, all the people involved in the sport – the federation, the amateur and professional clubs, the players, and the fans – are all pulling in the same direction. General De Gaulle said it was hard to govern a country that has more than 200 kinds of cheese, and the FFR president, Bernard Laporte, will tell you it’s almost as hard to manage a federation that has the best part of 2,000 amateur clubs, who all have a vote in how the game should be run. And that is before you factor in relations with the 30 professional sides in the National Rugby League, who run the Top 14, which is the most lucrative, and gruelling, league in the world. There have been times, such as the match at Twickenham in 2020 when France were forced to do without so many of their best Test players because of a row about their availability, when it has been close to impossible. For years, it felt like this jigsaw would never come together. But it has, piece by piece. It started with the Joueur Issus des Filières de Formation regulations, from 2016, just before Laporte was elected for his first term as president. They cut back the number of overseas players in the league by forcing the clubs to keep an average of at least 16 homegrown players in their squad across the season. After that, there were the negotiations over the financial compensation paid out to the clubs when they send their players for international duty. They worked out so well that, right now, France are able to name a training squad of 42 players, and hold on to 28 of them even when their clubs have matches in the fallow weeks. At the same time, there has been huge investment in their youth setup, which led to the back‑to‑back titles in the World Under-20 Championship, and their national programme, which is of course run by Laporte’s old friend Galthié. The two of them were coach and captain of the team that lost to England in the semi-finals of the 2003 World Cup and they still have each other’s backs now. When Laporte was fighting a re-election battle in 2020, Galthié said he would consider his position if he did not win the vote. In return Galthié has been given almost everything he has asked for, including what has grown into the strongest coaching unit in Test rugby. Incredible as it sounds, there was a time, not long ago, when France employed only two assistant coaches: one for the backs, one for the forwards. Now they have an army of them. Raphaël Ibañez handles the man-management and Shaun Edwards marshals the defence, Laurent Labit runs the attack, William Servat does the scrummaging and Karim Ghezal the lineouts, Vlok Cilliers oversees the kicking, the former referee Jérôme Garcès works on their discipline, and the renowned trainer Thibault Giroud does the strength and conditioning. Which means that this golden generation of young players are stepping into the best-run coaching setup in the sport. That combination put 40 points on the All Blacks in the autumn, don’t forget, and now they have won the grand slam, too, there is only one step left – the World Cup in 18 months’ time.",Sport/Sport,French rugby in perfect harmony 18 months before home World Cup | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/21/french-rugby-in-perfect-harmony-18-months-before-home-world-cup
3/21/2022,"According to Robert Pattinson, the most important accessory on the new batsuit was not the batarang, the bat lasso or the bat grapple, but a Velcro flap that allowed him to pee when needed. No such easy escape, though, for audiences of The Batman, who must display superhuman willpower and gird their loins for its 176-minute runtime. Given that it joins No Time to Die (163 minutes) and Avengers Endgame (181 minutes) in the ranks of recent blockbusters dicing with the bladder-busting three-hour limit, is it time we reinstated that staple of another era of maximalist cinema: the intermission? It feels like a relic of a more civilised epoch. But, with more franchises than ever happy to take their sweet time, the intermission would be a welcome opportunity to hit the WC, as well as loosen the legs and buttocks and avail ourselves of refreshments, while musing with fellow cinemagoers on the semantics of grunge in The Batman. Elongated runtimes have become so common that many franchises, such as Avengers, The Hobbit and It, started breaking up unified stories into multiple parts anyway – effectively enforcing months-long intermissions. So why not make it official and, once a film tops the 150-minute mark, give us all a break? However, the death of the intermission has actually been much exaggerated: it still survives in Iceland, Switzerland, Egypt, Turkey and, of course, India, where movies contain so many volcanic emotions that a break to let everyone cool off is practically a public health measure. They have made the occasional return in showcase screenings of latter-day Hollywood film, to enhance the old-timey mood – as with Peter Jackson’s King Kong (187 minutes) or Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight (187 minutes) – or simply out of mercy in the case of the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League (242 minutes). But essentially, at some point, some Hollywood analyst decided that a 10-minute hiatus was incompatible with the “pack ’em in, six shows a day” production line of the modern multiplex. Gandhi, in 1982, is often cited as the last major western film to feature an intermission. This would be fitting as this multi-Oscar-winner was a holdover – in a world leaning into the streamlined blockbuster machines ushered in by Spielberg, Lucas et al – from the old-style, sprawling epics that parted their productions midway as surely as Charlton Heston did the Red Sea. Originally, intermissions were a legacy of theatre and opera, though in early cinema they had a technical justification: giving the projectionist time to change the very big reels. But in the 1950s and 1960s they became part of the deluxe theatrical experience the studios laid on for widescreen epics such as The Ten Commandments, Lawrence of Arabia and the original West Side Story, in an effort to entice viewers back from the young pretender, TV. These behemoths were first wheeled out at “roadshow” screenings in major cities, often with the full trimmings: overtures, entr’actes and intermissions that allowed weary punters to hit the concession stalls and get a Coke to see them through another two hours of warring gangs, endless desert treks or Egyptian plagues. But 21st-century cinema now faces its own existential threat: streaming. No one’s going to pretend that bringing back intermissions would suddenly reverse the post-pandemic malaise of movie theatres in the face of Netflix, Disney+ and others. However, especially compared with the degraded home viewing experience, interrupted by social media every 30 seconds, they might help bolster the status of cinema-going as a prestige event. Over the last decade, it feels as if the movies have tried every gimmick – from 3D to Imax to immersive, Secret Cinema-type masquerades – to rejuvenate the night-out experience, but these all come at a premium. Intermissions could lend a sense of occasion and ceremony to today’s cold-eyed franchise lineup and subtly link back to a more genteel era of film-making. This would come at no extra cost – and indeed the extended pause would help boost the snack sales that already deliver the fattest profit margins. They might even help blockbusters lift their game. It’s a regular complaint of the CGI era that story – frequently retro-fitted around VFX sequences – takes second place. Under the yoke of those long runtimes, a kind of digital fatigue often sets in, where you’re suddenly unable to distinguish one muddy monster smackdown from another. If intermissions were a regular feature, it might force studios to think more about structure again – to carefully modulate the rhythm of their screenplay around the pause, and see what cliffhanger, or other dramatic effect, they could spirit up. Lawrence of Arabia, with Peter O’Toole and his Arab chums having the bit between their teeth, hits the intermission on a chastening note from Claude Rains: “He’s riding the whirlwind! Let’s hope that we’re not.” In Seven Samurai, some villagers are beginning to think they can beat the bandits without all this extra help, but Takashi Shimura takes them to task right before half-time: “This is the nature of war: by protecting others, you save yourself.” This is the intermission working smartly: as an introspective inflection point, a minor fall before the major lift. With the Snap, when Thanos seemingly irreversibly finger-clicks half the universe’s population out of existence, Marvel managed a true coup de théâtre to close Avengers: Infinity War – and what a marvellous intermission it would have made if Endgame had followed immediately. But that kind of poise feels like a rarity for their formulaic Lycra-fests. In truth, though, the return of the intermissions seems about as likely as Batman smoking a bong. But maybe, just hypothetically, we can float a gentlemen’s agreement with Hollywood: if you’re going to insist on stretching out comic-book juvenilia to Tolstoy proportions, how about doing the decent thing and letting us take our time too?",Arts/Film,Blockbuster or bladderburster?

3/21/2022,"When you have faulty goods or receive poor service, it can be really hard to get redress. Companies fob you off, you don’t know your rights or you get sent from pillar to post. Follow these tips to get what you deserve. Always put your complaint in writing. Email is easiest but you can also send it by post. The risk of being pushed from pillar to post is reduced, and you won’t have to repeat yourself if you need to contact the company again because it will have the details on record. You can keep rewriting before clicking the send button on an email so the risk of losing your temper is reduced and you can make sure you haven’t forgotten anything. Most importantly, though, you have a record of what has been said and when it was said. You may need to take the matter further, for instance, by going to an alternative dispute resolution provider (usually an ombudsman) or making a claim through the small claims court. Phone calls will not give you the evidence you will need if you pursue these avenues. If the company has made it difficult for you to contact it, get the email address of the chief executive; you can do this for free at ceoemail.com. The chief executive may not respond personally (although some do) but your message should escalate the matter and get your complaint noticed and dealt with. Before you raise a complaint, check that you are being objective and that there are grounds for a formal complaint. Complaining about a sales assistant’s clothing would be subjective and inappropriate. But if the assistant threw down and damaged the item you were collecting, complaining about that would be reasonable. However frustrated you may feel, ranting to customer services will not help. You are far more likely to succeed by remaining polite and non-threatening. You do not need to be able to quote lots of legalese but demonstrating that you know your rights means you are less likely to be fobbed off. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, you are entitled to goods that are free from defects, of satisfactory quality, match the description and last a reasonable length of time. When you are paying for services, they must be carried out with reasonable skill and care. If your item turns out to be in breach of any of the act within 30 days from purchase, you are entitled to a full refund. After this time you can receive a replacement or repair. Within the first 30 days you will need to prove the problem was there at the point of purchase. But in reality this is rarely questioned. You need a proof of purchase, which doesn’t have to be a receipt. A bank or loyalty card statement would also work as proof. If your purchase breaches any of the CRA requirements, then if you have to send back the item the trader is liable for the postage costs. Contrary to popular belief, you are not entitled to a full refund because you changed your mind. However, the law is different for purchases bought online. Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, you have a 14-day cooling-off period from when you receive them. Your contract is always with the company to which you paid the money. So, if your parcel is late or lost, do not contact the courier to complain; contact the retailer instead. For late items, you are entitled to a refund of any extra costs you paid as a result of the lateness. If the courier damages anything, including your property, it is still the retailer who is responsible for putting the matter right, so address your complaints to it. Give the company a timescale by which it has to respond. With an email, five working days is fine as there is no need to factor in time for your complaint to arrive. For letters, you may need to give a little longer. It may be that the company needs longer to investigate. However, it should get back to you before the deadline to tell you when you can expect to hear from it again. A good sentence to end your email with is: “Should I not receive a satisfactory response I will not hesitate in taking the matter further. This will include but not be limited to …” This could be sharing your experience on social media and various forums or engaging with an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider or the small claims court. As soon as any deadline has passed, if you have not had a response send a follow-up email outlining further action you will be taking. Companies often say that the most difficult thing about dealing with complaints is not knowing what the customer wants them to do to put things right. Make it easy for people to understand what you want and how to give it to you by stating what it is in your letter. Is it a full refund? A repair? An apology? An explanation for poor service? Whatever it is, be clear in your request. Thinking about this will also help you to decide whether you are satisfied with any remedy you are offered. If you do not receive a satisfactory response you have a couple of choices. If the company you are complaining to is a member of an ADR scheme, you can take your complaint to the relevant provider. Some schemes are mandatory for certain sectors such as telecoms (Communication Ombudsman or CISAS, the Communication & Internet Services Adjudication Scheme), energy (Energy Ombudsman) and finance (Financial Ombudsman Service). Non-statutory schemes (so traders do not have to join) include the Motor Ombudsman, whose members include vehicle manufacturers, warranty product providers, franchised dealers, independent garages, networks and bodyshops. The Dispute Resolution Ombudsman runs the Furniture & Home Improvement Ombudsman and the Rail Ombudsman. All the schemes are listed on the website of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. You can take your issue to the relevant body eight weeks after you first complained or once you have received a deadlock letter from the company. The company is bound by its decision, whereas you are not. If the company is not a member of an ADR scheme or you don’t like the decision, then the small claims court is an option. To show the company you are serious in your intention, send a “letter/email before action” outlining that you intend to take it to court. List the costs, including the court fees. Go to the small claims court websites for England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, fill out everything, right up to payment, take a screenshot and attach it to an email to the chief executive.",Lifestyle/Money,How to complain effectively – and get results,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/21/how-complain-effectively-get-results-clear-informed-reasonable
