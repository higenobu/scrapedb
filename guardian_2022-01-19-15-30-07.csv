Fran Kranz’s intense film is an ostensibly simple drama, theatrical in its single-setting, real-time setup, but shot in intimate closeup and red raw emotionally. Martha Plimpton and Jason Isaacs, as the victim’s mum and dad, and Ann Dowd and Reed Birney, playing the killer’s parents, give devastating performances.

1/19/2022,"A set of ancient gold and silver tubes dating to about 5,500 years ago and unearthed in North Caucasus in Russia could be the world’s oldest surviving drinking straws, experts have claimed. The eight thin-walled tubes, each more than a metre in length with a narrow perforated tip, were found in the largest of three compartments containing human remains, discovered during the excavation of a mound near Maykop in the summer of 1897.  The tubes, now in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, date to the fourth millennium BC, and were made of segments joined together. Four of the tubes also feature gold or silver bull figurines that have been slid on to them. Experts have previously suggested the tubes may have been used to support a canopy used in the funeral procession, or that they were sceptres. A team of experts in Russia, however, said they were likely to be straws for drinking beer from a shared pot. “If correct, these objects represent the earliest material evidence of drinking through long tubes – a practice that became common during feasts in the third and second millennia BC in the ancient near east,” the researchers wrote. Writing in the journal Antiquity, the team suggest the items are drinking straws “designed for sipping a type of beverage that required filtration during consumption”. The researchers say their theory is backed by evidence including depictions on seals from Iran and Iraq dating to the fifth to fourth millennium BC of people using straws to drink, while in the third millennium BC “banquet scenes showing groups of people sipping beer through long tubes from a shared vessel became popular in Mesopotamian art”. The authors add that a reed stem, wrapped in gold foil, as well as two metal drinking tubes, were previously found in the grave of the woman known as Queen Puabi in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, dating to about 4,500 years ago. The tubes’ perforated tip is consistent with detachable metal straw tip-strainers used on the ends of reed straws in the Levant and Mesopotamia in the second millennium BC. “The set of eight drinking tubes in the Maykop tomb may therefore represent the feasting equipment for eight individuals, who could have sat to drink beer from the single, large jar found in the tomb,” the authors wrote. The team said they found evidence of barley starch in the tip of one of the tubes, although the finding is not conclusive proof of the presence of a drink such as beer. “The position of the tubes alongside the body emphasises both the importance of the feast in the funerary rite and the high social rank for someone who throws a banquet,” said Viktor Trifonov, first author of the research from the Russian Academy of Sciences. Prof Augusta McMahon of the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said the work was very convincing, adding that the proposed purpose was fancy but functional. “Beer in the past was probably ‘chunky’ with sediment, and filter straws were a necessary implement,” she said, adding they were well known in Mesopotamia during the third to second millennia BC. “These drinking straws reveal the importance of past communal eating and drinking as a powerful creator of social connections, as feasts and parties are today,” she said.",News/World news,Ancient metal tubes unearthed in 1897 could be oldest surviving drinking straws,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/ancient-metal-tubes-unearthed-in-1897-could-be-oldest-surviving-drinking-straws
1/19/2022,"The part of communal work-life I miss most is gallows humour. This can only be forged in really crap jobs, and they don’t come much worse than call-centre work. I’ve done a fair bit, cold-calling for rubbish products, financial services and charities. Call centres are offices, but also open prisons. Managers keep track of the number and length of your toilet breaks. They count how many calls you attempt each minute, so you can’t slack off. When some poor sap does pick up, they sometimes listen in. You would only know this after you got taken to one side and asked why you hadn’t attempted to flog the cash-strapped pensioner some side plates. Your continued employment was always at stake. We all suffered the same dilemma. On the one hand, crippling financial need; on the other, our souls. Yet an atmosphere of Stasi-like distrust can really juice one’s rebellious instincts. These call centres were frequently staffed by actors (one of whom is now Hollywood royalty, starring in Marvel films for presumably more than £10 an hour). We were young, had the gift of the gab and could work off-script, which made sales conversations less robotic, and often more lucrative. If skiving was off the table, there were other plays.  Seeing a potential customer with an amusing name pop up on your computer screen was a highlight. “GOOD MORNING, MR BELLY!” you would trill, a decibel notch above normal. This let people around you know that high jinks were afoot, without alerting managers who were patrolling the floor. “It’s pronounced Bee-lay,” the mark would sigh. Then the game was finding the most ludicrous way into the conversation you could get away with. “Would you describe your days as donkey-less?” I once deadpanned, on a charity job. “That is, would you care to adopt an ass?” The trick was to quickly segue into drier, scripted information, so they wouldn’t catch on, and bosses couldn’t accuse you of not doing the job. We received a lot of abuse on these calls, even when we went by the book. If someone was really wringing you out, the thing to do was grow maddeningly polite, pouring oil on their fire. While murmuring in an understanding manner, we would be pantomiming larger, more truthful reactions for the benefit of friends sitting opposite. Sometimes we would change accents halfway through a call to throw off someone who was screaming. That was high-risk, though. Better to opt for our chief modus operandi: creative mispronunciation and intentional thickness. “Is this … the School for Sacred Courgettes?” you might ask, if you were trying to get in touch with say, Scolaire du Sacré-Coeur de Jette. (Not a real example – I’m just showing you how it worked.) I feel bad about it now, of course. These were essentially prank phone calls, as beneath us as the work itself. Yet as our only recourse, they restored to the job a perverse dignity and vitality. I don’t know how it works if you are not in an office – without pals to vent to, to make you laugh, do the frustrations of a working day simply accumulate? Surely it’s less fun if your work husband is your actual husband? I’ve been working from home for 10 years; I’m familiar with its boredoms. I almost look forward to receiving cold calls – though these days it’s usually a robot. Cowards. If it is a person, I make sure I never lose my temper. I’ve been where they are. Besides, “Mr Salamander” sounds pretty cool.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Memories of office life: at the call centre, every customer interaction became a prank",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/19/memories-of-office-life-at-the-call-centre-every-customer-interaction-became-a-prank
1/19/2022,"When Joe Biden finished delivering a televised update on the administration’s coronavirus response last week, aides began to usher the press towards the exit as reporters shouted questions. Biden declined to answer. “Folks, we’ll talk about that later,” he said. Then came a question from NBC’S Kelly O’Donnell he couldn’t ignore: “Maybe a press conference soon, Mr President? We would look forward to that.”  “Me too,” he replied. The next day, the White House announced that Biden would hold the 10th press conference of his presidency, far fewer than any of his recent predecessors during their first year in office. It was scheduled for Wednesday, on the eve of his first anniversary as president. When Biden steps up to the lectern, he does so facing myriad challenges and setbacks – and a press corps eager to ask him about all of it. His domestic agenda is stalled in the Senate, where his push on voting rights legislation has also hit a wall; inflation is the highest it has been in nearly four decades; and the supreme court rejected the administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate, a key part of his plan to combat the pandemic, now in its third year. The goodwill Biden enjoyed early in his presidency has mostly dried up, as his approval rating has fallen to 42% from 53% when he took office, according to FiveThirtyEight’s average of public polls. But it also comes amid the growing calls from journalists and press freedom advocates for Biden to engage more directly with reporters. In a sharp shift from Donald Trump, Biden has said journalists are “indispensable to the functioning of democracy”, which the president has repeatedly warned is under threat at home and abroad. Yet press access to the president has been limited. Last week, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) released a report grading the president’s approach to the media at home as well as his administration’s support for press freedom globally during his first year in office. Titled Night and Day, the report praised the Biden White House for an “almost complete reversal of the Trump administration’s unprecedentedly pervasive and damaging hostility”, which it said “seriously damaged the news media’s credibility and often spread misinformation around the world”. Yet the report criticized the president for his limited availability to journalists. As he ends his first year, Biden has held fewer press conferences and participated in fewer interviews than nearly all of his recent predecessors. Biden has held just nine formal news conferences during his first year, according to research compiled by Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. Trump had held 22 and Barack Obama 27 at the same point in their presidencies. Only Ronald Reagan, whose public appearances were scaled back following an assassination attempt in March 1981, held fewer press conferences during his first year. But Reagan did 59 interviews that year, compared with Biden, who has only done 22. Trump, who labeled the media the “enemy of the American people” and once praised a congressman who assaulted a reporter, did 92 interviews during his first year. Many of those interviews were with friendly outlets, but they also included the major networks and media organizations he frequently impugned, such as the New York Times and ABC News. Biden does field questions more frequently than his predecessors, but takes fewer of them, according to Kumar’s tally. These impromptu exchanges with reporters often follow scheduled remarks or public appearances. “For the president, it is a question of how do you use your time?” Kumar said. “And for Biden, he has wanted to use his time negotiating privately on his policies.” She expects Wednesday’s press conference to mark the beginning of a more public phase for the White House, as it tries to build support for Biden’s agenda before next year’s midterms. Asked about Biden’s relative lack of one-on-one interviews and formal news conferences, White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, pushed back, arguing that the president interacted with the press frequently and questions from reporters multiple times per week. “I think the American people have seen him out there, answering questions,” she said. “He will continue to be. That’s an important part of his engagement with the press and the public.” Due to the brief nature of his interactions, and his tendency to make mistakes when speaking extemporaneously, Kumar said Biden relies heavily on his cabinet and his team to communicate the White House’s agenda. “Biden doesn’t feel the need to talk all the time,” she said. “From his viewpoint, it’s not just the president but the whole administration and Biden is willing to let them speak in his stead.” It is a stark contrast to the Trump years, when the president regularly contradicted his team and press briefings were irregular, hostile and rife with falsehoods. One of Trump’s press secretaries, Stephanie Grisham, refused to hold any briefings at all. “We got used to the Trump way of communicating,” she added, “but Biden is very different.” After four years of attacks on the press by the former president and his team, Biden saw resetting relations with the media as a “big priority”, Psaki said. “Our objective is to – has been to – re-instill normalcy and engagement with reporters, whether we agree or disagree, whether there is a partisan tilt to an outlet or not,” she said. “And I think we have conducted ourselves accordingly.” Press briefings and fleeting exchanges with the press are not stand-ins for hearing directly and at length from the president, said Leonard Downie Jr, author of the CPJ report and a former executive editor of the Washington Post. “It is still the only opportunity for large numbers of the press who cover Washington and cover the administration, who are knowledgable about what they’re doing, to be able to ask questions and follow-up questions in depth,” Downie told reporters. Downie acknowledged the drawbacks of a press conference: the potential for political theater, grandstanding by reporters and filibustering by the president. Yet he said events present a “valuable” opportunity for Americans to hear directly from the president – and for the world to see a leader field tough question from a free and independent press. The CPJ report credited the Biden administration for taking steps to protect press freedoms, but cautioned that more work was needed. Biden restored the editorial independence of the United States Agency for Global Media, home of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, deeply undermined by the Trump administration. Hours after his inauguration, Biden dismissed the agency’s Trump-appointed chief executive. In July, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, issued a memo banning federal prosecutors from using subpoenas, warrants or court orders to obtain reporters’ telephone and email records in leak investigations, placing sharp new limits on a practice used by both the Trump and Obama administrations. And a spokesman for the Department of Justice told Downie that its investigations into the local police departments in Minneapolis, Louisville and Phoenix would include law enforcement’s treatment of journalists covering Black Lives Matter protests. Yet despite Biden’s pledge to lead the most transparent administration in the nation’s history, journalists and experts interviewed for the CPJ report said there had been “little improvement” in the responsiveness of government agencies to journalists’ requests for information and that “too many briefings and conversations” with administration officials are conducted on “deep background” and unattributable. Press freedom advocates told the CPJ that the White House’s actions have “fallen short” of its lofty rhetoric. In the report, they faulted the administration for failing to extract Afghan journalists during the chaotic US military withdrawal, as well as for failing to hold the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, accountable for the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. It also raised concerns among press freedom advocates with the Department of Justice’s 2019 decision to extradite the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange under the espionage act, which they warn could set a “dangerous precedent for use against journalists trying to do their jobs”. “We as press freedom advocates and journalists need the United States to stand up and affirm … the first amendment values freedom of the press,” said Robert Mahoney, CPJ’s deputy executive director. “It cannot do that credibly on the international stage if press freedom is not fully respected at home in the United States.”",News/US news,Biden pledged media reset after Trump – so why so few press conferences?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/19/joe-biden-media-reporters-press-conference
1/19/2022,"There are caves where ethereal golden-green lights glow on the ground like emeralds. These light displays are from a luminous moss called Schistostega pennata, known as goblin’s gold, a name that conjures up legends of cave-dwelling creatures. But in daylight, the magical green glow vanishes. The moss is superbly adapted to life in the dark. When its spores germinate they grow filaments that fan out, scavenging for any faint light they can find. Cells on the surface of the moss are covered with tiny lenses that focus any dim light deep down into the bottom of the cells where chloroplasts move around to harvest any pinpricks of light.  The fluorescent green glow of the moss comes from the chloroplasts as they absorb most of the light but reflect green light, while some of the light focused inside the cell is also reflected out. The moss can grow into huge colonies in the dark and cover cave floors in a luminous green light. And by growing in dark places, it gains a huge advantage by avoiding competition with other plants that cannot survive in such dingy light.",News/Science,Plantwatch: goblin’s gold luminous moss continues to captivate,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/19/plantwatch-goblins-gold-luminous-moss-schistostega-pennata-caves-glowing-green-light
1/19/2022,"More than 1,200 students in Oakland, California, have signed a petition saying they would stay home this week unless school administrators provide additional Covid protections, including more N95 masks, weekly testing and better social distancing – or a shift to virtual learning. On Tuesday, three district campuses were closed because students and teachers, in solidarity, stayed home.  At a news conference today, the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) spokesperson John Sasaki said that attendance numbers would not be available until tomorrow, but the district was expecting more than a thousand students to stay home. The district said it was providing free tests and masks and had implemented other safety protocols including air purifiers, but students and teachers have alleged inequities in the distribution of resources between schools in more and less wealthy neighborhoods. The protest comes as schools across the country have struggled with the latest, Omicron-fueled wave of the coronavirus pandemic. In recent weeks, students in New York City, New Jersey, Chicago, Washington DC and elsewhere have launched protests and petitions as well, demanding improved safety measures. Districts, meanwhile, have faced immense pressures from parents and politicians to keep school campuses open as the US enters its third year of the pandemic. Students and teachers around the US have complained of inconsistency in schools’ coronavirus policies and a chaotic return from winter break. Last week, students from several New York City schools walked out, demanding virtual learning options, and a video of hundreds of masked, Brooklyn Technical High students filing out of class went viral. “I think the number one emotion I feel is just frustrated,” Favour Akingbemi, 17, a senior at Washington Preparatory high school in South LA, told the Guardian earlier this month. Nearly three of Akingbemi’s four high school years have been defined by Covid-19. “It’s upsetting that we’re still stuck in this pandemic,” she said. As students stage walkouts over a lack of high-quality masks and coronavirus tests, the Biden administration today announced that it had distributed that last of its $122bn Covid-19 relief funding for schools from the American Rescue Plan. “I am proud that, with the approval of these plans, states have 100% of their funds and robust plans to help schools remain open and help students thrive,” said the education secretary, Miguel Cardona. Cardona also echoed calls from Joe Biden to keep public schools open. “We know what it takes to keep our schools open safely for in-person learning, and these funds will help us achieve that goal,” he said. But students in Oakland and around the country are alleging that resources have not been distributed equitably. Moreover, in the face of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant, students and teachers who are immunocompromised or live with elderly or immunocompromised family members say that they still feel unsafe attending class in person. “Teaching is already a stressful job. Doing so when I’m fearing for my life and for students’ lives and the lives of their families is just on a different level,” Joanne Yi, a teacher at Augustus Hawkins in South Los Angeles, told the Guardian this month. Safety concerns and mandated quarantines for exposed students are among the reasons the Los Angeles Unified School District recorded 130,000 student absences last week with only a 66.8% attendance rate.",News/US news,"More than 1,200 Oakland students pledge to stay home unless schools improve Covid safety",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/18/school-strikes-covid-safety-omicron-oakland
1/19/2022,"A landmark study has described the way primary school pupils are taught to read in England as “uninformed and failing children”, calling on the government to drop its narrow focus on phonics. Researchers at UCL’s Institute of Education say the current emphasis on synthetic phonics, which teaches children to read by helping them to identify and pronounce sounds which they blend together to make words, is “not underpinned by the latest evidence”.  They claim analysis of multiple systematic reviews, experimental trials and data from international assessment tests such as Pisa suggests that teaching reading in England may have been less successful since the adoption of the synthetic phonics approach rather than more. The UCL researchers are among 250 signatories to a letter which has been sent to education secretary Nadhim Zahawi, calling on the government to allow for a wider range of approaches to teaching reading, which would allow teachers to use their own judgment about which is best for their pupils. The use of synthetic or blended phonics to teach reading in schools in England has been the subject of ferocious debate since it was backed by former education minister Michael Gove, who introduced a phonics screening check for all children in year one (aged five or six) to check pupil progress. In synthetic phonics, children begin by pronouncing individual sounds in words and are then encouraged to blend them together to make words. For example “s-t-r-ee-t”. Supporters say it has had a positive impact on literacy, and point to significant long-term benefits for disadvantaged pupils. Critics say phonics training only helps children to do well in phonics tests – they learn how to pronounce words presented to them in a list rather than understand what they read – and does nothing to encourage a love of reading. England’s Pisa reading scores are virtually unchanged since 2006. The report outlines three key approaches to the teaching of reading. As well as the government’s preferred approach using systematic synthetic phonics, there is a whole-language approach, where the focus is on real texts, the emphasis is on reading for meaning and any phonics teaching is non-systematic. The third approach is “balanced instruction” which balances the different approaches. Prof Dominic Wyse, co-author of the UCL study, said: “Teaching children to read and to make sense of texts is crucial to improving their life chances and is one of the most important tasks of primary schools and early-years settings. “Although there are some strengths to England’s current approach to teaching reading, our new research shows that the government’s policy is uninformed because it is not underpinned by the latest robust evidence.” Wyse went on: “For the first time in more than 100 years we see that a balanced-instruction approach to the teaching of reading is no longer the norm in England. The majority of teachers are now reporting the more frequent use of the narrower synthetic phonics approach. “Our view is that the system doesn’t give teachers enough flexibility to do what they think is best for their pupils, nor to encourage pupils to enjoy reading.” Co-author Prof Alice Bradbury said research had showed that teachers feel pressured by the compulsory screening check. Results from a survey of 2,200 teachers found synthetic phonics was their main focus for teaching reading. All but one of the 936 comments from the survey were negative about the screening test, while one teacher described having to “live and breathe phonics” and another appealed for “reflection on the mass of skills involved in reading rather than solely focusing on phonics”. “Policy changes have led to changes in teaching, including more time being spent on phonics, the separation of phonics from other literacy activities, and a reliance on a small number of phonics schemes,” said Bradbury. “This is an important shift in how children are taught to read, a shift which is not underpinned by the research evidence.” Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the phonics check should be abolished. “When it comes to detailed questions of teaching children to read, ministers should accept that government does not know best. It would be more responsible for them to trust research evidence rather than to follow their own prejudices and instincts.” A Department for Education spokesperson said systematic phonics teaching had been proven the world over to be the most effective method of teaching children to read. “Since the introduction of the phonics screening check in 2012, the percentage of Year 1 pupils meeting the expected standard in reading has risen from 58% to 82%, with 92% of children achieving this standard by Year 2.”",News/Education,"Focus on phonics to teach reading is ‘failing children’, says landmark study",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/19/focus-on-phonics-to-teach-reading-is-failing-children-says-landmark-study
1/19/2022,"Al Jazeera, the Qatar-funded media organization, has reportedly stopped creating content for its new conservative digital project in the US, Rightly. Four sources confirmed the news to Axios, which was the first to report it on Tuesday. In December, the company ended its show on the platform, which was being overseen by its editor-in-chief, Scott Norvell, a Fox News veteran.  Al Jazeera launched Rightly last year to “provide fresh voices that are too often left out of the mainstream media a space to engage and debate the issues that matter most to them”, according to a statement released at the time. The surprise decision to launch such a project was met with objections from numerous Al Jazeera staff members, with many saying that its launch would “irreparably tarnish the network’s brand and work”. In an open letter to Al Jazeera management, staff members, including executive producers, presenters and correspondents wrote: “Media in the US is already polarised and the introduction of Rightly is not a solution but rather a deepening of the problem. “Those of us who work in the United States already face tremendous challenges, and our jobs will only be made more difficult now that we will be associated with promoting a political ideology,” the letter added. “This isn’t about politics, left or right, or diversity of perspectives … This is about journalism and continuing the network’s moral mission of uplifting marginalized voices, communities and stories. Rightly is a betrayal of that mission.” Last fall, the Department of Justice ordered AJ+, a US-based digital news network owned by Al Jazeera, to register as a foreign agent. In a letter sent to Al Jazeera, the DOJ said that the network, which produces short videos for social media, engaged in “political activities” on behalf of the Qatari government and thus needed to be subject to the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Al Jazeera said AJ+ was independent and should not need to register. Axios reported that Rightly staff members who worked on the show were given little warning that it would wind down. One staff member who worked on the show said it was explained as “a budgetary decision”. Brad Polumbo, a policy correspondent at the Foundation for Economic Education, who worked on Rightly, confirmed to Axios that it had closed. “I had a great experience there,” he said, adding: “It’s disappointing that it was cut short but we’ll still have that work we did as part of our portfolio and to be proud of going forward.” Michael Weaver, Al Jazeera’s senior vice-president of business and development and growth, said that the company was still evaluating the Rightly brand. “We’re constantly evaluating everything we put on the air,” he said, without specifying what products might be produced in the future from the brand.",News/Media,"Al Jazeera winds down Rightly, its conservative US media project – report",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/19/al-jazeera-rightly-conservative-media
1/19/2022,"How could they be so careless? How do fishing vessels lose so many of their nets and longlines that this “ghost gear”, drifting through the oceans, now presents a mortal threat to whales, dolphins, turtles and much of the rest of the life of the sea? After all, fishing gear is expensive. It is either firmly attached to the vessel or, using modern technologies, easily located. I’ve asked myself these questions for a while, and I think I now have an answer. It comes from an unlikely source: a trawlerman working in Scotland. I’m not a fan of trawling, but I recognise that some operations are more damaging than others. He and his colleagues now appear to be pulling in more nets than fish. On trip after trip they catch vast hauls of ghost gillnets and longlines, often wrapped around marine animals. He has sent me his photos, which are so disturbing I can scarcely bear to look: drowned seabirds, decapitated seals and fish and crustaceans of many species, which died a long, slow death. Where are these nets and lines coming from? He believes they’re being deliberately discarded.I have checked his identity, but he wants to remain anonymous. Like other local trawlers, his boat brings its waste to land. The problem, he says, lies with large vessels, many from France and Spain, that spend four to six weeks at a time at sea. They don’t have enough storage space for the rubbish they generate: most of the hold is dedicated to frozen fish. Worn-out gillnets and longlines should be returned to port for disposal. But those he retrieves have a revealing characteristic: the expensive parts, those that can be reused – floats, weights and hooks – have been cut off. This, he believes, is a giveaway: if you find a net or line like that, it has been deliberately thrown overboard.  He and his colleagues, he says, often watch French and Spanish boats landing plenty of fish in Scottish ports when “no rubbish is taken ashore by these vessels”. He estimates that a typical crew of 20 on a month-long fishing voyage would generate roughly 20 cubic metres of waste, aside from the fishing gear. Where is it? There might be a clue in some of the other rubbish his boat trawls up: bin bags full of French and Spanish food wrappers. As for the gear, he tells me that he sees boats come into port and “miles and miles of new gillnetting is put onboard – but none is taken ashore for discard”. The nets these boats use are enormous: every large vessel deploys between 50 and 70 miles of them. But gillnets tend to wear out quickly. The fisherman tells me, “the vessel I work on takes ashore approximately one cubic metre of discarded gillnets every four to five days on average.” That’s a lot of net. Gillnets have been banned from many waters because of their very high rates of bycatch, and their mysterious tendency to go missing. In Scotland, they are prohibited within six miles of the coast. But these boats work farther from the shore. Beyond 12 miles, my contact says, it’s “basically bandit territory for any vessel not UK-registered, as UK law does not apply”. He alleges that, while local boats are closely regulated, there is practically no monitoring of foreign, offshore vessels. Competition between national fishing fleets is an explosive issue, further charged by Brexit. At first I was wary of these claims, as I know how bitter the rivalry has become. But the photographic evidence speaks for itself, and his testimony is compelling. Moreover, it’s clear that there is a new mood among many of the local boats, which are now desperate to save their fisheries. Most of them are involved in the Fishing for Litter scheme, landing the discarded gear and other rubbish they catch. But this is likely to be a small fraction of the equipment being dumped. Unless active gillnetting and ghost fishing by discarded nets are stopped, my contact believes, the entire marine ecosystem is likely to collapse. He and other fishers “have written to the authorities until we are blue in the face”, but he says he has been repeatedly stonewalled. It’s a sign of desperation that he has come to me, a longstanding critic of his industry. When I approached the Scottish government, it told me: “We take protection of the marine environment seriously and are clear that any form of dumping and other illegal activities is completely unacceptable … We would encourage anyone with intelligence relating to suspicious activities by vessels to report this to us on our website.” But, as the Scottish government’s own report points out, “no data or studies” have been produced showing where the discarded gear is coming from. This is despite the fact that, in the north Highlands, commercial fishing gear accounts for 90% of the ocean plastic picked up by beach cleaners, and that entanglement in static fishing equipment is a major cause of death for minke and humpback whales in Scotland. There’s a reliable principle of public administration: if a government takes a genuine interest in an issue, it commissions researchers to study it. No data tends to mean no interest. There are similar issues all over the world. Gillnetting and the ghost fishing it causes have reduced the population of vaquita – the world’s smallest member of the whale and dolphin family, which lives in Mexico’s Sea of Cortez – to fewer than 20. Last week a young humpback whale was spotted in Antarctic waters, its dorsal fin severed, with nets cutting through the skin around its tail. As global seafood consumption has doubled in 50 years, the issue has become ever more urgent. Yet most governments propose to do nothing except “encourage” fishers and gear manufacturers to behave responsibly, without sanctions or incentives. No vessel should be allowed to leave port unless it has enough space to store all its rubbish. Mandatory deposit return schemes would ensure that fishers returned used gear to the manufacturers at the end of its life. All nets should be traceable to the boats that use them. While some equipment is bound to be lost accidentally, it’s not hard to spot patterns of deliberate disposal. But, like the fictional US president in the movie Don’t Look Up, the world’s governments, faced with ecological collapse, have again decided to “sit tight and assess”.

1/19/2022,"‘My initial reaction,” says Greg Arundell, with a laugh, “was no.” The actor had been playing Jacob Marley, the deceased partner of Ebenezer Scrooge, in a production of A Christmas Carol at Beaulieu Abbey. Then several of the cast, including Scrooge himself, came down with Covid. Director Abbey Wright pulled Arundell aside and asked him to step up and play the great festive miser.  In preparation for anything going wrong, the entire cast already had roles they were ready to cover. But Scrooge was not one of Arundell’s. “I hadn’t learned it!” he says. “It wasn’t on my understudy plan.” However, persuaded to try out some scenes, he realised he didn’t need to look at the script very much. “Because I’d watched the show so many times, it had made its way into my brain.” He agreed to give it a go. So how was it? “I don’t really remember the first two shows,” he says. “They were an absolute blur.” They must have gone well, though: he played Scrooge for the rest of the run. “I don’t want to make a habit of it,” he says. “But it made me more confident, knowing I have the ability to do something like that.” As Omicron raged over Christmas, dozens of shows were cancelled. Were it not for intrepid actors like Arundell, far more would have had to shut down. “Understudies and covers are the people in the background,” he says. “Until they’re called upon, you don’t think about them. But they are the backbone of a show.” Some shows have covers or “swings” – performers offstage who can cover a wide range of parts in the ensemble, as opposed to understudies, who are part of the ensemble and can step up to play leads or supporting roles. After Christmas, when every one of the leads in the West End jukebox musical The Drifters Girl came down with coronavirus at the same time, the show was saved by covers. “It was amazing,” says Ethan Davis, who was able to make his West End debut as singer Johnny Moore in The Drifters Girl. “I’m an offstage cover,” he says. “So I’ll be in the dressing room during each show, just on standby. But I’ve now been on eight times in a week.” Without Davis and the other covers, The Drifters Girl could not have stayed open. “If you don’t have covers,” says Davis, “you don’t have a show.” Covers, he says, will generally find out whether they’re going to perform three to four hours before curtain-up. “But sometimes you might be halfway through a show and something happens on stage – they fall over, or their voice might not be feeling it. You’re sitting in your dressing room watching TV, and you hear over the Tannoy that you’re getting called on stage.” Isn’t that terrifying? “If it’s your first time,” he says, “you’re always on edge. But once you’ve done it a few times, it’s nothing too scary. You’re just doing your job.” For smaller productions and shorter runs, covers aren’t always an option. On Christmas Eve, Stacey Coleman had just finished her lead role in Jack and the Beanstalk at venues in Whitchurch and Ellesmere Port. “We were all in tears,” she says, “because it was just such a relief to have got through it.” After the show, which she had also directed, Coleman got a call asking if she could cover for Sleeping Beauty at the Northwich Memorial in Cheshire, since Covid had laid low some of the panto’s cast. Did that mean she spent Christmas Day learning Princess Aurora’s lines? “Yeah,” she laughs, “in between serving Christmas dinner to my family.” The part lasted until 29 December. Then, the next day, Coleman received another call, this time from Oldham’s Queen Elizabeth hall, which was having its own problems with Sleeping Beauty. Coleman had already stepped in there, playing Carabosse on a day off from Jack. Now they needed someone to play the comedy role of Wally. Other members of her Beanstalk cast had similar experiences, helping out with various productions by the same company, Anton Benson Productions. “We weren’t official understudies,” she says. “We hadn’t read the parts previously. Everyone who was lucky enough to be well just felt like, ‘It’s up to all of us to pull together.’ ” She kept saying yes because she knew how important it was to keep shows going. “I knew saying no would mean turning away hundreds of people, the show not opening. And [Christmas shows] are not like any other production, where you can reschedule in three weeks. Once Christmas is past, that’s it.” Putting on a good show with understudies, says Coleman, is all about team effort. “I couldn’t have gone on without feeling like everybody had our backs the whole time. It takes that to go on and cover. You can’t do it alone.” Justin-Lee Jones had a similar experience when he covered for the role of Sven – the all-singing, all-dancing reindeer in Frozen – on New Year’s Day in the West End. “You can only see the floor,” he says of the puppet contraption the actor wears to play the part. “You can’t look up, otherwise the reindeer’s head is going to stick up in the sky. There’s a lot of trust on stage between Sven and the other actors around you.” Jones is a swing: he covers for nine roles among the Frozen ensemble. “You get a text every day to say what the setup of the show is going to be,” he explains. “So, say a principal member is on holiday, a member of the ensemble would fill in for them, and then the swings have to cover all the gaps.” He knows the show inside out. Although he’s assumed a wide range of roles, New Year’s Day was his first as Sven. The part of the jolly reindeer is incredibly demanding, essentially requiring the actor to be in the muscle-shredding plank position for the entire time they’re on, with the longest scene lasting nine minutes. “You have stilts on your hands, like crutches,” Jones says. “Then you’ve got these extended feet which also have stilts, with an extension on your toes. As well as holding your own body weight, you’re also carrying the head, which weighs 10kg, then the rest of the body – and at times, a ukulele and an axe. It gets very hot in there, so there’s an air-con machine inside.” The role is generally shared between two performers, each doing four shows a week to relieve the intensity. When one was unable to perform, Jones got a text. “Because of the adrenaline of going on for the first time,” he says, it was OK. But in the next scene, after I’d calmed down, I was more aware of my body.” That’s when it started to hurt. “I was dripping with sweat, thinking, ‘It’s OK, it’s OK, this is for the kids!” He grins. “I do love the challenge. Only a certain person is going to be given Sven to cover.” Shows as big as Frozen can only happen because of the swings. “They have to learn so much so they can just slot in,” he says. “The audience shouldn’t notice anything different. The best compliment for an understudy is, ‘I didn’t notice you were on.’ ” Over the holidays, a clip of Hugh Jackman went viral. During the curtain call for The Music Man on Broadway, Jackman told the audience about his co-star for the evening. The leading role of Marian, usually performed by Sutton Foster, was instead covered by swing Kathy Voytko. Jackman applauded Voytko for stepping in with only a few hours’ notice – and Marian was only one of eight roles she was prepared for. To riotous applause, Jackman called swings and understudies “the bedrock of Broadway”. In the video, Jackman gets visibly emotional, telling the audience that it’s only their fourth preview. “Swings and understudies have not had a chance to learn,” he says. “They’ve watched from the corner of the room while we rehearse. Then five hours before a performance, they’re told, ‘You’re on.’ It humbles me. The courage, the brilliance, the dedication, the talent.” By celebrating these roles, Jones says, Jackman was speaking for a whole industry. “It felt like a nice highlight, showing what an unsung job it is. Most people have no idea that the reason they’ve been able to see a show is because someone else has learned this role and can do it at the drop of a hat.” He laughs. “My mum has three kids in this business – and even she doesn’t understand it properly.”",Arts/Stage,You’re on!

1/19/2022,"A former Guantánamo detainee is planning legal action against Priti Patel to try to restore his British passport, which was stripped from him eight years ago after two trips to Syria. Moazzam Begg’s application for a new passport was rejected in September 2021, even though a terror prosecution relating to his time in Syria collapsed in 2014, after which police said they accepted he was innocent.  Frustrated by the delays and complaining of a lack of explanation, Begg, who works with the Cage advocacy group which campaigns to help people caught up in the “war on terror”, said he felt he had little choice but to apply for a judicial review. “I’ve met with leaders of countries and government ministers; the police have said I’m innocent; but all of that seems to count for nothing. When I met with Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, when the Guantánamo cases were settled [in November 2010], he said he would like to turn over the page, but that doesn’t seem to be the case,” Begg said. He said that if he were able to travel he would like to visit his daughter in Turkey, whose marriage he had not been able to attend, and to return to Bagram in Afghanistan, where he was held for a year before being moved to Guantánamo. “I saw two people there being murdered by US soldiers. Now the US has left I would like to go back and try and reinvestigate what happened, to try and visit the camp and the cells,” he said. Begg was arrested in February 2002 in Pakistan, handed to US forces, and detained at Bagram before being moved to Guantánamo Bay. During his detention he was interrogated by British and US intelligence officers but released without charge in 2005. The trips to Syria took place in 2012 and 2013, a time when armed resistance to the regime of Bashar al-Assad was beginning from a range of groups, but before the public emergence of Islamic State in 2014. Before his second visit, Begg said he was contacted by MI5. “I told them: ‘I am trying to investigate your role in working with Assad regime in the programme of renditions.’” It was, he said, part of his campaigning activity. After the conversation, Begg said, he met an MI5 officer and a lawyer at an east London hotel in October 2012. He said Security Service representatives made it clear that he was free to travel to Syria, where he stayed in opposition territory near Aleppo until April 2013. Nevertheless, his passport was taken from him in December 2013, as he returned to the UK from a trip to South Africa. Shortly after he was arrested on terror offences. A year later the prosecution case collapsed, undermined by secret material handed to the CPS. “They know from the probe they put in my car that I was totally against people who would go on to join Isis,” he said. Begg applied again for a passport in 2019. One was briefly issued in September 2021 but revoked four weeks later. The email revoking his passport was dated 2017 and addressed to a woman accused of passport fraud. “I think it was a cut and paste job, they were in a rush,” he said. “They gave no explanation.” Last month Begg’s lawyers sent a letter to the Home Office and the Passport Office putting them on notice of legal action in an attempt to get the decision overturned. Having had no reply, his team plan to launch an application for judicial review within days, supported by a crowdfunding campaign. Begg said he believed the government’s actions showed it did not consider him a full citizen, despite the prosecution case against him collapsing in 2014. “This government hasn’t tried to take away my citizenship,” he said. “But a passport is a sign of your nationality, the most unique identity document somebody has.”",News/World news,Ex Guantánamo detainee plans legal action to restore British passport,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/ex-guantanamo-detainee-plans-legal-action-to-restore-british-passport
1/19/2022,"Meningitis B cases among students in England are rising sharply and exceeding pre-pandemic levels, according to a report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Meningococcal group B bacteria are a serious cause of life-threatening infections, including meningitis and sepsis. While most people recover, some can die. Others may suffer a permanent disability as a result, including brain damage, epilepsy, hearing loss, or the loss of limbs.  During the pandemic, lockdowns used to curb the spread of Covid-19 also led to a decline in other infectious diseases. Meningitis rates were at a historic low until September last year, experts say. Since then, however, there has been a stark increase in meningitis B cases among adolescents and young adults in England. The rise in cases has been found “particularly in university students”, according to an early pre-print study by the UKHSA seen by the Guardian. “Between September and November 2021, IMD [invasive meningococcal disease] cases increased with group B disease in adolescents/young adults rising sharply and exceeding pre-pandemic levels,” the 11-page analysis of the most recent data available says. During that period, 41.5% of meningitis cases occurred among those aged 15 to 19, compared with 11.8% and 14.3% during the same period in 2018 and 2019 respectively, it adds. Importantly, the UKHSA report says, the number of cases in this age group during this period in 2021 (22) was higher than the corresponding periods in 2018 (16) and 2019 (19). Of the IMD cases confirmed among the 15- to 19-year-old and 20- to 24-year-old age groups in September to November 2021, 84.6% (22/26) were students registered at a further or higher education institution, the study found. Almost all the cases involved meningitis B. Experts said the rise in cases confirmed the risks of a post-lockdown infectious disease “rebound”, something charities including the Meningitis Research Foundation last year said could happen. “This early evidence of a sharp rise in MenB cases in teenagers and young adults, exceeding pre-pandemic numbers for those aged 15 to 19, is important to highlight,” said Linda Glennie, director of research, evidence and policy at the Meningitis Research Foundation. “Whilst the numbers may appear small, meningitis can have life-changing implications for anyone who contracts it, which is why monitoring any evidence of a rebound in cases is so vital. “The data published by UKHSA has highlighted that students, particularly those living on campuses, have a higher risk of meningococcal disease than their peers. It is essential that students, young people and their families remain vigilant to the signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia. Meningitis progresses rapidly, so it’s critical to alert someone if ill, and to seek urgent medical advice.” The UKHSA paper suggests the rise in cases may be because of a combination of factors including high levels of transmission in young people, and an “immunity debt” sparked by the fact that lockdowns reduced the opportunities for meningococcal exposure and transmission among adolescents. “A lower level of immunity could be contributing to the sharp increase in IMD cases following the return to universities, however, serological study of this population would be needed to quantify any changes in immunity throughout the Covid-19 pandemic,” the report adds. Prof Ray Borrow, one of the paper’s authors and head of the vaccine evaluation unit at the UKHSA, said: “Whilst this is early data, it is crucial we continue to monitor all strains of invasive meningococcal disease given the impact social distancing and other Covid responses have had in limiting natural circulation, blocking both the benefits and harms of exposure to these bacteria, which can lead to a lack of immune stimulation within the population.”",News/Society,"Meningitis B cases rising sharply among students in England, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/19/meningitis-b-cases-rising-students-england-study
1/19/2022,"André Leon Talley, the influential fashion journalist and former editor-at-large of US Vogue under Anna Wintour, has died at the age of 73. TMZ reported that Talley had passed away on Tuesday at a New York hospital, of an unknown illness. His death was later confirmed by his literary agent, David Vigliano.  A larger-than-life character – and six foot seven inches tall – Talley was a pioneering figure in the fashion world, as known for his biting comments and flamboyant presence as the statement kaftans, hats and robes he frequently wore. In a career that spanned six decades, Talley used his position to champion diversity on the runway and behind the scenes in the fashion world. Designer and close friend Diane von Furstenberg was among those to pay tribute on Wednesday. “Goodbye darling André … no one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did,” she wrote. “No one was grander and more soulful than you were.” Playwright Jeremy O’Harris wrote: “For a little black gay boy who reached for the stars from the south there were few people I could look up to up there amongst the stars who looked like me just more fab except for you André. “For a generation of boys André Leon Talley was a beacon of grace and aspiration.” Born in 1948 and raised in North Carolina in the Jim Crow era, Talley was a lifelong advocate of fashion, recalling in his 2020 memoir The Chiffon Trenches how he would visit his local library to read copies of Vogue magazine, which came to embody a world in which “bad things never happened”. Speaking to the Guardian in 2020, Talley recalled students at his university stoning him as he crossed campus on Sundays to buy Vogue. His career in fashion began with an internship for former Vogue editor Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1974. Vreeland, impressed with his skills, introduced Talley to contacts at Andy Warhol’s Factory and Interview magazine, where he worked as a receptionist. He began writing for publications including W and the New York Times, but it was at US Vogue that he made his name, rising up the ranks to become the magazine’s news director, then creative director until 1995 when he left. He returned to the magazine three years later and remained the editor-at-large until 2013. Talley’s long working relationship with Vogue editor Anna Wintour would become the big selling point of his second memoir, The Chiffon Trenches, in which Talley took unsparing potshots at his former boss. Talley felt he had lost favour because “I had suddenly become too old, too overweight and too uncool”. Wintour, he wrote, was incapable of “simple human kindness” and “never really passionate about clothes. Power was her passion.” In the book he also detailed the sexual abuse he endured as a child, and the racism and sizeism he encountered throughout his life. He felt “at home” in the fashion world, he once told the Guardian, because “there were no victims, only high-octane egos”. In 2021 he was softer on Wintour, telling the Cut: “She’s the empress. She’s worked hard. She’s gone through many battles. She deserves everything they give her. At 72, to have that job, is very, very, very impressive. I wish her all the best.” Talley also served as a judge on America’s Next Top Model and, in 2008, became the Obama family’s fashion advisor. He interviewed Michelle Obama for Vogue when she stepped into the role of first lady in 2009, later calling her “the most fashionable woman in America”. But in 2020 he publicly criticised the Obamas for throwing a birthday party during the Covid pandemic, telling the New York Times: “I think the nouveaux riches Obamas are seriously tone-deaf … the Obamas are in Marie Antoinette, tacky, let-them-eat-cake mode. They need to remember their humble roots.” Talley never publicly defined his sexuality, calling himself “fluid”. He had never been in a relationship, he once said, something he attributed to being abused as a child. “I gave it all to my career,” he told the New York Times. “Diane von Furstenberg said, ‘He was afraid to fall in love,’ and I guess I was. I guess I was afraid, and I guess I was repressed. I grew up in a very strict household. But being in this world, moving around with all these incredible people … it was enough for me to have the friendship of Karl or the friendship of Yves Saint Laurent or the friendship of Azzedine Alaïa.” Talley wrote two memoirs and was the subject of the 2018 documentary The Gospel According to André. When asked if he would have been happier working outside of fashion, Talley said no. “My story is a fairytale of excess, and in every fairytale there is evil and darkness, but you overcome it with light,” he once told the Guardian. “I want every person I come across – the stranger on the street, the church member in the pew next to me – to feel love.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"André Leon Talley, influential fashion journalist, dies aged 73",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/19/andre-leon-talley-influential-fashion-journalist-dies-aged-73
1/19/2022,"On what was supposed to be the day after the Hobart Test, all was quiet. England had wrapped up an epochally anaemic Ashes defeat leaving enough spare days to squeeze in an embarrassing visit from police to the world’s meekest sunrise rager, telling off cricketers who had been drinking in their whites for longer than they had been required to play in them. The constabulary arrived to extinguish a cigar sparked by England staffer Graham Thorpe, who then decided to video the players present. It ended up at a newspaper within a day. As batting coach of a team that had just been bowled out for 147, 192, 185, 68, 188 and 124, among other embarrassments, you for one thing might be short cigar-worthy moments, and for another might be inclined to keep your head down.  But no. That’s not the way for England. Head coach Chris Silverwood will try to hang on, despite being made sole selector a year ago and getting every team wrong since. Director of cricket Ashley Giles, one of those complex administrative jobs that apparently former Test cricketers are uniquely qualified to occupy, will try to hang on. Chief executive Tom Harrison will try to hang on – like his Australian counterpart James Sutherland after the sandpaper scandal, spruiking that his regime is uniquely suited to fix the problems it has spent years ignoring or exacerbating. And Joe Root, fine man, fine player, uninspired captain, will stay on, because everybody else’s batting is worse than his leadership. With a day or two for the head to clear, it is hard to know what to make of the Ashes. The needs of marketing demand that it be presented as the great rivalry, the biggest of the big, the two oldest teams in one of the few five-Test series remaining on the calendar. The reality is most often likely to underwhelm. The wallpaper now is always 2005, the promise of heights that seem recent enough to still be relevant. Since then, 2019 has been the most entertaining, proving that teams don’t need to be stacked with great players. Flaws can be as absorbing – they just need to be evenly distributed. Which means that after a series like the one we’ve just seen, it is reasonable to ask what is the point of England visiting Australia. Across four of the last five tours, the scoreline for the home side is 18-0 from 20 starts. Even the outlier series that England won 10 years ago only reversed the primacy, with three thrashings by an innings. Even among that desert of competitiveness, this year’s effort somehow stands out. The two whitewashes completed in 2006 and 2014 were over quality teams: names like Pietersen, Cook, Trott, Bell, Strauss, Flintoff and Collingwood in the order. The scorelines were notable because they involved good players being overcome, in one instance by Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, in another by Mitchell Johnson’s fiercest hour. The class of 2022 did not have to be menaced out, or bounced out, or bewitched by spin. Their tailenders finished the tour as their top order had started it, giving away their stumps to all comers, part of a parade lacking all technique or temperament. Australia’s struggles in England, both with and against the swinging ball, have been as stark at times. Trent Bridge in 2015 is the nadir, but even 2019 would have been a thrashing had Steve Smith been any other player. In Australia’s favour for the next round in 2023 is that plenty of Australians have been playing county cricket in recent seasons and will carry on doing so. There is debate about whether the championship can produce England Test players, but it’s very useful for polishing up Australian ones. There has been recent talk about whether a reciprocal arrangement could see English players in the Sheffield Shield, but that is a much harder sell. Ten matches anywhere between October and April, six state sides, batting positions at a premium with 36 per round in the entire country. States want to use those to develop their own players, not those from elsewhere. They would take Root if he were available, but there is no clear gain in taking players without the record to demand it. Ultimately, all that can put some spice back into the southern contest is for England to do what they did before 2010: breed a generation of cricketers with the resilience to tackle the change in conditions and the siege feeling of the tour. Quite how to do that can only be solved by the insight and wisdom of… Ashley Giles? He played 54 Tests, so that must be right. The reality is that four years will spin by quickly, and English cricket is highly unlikely to have undergone a great structural change. Fans will do what all sport fans have learned to do: embrace innocence, ignore experience, and hope it will be different this time.",Sport/Sport,Test cricket’s next challenge: how to avoid yet another lop-sided Ashes series | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/test-crickets-next-challenge-how-to-avoid-yet-another-lop-sided-ashes-series
1/19/2022,"The Tongan government has raised concerns about the tiny islands of Mango and Fonoifua islands – north-east of the main island of Tongatapu – which both suffered catastrophic damage from the tsunami and volcano eruption on Saturday. The Tongan government reported on Tuesday night that all houses had been destroyed on Mango Island, and only two houses remained on Fonoifua.  The news came in the first statement released by the government since the disaster on Saturday, which damaged the undersea cable, cutting off communications between Tonga and the rest of the world. In the statement, the Tongan government said tsunami waves reaching up to 15 metres (49ft) hit the Ha’apai island group, where Mango is located, and the west coast of Tonga’s main island, Tongatapu. Residents were being moved to evacuation centres after 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged on that coast. Mango is located about 70km (43 miles) from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean when it erupted with a blast felt more than 2,000km away in New Zealand. The Tongan prime minister also confirmed that there had been three recorded deaths from the disaster: a 65-year-old woman on Mango and a 49-year-old man on Nomuka island, as well as the 50-year-old British woman whose body was found on Monday. A number of injuries were also reported. On Monday, the UN detected a distress signal from Mango, prompting particular concern for their inhabitants; 36 people live on Mango. Aerial images prepared by the New Zealand defence force for the Tongan government, which were leaked on Tuesday, of Mango Island, showed that the small island had sustained “catastrophic damage”. “Catastrophic damage was observed with the entire village destroyed. Temporary tarpaulin shelters had been erected on the island’s higher areas. Debris was observed throughout the village,” said the annotated image. The Tongan government has started evacuating stranded residents in some outlying areas. Aid has been sent to Tonga, with two New Zealand naval vessels en route to the islands and due to arrive on Friday. An Australian naval vessel, also containing relief supplies was due to depart on Wednesday. Aid groups are particularly concerned with making sure safe drinking water was delivered to communities, as water supplies across Tonga were disrupted by layers of volcanic ash and salt water dumped on the islands by the eruption and tsunami. Katie Greenwood, the Pacific head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said: “Water supplies across Tonga have been severely impacted by ashfall and saltwater from the tsunami. It’s vital to restore access to safe drinking water as there is a mounting risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea.” Tonga Red Cross emergency teams are providing people with clean water, tarpaulins, shelter tool kits, kitchen sets and other essential relief. Clearing the airport runway of ash is a priority for the government. The archipelago’s main Fua’amotu international airport was not damaged but the ash needs to be manually removed.",News/World news,Fears for Tonga’s tiny Mango island as every house destroyed ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/fears-for-tongas-tiny-mango-island-as-every-house-destroyed
