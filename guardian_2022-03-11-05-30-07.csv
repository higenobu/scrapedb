3/11/2022,"This was a game of fine margins and in the end it belonged to the side with greater European knowhow. Sevilla usually tend to find a way in this competition and although they did not have it all their own way here, they were more ruthless than West Ham and knew how to see themselves over the line once Munir El Haddadi had given them the lead with a fine strike on the hour. For West Ham, the primary emotion was frustration. Ultimately they only had themselves to blame. David Moyes’s side missed several excellent chances in both halves and, while they will back themselves to turn this last-16 tie around when Sevilla visit the London Stadium next week, their European adventure will be over if they do not sharpen up in front of goal. All the same it was worth taking a moment at the start to consider how far West Ham have come since appointing Moyes two years ago. After all this, a glamour tie against opponents who more or less own this competition, was unfamiliar territory for them. They have been more accustomed to battling relegation than appearing on the European stage and it would have been understandable if there had been a few nerves at kick-off, a few players in claret and blue wondering if they truly deserved to be at the Estadio Ramon Sánchez Pijuan, where there is no shortage of reminders that Sevilla have won the Europa League six times. Yet there is a robustness to West Ham these days and they did not look out of place during an absorbing first half. There was a crispness to their football and their boldness seemed to unsettle Sevilla at times, particularly with Michail Antonio running the channels and doing everything possible to unnerve a defence that looked vulnerable with Nemanja Gudelj alongside Jules Koundé instead of the injured Diego Carlos. The action was action to end-to-end, the first jabs coming from Sevilla. Yet while West Ham were fortunate not to fall behind when El Haddadi headed wide from Jesus Navas’s cross, the visitors had their moments. Antonio was a constant nuisance, barging past Gudelj before shooting wide, and West Ham seemed certain to take the lead when Declan Rice nodded Manuel Lanzini’s free-kick into the six-yard box, only for Nikola Vlasic to head too close to Bono, the Sevilla goalkeeper. It was a bad miss from Vlasic but West Ham were causing problems. Rice was working well with Tomas Soucek after recovering from a stomach upset. The full-backs, Aaron Cresswell and Ben Johnson, also had freedom to support the attack and there were more encouraging moments for West Ham before half-time, Bono pushing an effort from Vlasic wide and Antonio’s cross just evading Soucek’s lunge in the middle. West Ham, who were not quite as dangerous without the injured Jarrod Bowen cutting in from the right, needed to be more clinical. Sevilla were without several important players and their problems increased when Ivan Rakitic injured himself during the warm-up, El Haddadi coming in for the influential midfielder, but the hosts still had plenty of threats. El Haddadi was lively, jinking in to slide a shot just wide, and West Ham had another escape when Youssef En-Nesyri eluded Kurt Zouma and Craig Dawson before seeing a glancing header saved by Alphonse Areola midway through the opening period. The game was nicely balanced at the break. West Ham had settled, Rice winning his tackles and oozing confidence. Gaps were starting to appear and West Ham went close at the start of the second half, Antonio laying the ball off for Soucek to draw another fine save from Bono. Sevilla were in a game. Sensing danger, their fans increased the noise. Julen Lopetegui was whipping his players up on the touchline and West Ham soon found themselves pinned back, their defence breathing a sigh of relief when En-Nesyri spurned another good chance, heading straight at Areola. Had West Ham’s moment passed? Their finishing has been wasteful in recent weeks. Sevilla had started to press with more energy and West Ham were growing edgy, the signs ominous when Zouma conceded a free-kick after being played into trouble deep on the right. A goal was coming. Marcos Acuña trotted across from left-back to take the free-kick and West Ham momentarily forget themselves, nobody spotting El Haddadi lurking on his own on the left of the area. Nobody, that is, apart from Acuña, whose delivery caught West Ham cold and sat up perfectly for El Haddadi to clip a beautiful finish past Areola. It was such a sloppy goal to concede and West Ham were fortunate not to fall further behind when Lucas Ocampos curled a shot narrowly wide. Something had to change. Moyes replaced Vlasic with Saïd Benrahma and West Ham improved, Lanzini denied an equaliser by a heroic block from Navas. Not for the first time, the finishing touch had eluded them.",Sport/Football,Sevilla take slim first-leg lead over West Ham with Munir El Haddadi goal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/sevilla-west-ham-europa-league-match-report
3/11/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s attack on a children’s hospital has been called evidence of “genocide” by Ukraine’s president. In Australia, the head of Ukraine’s embassy has called for the expulsion of Russia’s ambassador. Shane Warne’s body has arrived in Melbourne. And the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said more support will be offered to flood-hit regions in NSW and Queensland. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned a Russian attack on a children’s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol as evidence of “genocide” as the US moved to drastically bolster support to Ukraine with a US$13.6bn aid package. At least 39 countries have called on the international criminal court to investigate war crimes, with the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, saying Russia should “absolutely” be investigated. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Vladimir Putin will fail in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and will instead lead Russia into a “strategic defeat” that is already unfolding. “I’m absolutely convinced that Putin will fail, and Russia will suffer a strategic defeat no matter what short-term tactical gains it may make in Ukraine,” the secretary of state said. Meanwhile, the head of Ukraine’s embassy in Australia says he cannot remain “diplomatically polite” when his parents, aged in their 70s, spend their nights in a bomb shelter in Kyiv, and has called for the Russian ambassador to be expelled. Travellers are facing steep air fare hikes as bans on Russian oil cause jet fuel prices to surge, aviation experts warn. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has said the average fare would increase by 7% as a result of the increased crude oil prices, but others predict the price rises could be higher. The Brent crude oil price is about US$112 a barrel, up from about US$78 a barrel at the beginning of 2022 and marking an eight-year high, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The surge follows the US and UK banning oil from Russia. President Joe Biden has been criticised by both progressives and Republicans after a report indicated the White House was planning a visit to Saudi Arabia to discuss global oil supply. Pollution washed into Sydney’s beaches and waterways could linger for days, with state authorities urging swimmers to exercise caution after the flood disaster. Sydney Harbour turned brown as a result of storm water carrying soil and debris, and algal blooms have appeared on the usually pristine sands of Hyams beach in Jervis Bay. Rainfall is the major driver of pollution into coastal areas because it generates storm water and triggers the overflow of raw sewage. In flood-ravaged towns, thousands of homes are now unliveable in areas that already struggled with accommodation shortages. More than $13m has been donated to support those affected by the devastating floods in Queensland and NSW, and most of the money has been directed towards peer-to-peer fundraising efforts such as GoFundMe. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, says it may be possible for Australia to achieve a diplomatic thaw with China despite the substantial differences between the two countries – if Scott Morrison abandons his “desperate” pre-election weaponisation of national security. The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly of a suspected heart attack aged 52, prompting tributes from across the political divide. Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines would “inevitably” be forced into an emergency reactor shutdown by swarms of jellyfish if the fleet were based in Brisbane, a marine scientist says. The closure of the Bulahdelah’s Cedar Wharf Lodge will see elderly couples torn apart, unable to visit each other as limited transport options hinder travel to the NSW Hunter region aged care home. Some in the community will be left travelling more than 75km to the nearest aged care facility in Taree to visit their partner. The US and some of its European allies are facing accusations of double standards for supporting sanctions and international war crimes investigations against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine while blocking them over Israeli military actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Brazil’s capital after one of the country’s leading musicians, Caetano Veloso, called a protest to denounce what environmentalists call a historic assault on the Brazilian environment under President Jair Bolsonaro. The “Ato pela Terra” (Stand for the Earth) demonstration was held in Brasília to oppose what activists call a “death combo” of five environment-related bills being considered by congress. A film on the pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019 has broken a box office record in Taiwan for an overseas Chinese-language documentary within the first fortnight of its release. Connor Ratliff has told the story a thousand times. About when, as a young up-and-coming actor, he auditioned for a small role on the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers. About how he got the part, only to be fired before filming began because one of the show’s executive producers thought Ratliff had “dead eyes”. About how, and here’s the real kicker, the executive producer in question was Tom Hanks. From the moment they met to their final days in hospital together, Jeannette and Michael Ryan’s relationship was a love story. For six decades they were dedicated to each other, until they both tested positive to Covid-19 on New Year’s Eve. They were admitted to hospital in the regional Victorian city of Shepparton 10 days later. Michael was 84 when he died on 15 January. His wife followed him exactly a week later, aged 82. “It would have been so sad to watch one of them mourn the other,” the daughters of the Victorian couple say. Can we really harness our brain chemicals to give ourselves a blast of positivity? Researchers share their shortcuts to boosting oxytocin, serotonin and more. Crises in Australia have underlined the power of state governments and their roles in our lives. State premiers stepped up during the Covid pandemic, while the prime minister went missing. Communities hit by floods and bushfires have been left to fend for themselves as they wait for state and federal governments to act. In this episode of Full Story, Gabrielle Jackson speaks to Lenore Taylor, Mike Ticher and Conal Hanna about how to approach state news in a federalist system.

The 52-year-old died at a resort on the Thai island of Koh Samui last Friday, sparking widespread grief as fans mourned the loss of one of the world’s best spin bowlers. The Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is among seven of Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs who have been hit with sanctions by the UK, in an effort to further punish allies of Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine.

3/11/2022,"Two weeks ago, the greater Kyiv area had a bustling population of about 3.5 million people, its streets buzzing with busy cafes, businesses and bars. Today, after 13 days of bombing by the Russian military, the Ukrainian capital is deserted, with 50% of its inhabitants gone. “Half of the Kyiv population has fled,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Thursday as Moscow’s forces continue to give the city no respite. “A little less than 2 million have fled the capital.” In recent days, as the Russian bombardments in Irpin and other suburbs of the capital intensified, the citizens of Kyiv have been flowing into the western city of Lviv, where tens of thousands of people have sought shelter since the beginning of the invasion. Anastasya Stepanchuk, 28, was determined to stay in her home in the Kyiv suburbs with her husband, who is fighting to defend the capital. As Russian forces started to press closer to the city, she decided to flee. She left behind an unrecognisable Kyiv, the cafes and shops shuttered and the streets full of roadblocks and anti-tank defences. It has become, says Klitschko, “a fortress, with every street, building and checkpoint fortified”. “I had to flee and I’m scared, because I left a lot of friends and, of course, my husband,” she says. “I don’t want to go abroad. I’m determined to go back to my city when things improve. Once Ukraine wins, I will come back to Kyiv to build it back. We all want to return and take part in the rebuilding.” Many of those forced to flee their city spoke of their fears of what they would find on their return. Yulian Kondur, 28, a Kyiv resident who is now internally displaced, was forced to move to the outskirts of the capital when the war began. “During the first bombing, a building two blocks from mine was hit,” says Kondur, who is a coordinator at the charity Roma Women’s Foundation Chirikli. “When I left, the city looked like a ghost town. Most of the people who are left live in the bomb shelters and some are helping others with food and other needs. Kyiv was very lively and peaceful, with people going to work every day and living their normal lives. The idea of going back and seeing Kyiv in this condition scares me a little.” In Lviv, doctors, soldiers and volunteers are also anxiously awaiting the arrival of people from Mariupol, a city that has experienced horrific bombardment by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called an attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol on Wednesday “an atrocity”, with patients trapped under rubble in “apocalyptic” scenes. Preparations are being made to welcome more wounded and displaced people in the coming weeks and months as they leave cities across the country. Olga, 30, arrived in Lviv with her four cats on Wednesday from Kharkiv, a major city near the eastern border with Russia which was among the first to be bombarded. “It was very difficult to get out of the city. People are afraid of driving cars to reach the border or other areas of the country,” she says. “There is little information and not everyone knows that there are buses to evacuate people. “If you could let these people know that they can leave cities safely, you could save a lot of lives. But as long as the flyzone is open, people will continue to die.”",News/News,‘We all want to return’: residents fleeing Kyiv mourn a deserted city,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/10/we-all-want-to-return-residents-fleeing-kyiv-mourn-a-deserted-city
3/11/2022,"Chelsea fans don’t know where they stand and nor do outside shareholders in Evraz, the FTSE 100 steelmaker where Roman Abramovich is a 29% shareholder. After the government unveiled sanctions against the oligarch on Thursday morning, trading in Evraz’s shares continued for more than an hour before the Financial Conduct Authority, in charge of listings on the London Stock Exchange, ordered a temporary suspension at 11am. The FCA said it had acted “in order to protect investors pending clarification of the impact of the UK sanctions”. Well, yes, clarification is definitely required, because a reader of the asset freeze order against Abramovich would immediately wonder why Evraz itself hadn’t also been sanctioned. Here’s one passage: Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, via Evraz plc”. In the gap between the government’s move and the FCA’s, Evraz’s shares fell from 93p to 82p. The stock is thinly traded (Abramovich isn’t the only chunky holder), but a few wide-awake investors may have used the window to get out quickly. That, in most books, counts as a disorderly market. It’s hard to blame the FCA if it wasn’t given advance warning by government officials, but the market-related angle to the sanctions process in the past fortnight has been chaotic. With the global depositary receipts at sanctioned Russian companies, authorities veered from allowing outside investors to trade to slamming down the shutters suddenly. If there was an underlying methodology, it was hard to spot. Evraz popped up later in the day to argue that UK financial sanctions should not apply to the company itself and that it didn’t consider Abramovich to be “a person exercising effective control”. It also denied the government’s allegation that it had supplied steel to the Russian military, which may have been used in the production of tanks. The position will be resolved eventually, but ensuring an orderly market in the shares ought not to be as hard as the authorities are making it appear. The government and the FCA just have to talk to each other. A chief executive with the nickname “Nails” is exactly what Marks & Spencer needed circa 2016. The business had to be told a few home truths about getting competitive again. Steve Rowe, a virtual M&S lifer who had risen from the shop floor, was best placed to deliver them. He got M&S out of most of its ragged international ventures, took it into online food with Ocado, and finally tackled the excess of floor space. Miracle of miracles, the clothing side even looks sharper. If Rowe is quitting because he’s knackered after six years in charge, including the tough pandemic period, you can’t blame him. He’s done an excellent job – certainly better than the share price makes it seem. Worryingly, though, M&S seems to have concluded that Rowe is irreplaceable in conventional fashion. Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe will be co-chief executives, except that, weirdly, only Bickerstaffe will have the “co” bit in her job title. Double acts at the top of large quoted companies have a terrible record; they rarely last. Maybe this time will be different because the pair have worked harmoniously as co-chief operating officers, but it rather looks as if the chairman, Archie Norman, is the real boss. The new set-up looks like a fudge. It’s too soon to say the John Lewis Partnership is out of the woods, but there’s definitely progress; the self-help programme is probably about a year ahead of schedule. The department stores were always the more troubled side and revenues there reached a record £4.93bn, despite the closure of 16 outlets. Indeed, for all the wailing in some quarters, last year’s numbers offered strong evidence that the closures had to happen. The online shift is relentless: two-thirds of non-Waitrose sales were online. That ratio may slip back this year, but the tally definitely won’t return to the pre-pandemic level of 42%. Cost savings were the key driver of the recovery in overall profits (before tax, staff bonus and exceptional charges) to £181m. As important is the vastly improved state of the balance sheet. John Lewis can continue to invest. The next task is to ensure it does so well. Adventures into financial services and build-to-rent flats are billed as big new sources of sustainable profits. There’s a commercial logic at work for a mutually owned company with long investment horizons, but diversification is rarely easy.",News/Business,UK sanctions confusion left Evraz investors not knowing where to stand | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/10/uk-sanctions-confusion-left-evraz-investors-not-knowing-where-to-stand
3/11/2022,"A playwright who was considering a “complete career change” because of the Covid-19 pandemic’s devastating impact on the arts has been announced as the winner of this year’s Women’s prize for playwriting. Karis Kelly won the prize for Consumed, a drama about four generations of Northern Irish women at a 90th birthday party in a “house full of hungry ghosts”. Kelly, who has been writing plays since 2008, said “like many others in the arts, during the pandemic, I had a complete crisis of faith … So to go from that point to receiving recognition from such an amazing prize and panel of judges is genuinely a dream come true.” Literary agent Mel Kenyon chaired the judging panel, which included the Guardian’s chief theatre critic Arifa Akbar, playwright Lucy Kirkwood and Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker. The award, now in its second year, is vital “in today’s theatre ecology”, said Kelly, who received the prize of £12,000 at a ceremony on Thursday at the London Library. “We really do need programmes that highlight female and female-identifying voices. I’m so proud to be a part of its legacy.” More than 850 scripts were entered for the prize, which is produced by Ellie Keel and the touring theatre company Paines Plough. Keel called Consumed “warm, funny, deft and sharply observed”, and added: “We’ve got a long way still to go in terms of parity between male and female writers on major stages and I hope that the exceptional plays brought together under the banner of this prize demonstrate that there’s no shortage of talent: only, in some places, a reluctance to recognise it or give it a chance.” Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett, joint artistic directors of Paines Plough, said they had called each other after reading Consumed and found they had “both been howling with laughter, moved and shocked all within the first 10 pages”. Consumed is set to be programmed in 2023. In 2020, the prize’s inaugural year, two scripts won: Amy Trigg’s Reasons You Should(n’t) Love Me, which was later staged at the Kiln theatre in London, and Ahlam’s You Bury Me, which had a staged reading during last year’s Edinburgh international festival.",Arts/Stage,Women’s prize for playwriting won by 90th birthday drama in ‘house full of ghosts’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/10/womens-prize-for-playwriting-karis-kelly-consumed
