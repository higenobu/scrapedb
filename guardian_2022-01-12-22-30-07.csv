1/12/2022,"Without wishing to sound like an episode of Poirot, I remember well what I was doing on the evening of 20 May 2020, when more than 100 people were invited to a BYOB party in the prime minister’s garden, “to make the most of the lovely weather”. While they recovered from an “exceptionally busy period” with, it might be presumed, laughter, companionship and their own bottles of wine, I was at my house. Like them, I, too, had a glass of wine, although I had drunk it by myself. I had then gone for a walk around my block where I had bumped into a friend out on his “daily permitted exercise”. We spoke a little, at a distance of more than two metres. He offered his condolences. I thanked him and returned home, alone. 20 May 2020 was the day I buried my sister. Like those assembled with their bottles in Downing Street, I, too, had broken the government’s existing guidelines, implemented to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, in a familiar garden. After my sister Karina’s funeral, I had gone to my mother’s house. It was a baking hot day and, while the circumstances didn’t really allow me to “make the most of the lovely weather”, the sunshine did permit me and my other sister, Kirsty, to sit in our mum’s garden, at the state-appointed distance from each other, and recall the many joys, as well as strains, that Karina’s life had brought. There were three of us in the garden, from three separate households, one more than was permitted. It might not have been exactly to the letter of the law, but we reckoned it was the least our grief would permit.  Luckily we could remain physically, if not emotionally, distanced from each other. Karina had died of Covid and we felt we should take the best precautions possible to prevent the disease’s spread. We sat at three different points in the garden, on familiar garden furniture in the most unfamiliar of circumstances. We didn’t hug, didn’t allow ourselves any of the consolation of physical touch: we thought it would be safer that way. Physical contact was, after all, what they had instructed us to avoid. For 48 years my mother had fought to keep her disabled daughter happy and alive. For 48 years, whenever Karina had been ill, my mother had slept in hospital chairs for weeks on end, gone days without sleep, sacrificed her own health for Karina’s wellbeing, driven by a love that only a parent can know. And now Karina was dead. And we couldn’t hug each other. It was bleak, yes, but then it was a time of incomparable global uncertainty. An unparalleled, unifying swathe of sadness had devoured us all. Pain like ours was tearing through families the world over. So, in some ways, it felt like we were all in it together. A couple of hours earlier, we had driven in separate cars to the cemetery in which my father is buried. Two gravediggers stood by a fence as we watched six strangers, wearing masks and latex gloves, lower Karina’s coffin into a freshly dug plot adjacent to his. A priest, somewhat concealed behind another gravestone, invited me to speak. I attempted to hold back tears as I gave thanks for the extraordinary role Karina had played in our family. A tinny speaker played Abba’s Thank You for the Music, the lyrics a little drowned out by the rustle of the willow tree above. We threw some earth on her coffin, got back in our separate cars and went back to my mum’s for a slice of chocolate cake on disposable plates. I had brought my own. Our story was just one of thousands similar happening up and down the country. We were, we consoled ourselves again, all in it together. That evening, as I walked alone, the streets were piercingly quiet. How sad it all is, I thought, how devastatingly sad. And yet, what consolation there is in seeing and hearing these manifest absences; silences that speak of self-denial and mutual respect. The sepulchral pallor that my corner of London had been bathed in was the result of a shared commitment to rules, designed by them, to keep us, our loved ones and our wider society safe. I walked past my neighbours’ houses; friends numbed by screentime and family dynamics, unsure how long this would all last, no access to society beyond their phones, windows open to mitigate against that lovely, lovely weather. I couldn’t help but feel grateful that my community was taking the deaths of people such as my sister as seriously and profoundly as I was. Their confinement spoke of a silent but wholehearted sympathy for families such as mine. They knew, they felt too, that we were all in it together. Well, not all of us, it turns out. Not them. Just under two miles separates my corner of London from the garden of Downing Street. I am, today, haunted by the tinkling of those glasses there on that sun-drenched night, the echoing of their thin laughter, the stifled chuckles as they practised their imagined denials and, most perniciously, the leadership that encouraged it to happen. Their actions feel like direct assaults in the face of my family’s, and all of our shared national, tragedy. To me, and I’m sure many others, the revelations of the manifest and repeated failures of those in power to understand, empathise or show solidarity with what the people of this country experienced during that time has released from the body politic a stench so toxic that I can’t see how they will be able to put it back in the bottle, no matter how desperately they try. They can’t point the finger anywhere else this time, can they? After all, they brought the bottle themselves.

1/12/2022,"After months of sabre-rattling from Vladimir Putin over Ukraine, Russian officials have been on a diplomatic tour of Europe this week, meeting the US in Geneva and Nato in Brussels. Amid this diplomatic whirl, Europe’s biggest diplomatic club has been absent. The EU has no formal role in the talks, although its officials are drawing up possible sanctions to levy against Russia if the Kremlin decides to invade Ukraine. The EU’s exclusion from talks on war and peace in its own backyard hurts. “Between Putin and Biden, Europe is sidelined,” ran a Le Monde headline last week. The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell struck an insouciant note. “I don’t care,” he said when the BBC asked whether the US should have gone ahead with the Geneva talks. The Russians, he said, had “deliberately excluded the EU from any participation” but he had been assured by the US that “nothing will be agreed without our strong co-operation, coordination and participation”.  Officials have downplayed the exclusion of the EU. “European allies are at the table, because European allies are in Nato,” said Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg. After Nato-Russia talks, Stoltenberg plans to brief EU defence ministers meeting in the port city of Brest in north-western France on Wednesday evening. The two organisations have 21 member countries in common and pages of pledges to improve cooperation. Not everyone buys this reassuring story about Europe’s absence from the top table. “It gives me huge concern,” Radosław Sikorski, a Polish former foreign minister, who now sits in the European parliament, told the Guardian. “The EU is a neighbour of both Ukraine and Russia, these are countries with whom we have intense relationships. And what happens between them affects several member states. Of course we should be there and I am astonished that we are not.” The EU’s foreign policy chief, then Catherine Ashton, was at the table with the US, Russia and Ukraine in 2014 in Geneva, following the invasion of Crimea. France and Germany later switched to the narrower Normandy format, talking to Kiev and Moscow, in an attempt to end the conflict in Ukraine. “It was the actions of some member states, Germany and France, and a diplomatic mistake by Ukraine to accept the Normandy formula, and then the Minsk formula, that has got us nowhere,” argues Sikorski. “Through a series of missteps we have ended up with the EU excluded from an issue of vital importance for us.” In an uncomfortable irony the crisis is unfolding as EU defence and foreign ministers gather this week in Brest to discuss how the EU can be a more powerful player in a global order challenged by authoritarian powers and rogue actors. The search for the EU’s “strategic autonomy” is championed by France, which took charge of the EU rotating presidency this month. Europe, a senior French government official said, must be “fully sovereign, free in its choices and master of its own destiny”. Another Russian invasion of Ukraine is an obvious big test for “sovereign” Europe. More than 100,000 Russian troops are stationed around Ukraine’s borders and US intelligence has reported that 175,000 could be deployed by the end of January. EU leaders have warned of “massive consequences” in response to any further military aggression against Ukraine. The precise consequences are a closely-guarded secret, as officials believe telegraphing the details would advantage Putin by allowing him to calibrate his response. Even senior diplomats say they are in the dark about exactly what the European Commission has prepared. Nonetheless, a broad list of options has emerged, covering finance, technology and individuals. In the event of a fully-fledged invasion, Russia could be cut off from Swift, the bank-messaging system that connects 11,000 corporations in more than 200 countries. Oligarchs close to the Kremlin could see their assets in western jurisdictions frozen. The EU would also be under pressure not to approve the controversial NordSteam II pipeline, which is complete, but must clear regulatory hurdles before Russia can start pumping has to Germany. “The Swift option is an option being looked at closely,” said veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, who was the top civil servant at the EU’s foreign service between 2010-15. “It has to be looked at closely, and maybe more tailor-made financial sanctions, and also individual sanctions.” The final outcome would depend on the nature of the Russian aggression he said. “If the Russians go ahead with a large-scale direct military invasion, one could expect that the EU would respond in equal strength.” Diplomatic sources suggested a full-scale invasion would unify the EU to act, whereas a continuing campaign of Russian hybrid attacks, disinformation and support for proxy forces in the Donbass makes the decision more difficult. European countries trade more with Russia and have more to lose than the US, making the sanctions calculus more complex. “If on the contrary there is still pressure from Russia, but we remain with the same level of tension it will be more difficult,” Vimont said, referring to Nordstream in particular. “It seems this will very much depend on the circumstances.” Meanwhile, member states remain divided over whether to set up an EU military mission to train the Ukrainian army, adding to an EU civilian mission that has been on the ground since 2014 to help Kiev improve police, courts and border forces. Poland, the Nordic and Baltic states would like to see a fully-fledged army-training mission with EU boots on the ground, whereas other countries wonder whether the same outcome could be achieved by increasing financial aid to Ukraine. The question has gone to and fro, since Ukraine’s government requested a military training programme last July. Sikorski argues Ukraine has much bigger needs from European countries. “What Ukraine really needs is a batch of anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, but these would be national decisions. I hope the member states are preparing contingency plans to do that if Putin fulfils his threats.” Tomás Valášek, a member of Slovakia’s parliament and former ambassador to Nato, argued against assuming the EU would be divided, pointing to the bloc’s decision to levy wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russia in 2014 – measures that remain in place. “Historically the track record suggests that when Russia crosses red lines we do the right thing, rather than the opposite.” “What [Putin] has done more recently, with the massing of 100,000 plus troops in Ukraine, and now with the unprecedented demands of a security architecture, that has actually had a unifying effect. We have crossed from a situation of a merely normal level of subterfuge and provocation to something new, something that is already unifying Europe.”",News/World news,‘Europe is sidelined’: Russia meets US in Geneva and Nato in Brussels,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/europe-is-sidelined-russia-meets-us-in-geneva-and-nato-in-brussels
1/12/2022,"Right now, Tamara Rojo is putting the finishing touches to the first ballet she has created for English National Ballet – a new version of Raymonda – but it will also be her last. She announced on Tuesday that she is leaving the company, where she is artistic director and lead principal, to take up the artistic directorship at San Francisco Ballet. It’s a blow for Britain’s ballet scene, where the sharply intelligent Rojo has been an innovative leader and an articulate advocate for the art form, turning ENB from a respected but unexciting touring company into a news-making organisation.  It doesn’t feel that long since Rojo arrived in the job but it’s almost 10 years – testament to the fact that things have never become predictable in her time there. When she started, she was one of the world’s leading dancers at the Royal Ballet, with little management experience but plenty of brains and ambition. She brought star quality to ENB and continued to dance, combining the two roles in a seemingly impossible balancing act of early morning body conditioning, daily class with the rest of the company and morning rehearsals, then in the afternoon running the company (and in the evenings when not performing, out networking and fundraising and all the other things artistic directors have to do). You could see the results for the company on stage, although there were some rumblings about Rojo’s management style, and a number of dancers left. She brought in Cuban ballerina Loipa Araújo to coach the dancers and new signings: Alina Cojocaru, poached from the Royal Ballet, Precious Adams from the US and the brilliant Russian Maria Kochetkova, as well as some virtuoso young men, including César Corrales, Jeffrey Cirio and Isaac Hernandez (who is her partner – the couple have a nine-month-old son). Rojo has also overseen the company’s move from its cramped HQ in South Kensington to slick, vast new studios in Canning Town, representing not just a geographical shift, but a move from a spot associated with upper crust heritage – round the corner from the Royal Albert Hall; Princess Diana used to escape across Kensington Gardens for lessons there – to the east of the capital where the mood is all about change, renewal and creativity. Rojo turned the company into one worth talking and writing about. She was always walking a tightrope between artistic innovation and staying financially afloat (ENB’s bank balance is much more precarious than that of the Royal Ballet behemoth), serving regular helpings of The Nutcracker and staging some big glitzy romps such as Le Corsaire to win crowds. But her biggest success was in asking contemporary/kathak choreographer Akram Khan to reinvent one of ballet’s most cherished works, Giselle. The triumphant result was a brooding, intense ballet, setting the turbulent story of love and betrayal in a community of migrant factory workers, and was a reinvention for the company – the dancers performing with a new energy and urgency. The work has toured internationally. Elsewhere, Rojo commissioned another contemporary choreographer, Russell Maliphant (along with Khan and ballet choreographer Liam Scarlett) to make a moving triple bill, Lest We Forget, marking the centenary of the first world war. She has continually championed female choreographers, of whom there have been embarrassingly few in the ballet repertoire, staging an all-female triple bill, She Said, with works from Annabelle Lopez Ochoa, Yabin Wang and Aszure Barton. She gained rare permission for the company to perform Pina Bausch’s punishing Rite of Spring. With their wild hair and bodies flying, the dancers couldn’t have been further from classical ballet’s poised prettiness. And she got the great William Forsythe to make the joyful Playlist (Track 1, 2) leaping and spinning to house music in a piece of pure balletic pleasure. The risk-taking doesn’t always pay off – Khan’s 2021 piece Creature was the equivalent of those dark TV dramas where the lighting’s too gloomy and you can’t hear what the actors are mumbling, but you can’t resent the ambition to push the agenda and keep ballet a vital, living art form. Rojo’s vision has always been to tie together classical ballet’s heritage with modern theatrical sensibility and meaty female characters, and in her Raymonda – a Florence Nightingale-inspired story set in the Crimean war – she’s putting her money where her mouth is. Even though it might be her swansong for English National Ballet, it’s only the beginning of the next gripping chapter of Rojo’s career.",Arts/Stage,A 10-year triumph: how Tamara Rojo transformed English National Ballet,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/12/a-10-year-triumph-how-tamara-rojo-transformed-english-national-ballet
1/12/2022,"Gordon Brown has written to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, calling on her to help convene a donor conference to raise $4.5bn (£3.3bn) for Afghanistan as he warned that more than 23 million people were at risk of starvation if aid did not materialise. The former prime minister said: “We are witnessing a shameful but also self-defeating failure to prevent famine”, adding that the UK should urgently take a lead in resuming the delivery of aid dramatically halted after the Taliban takeover.  Cash was available, said Brown in an article for the Guardian, but donor countries needed confidence they would not be hit by existing international sanctions, which he also argued could be relaxed if the Taliban made genuine progress on the rights of women and girls. On Tuesday, UN agencies launched a call for $4.5bn in aid for 2022, its biggest ever international appeal. The US responded with a donation of $308m, to be channelled through independent humanitarian organisations. But Brown said that was not enough. “The 35-country, American-led coalition that ruled Afghanistan for 20 years under the banner of helping the Afghan people has still put up only a quarter of the money that would allow UN humanitarians to stop children dying this winter.” Britain had planned to cut its Afghan aid spending in 2021, in line with wider cuts to the aid budget, but lifted its commitment to £286m in August, taking the headline total close to the £290m delivered in 2019. Wealthy countries in the Middle East were ready to commit, he added. “The Gulf states – Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates – have the money and have made offers to provide assistance, but they fear an American backlash. Realistically it will require America to break the logjam and end the cycle of starvation and death.” Brown said he had written to Truss and to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, to ask them to host an international donor conference “in January or at the latest in February” to break the impasse. Afghanistan’s previously aid-dependent economy has been “in freefall”, according to the UN, falling by about 40% since US and Nato forces withdrew last summer. International assistance halted almost overnight once the Taliban took over, while US economic sanctions aimed at the group have further isolated the country. “The devastation the world was warned about months ago is no longer a distant prospect,” Brown wrote. The UN’s humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffiths, Brown wrote, “forecasts that if we do not act, 97% of Afghans will soon be living below the poverty line”. About 90% of the country’s clinics “do not have the funds to keep themselves open” while the Covid crisis continues, the former prime minister said. Only 11% of Afghanistan’s population of approximately 40 million have been vaccinated. “Aid workers now find children huddled together under threadbare blankets in temporary camps and hovels or lying wrapped in their mothers’ burqas outside hospitals waiting for treatment that is now simply not available,” Brown added.",News/World news,Gordon Brown calls on Liz Truss to help raise funds for Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/gordon-brown-calls-liz-truss-help-raise-funds-for-afghanistan
1/12/2022,"How can it be that, in these first weeks of 2022, the world is allowing millions of Afghan children to face death from starvation? And this after months during which the UN, a score of governments, the EU and the Arab League, not to mention US ex-army commanders, ambassadors and humanitarians, have been publicly pleading for immediate action to stop the rising cascade of Afghan lives lost to famine and malnutrition. On Tuesday, Martin Griffiths and Filippo Grandi, UN humanitarian and refugee coordinators, once again begged countries to send food and urgent supplies. They announced the biggest humanitarian appeal mounted since 1945 for a single country, a $4.5bn request to help more than 23 million Afghans on the edge of starvation.  For the devastation the world was warned about months ago is no longer a distant prospect. “Let us eat” was the stark banner under which protesters demonstrated a few days ago in Kabul, as the guarantees of assistance made by world powers in August have melted into a trail of broken promises. Dawn in Afghanistan sees long queues of women and children outside bakeries for the one food staple still available – bread – and even that is in short supply due to a 40% drop in wheat production after the worst drought in decades. Griffiths forecasts that if we do not act, 97% of Afghans could soon be living below the poverty line. In other words, to be Afghan today is to be sentenced to dire poverty or destitution. Aid workers are finding children huddled together under threadbare blankets in temporary camps and hovels or lying wrapped in their mothers’ burqas outside hospitals waiting for treatment that is simply not available. Until August, 30 million Afghans depended on World Bank-managed healthcare. Now, more than 90% of the country’s health clinics lack the funds to stay open. Only 11% of Afghans have had a Covid vaccine. International aid workers are courageously doing their best to keep some food aid moving, some clinics functioning and some schools open for boys and girls. But their work is undercut and any progress is cancelled out by the withdrawal of the aid money that previously accounted for 43% of Afghanistan’s GDP and funded 75% of public expenditure, and by the freezing of banking transactions and trade with Afghanistan, with the result that there is little private cash circulating either. This is the new world order revealed at its most selfish and morally defective: countries are locked into the narrow nationalism of “America first”, “Britain first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first”, and trapped in a geopolitics that puts military and economic sanctions before food for the hungry. Even after America’s $308m contribution on 12 January, the 35-country, US-led coalition that ruled Afghanistan for 20 years under the banner of helping the Afghan people has still put up only a quarter of the money that would allow UN humanitarians to stop children dying this winter. This is not an isolated incident. Our liberal world order is proving itself neither liberal nor orderly. What has also been destroying thousands of lives in the past year is an equally counterproductive failure to vaccinate, test and provide treatments for poor people across the world, with the result that we have spawned new Covid variants, endangering us all. Now we are witnessing a similarly shameful and self-defeating failure to prevent famine. Our reluctance to act is not only a moral outrage but will have real-world consequences. These may take the form of mass migration to the west, rising production of heroin and the recruitment of terrorists who will claim that the world’s failure to act proves coexistence is impossible. The UN security council has finally agreed to offer financial institutions and commercial actors legal assurances that they will not be in breach of sanctions if they engage with humanitarian organisations. It is an important step, but one that does not yet guarantee that enough help will come. So we must make a success of the $4.5bn humanitarian appeal and augment it with all of the $1.5bn held in trust at the World Bank for Afghanistan (currently only $280m has been released). But even these initiatives amount to just 30p a day per person in Afghanistan for all their food, shelter, healthcare and schooling, and are no more than stopgap measures to get us through the winter. Humanitarian programmes alone cannot replace that 75% of public expenditure that until August came from aid agencies abroad, or substitute the networks of governmental provision built before the takeover that are now collapsing. And so, we must find a way to ensure dollars can come into the country, or for local banks to issue a stable Afghan currency, so food and salaries for teachers and health workers can be paid for. Nothing should detract from our condemnation of the regime’s repression, abuses of human rights and extrajudicial killings. They must receive no political recognition from any aid we give to the Afghan people. But on condition of demonstrable progress, for example, on women’s and girls’ rights and with aid going through the UN and NGOs, some economic sanctions could be relaxed. If the killings stop and there is a more inclusive government, some development assistance could begin. The next step must be a UN-backed pledging conference, and I have written to both the UK foreign secretary and the EU president asking them to co-convene it. The Gulf states – Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – have the money and have made offers to provide assistance, but they fear an American backlash. Realistically, it will require the US to break the logjam and end the cycle of starvation and death. To turn our backs now on ordinary Afghans in their hour of greatest need would be the final insult: a badge of shame that the free world would carry for ever. Visiting Kabul a few days ago, my colleague at the organisation I chair, Education Cannot Wait, met a young girl pleading to go back to school. Her name was Arezou. It is the Dari word for wish, indeed for hope. And it is hope that we must offer her and a despairing Afghan people. Now.

1/12/2022,"December 1925 was a busy month for June. A fixture of the West End stage since childhood, her surname, Tripp, had been excised by the impresario Charles B Cochran because it “sounds a bit comical for a dancer”. She spent the days rehearsing for a musical, Kid Boots, the evenings starring in another, Mercenary Mary, and then would “rush to the studio at midnight”, to act in a horse-racing short film opposite the fading American film star Carlyle Blackwell. The studio was at Poole Street, Islington, in north London, built five years earlier by Paramount but now rented out, most often to a British company, Gainsborough, run by Michael Balcon. The short, Riding for a King, starred the celebrated jockey Steve Donoghue and had its premiere in January 1926, with June in attendance. Two days later, she collapsed during a performance of Mercenary Mary and shortly after underwent an appendectomy. Daily Express readers subsequently learned that she would “not be able to dance for six months”. By February, she was recuperating on the Riviera. It was there that she received a telegram from her old friend Ivor Novello, who offered film work. “No dancing required. You will act beautifully and we shall have fun.”  Novello was Britain’s preeminent male star. The Rat, Gainsborough’s film of a play he had co-written for himself, had just been released, and now Balcon had him lined up for the lead in a murder mystery, The Lodger. June was to play Daisy, the landlord and landlady’s daughter who falls in love with a man who may or may not be Jack the Ripper. It was her first significant film role. If Novello’s telegram named the film’s director, it could not have meant much to June, since neither of his two films had yet been released. On her arrival at Poole Street she encountered “a short, corpulent man named Alfred Hitchcock”, as she wrote in her 1960 memoir The Glass Ladder. He had started his career at the studio when it was still Paramount’s, and would in future describe himself as “American trained”. After the Americans left he was hired by the nascent Gainsborough, and worked his way up to the director’s chair by the time he was 25. His first two films, The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle, were made in Bavaria and northern Italy. Coming home after finishing the latter, late in 1925, Hitchcock had proposed to his assistant director Alma Reville, and she, too seasick to speak, had made “an affirmative gesture”. The Lodger, his third film but “the first true Hitchcock movie” as he put it to François Truffaut, was derived from a novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes, as well as a comic stage adaptation, Who is He?, that he had seen as a teenager. The morning after production began in February 1926, with a night shoot on the Victoria Embankment, it was reported that Gainsborough had bought Poole Street outright. What was not reported, though, was that this was another aspect of June’s contribution to The Lodger, through her secret romance with the racing-car driver Woolf “Babe” Barnato. When they met, June was unaware just how rich, and how married, Babe was. His father Barney, “a poor Jewish lad who, born in London’s ghetto”, as June later put it, had gone out to South Africa in the 1870s, made millions in diamonds, then gone mysteriously overboard on a voyage back from the Cape in 1897. At one point he had been up there with Cecil Rhodes. As it happened, June’s Riding for a King co-star Carlyle Blackwell was a beneficiary of the same legacy, through his (initially bigamous) marriage to Babe’s sister, Leah. One source says it explicitly, but it was the Barnato fortune that paid for Gainsborough’s studio. British films were at a low ebb in the mid-1920s, kept off the screen by the all-conquering Americans; to compete with the new empire, Gainsborough drew on inherited wealth accumulated under the old one. In return for the Barnato’s money, their two partners, June and Blackwell, were given roles. June had barely been in a film before, and every previous Gainsborough film had had a US female lead. Blackwell was given a job on the board and is credited as producer on The Lodger. The Barnatos enabled Gainsborough to survive the American onslaught: a month after The Lodger was released in February 1927, the government brought in the famous Cinematographic Films Act, designed to protect the British studios by establishing a quota. Naturally enough, June appeared in reports from the set of The Lodger that appeared in the press in early 1926. In one, by the Daily Mail’s Iris Barry, she emerged from her dressing room “to discuss the merits of an intensely golden wig she must wear”. In another, the Evening News printed a photo of the director playfully threatening her with a poker, along with a vivid portrait of “the autocrat of the studio” at work. June herself provided an account of Hitchcock’s methods in The Glass Ladder, which was published before his notorious mistreatment of Tippi Hedren on the set of The Birds came to light. In one scene, she writes: “All I had to do was carry an iron tray of breakfast dishes up a long flight of stairs, but by the time Hitch was satisfied with the expression of fear on my face and the atmosphere established by lights and shadows, I must have made the trek 20 times, the tray seeming to grow heavier every passing minute. During that exhausting hour and a half, I felt a strange sickening pain somewhere in the region of my appendix scar, but forbore to complain or ask for a rest, because delicate actresses are a bore and a nuisance, and in any case, this scene ended my work on the film.” Within weeks June was at death’s door. After a second operation, she had to deny rumours “that she would probably dance no more”. In July 1926, she went to recuperate in Dorset, where she was photographed with Babe in the Daily Sketch – one of the few occasions their relationship was even hinted at in public. Only the very end of the shot is in the film. What happened to The Lodger in the summer of 1926 has become one of the founding myths of Hitchcock’s early career: supposedly, it was rejected by its distributor (like Hitchcock’s two previous films) and the director’s career was in trouble until the Observer’s film reviewer Ivor Montagu was brought in to re-edit it, leading to the film’s triumphant first screening in September of that year (and the subsequent release of The Mountain Eagle, Hitchcock’s previous film). This is exaggerated; what really happened was less of an underdog story. None of Hitchcock’s films were shelved, and the extent of Montagu’s intervention has been inflated. If there was tension between Hitchcock and Gainsborough, it is more likely to have been because Hitchcock was poached by a rival studio very soon after The Lodger was shot. It was June’s career that was in the balance. She had sailed to Rio with Babe, briefly her fiance, where she was offered and had to decline a new stage musical, Sunny, opening that autumn: “The trouble lay in my right side where muscles had been cut or damaged during the last operation.” But by December, back in London, she was dancing again. Within a couple of years she was on Broadway, taking the lead in what was meant to be a smash hit, Polly, opposite future Hitchcock star Cary Grant (then still billed as Archie Leach). By then she was free of Babe, and after Polly flopped June entered into what she herself characterised as a Rebecca-esque marriage to an aristocrat, one Lord Inverclyde, who kept her out of showbusiness. After their divorce, she returned to the West End limelight, but never made a film as significant as The Lodger. Might things have been different if Hitchcock hadn’t almost killed her?

Perhaps she was remembering the gentle advice from her closest adviser, Charles Powell, immediately after her third election triumph in 1987, suggesting that after two further years in office it would be wise for her to resign willingly. “There comes a point when your reputation and standing as an historic figure are more important to your party to your cause and to the country than even yourself can be,” he wrote, suggesting it would then be time for her to contribute in some other way.  Thatcher, of course, ignored him, instead granting an interview in which she said she intended “to go on and on”, only to be defenestrated by a party with an accumulated resentment of her divisiveness. Geoffrey Howe, the former cabinet minister who wielded the knife in the Commons, was later to explain: “The insistence on the undivided sovereignty of her own opinion – dressed up as the nation’s sovereignty – was her undoing.” In her memoirs she understood the source of her defeat, reflecting: “a prime minister who knows his or her cabinet has withheld its support is fatally weakened”. For Boris Johnson, facing the biggest test of his term in office, there will be a similar reluctance to give way. His brief tenure contains a legacy of sorts, the negotiated departure of the UK from the EU, but not so long ago his advisers were briefing the Times he intended to stay in office for 10 years. He is probably assured the cabinet, many of them uninspired placemen and women, will not yet move upon him, even though he will be watching every move of Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Rishi Sunak, his chancellor. His concern will be the court of public opinion, its impact on the parliamentary party, and the real threat that either Sue Gray, the ethics adviser, or the police will do for him. Prime ministers have had the Metropolitan police on their case before. Tony Blair famously was pursued by the Met over allegations that peerages were offered to party donors who were asked to disguise donations as loans, and therefore not declared. The loans, it was alleged, might be turned into donations if a peerage was granted. In his autobiography Blair recalled: “From the day the story broke to the day I left it was a running sore.” The file was closed soon after he left office and Blair said the 18 months had been “an absolute hell” for all those involved. Blair became convinced that Gordon Brown had used the scandal internally to push him out, something Blair had already agreed to do in principle. Many, including some Downing Street staff, were arrested, and Blair was interviewed three times, twice in office, but not arrested or interviewed under caution. It was the first time a prime minister had helped the police with their inquiries. Channel 4 later reported the police had on one of the occasions sought to interview him under caution, and Blair declined, saying to do so would require him to resign as prime minister. The police reconsidered. Eventually the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case because there was no evidence of an explicit agreement that the cash would lead to an honour. The Downing Street gathering on 15 May 2020 took place under the rules of England's first coronavirus lockdown.  Two days earlier, an amendment to Covid regulations had come into force allowing the first between-household contact since lockdown began. However, this was limited to two people, who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 metres.  The rules were less specific about social gatherings at work. Very few workplaces were open, and when this was the case, staff were urged to keep as distanced as possible.  No 10 staff were allowed to be at their office, as national government staff were classified as key workers. However, a key objective set out in the guidelines for workplaces that remained open was to “maintain 2-metre social distancing wherever possible”. In-person meetings should only take place if “absolutely necessary”, they said, and if that was the case, a 2-metre distance should be kept at all times. The Johnson and Blair cases – potentially breaking the lockdown laws and the 1925 Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act – are of course very different, and carry very different penalties. Although cash for honours is reprehensible, and a feature of a corrupted political system, the offence perhaps does not have the same public resonance as a breach of the lockdown rules, since those rules applied to everyone. It is the reek of hypocrisy, the betrayal of an assumed sense of national shared sacrifice, that is so dangerous to Johnson. The day after the party, 24 hours after the last empty cans were being cleared from the Downing Street garden, Johnson stood on the steps of No 10 to applaud NHS workers. But there is one other parallel between the Blair and Johnson case. In both there was a sense that stories were being fed by internal party sources as a political rivalry. In his short time in office Johnson has managed to offend some knowledgable and merciless people. His efforts to show he is prime ministerial material – always an uphill task – are not made easier by the leaks. It is possible he will survive – some politicians such as Michael Heseltine adored crises, and others such as John Major hated them. Johnson, who likes to be loved, seems uncomfortable confronting his mistakes. Tory MPs will now have to decide whether the Johnson prime ministership has made a discreet but recoverable error of judgment, or is instead incapable of functioning effectively owing to personality defects – the verdict passed on three recent holders of the office, Brown, Major, and Theresa May, politicians whose reputations have improved out of Downing Street. The fear is less that Johnson is accident prone, or weak, but fundamentally dishonest, utterly lacking what Blair once described as an “irreducible core”. Huw Merriman, the Tory MP, urged his colleagues to see Johnson “in the round”. The worry for Johnson is that too many MPs have indeed looked at that larger picture – and seen something irredeemable.",News/Politics,Can Boris Johnson survive partygate?

1/12/2022,"Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain, is warning that it expects cost inflation for the hospitality sector to reach between 7% and 8% over the coming months. Higher labour costs, rising energy bills and increased construction costs for its new hotels are putting pressure on the FTSE 100 company, according to Whitbread’s chief executive, Alison Brittain.  The group said it expected to offset these increased costs through charging higher rates for rooms in its 800 Premier Inn hotels, as well as through cost efficiencies and by growing its estate. The company, which also owns restaurant chains including Beefeater, Bar + Block, and Brewers Fayre, said higher levels of inflation would affect about £1.4bn of its cost base until April 2023. Brittain said the company had brought in a 5% staff pay rise in the last quarter of 2021, in order to retain workers and attract new ones amid a squeeze on hospitality staff. She said she anticipated increasing wages again in the spring for its staff who are paid hourly rates. “That [labour costs] is quite a large part of inflation for us, so are energy bills which are highly inflationary,” Brittain said. “Construction costs are higher, and so that impacts our building of hotels where we are not contracted, where we are looking at new hotel builds.” Whitbread said that demand at its hotels and restaurants was dampened in December and during the festive period by fears over the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. The company’s food and beverage sales were 17.2% lower in the six weeks to 6 January than during the same period in 2019, as consumers stayed at home and many Christmas parties were cancelled. In recent weeks, governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also introduced more restrictions on consumers eating out and drinking inside hospitality venues. However, Whitbread said accommodation sales at its UK Premier Inn hotels over the past six weeks were 5.1% higher than during the same period in 2019. Before the news of the Omicron variant affected consumer behaviour, Whitbread had benefited from consumers taking domestic holidays, as like-for-like accommodation sales grew by 5.5% in the three months to the end of November compared with 2019. However, this contrasted with food and drink sales, which slid by 13.4% during the period, leading Brittain to describe the “value pub and restaurant sector” it operates in as “more challenging”. Anticipated slower trading in January and February combined with supply chain disruption have caused Whitbread to delay £20m of spending on marketing and refurbishment of its venues.",News/Business,Whitbread plans to offset rising costs with higher Premier Inn room rates,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/whitbread-plans-to-offset-rising-costs-with-higher-premier-inn-room-rates
1/12/2022,"Benefits must be increased by twice as much as planned this year if the poorest households in Britain are to be supported through the cost of living crisis, a leading economics thinktank has said. Warning the government that its current plans were not fit for purpose amid the worsening squeeze on families, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said an additional £3bn needed pumping into the welfare system in response to soaring energy bills and mounting inflationary pressure.  Instead of a planned 3.1% increase in the value of benefits, it said payments needed to rise by about 6% to protect the poorest in society from high inflation hurting their finances. Boris Johnson is under growing pressure from his own MPs to act on the rising cost of living amid warnings that failure would push many more people into fuel poverty and severely undermine the government’s promise to level up poorer areas. The prime minister and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have faced calls from cabinet members and backbench Conservatives to cancel the planned 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance from April and ditch VAT on energy bills. The IFS said the planned tax rise and high inflation meant average take-home pay in Britain was likely to fall this year, with the poorest in society finding it hardest to tide themselves over. Industry leaders have warned gas and electricity bills are expected to rise by more than 50% from April when Ofgem, the energy regulator, lifts its price cap to account for soaring costs on the wholesale market. Benefits are due to rise from April by 3.1%, in line with September’s inflation rate as part of the government’s annual uprating process. However, the Bank of England has said inflation could peak close to 6% in the same month. The IFS said this meant the poorest in society faced a 3% cut in their real benefit levels and living standards this year, even before taking account of the £20 reduction in universal credit imposed by the government in October. Robert Joyce, the deputy director of the IFS, said: “We have become used to an era of low and stable inflation. But the way in which we increase benefits each April is not fit for the period of high and rising inflation we now face.” He said given acute pressure on households it would be preferable to raise benefits by the actual inflation rate in April. If that was 6%, it would cost an additional £3bn, or £4.5bn if the state pension was also included. “This need not be a permanent increase. Future uprating can be adjusted once inflation has fallen back,” he said. Raising benefits by 6% this year would mean preventing a £290 real fall in benefit income year on year for the 10m households in receipt of state support, the IFS said. The IFS said increasing benefits could be preferential to other options for helping households with the cost of living squeeze because it was already targeted at the poorest in society. The thinktank estimated that overall energy bills were likely to rise by £14bn this year, meaning compensation for households broadly across the population would prove very expensive or only extremely partial. It said abolishing VAT on domestic fuel – a policy called for by Labour and backbench Tories – would be less preferable because there were environmental downsides and would only reimburse households for less than one fifth of the increase in energy costs.",News/Business,"Benefits must rise to twice as much as planned to ease cost of living crisis, says IFS",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/benefits-rise-cost-of-living-crisis-ifs-institute-for-fiscal-studies
