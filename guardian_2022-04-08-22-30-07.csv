4/8/2022,"It’s easy to imagine the look of horror on the faces of Hollywood’s VFX artists when Chris Pine said recently that he felt the Star Trek movies are spending too much money trying to imitate Marvel. No more spectacular set-pieces in the depths of space or on opulent alien planets. No more giant special-effects budgets and lucrative months planning how to bring enormous Federation space stations and Klingon warbirds to the big screen in glorious ultra HD. Instead, Pine (who is back as Captain James T Kirk in a forthcoming fourth Star Trek film in the new rebooted timeline) seemed to be imagining a return to the low-budget vision of the future seen in the original series – or at least, one that doesn’t cost serious megabucks.“I’ve always thought that Star Trek should operate in the zone that is smaller,” Pine told Deadline. “You know, it’s not a Marvel appeal. It’s like, let’s make the movie for the people that love this group of people, that love this story, that love Star Trek. Let’s make it for them and then, if people want to come to the party, great. But make it for a price and make it, so that if it makes a half-billion dollars, that’s really good.”Pine added: “But we operate in a system now which I don’t know how much longer we have if you have to spend $500m on a film to reach … even you have to pay all sorts of people back. So to make a billion, it’s like you haven’t even … brought your net in. So I mean, if I had my business suit on, that’s what I would do, but I don’t know where that is. That’s all above my pay grade.”It is certainly true that Star Trek did not get where it is today by spending vast budgets on elevated special effects. The original series that ran on TV between 1966 and 1969 was known for its cheap-as-chips vision of the 23rd century, so much so that the iPad-like hand-held devices used by the crew of the Starship Enterprise were reputedly based on a children’s toy called the Magic Slate, with a few lights added to make them look kosher.Such cost-saving shortcuts would be difficult to pull off in modern Hollywood – cheap effects can give a movie a bad name before the opening credits have even rolled. But Pine is right to suggest that the key to success in 2022 is not necessarily just to do everything Marvel does. The Disney-owned superhero saga’s essential formula – huge, expensive fantasy spectacle and plenty of well-written jocularity – has often proved disastrous when other franchises have tried to borrow it.The DC “extended universe” never quite recovered after parachuting The Avengers’ Joss Whedon in from its rival studio after Zack Snyder stepped back from 2017’s Justice League, while some Star Wars fans hated the same year’s The Last Jedi for apparently lampooning The Force, its more po-faced adherents, and the saga’s storied past. It’s hard to tell if Tom Cruise-led monster picture The Mummy, which came out around the same time, was going for Marve-style action comedy, because the entire movie is such a diabolical mess. But it wouldn’t be surprising to discover that somebody involved (probably Cruise, who reportedly had contractual control of everything) thought plumping for throwaway quips and a breezy, irreverent vibe was a great way to adapt a classic monster tale that’s as creepy and gothic as they come. There have been great science-fiction movies made relatively recently that neither cost the planet Vulcan to make, nor tore such a hole in the thematic architecture for hardcore fans. Whedon’s own Serenity, perhaps the closest thing to Star Wars ever to reach the big screen before JJ Abrams’ Star Trek films, cost just $39m (albeit in 2005). Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 was budgeted at $30m four years later, while Gareth Edwards’ Monsters cost a miraculous $500,000 in 2010. These things can be done.Moreover, Star Trek’s hardcore fans have been crying out for a more cerebral big-screen vision of the saga as a paean to Apollo-era optimism and moral rectitude. The crash, bang, wallop of the brazen, big-budget Abrams-produced movies has not always gone down so well.There is a training exercise in the Star Trek mythos known as the Kobayashi Maru. It’s an unwinnable scenario, designed to test Starfleet recruits’ stamina and ability to maintain calm against impossible odds (naturally Pine’s cocky Kirk defeated it in his first big-screen outing by reprogramming the entire system without his superiors’ knowledge).Looking at Star Trek’s box office travails over the past few years, despite generally strong reviews, you would think Paramount was facing its own insuperable challenge. The truth couldn’t be more different than a Romulan and a Tribble: this is a saga that, three episodes in, is far from doomed. But if Pine is right and a simple tweak to the next movie’s budget helps bring the series up to warp speed, the studio might want to at least consider continuing its mission to boldly go where no man has gone before … but on a lower budget.",Arts/Film,Showing some enterprise: Star Trek must avoid the Marvel money-trap,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/08/star-trek-must-avoid-the-marvel-money-trap

4/8/2022,"There may be two kinds of bookcase owners: those who own more books than they can accommodate, cramming tomes into every crevice – and those who dot their shelves with artfully placed stacks, and have space to burn on potted plants and framed photos. And then there’s Ashley Tisdale, whose bookshelves are just empty. The High School Musical star recently went viral for admitting to Architectural Digest that she had rushed to fill the in-built shelves in her Hollywood Hills home specifically for an on-camera tour. “These bookshelves, I have to be honest, actually did not have books in [them] a couple of days ago,” Tisdale said. “I had my husband go to a bookstore, like, ‘You need to get 400 books.’” (Her husband’s alternative plan, of “collecting books over time, and putting them in the shelves”, Tisdale promptly dismissed.) A Twitter pile-on naturally ensued. “I am speechless,” declared the tweeter who first circulated the clip. But it turns out the bookshelf bulk-buy is standard practice among the rich and famous – and increasingly so, since books have become established as an erudite backdrop for Zoom. According to MailOnline, Adele spent more than £1,000 in a spree at Daunt Books before the pandemic, “pulling books off the shelves without even looking at the spines or reading the blurbs”. At least Adele bought them herself, points out Miles de Lange, an interior designer at the Alexander Lamont + Miles showroom at the Design Centre in Chelsea. He says interior designers are often charged with supplying books for clients. “They are props, just like you buy a little objet.” But filling shelves with desirable coffee-table books can cost as much as £5,000 – which clients rarely want to spend, says De Lange. “They’ll give you £1,000, and you can buy 20, but it’s not enough to fill a wall.” The compromise is often a stack of two or three books, with a vase or knick-knack on top. If you do have the budget to splash around on books you won’t read, there are dedicated bookshelf curators such as Thatcher Wine, whom Gwyneth Paltrow hired on finding herself some 600 books short after a home renovation. Wine’s company Juniper Books sells sets of classic literature with custom jackets – a patented approach, he explains, that allows someone to own “the complete works of Jane Austen, but in a certain Pantone chip colour that matches the rest of the room”. Juniper Books and its Colorado “showroom” may seem like the ultimate celebrity foible, but since the pandemic some bookshops have started offering shelf curation services. Publishers, too, accept that many do judge books by their covers. Penguin’s Clothbound Classics series of titles like Ulysses and Emma with Instagram-friendly covers has been hugely successful, with a box set spotted on the Duchess of Cambridge’s desk; a small-format range of 48 titles is coming in August. Bea Carvalho, head of fiction at Waterstones, says books with strong design tend to get shared on social media, driving sales: “Having beautiful images to show off is so important … Sprayed edges go down very well on BookTok and Instagram.” It has encouraged the industry to innovate. Waterstones’ special edition of Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus – out Tuesday, and tipped as the book of the summer – has exclusive endpapers, displaying the periodic table. It is a fantastic novel, adds Carvalho, but the design does it justice: “If you love a book, you want to display it proudly.” It is for that reason, Karen Howes of interior design studio Taylor Howes says, designers with a book-buying brief tend to stick to non-fiction, not novels. She tends to “dress the bookcase” with titles relating to her clients’ interests such as wine or aviation – “so that when their friends come it does feel like they have selected all their books themselves”. Novels are where you would get caught out, Howes says: “‘Have you read the latest so-and-so?’ – and you haven’t.” The rise of working from home has allowed for exposure on an even greater scale. The Twitter account @BookcaseCredibility, followed by more than 115,000 people, collates screenshots of celebrities’ bookish backdrops, arguing: “What you say is not as important as the bookcase behind you.” In a video interview with Vogue from her LA home, Adele’s shelves were recently revealed to bear titles such as The Mosaics of Rome and Japanese Prints. “There are some good ones up there,” she said as the camera panned across. Likewise, a close study of Tisdale’s shelves reveals celebrity biographies, reference books, cookbooks and titles on fashion, psychology, wealth generation and self-help – her taste for fiction seeming to extend only to a novel by Ken Follett. Tisdale was at least good-humoured about the criticism she received, sharing her favourite book recommendations (and asking for more) in a post to her lifestyle website Frenshe. She apologised for being slow to respond: “I’ve recently just got a lot of new books to get through.” At least she can see the shelf as half-full.",Arts/Books,Shelf-promotion: the art of furnishing rooms with books you haven’t read,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/08/shelf-promotion-the-art-of-furnishing-rooms-with-books-you-havent-read
4/8/2022,"The French election is straying from the script. It was meant to be a predictable remake. It has turned into a thriller. It could end up as a horror story. A month ago, Emmanuel Macron seemed certain to be the first French president to win a second term in 20 years. After Russia invaded Ukraine, his poll ratings soared. He built a 12-point lead in a probable second-round match-up with the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, and a 15-point lead over all other candidates in the first round. But with that first round taking place on Sunday, Macron’s lead has all but evaporated. In the most recent polls, he only has a two- to five-point advantage over Le Pen in round one, and a two- to eight-point lead over her in the two-candidate runoff on 24 April. Most French political analysts believe Macron will still prevail. Le Pen has magically evaded, so far, any reckoning for her long years as a Vladimir Putin sympathiser. In the second round of French elections, the presidential credentials of candidates are put to a greater stress test than in the multicandidate first round. Le Pen’s economic programme is an incoherent mess. Her European policy is Frexit by stealth – unilaterally reducing payments to the EU budget and breaking EU laws she does not like. She also wants to ban all Muslim women from wearing veils in public – not just the burqa, which was outlawed in 2010. She plans to discriminate against foreigners, including EU nationals, with regards to eligibility for benefits. France is an angry country. It is always an angry country. It is especially angry at present because the Ukraine war has inflated already high petrol, diesel and food prices. But there is no real appetite in France for confrontational policies that would destroy an 80-year postwar political consensus of outward-looking tolerance and European unity. So Le Pen cannot win. Can she? Probably not. And yet the opinion polls suggest that if enough leftwing voters stay at home in the second round, refusing to choose between Macron (“the president of the rich”) and a seemingly “kinder, gentler” Le Pen, then she could win. Just. After covering every French presidential election since 1986 and elections in five other countries, I can think of no parallel for such a late collapse in the position of the presumed favourite. What on earth has happened? Macron’s support has not, in truth, collapsed. It is now averaging 27% – three points higher than it has been for most of the past year. When the Ukraine war began it rose briefly to 31%, as people from the softer left and softer right rallied to the flag and the centrist president. Equally, there has been no dramatic surge in support for the far right. Le Pen’s ultranationalist rival Eric Zemmour has been destroyed electorally by his own years of Putin fellow-travelling. Le Pen’s meteoric rise in the first-round polls mirrors Zemmour’s decline since the Ukraine invasion. In mid-February, they were both on about 16%. She is now on 22-24%, with Zemmour slumped at 8-10%. It is one of the great oddities of the campaign that Zemmour has paid dearly for his Putin idolatry but Le Pen – an even more enthusiastic Moscowteer – has not. Zemmour’s extremism on race and Islam allowed Le Pen to present herself as a mainstream politician close to ordinary people. She spotted early the opportunities provided by low wages and high prices. Since the Ukraine invasion, she has reaped electoral benefits by connecting Russian sanctions – of which she disapproves – to the cost of living. The shift in second-round opinion polls is also not quite so dramatic as it seems – but potentially more significant. Macron’s average runoff lead over Le Pen in the past six months has been 12 points, 56%-44%. Several polls now put them within two to four points. Politico’s Poll of Polls, which was a very accurate guide in 2017, gives Macron a six-point lead at 53%-47% (but falling). There are two main reasons why the projected score is so much closer than when Macron beat Le Pen 66%-34%. First, many more leftwingers say they will stay at home this time. Second, Macron is no longer an upstart, revolutionary-in-a-suit; he is the incumbent. It is an iron rule of French politics that sitting presidents are detested. The 2017 election second round was a plebiscite against the far right; this one could become a plebiscite against Macron. Does Macron deserve to be so detested? No, he doesn’t. He has made many mistakes. He has sometimes seemed arrogant or aloof. He has failed to construct a convincing narrative of success, during his term of office and during a campaign he entered late, distracted by the Ukraine war. When he did finally start campaigning, he took what now looks like an electorally brave (or foolish) decision to propose an increase in the standard French retirement age from 62 to 65. And yet Macron has much to boast about. He has reduced French unemployment to 7.4%, the lowest for 13 years. France weathered Covid better than many other comparable countries, thanks to huge state support for individuals and businesses. His ideas and energy have revived the European Union as a thinking force in global politics, not an immobile, inward-looking bloc. He can still win the election.

4/8/2022,"When Andrew Sheldon first started travelling from Leeds to London to pitch ideas for new television shows, even getting in the door was a challenge for his Leeds-based television production company. “You’d get to London and get to the front desk and be told: ‘Sorry can you come back next week,’” recalled the founder of True North productions. Even when he did get inside, one senior television executive was notorious for welcoming the visitors from Yorkshire as exotic creatures: “You’d go and see them and they’d say: ‘How are things in the north’ and wave their arm across the sky. It was a bit like being in Game of Thrones.” In theory Channel 4’s recent arrival in Leeds should change that. Rather than having to head to the capital to win television commissions, Yorkshire companies such as True North – and smaller start-ups – should be able to build up relationships with commissioners in the same way that their London rivals have long enjoyed. Which is why Yorkshire’s television production companies are baffled the government is risking its own rare levelling up success by privatising the channel, just as the regional work starts to take off. They fear that any private-sector owner of Channel 4 is unlikely to want to keep an expensive office in Leeds or take risks on small start-up companies. “TV in Yorkshire has become a thing again – it’s that hard-to-quantify confidence,” said Pete Brandon. He returned home from London three years ago to co-found Button Down productions. The company, based in a wooden medieval building overlooking York Minster, has benefited from Channel 4’s regional commissions schemes and is hoping to win commissions from the broadcaster. It currently employs five full-time staff and has been considering expansion but the uncertainty caused by Channel 4’s potential privatisation is causing them to think twice. “Would there still be an appetite from whoever owns Channel 4 to commission small regional indies like ourselves, or would all the commissions just go to [global television production giant] Endemol?” asks Brandon. He fears a lengthy parliamentary debate over privatising Channel 4 will leave his business in limbo: “Is it going to turn into TV’s version of Brexit and waste so much time and nothing actually happens?” Veterans of Yorkshire’s television production scene talk about two lost decades of television production in the county, after ITV’s retreat from regional programming in the early 2000s destroyed the career pathways that used to exist and left little more than Emmerdale behind. And while they don’t doubt Channel 4’s current commitment to the region is sincere, many point out that this is a recent development. Channel 4 fought hard against government plans in 2015 to relocate the entire business to Birmingham, and even with the opening of the Leeds office the majority of staff and key decision makers, including the entire top executive team, are remaining in London. There’s praise for the government’s pressure on Channel 4 to boost its regional presence – and bafflement at why ministers want to risk that. Caroline Cooper Charles, the boss of regional group Screen Yorkshire, says the media industry in the region wants the business in public hands: “If a commercial owner was to decide to withdraw that regional presence, that would be very significant for the indie community – many of whom are only just starting to reap the benefits.” Ministers have suggested than some of the £1bn it hopes to raise by selling Channel 4 will be put into regional training programmes for the television industry – but Sheldon says he just wants Channel 4 to spend more on regional programming. “What [the government] is saying is we’ll sell Channel 4 to raise some money to let you do the things you’re already doing. There’s no logic. It’s telly eating itself,” he said. In February Channel 4 put forward its own counter-proposals to government, which would see it seeking private investment while remaining in public ownership. A leaked copy of the document shows the broadcaster’s bosses want to have a commitment to regional output built into its legal mandate, with a pledge to move 300 more jobs out of the capital, rapidly expand the Leeds office, and reduce office space in London. Instead Sheldon has one more proposal that the government should take advantage of its ownership of the channel to push it to be more radical: “One of the things I’ve tried to advocate is that it would have been a brilliant thing to move Channel 4 out of London altogether and put it in Leeds – that would be entirely possible.”",News/Media,‘No logic’: Yorkshire’s TV industry baffled by Channel 4 privatisation,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/08/no-logic-yorkshires-tv-industry-baffled-by-channel-4-privatisation
4/8/2022,"Trans women are no longer able to compete in elite female events run by British Cycling after the organisation performed a significant U-turn and suspended its transgender policy. The Guardian understands that the decision was taken by British Cycling’s board of directors after numerous members – and voices within the sport – raised concerns that trans women such as Emily Bridges, who broke the national junior 25-mile record as a male before transitioning, would have an unfair advantage in the female category. British Cycling also acknowleged there were “concerns” that its transgender policy – which was only ratified in January – did not match the guidance from the Sports Council Equality Group (SCEG), which was based on an 18-month review of the science. However Bridges’s mother, Sandy Sullivan, quickly expressed her frustration, tweeting: “Dumped by email. We’ve just received this in our inbox. We will be making a statement at some point during the next 24 hrs.” Under British Cycling’s previous policy, trans women were allowed to compete if they reduced their testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L for a 12-month period. However, the emergence of Bridges, who began hormone therapy last year as part of her gender dysphoria treatment, and raced in men’s events until February, has led to a hasty rethink. The 21-year-old was due to compete in her first race in the female category at the British National Omnium Championships last Saturday, before cycling’s governing body, the UCI, blocked her as she was still registered as a male athlete for international competitions. The UCI’s decision came as cis women in the event considered a boycott in protest at Bridges’s advantages. However until Friday she was still able to compete in domestic events, before British Cycling suspended its transgender policy, pending a review. In a statement, the governing body said: “Due to the difference in the policies held by British Cycling and the UCI relating to the licensing process, it is currently possible for trans-female athletes to gain eligibility to race domestically while their cases remain pending with the UCI (or indeed in situations where they are deemed ineligible). “This in turn allows those riders to accrue domestic ranking points which impact selection decisions for National Championship races, which is not only unprecedented in our sport, but is also unfair on all women riders and poses a challenge to the integrity of racing. We also understand that there are concerns regarding the extent to which our current policy appropriately reflects the Sports Council Equality Group guidance, published in September 2021.” That SCEG guidance concluded that “testosterone suppression is unlikely to guarantee fairness between transgender women and natal females in gender-affected sports”. It also states that there are “retained differences in strength, stamina and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth”. Earlier this week British Cycling’s head of Olympic programmes, Sara Symington, co-signed a letter to the UCI criticising its current policy on transgender inclusion. The letter signatories claimed the UCI’s current rules do not guarantee female athletes fair and meaningful competition. The prime minister Boris Johnson also intervened in the debate, saying that he didn’t believe “biological men should be competing in female sport events”. In a statement British Cycling said it would conduct a full review of its policy “in the coming weeks”. It confirmed that transgender and non-binary athletes could still take part in non-competitive activities.",Sport/Sport,British Cycling U-turn freezes trans women out of elite female events,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/british-cycling-u-turn-freezes-trans-women-out-of-elite-female-events
4/8/2022,"As I write this in late March, the sun is blazing outside, but by mid-April, who knows? That said, Easter is late enough this year for us at least to feel that it’s spring and therefore eat and drink accordingly. So, crisp dry whites and summery rosés are definitely on the cards, and you could lighten up reds a notch, too. If there’s a time of the year that prosecco really shines, it’s Easter. Being slightly sweeter than most sparkling wines, especially (perversely) the “extra-dry” category, it goes particularly well with a colomba di Pasqua, the dove-shaped Easter version of panettone, as well as with simnel cake and, of course, Easter eggs. Personally, I prefer a rosé prosecco, especially the rather smart one I’ve recommended below, which you’ll love if you’re a Provence rosé fan, but even the cheaper ones generally have more character than basic prosecco, thanks to the fruity pinot noir that is typically added to them. And, as opposed to Christmas, when you deviate from tradition at your peril, Easter is a bit more relaxed, so you can afford to be more adventurous, particularly when there’s real value to be had. Hungarian furmint, for example, is a dry white wine that should be on your radar. It’s the same grape variety that produces the country’s famous sweet wine tokaji, and is one of those massively useful dry whites that seems to go with everything, and certainly with those perennial Easter favourites, chicken and salmon. Austria’s grüner veltliner is another to look out for, and Aldi has a particularly good one in its Specially Selected range (12.5%) for £6.99 that’s well worth snapping up. Pinot noir is the most versatile spring red, and there’s a lot around at the moment, especially from more unusual sources such as Argentina. Again, Aldi has a bargain at £6.99 and also the cracking Pinot Vigilante that I’ve been trying to write about for a couple of months and which is finally now in stock (I mentioned it a few weeks back, so apologies if you’ve been frustrated). At £10.99, it’s expensive for Aldi, but not for New Zealand’s Central Otago. I’d drink that with chicken, ham or duck, or anything mushroomy. If you fancy a bigger, bolder red, rioja has evolved in style over the past few years, and many wines are being released significantly younger, resulting in brighter fruit, as shown by the Barón de Barbón below. At the same time, just the name “rioja” will be reassuring to older relatives you may have round your table, so it’s a bit of a winner all round. The Emissary Prosecco Rosé 2020 £14.99 theemissary.co.uk, 11%. More expensive than standard prosecco, but really well made, with delicate, Provence rosé-style fruit. Pajzos Tokaji Furmint 2019 £7.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%. Appealingly smooth, dry, Hungarian white that you’ll like if you’re a gavi fan. Goes with (practically) everything, including a mild curry. Specially Selected Argentinian Pinot Noir 2021 £6.99 Aldi (in store only), 12.5%. Argentina isn’t as well known as Chile for its pinot noir, but this is really good, with clean, bright fruit and it has a freshness that inexpensive Chilean pinot often lacks. Try with roast chicken or duck. Barón de Barbón Oak-Aged Rioja 2020 £11.99 (or £10.49 on a mixed-case deal) Laithwaites, 14%. A young, vibrant rioja that has lots in common with a malbec, but should still keep traditionalists happy. One for the Easter lamb or even a barbecue. Domaine Equis Crozes Hermitage “Equinoxe” Rouge 2020 £17.95 Yapp Brothers, 12.5%. Classic, spicy, northern Rhône syrah that would be lovely with lamb or roast duck.

4/8/2022,"If the idea of a musical about grief sounds unlikely, it can only be because we have a limited idea of what that emotion should look like. The grief in Peter Mullan’s 1998 movie Orphans is not of the maudlin, greetings-card kind. Rather, it is raw, dangerous and off-kilter. So it is in this National Theatre of Scotland staging, directed by Cora Bissett and scripted by Douglas Maxwell with songs by Roddy Hart and Tommy Reilly. It amplifies Mullan’s emotional states into the raucous, the ribald and the plaintive. Set on a dark and stormy Glasgow night, Orphans is about four siblings from a working-class Catholic family who are about to bury their mother. Each embodies a different facet of grief. Robert Florence as elder brother Thomas becomes neurotically protective of the dead woman’s memory, his anguish so profound it seems to rip the roof off the church. Reuben Joseph as Michael turns inward, reflecting on his damaged relationship with his ex-wife as he heads out for a bloody night of self-destruction. Dylan Wood as youngest brother John turns angry, displacing his sense of loss into a thirst for revenge and gun-toting violence. Amy Conachan’s Sheila appears the most balanced, but she too races with a reckless abandon to fill the void left by the central figure in her life. The chaos of the night, with its fights, funfairs and feuds, stands as a metaphor for the family’s inner turmoil. And even though it begins with a coffin and ends with a grave, the emotional extremes put a halt to sentimentality. They also make for a buoyant show. Staged on a set of towering sandstone tenements by Emily James, Bissett’s production makes as much of the wider community – from the chorus of boozy drinkers to a trio of sharp-talking paper girls – as it does of the central players. Faithful to the big-screen original, Maxwell’s script is characteristically funny while respecting Mullan’s dark edges. It’s a shame not to have live musicians, but the songs do well to carry the story forward, while cheerfully revelling in the Glasgow vernacular (not all of it is radio friendly). It adds up to a cathartic reckoning with mortality. Perhaps even good grief. At SEC Armadillo, Glasgow, until 9 April. Then touring until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,"Orphans review – buoyant musical about death, grief and boozing",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/08/orphans-sec-armadillo-glasgow-review-peter-mullan
4/8/2022,"My favourite kind of fashion isn’t the kind that gets itself on the front page. Not the omelette dresses, or the maternity negligees. Praise be to Queen RiRi for both of those, but the fashion moments that get me really hot under the collar are in the small print. The blink-and-you’d-miss-it changes in the fashion weather, when the style winds shift direction, and something suddenly looks chic. I’m talking about, for instance, the first time I saw someone knot the belt of their trenchcoat instead of threading it through the buckle and realised that this was the key to making a trench look more Paris Vogue and less French policeman. Or when I clocked that by shoulder-robing your coat, rather than putting your arms into the sleeves, you could instantly elevate your entrance to any social situation to quite extraordinarily dramatic effect – a bit like the free-styling-trick version of arriving in a private jet. Or when Phoebe Philo at Celine did the hair-tucked-inside-the-polo neck thing. Or when the penny finally dropped that all the cool people had stopped wearing invisible trainer socks with their trainers and started wearing thick white sport socks instead (I think this happened about two years ago actually, but I have only just noticed). This is my stone-cold-favourite kind of fashion. The correct amount to fold your trouser cuff in any given season. To button your shirt to the top or leave two buttons undone? To tuck your shirt in or to leave it loose? To carry your handbag across your body, hook the strap over the crook of your elbow, or tuck it under your arm? This is my jam. This, my friends, is the juicy stuff. This is where you can roll your sleeves up (or not, depending on the season) and get stuck in. This kind of fashion got lost for a bit. After the height of the pandemic, fashion split into two camps. There was the anti-fashion, anything-with-a-fleece-lining crew, and the roaring 20s brigade. The choice seemed stark: reject dressing up altogether or gorge on feathers and frills, like an Easter egg hunt after Lent. Truth be told, none of us gets to choose between turning the clock back to the old normal and taking a great leap forward into a Zen new way of life. We all have to muddle along in whatever the new normal is. From a fashion point of view this is good news, because this is where the meat of the story happens.So, let’s hear it for wearing mid-blue jeans again – not indigo, not washed out, but solid May-skies blue. Let’s dig out an ordinary, inch-thick plain leather belt and start wearing it with slightly oversized trousers, a white shirt and cat’s eye sunglasses – like the influencers do. Let’s experiment with a knee-high boot under a below-the-knee skirt, because that combination is going to be everywhere come autumn, mark my words, so we may as well get a jump on it before the weather gets much warmer. Or leaning into a chunky loafer, if you haven’t already done so. Perhaps you could experiment with a short-ish skirt and a long-ish blazer, which is the new suit-adjacent tailoring look in town. None of this is headline-making stuff, but fashion doesn’t have to be. The best kind doesn’t even look like fashion, really: just clothes that look modern. No drama, no jeopardy, no plot twists. Fashion for a world that just keeps rolling smoothly on. Which sounds like a must-have to me. Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Bumble & Bumble and Stila. Shirt: Monki. Trousers: Maje.

4/8/2022,"I am a divorced woman in my 50s and for the past four years I have been in a long-distance relationship with a kind and considerate man. He runs his own business and visits me for extended periods; we spent most of 2020 together at my house. He is helpful with chores, and was very supportive of me through an intense work-from-home period. Material wealth is not a priority for me. Having a good income myself, I don’t need to consider my partner’s income. I earn significantly more than him and I have always been clear that my main priorities are building a pension and supporting my children, who are now at university. I pay most of the costs for us visiting each other, and other trips. I have also helped when he has had cashflow problems. Recently I’ve found myself more reluctant to do this, and get irritated when he asks for help. I’m at the point where I think this relationship may not be viable in the longer term. My parents’ relationship was a traditional working man/stay-at-home wife. Is my current discontent a reflection of that? Am I unconsciously harbouring a desire for a “patriarchal” male role in the relationship? To be clear, this is not on the scale of ‘The Tinder swindler’ but it would be nice if he occasionally stepped up to meet the costs for shared activities or reworked his business to avoid cashflow crises. His business will probably never bring in that much money, and his relaxed approach is precisely what enables us to spend more time together. I just find myself wishing he earned more. In a way it doesn’t matter why it’s happening, but something in your relationship is making you unhappy. It’s really important to take note of these feelings instead of reasoning them away. Is your partner aware of how you feel? The patterns we observed growing up do tend to inform us – we either copy them or we try to do things differently, but I wonder if your “current discontent” is less about wanting your partner to earn more, and more about making you feel more looked after? And maybe that does involve money for you. Money might mean very different things to each of you, but it can also be a sign of who takes responsibility and who doesn’t, because someone who habitually doesn’t pay their share or doesn’t bother with bills often doesn’t take responsibility for themselves, either. You talk a lot about money, but say material wealth doesn’t matter to you. I wonder if it stands in for something beyond safety, security or freedom? If you could tap into what this is, it may help you work out whether this is fixable or not. Your partner may feel he looks after you in different ways. Psychotherapist Alivia Rose wondered if this was less “about money than you mothering your partner and then resenting it. Do you feel you’re not worthy of an equal relationship?” Rose also wondered if you were “afraid to set boundaries in case he’ll leave you. We only really confront people we feel safe with. You have money now, but what if you got ill or couldn’t work – would he equally support you through those difficult financial times?” I think you need to have an honest conversation. Paying constantly for someone else is exhausting and can end up making you feel used. Be brave, give him the chance to know how you feel and give him the chance to fix it.

4/8/2022,"A portrait of the actor, singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson painted in 1930 by the British artist Glyn Philpot has been rediscovered through painstaking research, after it was sold nearly 80 years ago under the title Head of a Negro. The painting, one of a number of Philpot’s portrayals of people of colour, will go on public display in Chichester, West Sussex, from 14 May, in the first exhibition of the artist’s work for almost 40 years. Philpot’s portrait depicts Robeson playing Othello at the Savoy in London in 1930, the first time in a century that a black actor had been cast in the title role of Shakespeare’s tragedy, and a milestone in theatre history. In 1833, Ira Aldridge had been racially abused while appearing in London as the Moor of Venice. Robeson’s co-star, Peggy Ashcroft, who played Desdemona, was repeatedly asked by interviewers whether she minded being kissed by “a coloured man”. Her response was robust. “Of course I do not mind. I see no difference in being kissed by Paul Robeson and being kissed by any other man,” she told the Daily Sketch in May 1930. Although the production received mixed reviews, Robeson’s performance was acclaimed, with the audience demanding repeated curtain calls. Philpot took his niece to see the play and then invited Robeson and his wife to dinner. The biography of Philpot, a successful society portrait painter who was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 23, notes that Robeson sat for him but the painting was long thought to be lost. Simon Martin, director of Chichester’s Pallant House Gallery, which is holding the exhibition of Philpot’s work, set about tracking it down. Trawling through images in archives and auction databases, he matched a portrait with a photograph of Robeson in costume as Othello. Philpot’s family had sold the painting in 1944, several years after the artist’s death, under the anachronistic title Head of a Negro. Subsequently sold again and now in a private collection, the painting was tracked down with the help of Christie’s auction house. “It was an exciting discovery,” said Martin. “I had a hunch this painting was Robeson, but I had to match it with press photographs of him playing Othello, and then trace the work.” The portrait has “a nobility about it”, he added. Othello was “the defining role of Robeson’s career – a seminal performance in theatre history. Philpot obviously recognised that it needed to be recorded.” As well as acting, Robeson – the son of a runaway slave, who was born 124 years ago on 9 April – was an athlete, lawyer, singer and political activist. He starred on Broadway and stages around the world, and his bass-baritone voice made him a recording star. He spoke out against fascism, colonialism and racism. During the McCarthy era of the 1950s, his US passport was revoked and 85 planned concerts cancelled. Robeson was brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee and asked to identify members of the Communist party and to admit to his own membership. Invoking the fifth amendment, Robeson told the committee: “You are the non-patriots, and you are the un-Americans, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.” Philpot’s subjects included the poet Siegfried Sassoon and prime minister Stanley Baldwin, along with ballet dancers, opera singers and actors. Unusually in the first few decades of the 20th century, he also created sensitive portrayals of people of colour. They included a Jamaican man, Henry Thomas, who was the subject of a number of portraits in the 1930s; the African-American tenor Roland Hayes; a Martinican cabaret performer known as Tom Whiskey, and an African American boxer named Joe.

4/8/2022,"The number of Covid-19 infections remains near or at record levels in most of the UK, with only Scotland seeing a drop, new figures from the Office for National Statistics have revealed. The ONS data for the week ending 2 April, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, shows that, for the second week running, about 1 in 13 people across the UK are thought to have had Covid – an estimated 4.88m infections. However, the picture varied between countries. In England, the number of infections for the week remained steady, with an estimated 7.6% or 1 in 13 people in the community thought to have had Covid. Meanwhile, in Wales, the estimated rate was up from one in 14 people to one in 13. In Scotland, 396,800 people – about one in 13, down from one in 12 the previous week – were estimated to have had the virus. Within England, infections rose in the north of the country and the east Midlands, but fell in the south-east. In other parts of the country, including London, the trend was unclear, although levels remained highest in the south-west, where almost 9% of the population were thought to have had Covid. Variation by age was also seen, with infection levels rising among those between school year 12 and those aged 34, while 7.1% of those aged 70 and over were thought to have had Covid in the week, the highest level yet for that age group. However, infections fell among younger children and among those between the ages of 35 and 49, with the trend unclear among other age groups. Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, said there were early signs in the latest data that infections may no longer be increasing in some parts of the UK. “Across English regions, there is a mixed picture in trends and we have seen a welcome decrease in Scotland. However, rates in Wales continue to rise and the trend in Northern Ireland is uncertain,” she said. “It is too early to say if infections have peaked in England and Scotland. We will continue to monitor the data closely.”",News/World news,"Covid infections remain around record levels in most of UK, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/covid-infections-uk-office-national-statistics-coronavirus
4/8/2022,"Global food prices rose to their highest ever levels in March as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UN has reported. Cooking oils, cereals and meats hit all-time highs and meant food commodities cost a third more than the same time last year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’s monthly food price index published on Friday. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted Black Sea exports of crucial commodities from a region that had been producing more than a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. The war has helped push cereal prices up 17% over the past month with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from Ukraine. Russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems. World wheat prices soared by 19.7% during March, while maize prices posted a 19.1% month-on-month increase, hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum. The FAO said these problems were likely to persist, leading to higher prices, lower stocks and uncertainty in the wheat market in the future. “The higher price quotations are particularly concerning for countries already struggling with other crisis, including conflict, natural disasters, economic conditions or, as it is often the case, some combinations of those,” said an FAO spokesperson, adding that countries with low incomes and food shortages may struggle to pay higher prices. “[Price] increases are the most noticeable in the countries where the share in disposable income spent on food is the highest. In these cases, the most vulnerable are likely to skip meals, purchase less nutritious foods, or use other coping strategies, which will have longer term effects on their health and wellbeing.” Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, said before the invasion, prices were already near record highs because of limited global supplies. “Projected stock levels were already low relative to recent years, which means that there are few supplies available to buffer the impacts of reduced exports coming from the Black Sea,” he said. IFPRI estimates that Ukraine and Russia accounted for 12% of calories traded in the world. Glauber said the volatility in food prices was being felt everywhere. Countries that were particularly reliant on wheat from Russia and Ukraine may have to switch to the EU, US, Australia, Canada and Argentina for wheat supplies. “Many of these countries are in north Africa and the Middle East where wheat often accounts for as much as 35% of total calories consumed and a majority of the wheat is imported, much from the Black Sea,” he said. The Black Sea region has also been a crucial source for sunflower oil and the limiting of exports has meant vegetable oil prices rising by almost a quarter since February. Prices also rose for palm, soy and rapeseed oils because of increased demand. Earlier this week, the World Food Programme said the effect of blocked exports would hit several countries in east Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan – countries already experiencing severe drought and conflict. WFP said the price of local foods had risen a quarter, on average, compared with last year but had been as high as 92% in Sudan. It also warned that eastern African countries are fully dependent on imports for fertiliser, for which Ukraine and Russia are also a key source, and that disruption could impact local production and push food prices even further up.",News/Global development,Global food prices rise to highest ever levels after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/08/global-food-prices-rise-to-highest-ever-levels-after-russian-invasion-ukraine-wheat
4/8/2022,"Adebilitating week for Treasury-based luxury casualwear influencer Rishi Sunak. He used to seem invincible; now he’s the pocket Samson who’s just taken a massive haircut courtesy of his wife. I know Rishi wants to be prime minister and stuff, but it’s increasingly difficult to imagine how the mega-rich chancellor would persuade ordinary British people to do difficult things. Mate – you can’t even persuade your own wife to pay you tax. But before I get accused of being a sexist by … hang on, let me get my lorgnette … James Cleverly, we’d better have a recap of developing events, which now include a possible US green card controversy. Initially believed to be watching his political oxidisation on Pacific time, the chancellor is in fact on these shores. I hear Lynton Crosby has banned Easter getaways, meaning Sunak will have to unwind in one of his houses in this country, as opposed to the high-end Santa Monica apartment he owns in a complex that includes a pet spa. Anyway, he has granted a hotly defensive exclusive interview to the Sun, which runs under the apoplectic banner LAY OFF MY MISSUS. And I think you’ll agree that headline truly captures the way Rishi Sunak speaks. This, quite simply, is a guy who is as at-home screaming a warning out of a van window as he is indulging in a desultory browse of Mr Porter’s fine knits, his cursor hovering briefly over a £495 smoke-blue James Perse cashmere hoodie before the window is closed in listless pique. There are some injustices even a knitwear purchase can’t alleviate. Even so, I think the headline could have been punchier. I’d have gone with PAY TAX? IN THIS ECONOMY?! As for the meat of the interview, I hugely enjoyed the implication that the £30,000 annual flat fee required for Akshata Murty to retain her non-dom status is the typical foreign national experience in this country. As Rishi explains of Murty’s completely legal arrangements: “That is how the system works for people like her who are international who have moved here.” (Great to hear that at least one part of any of the UK system works. “The system works” is really not a phrase you’re hearing a lot right now.) Very enjoyable, too, to read the furious commentary about Murty on MailOnline and in the Daily Mail, whose proprietor Lord Rothermere inherited his own non-dom status from his father. Again: the system works. And listen, what’s not to love about this latest episode of Sunak’s fish-out-of-water comedy? Recent outings have seen the rarefied protagonist’s hilarious interactions with the ordinary world. The one where he goes to the petrol station and fills up someone else’s car, then tries to scan his card on the barcode reader. The one where he fails to do anything meaningful in his mini-budget to alleviate the cost of living crisis for the poorest households, then promptly gives an interview in which he trills: “We all have different breads in my house.” The one where he scans the popular press and comes up with the perfect person to self-pityingly compare himself to in a manner that in no way caused his spads to kick a hole in the wall. As Sunak explained: “Both Will Smith and me, having our wives attacked …” Come on! It’s a funny show! Moving on to the villain trying to sabotage him, their precise identity remains a mystery. Where are all the mean stories about Sunak coming from? Not quite sure we need to activate Nancy Drew on this puzzle – Sunak’s naked manoeuvring, coupled with his vanishing act every time an unfavourable partygate story broke for Boris Johnson, suggests at least the dim possibility that his aggressor may be known to him. My own fan theory, however, is that this is a show where Sunak plays both protagonist and antagonist. Or to put it another way, he is his own worst enemy. The current stories are not a “smear”, as he claims, but the totally predictable consequence of his family’s financial arrangements, which he should have seen coming a mile off. It may be perfectly legal, but it is obviously – obviously! – a giant piss-take if the chancellor’s own wife has non-dom status. Apologies for returning to an achingly familiar furrow for this column over the years, but it really doesn’t have to be this way. The Hong Kong tax code, often cited as the most efficient and avoidance-proof in the world, is around 350 pages. The ever-expanding UK tax code is the world’s longest, currently running to more than 22,000 pages, having increased vastly in size under both Labour and Conservative governments. Unsurprisingly, it amounts to a charter for myriad types of avoidance. Tell you who should do something about this, just like all his recent predecessors should have but didn’t: Rishi Sunak. Instead, he prefers to spend his days saying no to pleas to alleviate hardship, which seems to exist in a universe beyond his comprehension. Hard to pick a low point, but I’ll go with the time he turned down the request from the hugely respected educational recovery tsar Kevan Collins for £15bn in pandemic catch-up funding for children. Sunak would only fork out £1.4bn, which isn’t even twice what he spent buying people free burgers with “eat out to help out”. Collins resigned in despair. It emerged that an internal presentation had shown Sunak and others in Downing Street how failure to invest £15bn now in this failed generation of children would result in the state paying upwards of £160bn down the line in welfare and criminal justice. And still Sunak said no, presumably on the basis that that would all be someone else’s problem in the future. As David Cameron reportedly said to his aides before his post-referendum resignation: “Why should I do all the hard shit?” And why should Rishi Sunak do it either? Why shouldn’t his wife tick the box and keep paying her 30 grand a year to stay out of things? Why shouldn’t statements of fact be denounced as smears? All sorts of things are optional if ordinary people would only realise it. Let them eat different breads.
