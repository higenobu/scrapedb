3/27/2022,"The sun had barely risen the morning that the military turned up for Vijay*. Grabbing him from his home in a village in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka while his pregnant wife and baby lay asleep next to him, they blindfolded him and drove him deep into a jungle. For the next 12 hours, in a small dark shack away from prying eyes, they interrogated Vijay. Pliers were repeatedly brandished, with threats that his finger nails would be removed if he did not give the army officers the information they wanted. The accusation hurled at him over and over again was the same: that Vijay was part of a conspiracy to restart the militant Tamil separatist group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elan (LTTE), widely known as the Tamil Tigers, and was involved in training and recruitment. The military let Vijay go after two days of clandestine interrogation but it was only the beginning of his ordeal. On the third day, it was officers from Sri Lanka’s notorious Terrorism Investigation Department who turned up for him. This time, his arrest was official. Sri Lanka’s brutal and bloody ethnic conflict officially ended, after 26 years, on 20 May 2009. Yet Vijay’s arrest was in June 2020. Though it has been 13 years since the end of a war in which at least 100,000 people were killed and the LTTE was defeated by the Sri Lankan army, the roots of the conflict remain unresolved. The country is as segregated as ever, with the Sinhalese Buddhist-majority concentrated in the wealthy south and the Tamils in the less-developed and heavily militarised north and east of the country. In recent years some of the worst abuses that were rife in the years after the war, from white-van abductions, torture and sexual crimes against Tamils, have abated. What never disappeared was the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Since it was passed in 1979, the PTA has been a stain on Sri Lanka’s human rights record, enabling arbitrary arrest, detention without charge or evidence, forced confessions and torture of anyone suspected of terrorism. Vijay was detained for a year and a half under the PTA. He endured daily interrogations, in which he was accused of involvement in assassination attempts and asked to name Tamil Tiger accomplices, without any evidence being presented. On one occasion they brought out a confession written in Sinhala, the language of the Sinhalese majority, which Vijay, like many Tamils, does not speak. “They were making threats that they would shoot me if I did not sign it, holding the gun against my leg, so I signed it even though I don’t know what it said,” he said. “I didn’t think I would survive otherwise.” As a young Tamil man growing up in the north of Sri Lanka where civil war waged between the Tamil Tigers and the state until he was aged 10, he was no stranger to harassment and violence at the hands of the armed forces. His elder brother, then a separatist militant, had been abducted by the army years before, and friends had died and disappeared. But that was over a decade ago. “They say the war is over but they are still doing what they have always done to Tamils: abducting us, torturing us, taking our land and using PTA to imprison us on no evidence. Tell me what has changed?” said Vijay, who was finally released in February. Repeating an oft-heard refrain in the Tamil north, he added: “We are still living in an open prison.” A 2020 report by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka found that 84% of PTA prisoners were tortured after arrest and they are regularly held for between five and 10 years without trial. The European parliament recently declared that the act “breaches human rights, democracy and the rule of law”. Previous hopes for the law’s repeal disappeared in late 2019, when Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a fierce Sinhalese nationalist who was in charge of the military in the final, bloodiest years of the civil war and has been accused over overseeing war crimes, was elected as president. “The abuses of PTA, the surveillance never went away,” said Ambika Satkunanathan, the former human rights commissioner of Sri Lanka. “But since 2019 when Rajapaksa came back to power, it’s just become more overt, more brazen. Every week, I can give you a minimum of one or two incidents related to the PTA being used to harass and intimidate civil society organisations and journalists.” Over the past two years, human rights organisations and the UN have reported an escalation of the harassment, surveillance and arbitrary detentions of Tamils, journalists and civil rights activists, and a “colonisation” policy, involving the systematic seizure of Tamil land by the government and military. In the aftermath of the deadly Easter suicide attacks carried out in churches and hotels by Islamist militants in April 2019, Muslims, too, have become targets of the state. In November 2021, Police Scotland suspended their programme training Sri Lankan police officers over human rights concerns. The Rajapaksa government, faced with mounting international pressure and the prospect of losing a multi-million dollar trade concession with the European Union, has denied all abuses of the PTA. The country’s foreign minister recently told the UN Human Rights Council that “we endeavour to strike a just balance between human rights and national security when dealing with terrorism”. In a bid to appease international critics, the Rajapaksa government last week passed a bill amending the PTA. But UN experts, human rights groups and the political opposition were damning of the amendments that left “intact some of the most egregious provisions of the PTA” and called into question Rajapaksa’s real commitment to reform. “What is needed is a complete scrapping of the PTA and not cosmetic changes,” an opposition MP, Anura Dissanayake, told parliament. In Jaffna, the capital of the Tamil-majority Northern Province, the fear was pronounced. Komahan Murugaia, who was detained and tortured under the PTA between 2009 and 2016 and now runs an organisation in Jaffna to help the families of those imprisoned under the law, said that “under the present government the situation for Tamils is getting much worse,” with more than 100 arrested under the legislation, accused of regrouping the Tamil Tigers. “It’s not as bad as 2009 when the war ended but there’s torture, and harassment, our right to freedom of speech is reduced, more arrests are happening, more surveillance,” said Murugaia. “My passport has been blocked and I have been summoned in for a police inquiry for participating in a memorial. There is a lot of fear.” This month the wives and children of several Tamil men detained under the act since 2020 stood in protest outside a government office. As rain poured down, ink wept from damp signs pleading “Please release my father”. Kamalaharan Easwary, 37, said her husband had been held under the PTA for 18 months, accused of trying to recreate the LTTE, but had not been charged. “There is no evidence. How can they do this? “ she said. “Without him we have no income. Life is so difficult. This law is being used to repress the Tamils even after the war is long over, and it is radicalising people, pushing them back to war again.” Muslims, too, have increasingly been subjected to sweeping arbitrary arrests under the PTA in the wake of the Easter 2019 bombings. More than 500 Muslims arrested under the act in the aftermath have languished in jail for more than 34 months without charge, including two maulvis – Islamic religious leaders – who have alleged to the courts they were tortured and beaten with pistols. One of the most prominent arrests was Hejaaz Hizbullah, a Muslim human rights lawyer from Colombo, who had been outspoken against actions taken by the Rajapaksa government. Arrested under the PTA in April 2020 on what human rights groups described as “no credible evidence”, Hizbullah was held in jail for more than 22 months without charge as security agencies sought to prove an unsubstantiated theory that he had “aided and abetted” the Easter attacks. In the end, none could be found, and after international pressure, including Amnesty International designating him a “prisoner of conscience”, he was released on bail in February, though he still faces charges of radicalising children through a charity. Hizbullah’s wife Maram confirmed that the harassment began in late 2019 when Hizbullah and his relatives started receiving warning messages and strange calls warning him to “be careful, keep quiet and stop all his human rights work”. His sister and father were called in for questioning by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and then one of his clients was told to drop him as their lawyer because he was on a “hit list”. In his first interview since his release, Hizbullah spoke cautiously, still fearful of repercussions for his ongoing case. “I have worked on many PTA cases as a lawyer but my own case was the worst I had ever seen,” said Hizbullah, who missed the birth of his child while he was detained. “From the beginning my lawyers were clear that there was no evidence to detain me but the CID were looking for something really big to pin on me. The officers kept telling me my life was over. Now we know for sure, after all those months of pain, they could find nothing.” “The key objective,” he added, “was to silence me forever.” * Vijay’s name has been changed",News/World news,"Tamils fear prison and torture in Sri Lanka, 13 years after civil war ended",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/tamils-fear-prison-and-torture-in-sri-lanka-13-years-after-civil-war-ended
3/27/2022,"The 10 largest providers of children’s social care placements made more than £300m in profits last year, according to research that will fuel concerns over profiteering by private providers. As pressure mounts within government, regulators, councils and fosterers over the provision of care for the country’s most vulnerable children, analysis seen by the Observer reveals the growing role of private equity companies in many of the biggest suppliers of care home and fostering places. Profits among the top 20 providers of care home and fostering places now amount to 20% of their income. Despite the pandemic last year, their overall profits rose by more than 14% from 2020, according to the study commissioned by the Local Government Association (LGA). The findings follow a series of warnings that marketisation of children’s social care is leading to some damaging outcomes. Several figures within the sector have reported children being placed far from their support networks where homes could be built more cheaply, or placed with families who lack the skills to provide the right care. It comes months after a highly critical Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warned that the UK had “sleepwalked” into a dysfunctional market for children’s social care, with councils struggling to pay for expensive places that often failed to meet the needs of the child. An official review of children’s social care in England has been commissioned by the government and will report later this spring. There are hopes that the review will back reforms in England as a result of a growing consensus around the issues within the current system. Councils have reported that spending on residential placements has increased by 84% since 2015, and that they are now diverting funds from areas such as early help for families to meet the spiralling costs. The LGA’s analysis, compiled by Revolution Consulting, found that eight of the 10 largest providers of children’s social care, which includes fostering, children’s homes and other services such as residential school places, now have some kind of private equity involvement. Total income of the largest 20 was more than £1.6bn, with 60% made by the largest four providers – Outcomes First, CareTech, Polaris and Priory, now called Aspris. It also confirms many of the concerns over the level of debt taken on by some of the groups, which many council figures believe is making child social care provision even more precarious. Nine of the top 20 providers had more debts and liabilities than tangible assets. “What matters most for children who can’t live at home is that they feel they are safe, loved and supported, in homes that best suit their need,” said Lucy Nethsingha, deputy chair of the LGA’s children and young people board. “While many providers work hard to make sure this is the case, it is wrong that some providers are making excessive profit from providing these homes when money should be spent on children. “Despite increasing their children’s social care budgets, most councils are overspending each year as costs continue to soar. Yet the largest privately-run companies, which provide many residential and fostering homes for children, continue to bring in huge profits. At the same time, many carry significant levels of debt. “Stability for children in care is paramount if we are to help them to thrive. It is therefore vital that there is oversight of the financial health of these providers to help catch providers before they fall, and ensure company changes don’t risk the quality of provision.” Outcomes First, CareTech, Polaris and Aspris, were all asked for comment, but either declined to do so or did not respond. Some recent cases have brought home some of the long-running issues in children’s care. In January, Ofsted inspectors suspended the licence of one children’s home in Bolton after finding that a boy had not bathed, changed his clothes or been provided with a home-cooked meal for four months.",News/Society,Revealed: top 10 children’s care providers made £300m profits,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/26/revealed-top-10-childrens-care-providers-made-300m-profits
3/27/2022,"Joe Biden was asked twice in a press conference on Thursday if Nato would respond with military action were Russia were to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, a fear raised repeatedly over the past few weeks by the US, UK and others. Russia is one of 193 countries that have signed an international treaty banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons – and Moscow denies having or using such weapons. However, Russian agents used a deadly nerve agent, novichok, in Salisbury in 2018, killing a woman. It was used again by agents to poison the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in August 2020. Investigative journalists believe Russia retains a covert chemical weapons programme, while its ally, Syria, is accused of repeatedly using a range of chemical weapons during the long-running civil war there. Western leaders have become concerned that Russia’s failure to achieve a quick victory in Ukraine means it could consider escalating the weapons it uses to avoid bloody urban warfare, which favours the defenders. Helicopters dropping chlorine gas in residential areas of Aleppo in November and December 2016 led to the end of rebel resistance in the Syrian city after four years of fighting. “These weapons are morbidly effective and can break the will of civilians to resist,” said the chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon. “We would respond,” Biden said in his first answer. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.” The second answer was less clearly expressed. “It would trigger a response in kind. Whether or not – you’re asking whether Nato would cross – we’d make that decision at the time.” It was clear from the context that a “response in kind” was intended to mean it would be a considered reaction to what was deemed to have taken place. Military action was by no means certain – although Biden was careful not to rule it out either. Biden’s answer was clearly conditional on what any attack would look like. De Bretton-Gordon argues there are two possible types of Russian attack: a chlorine or ammonia attack, which the Kremlin would could try to dress up as an industrial accident, and the use of chemical weapons specifically designed to kill such as sarin, which was used in Syria in 2017, or novichok. “In the first instance, I am not sure there would be a kinetic [military] response from Nato – allies would more likely want to supply Ukraine with more and better weaponry and extra intelligence if they can. But if Russia used agents only designed for use in warfare, Nato would likely have to respond militarily as they did in Syria,” said de Bretton-Gordon, also a former commander of Nato’s chemical weapons force. The US engaged in two sets of strikes in Syria. Missile strikes took place in April 2017, after the sarin gas attack. Air and missile attacks followed year later in April 2018, with the help of France and the UK, after a chlorine gas was used in Damascus. Each time what were described as Syrian chemical weapons sites were targeted. But any attack by Nato forces, or a subset of western countries, would be very unlikely to attack chemical sites in Russia directly for fear of starting a general war, which Nato members agree they want to avoid. The reality of Russia’s ability to strike back against the west may well make a military response impossible. Potentially, although nobody knows what Russia’s red lines are. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a direct appeal at Thursday’s Nato summit for more higher specification arms, fighter jets, tanks, rocket artillery and air defence systems. Western nations could step up military aid. A second option would be to tighten economic sanctions further, using the illegality of chemical weapons as justification. Options would include sanctions against other Russian banks and a full ban by the EU and the UK on oil and gas imports, although that would be, for some countries, an economically difficult decision to take. Western leaders say they want to preserve “a bit of ambiguity” in any response, as the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on Thursday. But the reality is that serious discussions will only take place after any chemical weapons attack.",News/World news,Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine and how would west respond?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/could-russia-use-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-and-how-would-west-respond
3/27/2022,"One thing at least we know about Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine: it isn’t going according to plan. Ah, yes, you reply, but which plan? Was it plan A, which simply said that you assemble enough conscripts and heavy artillery, roll into Ukraine, shell a few apartment blocks, amble across to Kyiv and have a victory parade? What we call the George W Bush model (except that he had his Iraq victory parade on the flight deck of an American aircraft carrier). If this was plan A, then we know what plan B is. It’s to do to Ukraine what was done to the statelet of Chechnya in 1999, namely bomb it to rubble regardless of civilian casualties. Apart from its intrinsic inhumanity, trying to implement this plan in Ukraine faces some practical difficulties: Ukraine is vast whereas Chechnya is small, and Ukraine has a serious army, a feisty capability for resistance and a plentiful supply of serious weaponry from its friends in the west. So if Putin wants a primer before embarking on the next stage of his imperial adventure, he should perhaps download Charlie Wilson’s War, an instructive film about what happened to the USSR in Afghanistan all those years ago. For those who follow these things professionally, the biggest puzzle is why Putin embarked on a campaign that looks like the second world war in Technicolor, when his military actually had an ultra-sophisticated plan for warfare in a digital age. It’s called the Gerasimov doctrine and it was the creation in 2013 of Valery Gerasimov, a smart lad who is chief of the general staff and first deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation. At the heart of this doctrine is the concept of “nonlinear warfare”, the goal of which is to “achieve the desired strategic and geopolitical results, using a wide toolbox of non-military methods and means: explicit and covert diplomacy, economic pressure, winning the sympathy of the local population, etc”. Molly McKew, an expert on information warfare, describes it as “a new theory of modern warfare – one that looks more like hacking an enemy’s society than attacking it head on”. At one point, McKew quotes a passage from Gerasimov’s original paper. “The very ‘rules of war’ have changed,” he wrote. “The role of non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness… All this is supplemented by military means of a concealed character.” The doctrine called for a 4:1 ratio of non-military to military actions. Watching what’s going on in Ukraine, one wonders if Putin ever read the Gerasimov paper. At any rate, the ratio of information to kinetic warfare currently being practised there looks more like 1:20. What is clear, though, is that Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his colleagues did read Gerasimov and prepared accordingly. As a result, they were relatively well prepared for the cyber onslaught that preceded the invasion. Security experts, some of whom may have been seconded from friendly states, went through critical systems looking for malware such as WhisperGate and HermeticWiper and removing them. It’s not known how effective these measures were overall, but one critical result was that the systems controlling Ukrainian railway operations were decontaminated, which meant that trains enabling millions of Ukrainians to escape continued to run. In recent decades, belief in the west about Russian mastery of electronic warfare has reached near-mythical levels. This inferiority complex may actually have its roots in the fact that democracies rely (foolishly) on the capacity of private companies to pay serious attention to cybersecurity – and their governments know that. To a serious hacker, an advanced western economy presents a large and largely defenceless “attack surface”, as the jargon puts it. But at the same time, one useful byproduct of the invasion might be deflation of the myth of Russian invincibility. It became clear very early on that the invaders’ command and control systems weren’t working. As one specialist website put it: “Only three weeks after hostilities began, the internet was already filled with photos of cheap Chinese civilian walkie-talkies that the Russian military was forced to use instead of professional equipment, intercepts of conversations of Russian officers who had to call each other on regular phones and testimonies of prisoners who tell how they could not call for reinforcements or find the right way due to lack of communication with the outside world.” In the absence of operational, secure army communications, many Russians succumbed to the temptation to use ordinary phones. They would simply take out Ukrainian sim cards and call Russia, allowing the Ukrainian military not only to easily intercept the conversations, but also to determine the location of the caller. On 16 March, US military sources were quoted saying that many Russian generals talk on unsecured phones and radios and that in at least one case Ukrainians had geolocated a call and killed him in an attack at his location. Ironically, his name was Vitaly Gerasimov. We do not know if he was related to the author of the military doctrine that his president seems to have ignored.

The eight numbers, originally show songs or jazz tunes dating from the early 1930s to the late 50s, touch on a variety of styles – swing, bebop, ballad and even boogie-woogie, each treated in such a way as to make it glow with new life. The album comes with proper notes, by my fellow jazz writer Brian Priestley, himself a pianist, who explains in some detail what makes Bryson’s playing so beautifully apt at every turn.

3/27/2022,"Håkan Samuelsson was a relatively late convert to electric cars. He took over as boss of Volvo in 2012, but it was only three or four years later that he realised he needed to oversee the biggest shift in the company’s history: ending the use of fossil fuels. Since then, Volvo has committed to making no more petrol or diesel cars after 2030. That will be the fastest phase-out of any traditional carmaker of equivalent size, and Volvo has put sustainability at the heart of its branding. Samuelsson was persuaded by “absolute engineering type of logic”, he tells the Observer via video call from a sparsely furnished office in Volvo’s Gothenburg headquarters. Batteries are the most efficient way to transform sun or wind energy into power to turn the wheels of a car. But it was Tesla Age 71 Family Two adult children. Education Studied mechanical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, which was “very fancy”. Pay £19.3m in 2020. Last holiday To his home north of Barcelona in Spain. Best advice he’s been given “Don’t have this career planning; do something you really like doing, because then you will do it well.” Biggest career mistake “That list would be so long, it would take a whole section of your newspaper,” he says, before highlighting two: not being “diplomatic” enough when making a bid for Scania when he was leading Man Trucks; and not realising earlier that electric carmakers would need their own supplies of batteries. Word he overuses “Goes without saying – I use that often and maybe it is not so obvious for other people.” How he relaxes Reading history and economics books, including Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations recently, doing DIY at home, and going to the dump. founder Elon Musk, automotive disrupter par excellence, who really piled on the pressure. “You have to admit that Tesla inspired us all, by showing that, wow, this can be done in a premium car,” Samuelsson says. “The guys in California put the spotlight on electrification, and there were people saying it would not work and they would go bankrupt. But gradually, it came up, ‘no, this works’, and you tested those cars and there’s nothing wrong with them. They really are better than a combustion car: silent, and with super acceleration.” It would, he adds, be “stupid to try to resist” the push to all-electric. And as Volvo’s electric cars will be cheaper to make than petrol or diesel by 2025, there will be little reason for companies to make internal combustion engines after that. Setting Volvo on the route to electric, via a £13bn flotation on Stockholm’s stock exchange last October, has turned out to be the 71-year-old’s final move as CEO as he heads into a quasi-retirement that could have come a decade earlier. Samuelsson has taken a carmaker that in 2012 was selling about 400,000 cars a year and just about breaking even to record profits and revenues on sales just shy of 700,000 in 2021. One of his top priorities when joining was to take full control of the manufacturing platform for every car rather than relying on other carmakers – “no Ford Mondeos with another body”. He also ordered a design rethink to make Volvos “less boxy and boring”. Another key aim was a drive for stronger profitability. “If you work in a company losing money, it destroys the whole energy,” he says. “You need profits to boost morale. So I said, no, it has to be turned around quicker. So we have never lost any money.” Volvos may have become less boxy on his watch, but they also became bigger. The streets of many western cities – where off-road ability is hardly a must – are increasingly taken up by sports utility vehicles (SUVs) that hog space and use more fuel. In 2019, the International Energy Agency in 2019 found that SUVs were the second-biggest cause of rising global carbon emissions between 2010 and 2018. Samuelsson, whose English maintains a steady, unhurried rhythm throughout the conversation, does not skip a beat when asked about his part in this: “You need also to be profitable to have money for the investments,” he says. Customers have freely chosen to go for bigger cars, so that was the best way to afford the giant outlays needed to develop electric technology. The changes did not go entirely smoothly, however. In 2020, shortly before the pandemic hit, Samuelsson was tasked by Volvo’s Chinese owner, Geely, with drafting plans for a merger with Geely Automobile that would have created a global Chinese carmaker along with Britain’s Lotus Cars. A year later, Geely instead settled for its carmakers listing separately and sharing electric vehicle technology and software. Samuelsson says Geely owner Li Shufu, who also goes by Eric, “never micromanaged” or pressured Volvo to hit quarterly targets, but there is little doubt that Li’s influence was behind a push that saw annual Volvo sales in China rise from about 1,000 to 170,000 during his time there. He acknowledges that Li was a “door opener”. Samuelsson grew up south of Stockholm, son of a workshop manager, so it was perhaps not a surprise that he ended up studying mechanical engineering. He points out that in the 1970s, automotive manufacturing was the most glamorous industry going: “In those days, mechanical engineering was more or less what software or digital development is today. It was cars and motorcycles and carburettors. That was hi-tech.” A traineeship at Swedish lorrymaker Scania was the start of a lifetime in the automotive industry. He spent 20 years making lorries, including stints in Argentina and Brazil, before being headhunted to join German lorry and diesel engine maker MAN Group. (Samuelsson also sold off large parts of MAN’s sprawling conglomerate, including a declining business making newspaper printing presses.) Samuelsson has handed the Volvo reins to Jim Rowan, former chief executive of Britain’s Dyson, the vacuum cleaner maker which also had plans – now abandoned – to build an electric car. In the short term he is heading to Tel Aviv for some time off over the spring, but the plan is to continue to work in the industry, so his will not be a “sit down and play golf” retirement. (He may find time to renovate his vintage Volvo P1800 – the car driven by a pre-James Bond Roger Moore in The Saint, a spy series that aired during Samuelsson’s childhood.) One key task will be chairing the board of Polestar, the electric vehicle company started by Volvo. He is also in discussions about other board positions in the automotive field, but won’t be drawn further. Being chief executive of a major company comes with handsome rewards – Samuelsson was paid £19m in 2020 – but he is does not hesitate when asked about the costs of such a high-powered career. “You always lose something” he says. “I think you should see it more as having a job where you are passionate, and happy having it as a total hobby. When it comes to the personal costs of the job, he admits he “lost a lot of other things” and “probably also should have spent more time with my kids and family. They say that I was travelling a lot and they never saw me when they were small. You feel a bit bad hearing that. “I didn’t realise it when it happened, but I probably neglected a bit my family. But in life you cannot do everything. So, I don’t regret putting in so much time as a CEO. It was worth it still.”",News/Business,Håkan Samuelsson: outgoing Volvo boss and electric car pioneer,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/26/hakan-samuelsson-outgoing-volvo-boss-and-electric-car-pioneer
3/27/2022,"Before the war, Igor Mezencev loved to go into the forest with Ukraine’s best chefs, equipped with just four ingredients – salt, sugar, vinegar and oil – and try to cook high cuisine in the wild. Now, with his city, Kharkiv, under heavy bombardment, Mezencev is confined to his high-rise flat. But using whatever ingredients he can find, he has continued to cook and invent – baking bread from untoasted buckwheat groats, cooking on his balcony and revisiting childhood recipes. He says this has helped him to cope with the terror of the shelling and airstrikes. “Cooking helps my nervous system to regulate,” the 33-year-old said in his diary, which he has shared with the Observer. “But there is this constant pain at the back of my head. They say it happens during extreme stress.” Mezencev is now living alone with his ailing French bulldog, Yosik, after he and his girlfriend, Ania, decided that she should evacuate to the safer city of Lviv. Soon after war broke out, with shells exploding around them, he did an inventory of his stocks of grain, fish and meat and felt well prepared. The freezer was full, and he announced on Instagram that he was ready to start baking bread and cooking for people. “But then,” he writes, “disaster struck. One of the missiles hit the power station and our district was without electricity.” So he got out a camping stove he had used in the wild for Topot, his chef expedition project, and started cooking soup and coffee on the balcony in “a new way of living and survival”. When, on day six of the war, their supplies started running low, they took meat out of the freezer and started curing some of it with salt, and used the rest to make tushonka – similar to French confit. Traditionally in Kharkiv, people have barbecues under their windows in March, a “festive, greet-the-spring cook-out”. But this year, Mezencev said, instead of making traditional shashlik, people were using barbecues to heat tinned food, and water for washing. “It was so heart-breaking to watch this,” he writes. “It finally dawned on me: we live in a war zone.” In the following days, as soon as curfew ended at 6am, queues of as many as 1,000 people formed outside shops, and when the supermarket opened at 9am, it let in 10 people at a time. They then had to queue for another two hours to pay by card because cash machines are empty. After walking the 3km home carrying about 50kg of food, Ania and he saw more queues – for humanitarian aid – and split the supplies between them and their parents. When planes shelled the city centre and blew out the windows of Iskra Bar, where Mezencev worked, he realised he couldn’t go to work any more and needed to be able to help from home. Instead, he became a “sofa activist”. He started helping charity World Central Kitchen by connecting them with logistics companies and supermarkets. When he ran out of flour and yeast and it was almost impossible to get into a supermarket, he instead decided to make his own flour using untoasted buckwheat groats. “One of our local supermarkets sells a buckwheat baguette. But I reckon mine came out much better than theirs – I vowed to share my recipe with the supermarket once it was all over!” Now, he says, there is no more buckwheat but he has managed to get live yeast and make bread with wheat flour. On day 25, they decided Ania should leave for Lviv and he would stay with Yosik, who wouldn’t survive a 24-hour train journey. They drove through the shattered city to the station, where they saw “a thousand abandoned cars”. Then they said goodbye. “We hugged and started to cry,” he writes. “Again, unbearable. These things should not be possible. War is such evil.” Mezencev’s parents remain in Kharkiv with his brother, in a neighbourhood that he cannot get to, and Ania’s parents are near by. After Ania’s departure, he went back to their flat, where he hugged Yosik tightly as missiles banged in the background, and cooked food his mother has made since he was a child: borscht, boiled buckwheat, and stewed chicken with garlic. “We will have enough food and stocks of products for a month,” he told the Observer. After that, he hopes he will be able to go to work. “I am still a cook and I am still a dreamer. I am sure that soon we will win and become even better, stronger for sure,” he said.",News/World news,"‘It keeps me calm’, says Kharkiv chef cooking to cope with Ukraine war",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/it-keeps-me-calm-says-kharkiv-chef-cooking-to-cope-with-ukraine-war
3/27/2022,"The Black News Channel, a cable news station focused on serving Black viewers, ceased operations on Friday afternoon after its billionaire backer declined to provide more funding for the startup. Many of the news channel’s journalists left careers at established media organizations to join the start-up, in hopes of bringing news to a historically underserved audience. One of the station’s presenters, Marc Lamont Hill, told the Hollywood Reporter the station had “an incredible assignment” and would work to “fill the void” for neglected audiences at a relaunch one year ago. The channel ceased live operations on Friday afternoon after it failed to make payroll. About 230 employees were laid off, informed they would not receive severance pay and their health benefits would end in a week, the Los Angeles Times reported. The recently launched Black News Channel is shutting down (via @latimes) https://t.co/zu9Hgf0sVtMy heart goes out to the employees, many who left other well-established outlets to help build and launch BNC. —AM The channel also faced a gender discrimination lawsuit, after female employees claimed their male counterparts earned more money. “During the past few months, we have endured very painful workforce reductions at all levels of the network as we worked to achieve our financial goal of a break-even business,” Princell Hair, the station’s CEO, said in the memo, the Los Angeles Times reported. “This has forced all of you to do more with less, and your contributions have been remarkable. Unfortunately, due to challenging market conditions and global financial pressures, we have been unable to meet our financial goals, and the timeline afforded to us has run out.” I remember hearing plans for the Black News Channel at least 10 years ago, when I covered media for the Tampa Bay Times. Now, as the Tallahassee-based service is shutting down abruptly after 2 years on air, I hope staffers can get their rightful pay. https://t.co/csWK6HrTuW The station was initially funded in 2019 by the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team’s owner, Shahid Khan, who provided $50m in backing.

3/27/2022,"The show, it seems, must go on as Formula One once more contorts itself to ensure Saudi Arabia enjoys its day in the sun, missile attacks notwithstanding. The evidence of Friday’s explosion, less than 10 miles from the circuit in Jeddah, is still writ large. The pall of black smoke hangs across the city, a suitably indelible stain on the regime’s latest attempt at sportswashing. As things stand the race will go ahead on Sunday after Yemen’s Houthi rebels struck an oil facility with a missile. The harsh truth of the Saudi-led coalition’s war with the rebels burst F1’s bubble of belief that they operate in a vacuum where sport and politics simply do not mix. It is a transparent fiction laid bare every time they visit this state and others on the calendar. Saudi Arabia’s shortcomings – and that is a generous description – are well known. Human rights watch has documented the state’s “brutal crackdown on peaceful dissidents” since Mohammed bin-Salman was appointed crown prince. They cite the regular use of torture on detainees. Same-sex relations remain illegal, punishable by flogging or imprisonment. The state has made much play of how “progressive” it has been in allowing women the right to drive. However, HRW reports some prominent activists spent nearly three years in prison for peacefully protesting for that right. They remain under suspended sentences, banned from travel and prohibited from pursuing their human rights work. All of which F1 was more than aware when they first agreed to race in Saudi Arabia last year but they were reminded in no uncertain terms of exactly with whom they were dealing just days before arriving in the country. On 12 March, the state executed 81 men in a single day. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, reported the UN believed that of the 81 convicted of “terror offences”, 41 were from the Shia minority who had taken part in anti-government protests, calling for greater political participation. The human rights group, Reprieve, reports a further 16 people have been killed since that mass execution. Saudi Arabia talks of hosting the race with the hope of “changing perceptions”, in itself an admission of how badly it needs to reform its deservedly grotesque image. HRW has also reported that in its seven-year war in Yemen, Saudi Arabia has “a sordid record of unlawful attacks, targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in areas held by the Houthi armed group”. Let it be noted that F1 acted with unprecedented speed to cancel the Russian GP within hours of their invasion of Ukraine yet has not batted an eyelid to what is happening in Yemen. F1’s repeated refrain when called to answer such criticism is that they believe they can effect positive change in the countries they visit. Nelson Mandela held the opposite opinion in believing how important the sporting boycott was in helping end apartheid in South Africa. Worse still, there is no evidence any change ever occurs. Since the mass protests in Bahrain in 2011, F1 has raced on in the country and human rights groups insist the situation has worsened for everyone who speaks out against the regime and that imprisonment and torture has in fact increased. Should anyone be in any doubt as to what this means it was spelled out unequivocally on Friday by Felix Jakens of Amnesty International. “This weekend’s Grand Prix in Saudi Arabia is sportswashing – plain and simple,” he said. “Despite the promises of reform, human rights violations in Saudi are going from bad to worse. Dissent and free expression are now virtually non-existent. “Much of the world’s attention is currently focused on Ukraine, but the world of sport must not limit its conscience to one conflict. Saudi Arabia must not be allowed a free pass over its continued bombing of civilians in Yemen.” So why is F1 in Saudi Arabia? In 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic a day before the Australian GP was ultimately cancelled, Lewis Hamilton was the only driver to openly state he thought a mass gathering of more than 100,000 people was a bad idea. When asked why he thought F1 and the FIA were ploughing on with the race his answer was simple and scathingly accurate: “Cash is king” he said. F1’s 10-year deal to host the race in Saudi Arabia is worth a reported $900m, while the Saudi state-owned oil company, Aramco, is an F1 “global partner” in a contract worth a reported $450m, again over 10 years. With the deals done, last year then the FIA president Jean Todt and F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali were happy to be pictured with beaming grins on the grid with bin-Salman – the man US intelligence agencies identified as having approved the 2018 murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The real danger with sportwashing is that it normalises regimes over time. The fuss dies down as people come to accept the event but business as usual continues in the background. This is the deal F1 has done. In this brave new world the sport’s leadership is wolfing down petro-dollar-funded soma to blunt the reality that they are burying their heads in increasingly bloodstained sand.",Sport/Sport,Formula One bosses continue to bury their heads in increasingly bloodstained sand | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/formula-one-bosses-continue-to-bury-their-heads-in-increasingly-bloodstained-sand
