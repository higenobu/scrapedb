3/1/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s bloody invasion of Ukraine has sharpened two terrifying realisations. The first is that Putin does not function within the realm of the usual finely balanced checks and balances, sticks and carrots, that the west hoped would contain him and maintain an uneasy truce in Europe. The second is that decades of work since the second world war to learn from the mistakes of the past and fortify against them in the future have failed. Here again, we have not a civil war, but an invasion of a sovereign state in defiance of the rest of the world. Here again, we have images that are only known to us as historical reels, of frenzy and panic as thousands attempt to flee to safety. But there is a third realisation that appears to shape the perception of too many western journalists justifiably appalled at the defiling of Europe. From the tone of much coverage, this seems uniquely distressing and more alarming to them because the lives of non-Europeans have less value, and their conflicts are contained, far away from us. I thought it was just clumsy phrasing from a couple of reporters under pressure, but soon it became clear that it was, in fact, a media-wide tic. From Al Jazeera to CBS News, journalists were appalled that this was not happening in “Iraq or Afghanistan” but in a “relatively civilised European city”. One said: “The unthinkable has happened. This is not a developing, third world nation. This is Europe.” Another reflected: “These are prosperous middle-class people … these are not obviously refugees getting away from the Middle East. To put it bluntly, these are not refugees from Syria, these are refugees from Ukraine … They’re Christian, they’re white, they’re very similar.” Ukraine’s deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, told the BBC, unchallenged: “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed.” Daniel Hannan, Telegraph columnist, former MEP, Lord Hannan of Kingsclere; put it more bluntly, writing that those suffering in Ukraine “seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking. War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations. It can happen to anyone.” It is, he said: “civilisation in retreat”. This strange account of a history in which wars, conflict and dispossession mostly happened in “third world” and “remote” countries (remote from whom?) is a fiction that has come about as a result of a political and media climate that has stripped the humanity of those seeking refuge so completelyt it has become a fact, repeated with no self-awareness or shame. An extremely generous view of these statements is that it is not, in itself, an unusual impulse to care more about, or be affected more, by events happening closer to home than farther afield. Perhaps what these people are really trying to say is something along the lines of “this has not happened in this patch in generations” in order to highlight the abnormality of this particular conflict. There is that. But there is also much more to it. There is an acceptance that war is natural in other places, an aberration here. That war happens only to the poor and the uncivilised, not the well-off and stable. That the fates of refuge and uprootedness are the lot of others, and therefore less of an event. These are beliefs that fall apart under the slightest of scrutiny to reveal a worldview warped by what has been popular unchallenged discourse on refugees and asylum seekers for too long. These opinions were shaped, concertedly and over time, in order to justify inhumane and often violent policies passed to block people from entering European lands. For these policies to become accepted, their victims had to be portrayed as threatening and undeserving. The legacy of that is a western world hostile to all those in need, blue eyed or not. As ever, when we avert our eyes from the humanity of one group of people, we end up building immigration systems that assail the humanity of all. A border of policies as high as the heavens now meets Ukrainians seeking to enter the UK, even as family members. As the Ukrainian flag was projected on to Downing Street, the Home Office was hoisting up the drawbridge, posting on its website: “Ukrainian nationals in Ukraine (who aren’t immediate family members of British nationals normally living in Ukraine, or where the British national is living in the UK), are currently unable to make visa applications to visit, work, study or join family in the UK.” Even those visa applications that are allowed will have to navigate an obstacle course of paperwork in the middle of war. Exceptionalism means we are doomed to repeat the complacencies of the past, constantly comforting ourselves that it can’t happen here, because it only happens elsewhere to others whose pain is somehow different from ours. But their wars are no less unthinkable, their uprootedness no less traumatic, their civilisation no less valid, than the thousands now leaving Ukraine. And in designing a world in which we are sanguine about other people’s war, we have ensured that we cannot anticipate when war will happen on our doorstep – and that when it does, we are appalled, but then find our humanitarian response systems hobbled, calcified in cruelty.

3/1/2022,"Disney World has long been touted as a place where dreams come true, which in reality was only the case if your subconscious mind had been plagued by visions of queues, tourists, crying children, depressed teenagers in unwieldy costumes and elements of the natural world that have been badly rendered in fibreglass. But today that all changes. Because today Disney World officially opens its Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser resort. Billed as the ultimate immersive Star Wars experience, the Galactic Starcruiser (centred on its Halcyon hotel) is a top-to-tail recreation of a Star Wars spaceship. During a two-day stay, which costs around £4,500 for a family, guests will be plunged into their very own app-dictated storyline where they’ll be sent on missions, asked to sneak away to clandestine meetings, trained in the art of lightsaber combat and – if they’re lucky – be allowed out into a “climate simulator”, which reports suggest is the only part of the resort where you get to go outside. “Wait,” you’re thinking. “If this is a mock-up of a spaceship travelling through the darkest recesses of the galaxy, then does that mean that Disney spent millions upon millions of dollars making an incredibly expensive hotel that doesn’t actually have any windows in it?” The answer, obviously, is yes. The hotel rooms all have screens where the windows should be, showing a representation of the inky nothingness of space, but nothing you can crack open in a panic if the air conditioning goes down and the illusion falls away and your throat closes up as you realise that you’ve paid several months’ wages to spend two nights in an airless box. This, according to a report in SF Gate, was a dealbreaker for some of the resort’s early reviewers. The report from an influential Disney food YouTuber was that “Disney went all-in on an experience that seemingly puts only the wealthiest guests inside a windowless bunker for two full days”. To add insult to injury, others have complained that the rooms themselves – in keeping with what life is probably like onboard a spaceship – are smaller than expected, and uncomfortably cramped. But, in fairness, this probably doesn’t matter. By the time you read the phrase “ultimate immersive Star Wars experience”, you had already solidly made up your mind about Galactic Starcruiser. You are either in, or aggressively and permanently out. I have to put myself in the latter category here, which probably makes me a little biased. By all accounts, Galactic Starcruiser demands total participation of its guests. Dressing in costume is recommended (the official Galactic Starcruiser site will even sell you an official Padmé Amidala cloak for £110), and the best way to get the most out of your stay is to treat it like a non-stop 48-hour Secret Cinema event. I’ve been to Secret Cinema in the past, and I still shudder at the memory. It’s the sort of thing that requires you to suspend all disbelief in a state of unquestioning compliance, and even a hint of self-consciousness will blast the whole thing to smithereens. Given that red-hot self-consciousness is my default setting, the thought of spending two days in close proximity to people who have paid through the nose to dress up as space beings and have fun no matter what sounds like my idea of hell. There is only one scenario where I would ever visit Galactic Starcruiser, and that’s one where an editor has commissioned me at double my usual rate to write at length about what a horrible time I’m having. And, for any editors reading, I would totally do that. But I’m equally aware that some people will go absolutely bananas for Galactic Starcruiser. They will have been raised on Star Wars. They will have gladly embraced Disney’s dilution of the original trilogy. They will leap at the chance to be the star of their own Star Wars experience, no matter the cost. And for that reason, I couldn’t be happier that Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser exists. It gives these people a place to live out their wildest fantasies, and I get to rest easy knowing that they’re all 4,000 miles away from me. It’s a total win-win.",Arts/Film,The Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser hotel sounds like Secret Cinema in hell,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel
3/1/2022,"First-time screenwriter Ben Conway has put together an interesting Belfast crime thriller, which pans out in a single, unbroken 97-minute take in real time, about a drug dealer doing one last catastrophic deal. Stephen Fingleton, who made an impression with his own 2015 debut The Survivalist, directs it with some elan. Most of the film is a single, locked-off shot of a guy at the wheel of his car, talking tensely to people via a hands-free mobile while his life terrifyingly unravels. This owes quite a bit to Steven Knight’s lo-fi 2014 classic Locke, starring Tom Hardy doing very much the same thing. Moe Dunford (from Paddy Breathnach’s homelessness drama Rosie) plays Budge: a tough drug dealer looking for the traditional final big score to get him out of this filthy trade so he can set up an honest bodyshop repair business with a mate. Without any camera cut, we watch Budge as he drives around barking instructions through his mobile phone: the plan is that he borrows €100,000 in cash from a well-known psychopath called Joe (Stephen Rea), one of many people that we just hear on the mobile; Budge plans to use this to buy some cocaine from Ukrainian gangsters (his girlfriend is Ukrainian) who need to unload it right now and get out of the country quickly; then he will sell these drugs to his contact for €200,000, pay Joe back plus €20,000 interest, which will leave him with enough left over to bring to the bank the next morning to set up this auto-repair business. And all in an hour and a half! Of course, it goes horribly pear-shaped. There’s a propulsive, driving force to the way the film is directed, but there are some things that don’t entirely track: his putative garage business associate – stunned and horrified by what Budge is getting dragged into – is fulfilling the plot function of a spouse or romantic partner, and I wonder if it’s plausible that a drug dealer of Budge’s prominence thinks he can just quit and become a civilian in the same city. Well, there’s some style to it.

3/1/2022,"Nicola Benedetti, the award-winning Scottish violinist, is to take over as director of the Edinburgh international festival, becoming the first woman to run the event. Benedetti, a Grammy and Brit awards winner, is also the first Scot to direct the festival since its foundation in 1947, adding to the dramatic impact her appointment is likely to have on the event’s wider popularity and fame. In a brief statement, Benedetti said: “I am deeply honoured to contribute to the long and rich history of the Edinburgh international festival and the cultural landscape of Scotland. This festival was founded on principles of reconciliation and the ideals of art transcending political and cultural fracture.” She will succeed Fergus Linehan, an Irish arts administrator who staged his first festival in 2015, in October. At 34, she is also one of the festival’s youngest directors. Its third director, Robert Ponsonby, was 30 when he took control in 1954. Benedetti has been appointed as the festival prepares to celebrate its 75th anniversary this year. Linehan, who will announce August’s festival programme this month, has previously said he wants the event to be a “huge civic moment from celebration to requiem” after the Covid crisis. On Monday evening, the festival announced that Valery Gergiev, the Russian conductor who is a close friend and ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had stepped down as its honorary president. The EIF said it had asked him to resign. “Edinburgh is twinned with the city of Kyiv and this action is being taken in sympathy with, and support of, its citizens,” it said. In 2020, the festival was in effect cancelled for the first time in its history, producing a handful of online-only events; last year, there were a reduced number of in-person events, with much smaller audiences, but with heavy investment in digital streaming of its productions. Unlike her immediate predecessors, Benedetti has no experience running large arts festivals but has built up a significant reputation as an arts educator and ambassador for classical music, particularly with younger musicians and schools. She won BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2004. A champion of modern compositions, the soloist became the youngest recipient of the Queen’s medal for music in 2017 and formed the Benedetti Baroque Orchestra in 2020. Her violin concerto to a score by the jazz trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis also won a Grammy that year. In a speech to the Royal Philharmonic Society in 2019, Benedetti said music “is the art of all the things we can’t see or touch. [It] brings millions together through the basic act of listening and thousands together through the act of making melody, rhythm and harmony in the practice and service of collective expression”. Keith Skeoch, an investment banker who chairs the festival’s board of trustees, said: “In many ways she reflects the spirit of this festival. Internationally recognised and respected but Scottish to her core, she’s dedicated to advocating world-class music making and innovating new ways to bring it to audiences.” Founded to revitalise European classic music in the aftermath of the second world war, the Edinburgh international festival has sought to increase its artistic and cultural diversity under Linehan and his Australian predecessor, Sir Jonathan Mills. Its current board, appointed in 2019, is the first in the event’s history to have a female majority membership and greater ethnic diversity, signalling its intentions to become more representative and, by appointing members with expertise in digital arts, broaden its output. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said: “I welcome Nicola Benedetti’s appointment as director – especially as she becomes the first woman to ever hold the role. Her experience in promoting Scotland’s cultural scene to audiences around the world will be invaluable and I wish her every success.”",Arts/Music,Nicola Benedetti becomes first woman and first Scot to lead Edinburgh international festival,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/nicola-benedetti-becomes-first-woman-and-first-scot-to-lead-edinburgh-international-festival
3/1/2022,"War in Ukraine upends our world again. The iron curtain slams down after the body blows of Brexit and Covid, amid Cop26 climate warnings. With Vladimir Putin’s invasion shaking Nato into life, refilling the war chest will reverse the peace dividend. Rocketing prices for gas, wheat and metals presage prolonged economic pain, as ever, unjustly shared. These thunderbolts strike when Britain lacks resilience on almost every front. Last week Martin Rees, the astronomer royal and an ex-president of the Royal Society, gave a Cassandra warning in the Financial Times on our vulnerabilities. “The current system dooms Britain to remain perpetually unprepared” against “existential risks” from “the atomic bomb, biological weapons, artificial intelligence and climate change”. A chaotic and short-termist national risk register gives no “proper assessment of the dynamic nature of risks such as floods, cyber-attacks and bio threats”. His words are restrained, but the Lords risk assessment and risk planning committee, of which he is a member, tolls a funereal bell on the country’s capacity to protect itself. Why this critical lack of resilience? Up jumped Jacob Rees-Mogg last week, the improbably titled minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, with a reminder of the reasons why, as he announced another 65,000 public servants were to be cut. These are the doers of mundane things protecting us from threats great and small, dangers distant or immediate. Westminster politicians can command, but if there’s no one on the end of the bell pull when it rings in the Downton public servants’ hall, nothing happens. The curtain was pulled back when one appalled beginner revealed he was left alone in the Foreign Office with a failing computer system to cope with the tragic exodus from Kabul. Between government policies in parliament and actual delivery falls the shadow of monumental maladministration. When the axe swung after 2010, the number of public servants dwindled to its lowest since the second world war. Then, irony of ironies, in escaping Brussels’ “red tape” and “bureaucrats”, says Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, “Brexit became a job creation scheme for civil servants”, as every department swelled to recreate lost EU functions. Numbers leapt up again to respond to Covid, but even then they were still well below 2010 levels. Some roles, such as test-and-tracers, will be shed, but, says Rutter, ministers picking a headline-grabbing number at random, regardless of skills and necessary tasks, is as absurd as the “one-in-two-out” rule for regulations plucked out of the air 10 years ago, which Iain Duncan Smith’s task force is trying to accelerate. Here’s the perversity: ministers slice away the skills, experience and capacity that would be needed to carry out their own wishes. Let’s ignore how misguided their policies may be, and just look at their incapacity. Hardly a week passes without some breathtaking example tumbling out of the National Audit Office, the public accounts committee or select committees scrutinising Whitehall departments. Last week, for example, the public accounts committee revealed official estimates that the state is unlikely to recoup up to £21bn of Covid business loans in “an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters”. That sum is so enormous it’s beyond counting in the usual currency of nurses, teachers or police officers, but think what damage it could repair. Cuts to due diligence on monitoring contracts is the worst possible value for money, as Rutter warns that reports of unchecked fraud undermine trust in HMRC, when the whole tax edifice relies on people’s willing compliance. Take a deep breath here and let’s dash haphazardly through just the latest revelations. The law’n’order party has brought justice to a near halt through a lack of prosecutors, defending barristers and judges, with the backlog so long, cases are now listed for 2024. Last week’s official report showed rape cases in England and Wales take two years to get to court. Undertrained, understaffed and ill-equipped police fail to cope with a fraud epidemic, up by 43% in two years, causing the resignation of government minister Lord Agnew. Some blunders are small but telling: last week the £1.3bn Kickstart scheme was revealed as “chaotically” failing to get a promised 100,000 young unemployed people into work or checking what employers had done with their £1,500 grants. The Home Office asylum-seeker backlog has seen decision delays of more than a year rise ninefold in the past decade. The 6 million-long NHS waiting list was already rising pre-Covid, due to cuts in doctor and nurse training and in beds, but now the length of time people are waiting for is also increasing: in 2010, there were virtually no people waiting for more than a year, now the figure in England stands at roughly 300,000. Delays at the DVLA for driving licences and HGV driving tests long predate Covid. Add here the parlous state of the Environment Agency to cope with sewage outflows and floods, Natural England stripped bare, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs nowhere near defining its replacements for EU farm subsidies. A backlog of checks on restaurant hygiene and factory safety grows, the Institute for Government tells me, while children at risk are not referred to social services and education harm mounts due to catch-up failures in English and maths. These are just snapshots of public services no longer there for the dull basics. Look at this blustering government’s big talk and ponder how a broken-down machine can produce net-zero targets, “levelling up” and Brexit “opportunities”, let alone a whole new defence tilt. Here’s an exhibition performance in bad government decisions matched by failed administration – and it’s about to get worse. As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Rishi Sunak’s ill-timed Mais lecture promised tax cuts. Maybe ideological small-staters of the Rees-Mogg and Sunak stamp don’t much mind if the despised state fails to function, but voters do.

3/1/2022,"Online casino company 888 will pay a £9.4m fine, the third highest in the history of British gambling regulation, over multiple failings that led to customers racking up huge losses during the depths of the Covid pandemic. The Gambling Commission highlighted a series of transgressions that it warned could force it to consider 888’s suitability to hold a licence to operate in Great Britain. The fine comes just weeks before the government is due to publish proposals to reform gambling regulation, potentially including affordability checks to make sure people can afford the amounts they are betting. The regulator said 888 was not properly identifying customers who were at risk of harm because it did not carry out financial checks until they had deposited £40,000. In one case, the company did no checks on a customer until they had lost £37,000 in just six weeks during 2020, a time when the commission had asked companies to be cautious about luring in people who might be more vulnerable due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In another case, 888 placed a deposit cap of £1,300 a month on the account of an NHS worker whom it knew earned £1,400 a month. An audit carried out in October 2020 found that most of the company’s social responsibility interactions with customers consisted of a single email describing the available responsible gambling tools and did not involve customer interaction. Andrew Rhodes, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, pointed out that this was 888’s second big fine, after it was hit with a £7.8m penalty in 2017, a record at the time. “The circumstances of the last enforcement action may be different but both cases involve failing consumers – and this is something that is not acceptable,” said Rhodes. “Today’s fine is one of our largest to date, and all should be clear that if there is a repeat of the failures at 888 then we have to seriously consider the suitability of the operator to uphold the licensing objectives and keep gambling safe and crime-free. “Consumers in Britain deserve to know that when they gamble, they are participating in a leisure activity where operators play their part in keeping them safe and are carrying out checks to ensure money is crime-free.” The online casino company, which is in the process of buying William Hill’s UK assets, also failed to carry out proper “source of funds” (SOF) checks to prevent money laundering. This included accepting verbal assurances from customers on their employment income, not setting out which documents should be requested as part of SOF checks. One customer was allowed to spend £65,835 in just five months without SOF checks being carried out. Itai Pazner, the chief executive of 888, said: “We recognise our responsibility to make gambling safer and regret that previous implementation of our processes failed to meet required standards in the UK. We accept the findings of the UKGC’s investigation of some of 888’s former policies and procedures and have taken immediate appropriate action to improve and address the failings. “Over recent years we have made significant investments in safer gambling, including more than doubling the size of our compliance team since 2019. We will continue to work closely with the UKGC, our peers and other stakeholders to drive continuous improvement in the industry.” The largest ever fine from the Gambling Commission was meted out to casino company Caesars in April 2020, a month after an £11.6m fine handed down to Betway.",News/Society,Betting firm 888 fined £9.4m after customers lost thousands in pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/01/betting-firm-888-fined-94m-after-customers-lost-thousands-in-pandemic

The 52-year-old German, who took the job last October, said he was “absolutely convinced” his decision was the right one. Gisdol, who had previously spent his whole playing and coaching career in his homeland, most recently with Cologne, had been in charge for 12 matches.

3/1/2022,"During the brief heyday of Russia as a “Bric”, the acronym I dreamed up in 2001 to describe the possible future largest emerging economies in the world – Brazil, Russia, India and China – I would go to Russia reasonably frequently. In 2008, I was asked by the organisers to give a special presentation on where Russia’s economy might be, by 2020, to the St Petersburg Summit, Russia’s own version of Davos. To my slight embarrassment, I hadn’t really appreciated that they would be quite irritated if I didn’t suggest that Russia was likely to be in the top five largest economies of the world by 2020, which I did realise afterwards, when my presentation and comments caused a bit of stir in the post-event coffee areas and media. Essentially I suggested that given Russia’s challenging demographics, and that crude oil prices were unlikely to continue the one-way rise that had characterised the decade to date, Russia’s potential growth rate was probably not much more than 2%. And if they really wanted to have the powerful economic growth that had been experienced in (those) recent years, they needed to undertake significant reforms to boost productivity. The reaction to my presentation among officialdom was my first real suspicion that Russia might have challenges ahead, which of course, was without realising the scale of chaos that was about to unfold in the global financial system and the subsequent economic collapse around much of the world. That set of circumstances contributed to a major multi-year peaking in oil prices, and much of what happened since, which for Russia, has been persistent economic disappointment. I have no great expertise at geopolitics but I have broadly assumed in the past decade or so that Vladimir Putin had decided that his huge domestic popularity would decline because he couldn’t achieve the growth that had taken place pre-crisis. Nor could he really reform, because much of his personal financial benefit and those of some close to him depended on the status quo, so he had to shift to another platform, which was loosely based around the idea of making Russia great. During those years, I got to know several senior technocrats in the policy world, primarily from the central bank and finance ministry, and leading economic influencers, and I was often struck by how widely the belief was about Putin’s excellence as a strategist. I had for some years been expecting some great era of big reforms to be unleashed due to these views but alas, they never came, and instead, this game of playing on his perception of western weakness dominated his apparent strategic thinking. Well, after the weekend just passed, and the western financial sanctions announced, it seems to me that Putin isn’t such a great strategist after all. I don’t know where the idea of freezing the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves originated, but whoever thought of it has come up with a cracker, alongside the bold move by leading western nations to agree to remove key Russian banks from the Swift plumbing network of the financial system. In one fell swoop, that announcement has essentially eradicated the relevance of Russia’s massive official foreign exchange reserves, and with it, sowed the seeds for big problems for the Russian economy. I had been thinking throughout recent weeks: how can a country that is no longer in the top 10 largest of the world’s economy (barely 2% of global GDP now) have such apparent military importance around the world? After the further collapse of the currency, the ability of Russia to remain anywhere near as important globally is starting to rapidly fade. Based on the exchange rate on Monday, Russia could at the end of 2022 rank no higher than 15th. While the background to recent awful events had included a picture of increasing closeness between Beijing and Moscow, I suspect the Chinese leadership might be scathing about what Putin has provoked as a response from the west. Now any country thinking of using its supposed military might to pick on a small neighbour to the dislike of the western democratic alliance will have to calculate the consequences for their own central bank being frozen out of the system, and with it, economic warfare being used in such speedy form as a much more powerful form of influence. Of course, there are many other aspects that go along in parallel, not least the remarkable shift in German policy on its own defence spending, its decision to pay for some weapons for Ukraine, and, of course, its sudden opposition to the previously agreed deal for a pipeline for more Russian gas. And with this, there has been a much more joined-up and robust EU policy response. It is now likely the case that some thinkers around the large emerging economies will have to, once again, rethink their happy dependency on the western-dominated financial system, and it is not impossible that current events sow the seeds for a big reform of the global financial system. There is no way that is going to happen unless such countries, China included, shift their approach to the use of their currency, and with it, many aspects of their economic and related systems. As for Russia, some huge reflection on its leadership must surely soon occur.

3/1/2022,"Twenty-four years ago Eric Underwood went to an acting audition at a performing arts school in Washington DC. He panicked, froze and forgot his monologue. It seemed like his career was over before it began. But now 38, Underwood has finally got his first role in a play, Bruce Norris’s Pulitzer prize-winning Clybourne Park, tackling knotty conversations about race and gentrification. Underwood, however, has had plenty of stage time in between. On the way out of that first audition, he saw some girls getting ready for a dance tryout and, desperate not to let down his mum, asked to have a go. The school recognised his raw talent and a ballet career followed, culminating in 11 years at the Royal Ballet in London, for this charismatic, shapeshifting dancer. Many ballet dancers are so consumed by their vocation that the idea of leaving the profession is anathema. “I’m not like that at all,” says Underwood, with characteristic radiant cheeriness. “I got everything I wanted out of it. I just felt like I needed to enrich myself outside something I knew.” Modelling was his first move – “It was a lot easier, and more money” – and he mixed careers for a while, dashing out for a casting in the afternoon and back to Covent Garden for a 7.30pm show. “Run, jump right into costume, and hit it!” as he puts it. Did the Royal Ballet mind you living a double life? “I suppose I never asked!” He left the Royal in 2017 and was later cast in the film version of Cats, which got him an agent, and while he was at Milan fashion week the script for Clybourne Park came through. Underwood dropped everything, locked himself in his hotel room and read the script over and over before auditioning for director Oliver Kaderbhai over Skype. Then, as they were nearing the end of rehearsals, came Covid. The hiatus actually gained Underwood some precious preparation time. He worked with an acting coach and came back to the studio more confident. What’s most satisfying to Underwood about the shift from ballet to theatre is finding his voice, and not only on stage. “There’s a lot more dialogue in the rehearsal space,” he says. “It feels very adult. My first day here I was like, why do they keep asking me questions? Just tell me what to do! Then I realised, oh wait, I have an opinion.” Apart from a couple of cast changes (“I now have a different wife. I think that happened to a lot of people in Covid!”), the major shift between 2020 and now has been in the world outside the theatre: the murder of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter and the changing conversation about race. “The play is even more relevant now than it was then,” says Underwood. He thinks the audience will be more receptive, “because they’ve been having those conversations outside of seeing the play”. The first act takes place in Chicago in 1959, where a white couple are about to sell their house to a black family, to the consternation of their neighbours. The second act, 50 years later, sees the same house, now in a predominantly black neighbourhood, being sold to a white couple who want to pull it down and build a new one in its place. “I didn’t fully understand the racial segregation there,” he says. “When black people started to move into those suburban neighbourhoods there were bombs thrown into their houses. I grew up in a 99.9% black neighbourhood and I never even thought about it. When I went to the School of American Ballet obviously things were completely different. My identity had changed from ‘Eric’ to ‘the black guy’.” During the hiatus, Underwood was able to go back to the US where he talked to people who lived through the period of the play. “I feel like I’ve come back with so much more knowledge,” he says. “It’s really nice to do a play where you’re talking about hugely important things. Things that are incredibly uncomfortable, but at the same time it’s humorous, it’s lighthearted, and it’s offensive in the best possible way.” In the first act, Underwood plays Albert, husband of the white couple’s maid, Francine. He found it difficult in rehearsals to see Francine (played by Aliyah Odoffin) “being talked to in a derogatory way that I, Eric, object to. But Albert has to be silent and strong and not do anything to upset the situation or he’ll be seen as threatening. I had to fight to keep ‘Eric’ away because I was going: no, no, no!” In the second act he plays Kevin, a character closer to himself. “He’s a peacemaker. I’m chatty and friendly and don’t like to have conflicts so I’d probably behave a lot like him.” But Kevin has a bit of bite. “I like to tell a cheeky joke, say something that’s quite shocking, so that’s right up my alley.” Underwood took British citizenship in 2007 and recognises that the story of friction between communities is not solely an American one. He’s involved in inclusivity work, teaching dance in schools – a primary school in Hackney has even run a course about him. “Dance isn’t out of my life but I feel like I need to share it more than do it,” he says. He is also working on an idea for a dance and travel TV show. His infectious can-do self-belief stems from his mother’s constant encouragement. “We’re really close, we probably talk three times a day,” he says. “It’s that very cliched American thing, but she always said to me, you can be anything that you want to be.” Underwood has no fears about leaping into new pursuits. “Given my life experience I’ve got really thick skin,” he says. “I don’t mind being judged. It’s just important to be who I am and try my best. That’s all I can do.”  Clybourne Park is at the Park theatre, London, 16 March-23 April.",Arts/Stage, ‘It’s offensive in the best possible way’: Eric Underwood on his leap into acting with Clybourne Park,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/01/eric-underwood-on-his-leap-from-ballet-to-acting-royal-ballet-clybourne-park
3/1/2022,"Tricky beast that it is, the music industry has a horrible habit of presenting its most promising talent with an impossible dichotomy. Release your music too soon, and you might fumble your first impression; take too long, and you risk getting lost in the crowd, sentenced for ever to “underrated” status as your faster-acting peers ascend. Fortunately for him and us, Kojey Radical has never been too bothered about following anybody else’s path. While the London rapper is a dexterous amalgamator of genres, he knew that he needed time to incubate his best ideas, warming up across a near decade of well-received projects before committing to a debut album, Reason to Smile, a cohesive yet varied offering that makes no bones about its own ambition. “You don’t want to put your best foot forward and fall, y’know?” he says, wafting away a cloud of smoke on our early morning Zoom. “I just wanted to stand behind something that represents me and shows off the quality of work that I can make.” As a musician, poet, visual artist and aspiring actor, Kojey Radical is part of a generation of artists who intentionally resist being boxed in. Born Kwadwo Adu Genfi Amponsah in east London in 1993, he started out as a fashion illustration student, but made his first mark in the music business with 2015’s Open Hand, a stark (yet hopeful) call for racial revolution. Amid a steady stream of releases and collaborations with future-thinking peers such as alternative R&B star Mahalia, grime MC Ghetts and jazz group Sons of Kemet, he built a dedicated fanbase, drawn to his blend of personal and political insight. Then, in early 2020, the global you-know-what hit, and he was thrown into turmoil – “just trying to work through the fact that life had stopped at a time where my career was probably at the biggest that it had ever been”. The pandemic didn’t keep Amponsah down for long. Taking to Instagram live streams as a daily practice, he invited fans into his creative process, experimenting with tracks that producer friends would send in. When he received the beat that would become the Reason to Smile track Silk, he began freestyling its slippery, playful ode to self-confidence, liking how the swagger felt. This felt right, but wouldn’t it be even better with an appearance from freewheeling saxophonist Masego? “I cut the live [freestyle] off and texted it to him; he sent me the saxophone parts the next day, and I just remember going: ‘Well, this is pretty damn good.’ I texted my team, just saying: ‘Yo, I think it’s album time.’” The finished results are both lyrically and sonically expansive. Stories of family, soul-seeking and good old‑fashioned lovemaking are set to bouncy grime, smooth R&B and skittering P-Funk, drawing on the same kind of exuberant 1970s flourish that has recently influenced the music of Silk Sonic, Little Simz and Joel Culpepper (whose 2021 debut shares a producer, Swindle, with Reason to Smile). While Amponsah’s lyrics do sometimes touch on feelings of understandable cynicism (“Should I drop the album on Black Pound Day / Or will they still support it just cos it sounds great?” goes one particularly on-the-nose line on Fubu), his is clearly music to feel uplifted by, exploring the nuances of joy, hardship and masculinity. “I just look towards genres that have the most freedom, you know?” he says. “Growing up, the ‘male rapper’ archetype was kind of etched in stone, whereas I would see neo-soul, jazz or indie artists just getting to experiment and be themselves. Things are changing in hip-hop; we see people like Kid Cudi or Tyler, the Creator doing multiple things and being embraced, and it’s inspiring for a younger generation. There are artists now who were literally born in 2000; my own son was born in 2020.” He shakes his head, marvelling at the thought. “I was thinking just the other day that TLC’s No Scrubs is nearly 25 years old, and by the time he gets to a conscious age to even hear it, it’s probably going to be 35. It’s horrible. Horrible!” Conscious of the passage of time, Amponsah is working hard to preserve his own history. Aware of hip-hop’s historic penchant for colourism, he makes sure to centre dark-skinned Black women in his visuals wherever possible, picturing both his own mum and the mother of his son on the album’s cover. His mum also narrates the album, recalling memories of her journey from Ghana and the life she has built in the UK. Album closer Gangsta is dedicated to her; Amponsah was initially trying to write about his tumultuous relationship with his father but changed tack when the words didn’t come. “I just figured to myself, why would I focus on a negative when the positive has been a constant in my life?” he says. “I can’t think of a day when my mum’s not been there, so why wouldn’t I go that way rather than wallowing in self-pity?” For such a wordsmith, you could never accuse Kojey Radical of being all talk. As part of a deal with Dr Martens, he has been putting funds into youth clubs, allowing emerging artists to learn the ropes of the music industry in a way that feels more holistic than simply “a quick workshop here and there … I don’t like false allyship. You don’t need to shout about it; you just need to represent and get it done.” In helping to secure a future for others, Amponsah can be confident about where his is heading. His fashion mind is constantly whirring (“I think the album would be a three-piece suit, double-breasted, in sky blue or dazzling yellow”), but he’s also pondering how he made it to this point. “This album is literally about the journey; the moments where you feel completely yourself and high-energy; the moments where you feel down and question yourself. It’s like reading [Paulo Coelho’s] The Alchemist – once you find a bit that connects to you, it becomes the best book you’ve ever read.” He grins, half-laughing at the audacity of his ambition. “I like to think that Reason to Smile is that.” Reason to Smile is released on 4 March.",Arts/Music,Kojey Radical: ‘I can’t think of a day when my mum’s not been there’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/kojey-radical-i-cant-think-of-a-day-when-my-mums-not-been-there
