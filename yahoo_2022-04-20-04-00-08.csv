4/20/2022,"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it. One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64. And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents. With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post. DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said. A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain. “He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said. “There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said. Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline. “What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said. “How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added. Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said. “I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.” DeHart said he paid what he should have owed. It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. A final coroner's report has revealed new details including the cause of death of Oscar-nominated director and producer Jean-Marc Vallée. Vallée, who was known for films like ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and the hit HBO series ""Big Little Lies,"" was found dead at his cabin outside of Quebec City on Dec. 25, 2021. The 58-year-old Montreal-native was believed to have been preparing to entertain guests for the holidays when he died from what's now been determined as ""a fatal arrhythmia secondary to severe coronary atherosclerosis."" According to Deadline, Vallée's death was particularly shocking since he abstained from alcohol and was ""a fitness fanatic."" A preliminary report received by the director's family on Dec. 31 stated that ""Mr. Vallée’s death was not caused by the intervention of another party, a voluntary act, or a known disease."" ""Testimonials of friendship, esteem and respect for our father and for his work are still coming from around the world,"" his sons Alex and Émile Vallée said in a statement following his passing. ""We are sincerely grateful and we hope that his creativity will continue to serve as inspiration and guidance to the people in this industry that he was so passionate about."" Read on to learn more about cardiac arrhythmias, signs and symptoms, and how they can be prevented. A cardiac arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat. If you have an arrhythmia, your heart may beat slower or faster than what is considered normal. ""A cardiac arrhythmia is serious because the condition can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms or you associate your symptoms with something else,"" a representative from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) tells Yahoo Canada. ""Oftentimes, doctors only spot the condition during a physical exam."" There are several conditions that might cause your heart to beat abnormally, and treatment depends on the cause. However, it can be normal to have a fast or slow heart rate. For example, the heart rate may slow down during sleep or increase while exercising. ""Generally, cardiac arrhythmias are grouped by the speed of the heart rate,"" the UOHI source, who asked to not be named, says. ""A tachycardia arrhythmia is a fast heartbeat (resting heart rate is greater than 100 beats per minute), and a bradycardia arrhythmia is a slow heartbeat (resting heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute)."" ""Cardiac arrhythmias may feel like a racing or fluttering heart and can be harmless. But some arrhythmias may be aggravating and life-threatening,"" they add. Cardiac arrhythmias occur when the electrical signals that coordinate heartbeats don't work properly. This causes the heart to beat too slow, too fast, or a combination of both. ""Arrhythmias can also be caused by high blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances, irritable heart tissue, injury from a heart attack, changes in the heart muscle or coronary atherosclerosis,"" the UOHI source continues. Coronary atherosclerosis, the secondary cause of Vallée's passing, kills 70,000 Canadians each year, per the University of Ottawa. Aside from cancer, it is the second-leading cause of death. The UOHI representative explains that ""coronary atherosclerosis is triggered by plaque buildup in the the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart and the human body. Over time, the plaque build-up narrows arteries resulting in adverse health effects."" Cardiac arrhythmias may not cause any symptoms or warning signs. However, a medical professional can diagnose an irregular heartbeat while performing diagnostic tests, taking a pulse, or listening to a patient's heart. ""Although symptoms can be silent, the signs of a cardiac arrhythmia include shortness of breath, chest pounding or discomfort, weakness or fatigue, a fluttering in the chest, and feeling dizzy or lightheaded,"" says the UOHI source. ""Other common symptoms may include sweating, fainting and anxiety, which is why the condition can easily be mistaken for something else."" If you have symptoms of an arrhythmia, or if you feel like your heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, or is skipping a beat, you should make an appointment to see a doctor or a cardiologist. There are a variety of factors that increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and irregular heartbeats. If you have certain medical conditions including coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, thyroid disease, high blood pressure or sleep apnea, you may be more at risk of developing the condition. ""Excessive use of stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine or drugs can also cause your heart to beat faster or slower than normal and may lead to the development of more serious arrhythmias or death due to ventricular fibrillation,"" explains the UOHI source. Treatment can depend on the severity and type of the arrhythmia. Once identified, there are various treatment options including catheter or pacemaker procedures, medication and surgery to control or eliminate fast, slow or irregular heartbeats. These treatment options are usually very successful. Implementing heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent heart damage that can trigger certain cardiac arrhythmias. Examples include exercising regularly, getting adequate sleep, and eating a healthy diet that's low in salt and fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. ""I would also recommend quitting smoking, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, and monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels,"" explains the source.

Researchers from the Alfred Hospital and Baker Heart Institute in Australia have reported that drinking coffee is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and dangerous heart rhythms as well as with living longer. ""Because coffee can quicken heart rate, some people worry that drinking it could trigger or worsen certain heart issues. This is where general medical advice to stop drinking coffee may come from. But our data suggests that daily coffee intake shouldn't be discouraged, but rather included as a part of a healthy diet for people with and without heart disease.""",Health/Yahoo Canada Style,What is cardiac arrhythmia?

4/20/2022,"STORY: The ""Battle of Donbas"" has begun, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday (April 19) as Russia unleashed thousands of troops in the east of the country. Speaking in an overnight video address, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would withstand the all-out assault. “Every life lost is an argument for Ukrainians and other free peoples, generation after generation, to perceive Russia exclusively as a threat. And any infrastructure can be restored. And we will definitely do it."" The coal- and steel-producing Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilize Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin used proxies to set up separatist ""people's republics"" in parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. Despite the looming threat, residents in Sloviansk, located in the Donetsk region, say they’re staying calm - for now. SLOVIANSK RESIDENT, ANYA, SAYING: ""Right now it’s mostly calm here.

4/20/2022,"By Idrees Ali and Kanishka Singh WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States military expects to start training Ukrainians on using howitzer artillery in coming days, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. So far, four flights of weapons have been sent by the United States as part of the new package. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the howitzer training would take place outside Ukraine. The United States is planning on teaching Ukrainian trainers on how to use some of the new batch of weapons such as howitzers and radars and then for the trainers to instruct their colleagues inside Ukraine. The United States has previously trained Ukrainian forces on Switchblade drones. Ukraine said a Russian missile attack killed seven people in Lviv on Monday, the first civilian victims in the western city, and the commander of Ukrainian forces holding out in the devastated southeastern port of Mariupol appealed to the pope for help. It appeared that Russia was aiming at military targets in Lviv and the capital Kyiv in the north, the U.S. defense official said. Mariupol was still contested as Russia appeared to have sent reinforcements into Ukraine in recent days, the official added. ""Our assessment is Mariupol is still contested ... (it) remains under threat from the air but both from missile strikes as well as bombs from the air but even of course artillery,"" the official said. The official said there were roughly 76 Russian battalion tactical groups in southern and eastern Ukraine, an increase of about 11 in recent days. Over the weekend, the Russian defense ministry said its anti-aircraft systems in the Odesa region shot down a Ukrainian transport plane delivering weapons supplied by Western governments. The official said that the United States did not have any information to suggest that was true. There were no indications that Russia was making any attempt to recover the warship Moskva, flagship of its Black Sea fleet, that sank on Thursday, the U.S. official said.

4/20/2022,"Amid its struggles in Ukraine, Russia's military has relied heavily on its most highly trained troops. The fighting has taken a toll on those troops, including Russia's famed Spetsnaz special operators. Moscow may rely on those operators even more as it renews its campaign, focusing on eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have struggled in Ukraine, failing to achieve any of their primary objectives after two months of fighting. Moscow has reduced its ambitions, focusing on eastern Ukraine. It appears to be renewing its offensive, but its performance has already affected assessments of its military prowess, calling into question its status as a ""near peer"" force. Among the Russian units affected are the famed Spetsnaz. During and after the Cold War, these special operators achieved legendary status in the West. Recent successes in Crimea and Syria seemed to add to their credentials. Alongside the rest of the Russian military, however, their reputation is being tarnished in Ukraine. The city of Irpin, only miles from Kyiv, was a base Russian special-operations forces until Ukrainian forces ousted the Russians in late March. The brutal fight for the port city of Mariupol — the kind of strategic target where Moscow has concentrated its most capable forces — appears to have taken an outsize toll on Russia's special operators. Moscow established the Spetsnaz, its first special-operations unit, in the 1950s to conduct strategic missions. Spetsnaz initially had a strategic role, but now every special-operations unit in the Russian military, law enforcement, and emergency and security services are called Spetsnaz. In general, military Spetsnaz units are a light infantry airborne force that can act as shock troops. A few elite Spetsnaz units, such as Alpha and Vympel Groups, have strategic missions, such as counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and the security of nuclear installations. There has been limited reporting on what Russian special-operations units have done in Ukraine or how they've performed, but their missions there may include special reconnaissance, direct-action operations, and unconventional warfare. One of the few advantages that Russia's military has leveraged against Ukraine is its long-range weapons. Russia has launched more than 1,500 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukrainian targets. Russian special operators could infiltrate close to those targets and use specialized equipment to help guide the munition. Moscow's utter disregard for collateral damage means it may not be using such targeting assistance, but that skill set could still be used if the Kremlin wants to take out the Ukrainian leadership with a strategic strike. Russian special-operations forces might also be conducting direct-action operations, such as raids and ambushes, in pursuit of tactical-level goals, such as capturing a city block. Generally, it would be folly to use special operators for conventional operations, as their potential casualties would squander the time and expense used to train them to a high level, but the lack of progress may prompt Russian commanders to do so, especially in urban settings where the close-quarters-combat training of Russian commandos might make the difference between winning and losing. Russia may also use its special-operations forces for unconventional warfare and asymmetric operations. Russian forces have been supporting separatist forces in eastern Ukraine for years, and that effort may expand as Moscow redirects its military campaign toward that region. Russian special operators may also target Ukrainian strategic targets, such as airfields or fuel and arms depots. There have already been reports of Russian naval commandos attacking a Ukrainian military intelligence ship. When it comes to special-operations forces, the Russian military has had ample opportunity to learn from the US. For the past 20 years, US special operators have been at the tip of the spear. Their ability to conduct high-reward missions with less military or political risk than larger conventional units has made them a go-to option for American policymakers. Russia's military began a major reorganization in 2008, part of which was the formation of a dedicated special-operations command organization. Created in 2009, the Russian Special Operations Forces Command is a strategic-level special-operations organization tasked with the hardest, most important missions. ""The Russians aren't stupid. They would have seen how successful we've been employing SOF [special-operations forces] downrange during the GWOT [Global War on Terror] and have taken their notes. That's what we would do,"" a retired Delta Force operator told Insider. What Russian forces have learned in terms of military doctrine isn't apparent, but open-source information showed ""how our operations have influenced their equipment and training,"" said the retired operator, speaking anonymously because they still work with their unit. ""It's funny because sometimes it's hard to distinguish between an American and Russian operator because they tend to both wear MultiCam [camouflage], high-cut helmets, and carry similar assault loadouts. It's only from the weapons that you can really tell the difference,"" the former operator added. Moscow drew on the creation of the US's Joint Special Operations Command, which is a component of US Special Operations Command, as a model for its new command. Although smaller than Russia's new command, JSOC contains the US military's special missions units, the most elite special-operations organizations that comprise the US national mission strike force. Moscow wanted to replicate the effectiveness of the JSOC, bringing together its top special-operations units to facilitate better command and control. Even Spetsnaz units from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, were transferred to the new organization, though they were reassigned to the GRU in 2013. ""People in SOF tend to be cut from the same cloth. The training, mission sets, and funding might be different — and in some cases worlds apart — but the people at the highest levels tend to be very similar,"" the retired operator said.
