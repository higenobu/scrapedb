1/5/2022,"This week, China switched on a nuclear fusion reactor. The “artificial sun” is known as the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (or EAST for short). After turning it on, China noticed record high levels for sustained temperatures. According to China’s state media, the EAST reactor ran five times hotter than the real Sun for over 17 minutes. China says its overall goal with the nuclear fusion reactor is to provide near limitless clean energy. The hope is that the reactor can mimic the natural reactions that occur within stars like the Sun. The idea is one that has been proposed for years. However, creating a working artificial sun has proven to be difficult, despite decades of research. This latest run, though, could help China break through the walls that have been holding back researchers for years.

(via The Independent) If China can continue work on its artificial sun, we could see more breakthroughs in the future. 17 minutes might not sound like long, but when you have something running at more than 70,000,000° C for that long, it’s pretty impressive, to say the least. Previously we’ve also seen other artificial suns reach upwards of 100 million degrees, another record level. The idea behind nuclear fusion reactors isn’t exactly easy. The entire basis of the idea is built on replicating the physics of the actual Sun. Artificial suns do this by merging atomic nuclei together to generate massive amounts of energy. Researchers are then trying to find ways to transfer all of that energy into electricity. There’s probably a lot more math involved in the actual process, but that’s the basic gist of what scientists are trying to accomplish. Because artificial suns don’t require any fossil fuels to run, and they also leave behind no hazardous waste, physicists say there is far less risk to the environment. This is especially true when you compare it to other energy sources out there, like nuclear fission reactors. China isn’t the only country working on creating an artificial sun, either. As mentioned before, the research into the idea has been ongoing for decades at this point. The same team from China’s reactor will also work with a team in Marseille, France. Once completed, the artificial sun in Marseille will be the world’s largest reactor. It’s known as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The United Kingdom also has plans to build its own nuclear fusion power station.

1/5/2022,"Brandon White, from YouTuber duo the Buff Dudes, has made plenty of videos (alongside his brother Hudson) covering how to grow your muscles. He’s also aware of the thousands of videos and training plans out there offering advice on how to build bigger biceps. After watching a ton of them, he has some thoughts. White took the time to create his own guide breaking down the biggest issues he's found with popular biceps-building advice—mostly that there's one secret method for success—and the techniques and exercises you need to really get your biceps growing. According to White, muscle growth starts in the kitchen. He begins the day with a big breakfast, which includes a plate of sweet potatoes and salad topped with fish, followed by a protein shake. ""Food is of course an integral part in building muscle, so you can't forget that,"" he says. ""It's the supplies you're giving your body to build the muscle."" But all that fuel needs to be used—so next comes the right type of workout. ""You need to activate and stimulate the muscle in order for it to adapt and grow,"" says White. ""The one thing all those videos don't want to talk about is the simplicity of building your biceps. It's going to be elbow flexion. Elbow flexion is essentially the curling action—it's taking your forearm and flexing up."" That sounds simple. But, as White explains, there are plenty of opportunities to mess up. ""As a beginner, I jumped in on Arnold's bodybuilder competition training where he was doing like 30 sets of biceps, and as a 14-year-old, I couldn't even move my arms the next day,"" he laughs. ""The volume was way too high, there were way too many exercises... my little biceps could not handle it, and I didn't know what activation was."" He emphasizes that in the beginning of your bicep training, it's essential to focus on training to learn how to activate and contract your biceps muscles. This principle is called neural adaptivity, where your mind-muscle connection adapts to the stress put on your biceps. To practice this, when you're starting out, take it light. Do not go heavy. As you become more advanced, White advises increasing training volume, weight, and frequency. This includes incorporating techniques like super sets and drop sets. ""Super sets are a technique going from one exercise immediately over to another exercise with no rest in between, so you're increasing the stimulation and fatigue in the muscle,"" says White. You can also implement drops sets, which increases more fatigue in the muscle as well. ""You're performing the exercise with a certain amount of weight, burning out at that weight (the muscle is completely fatiguing), and you drop the weight in order to continue doing repetitions with the lighter weight, dropping again for extra stimulation and growth,"" says White. Next, he shares his three favorite biceps exercises that he credits for building up his arms over the years. Exercise 1: Barbell Curl White is a fan of this staple movement because it forces the palms to be in a supinated position, which he cites as an optimal position to help isolate the biceps and get that elbow flexion. Plus, you can go pretty heavy with it. He implements 'cheat' curls, using a bit of momentum from his lower body. This typically would be frowned upon—and you shouldn’t only use cheat curls to train your biceps—but the added weight you can handle by fudging on form increases overload. White says he always starts his biceps workouts with the standard curl, slowly increasing the weight and decreasing reps. Exercise 2: Incline Dumbbell Curl White is a fan of this variation because of the adjustments you can easily make on a bench. He starts with a low angle (sometimes even completely flat), and increases the angle as desired. But why? ""Now you're leaning back and your elbows are placed behind you. That creates more stretch in the long head of the biceps, so the muscle needs to create more contraction to pull the forearm forwards (elbow flexion),"" says White. ""It's going to have to really contract to pull it up."" He also incorporates a supinating action, twisting his forearms and hands upward, for extra biceps activation and stimulus. Exercise 3: Concentration Curl Compared to the other two exercises, the positioning is quite different in this variation. The elbow is placed in front of you, so the long head of the biceps is more relaxed, and the short head of the biceps is more active. He notes that he prefers a unilateral motion, meaning you work one arm at a time. Tempo is also important to focus on with all curls, but can be especially effective with this movement. Incorporating a hold/squeeze in the top position will create more stimulus. White ends by emphasizing that the one thing no one wants to admit about biceps training is that there is no real secret to success. The principles are easy—it’s a matter of training smart and training often. ""It's very simple: elbow flexion! Be consistent with it and increase complexity of your exercises and training,"" he concludes.
