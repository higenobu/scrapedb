5/4/2022,"University students’ complaints about the Covid pandemic disrupting their studies led to more than 1,000 appeals to the higher education watchdog in England and Wales last year. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) received a record 2,763 appeals from students unhappy at the way their complaints had been handled by their universities in 2021. More than a thousand of those were related to the effects of campus Covid measures, treble the number in the first year of the pandemic. More than one in four appeals were upheld or deemed to be justified by the watchdog. But the number of appeals understates the number of individuals involved – the OIA said that 16% of Covid disruption complaints were from groups of about 10 to 30 students, including one joint appeal from a group of more than 400 students. Students on design, creative and performing arts courses were among those most directly affected, according to the OIA, raising issues such as access to equipment and studio space or lost opportunities to exhibit work. “More widely, complaints from students across a range of subject areas often related to practical experiences that were disrupted by Covid-19 restrictions. Students complained about lack of access to laboratories, cancelled or changed projects, placements and study abroad opportunities,” the OIA said in its annual report published on Wednesday. In one case outlined by the OIA, a group of postgraduates on a healthcare research course complained about problems with laboratory work and feedback, frequent timetable changes and the ending of lab-based projects during a pandemic lockdown. The institution offered £1,000 each in compensation but the students took their case to the OIA and were eventually offered £2,500 to settle. The OIA said that some complaints included disruption arising from strikes and industrial action as well as campus closures during lockdown. Felicity Mitchell, the independent adjudicator for higher education, said that 2021 had been “dominated” by the impact of the pandemic. “Many students experienced disruption to their lives and to their studies, and providers worked hard to deliver learning and support while balancing complex considerations and risks,” Mitchell said. Overall the OIA was involved in directing compensation of £792,500 and a further £512,000 in settlement agreements, for a total of £1.3m – significantly higher than the total of £742,000 in 2020. The highest individual award for a student was £68,000, while 60 students received £5,000 or more. In one complaint, a group of students studying medicine at the overseas campus of a British university received £24,000 after a damning report by the General Medical Council. The OIA ruled that the students had been led to believe that teaching and practice would be in English but in fact the local language was used in clinical consultations. The OIA does not name the institutions involved, other than in rare cases where they refuse to comply with an OIA ruling. The OIA only hears appeals from students after they have exhausted their institution’s internal procedures and remain unhappy with the response.",News/Education,"Complaints over Covid disruption rose in 2021, student watchdog says",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/04/complaint-over-covid-disruption-rose-2021-student-watchdog-office-independent-adjudicator-england-wales
5/4/2022,"Inequality in Britain risks being driven up by the biggest boom in City bonuses and pay since the 2008 financial crisis, the country’s leading economics thinktank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the return of bumper finance industry payouts meant the top 1% highest-paid workers were beginning to pull further away from the rest of the UK workforce despite the cost of living crisis hitting the country at large. Suggesting that City bankers would be better insulated than most from the soaring cost of living, the thinktank said pay and bonus deals in the Square Mile had shot up in recent months and had risen by about twice as much as other sectors in the past two years. According to the report, the mean monthly pay packet in the finance sector in February was 31% higher than in December 2019 in cash terms, compared with 14% across all sectors. Pay growth was driven by high earners, reflected in the higher mean figure. However, median pay in the finance industry was also significantly higher than for the economy at large. The IFS said City bankers, fund managers and other finance workers accounted for almost a third of all employees in the top 1% income bracket, meaning that a bumper period for this group would lift them further ahead of everyone else. The IFS said this was in contrast with the trend from 2016 to 2020, when low earners saw the strongest pay growth. Average annual pay growth, including bonuses, has increased in recent months as unemployment falls despite the end of furlough, reaching 5.4% in February. However, wage growth has failed to keep pace with soaring inflation driven by the rising cost of fuel and surging energy bills, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Inflation hit 7% in March and is expected to peak close to 10% later this year. However, the average figures mask a growing divide between different sectors of the workforce, highlighting how the cost of living emergency is likely to hit some people harder than others. Private sector staff have seen the strongest annual growth in pay, and earnings in the public sector have fallen furthest behind inflation. Xiaowei Xu, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: “Earnings inequality had been falling for some years before the pandemic hit, with low-paid workers seeing the strongest pay growth. The recent surge in pay among financial sector employees – particularly among top earners in the sector – has led to a reversal of this trend. “This appears to be the first time since the financial crisis that finance sector earnings have taken off like this and it remains to be seen whether this is a one-off spike or a new trend.” A spokesperson for UK Finance, the trade group for the financial services industry, said: “The banking and finance sector is a major source of employment around the country. It provides a range of high-skilled jobs and is one of the most important sources of tax revenue for the government.”",News/Business,"Biggest boom in City bonuses for years risks driving up inequality, says IFS",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/city-london-bonus-boom-risk-driving-up-inequality-institute-fiscal-studies
5/4/2022,"The cost of household goods such as toys, furniture and clothing is rising by the fastest rate in more than 15 years as the impact of the war in Ukraine combines with Covid lockdowns in China. Non-food inflation accelerated to 2.2% in April, up from 1.5% in March, according to the latest shop price index from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and market research group NielsenIQ, the highest rate since the monitor began in 2006. Food inflation rose to 3.5% in April – from 3.3% in March – making it the highest such figure on the index since March 2013, as the price of energy and commodities, including wheat and oil, drove up costs for many producers. The inflation is intensifying existing pressures on the cost of living, including last month’s energy cap increase that pushed the average electricity and gas bill up by £700 a year. The cost of petrol has also shot up, while household budgets arealready under pressure after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, raised national insurance contributions. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, which represents most of the major UK retailers, said furniture, electrical goods and books were seeing particularly high price increases as disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added to rising energy prices. It is understood that flooring, stationery and DIY materials, including paint, which are all heavily imported from China where many large cities have been shut down as part of strict anti-Covid measures, are also seeing high cost increases. “This [inflation] has been exacerbated by disruption at the world’s largest seaport, following Shanghai’s recent lockdown,” Dickinson said. “Food prices continued to rise, though fresh food inflation slowed as fierce competition between supermarkets resisted price hikes on many everyday essentials.” The BRC’s comments follow a warning from non-food retailers that sales have been hit by supply difficulties and weakening demand. The biggest squeeze on living standards since the 1950s has made consumers more gloomy about their finances and far less willing to spend in the shops. Sainsbury’s, the owner of the Argos chain, flagged problems with items such as TVs and consumer electronics made in China. The retailer said it expected the supply chain difficulties in east Asia – and a squeeze on customers’ spare cash caused by rising energy, petrol and food bills – to lead to lower sales of such items. Shares in the household appliance specialist AO World fell by more than a fifth last week as it said consumer demand for electrical goods had “progressively weakened”. Households are paring back spending on large non-essential items as the average household faces potential grocery price increases of £271 a year, according to the latest data from market research firm Kantar. It said shoppers had begun stockpiling some goods, such as sunflower oil, amid concerns about price rises and potential shortages. Meanwhile, the rise in the cost of living is expected to drive a surge in personal borrowing. Demand for credit from UK households is expected to rise to a five-year high of 7.9% – or about £16bn – in 2022, according to the latest EY Item Club UK bank lending forecast, as consumers increasingly turn to credit cards to cover bills. The rise would mark a reverse in trends from the first phase of the pandemic when many people paid down personal debts with nearly £200bn in extra cash saved – mostly by wealthier households – because of restrictions on travel, socialising and visiting high street shops. However, EY predicted demand for unsecured loans would diminish as households are likely to cut spending on discretionary purchases and big-ticket items, such as sofas and household appliances,to save money for essentials. Growth in mortgage lending is also expected to decline from 4.3% last year to 3.8% this year and 3.3% next – to £59.4bn and £53.5bn in 2022 and 2023 – amid rising interest rates and growing cost of living pressures.",News/Business,Ukraine war and China lockdowns drive fastest UK price rises in years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/ukraine-war-china-lockdowns-fastest-uk-price-rises-years
5/4/2022,"Cuts to rail funding could lead to more serious rail accidents as well as fewer, more crowded trains, unions have said. A TUC report said passenger safety will be compromised should Network Rail press ahead with reductions to its maintenance workforce to save £100m a year. About 2,500 jobs are expected to go and the TUC said it would be impossible to make such cuts without putting passengers at risk. It warned that the Treasury was also demanding cuts from train operators that would disrupt services and leave fewer trains running, leaving commuters “packed like sardines”. Network Rail said it would not compromise safety and its ideas for modernisation had “fallen on deaf ears”. The report comes as rail unions have warned of possible strike action, with the RMT having already announced a ballot of its members. About 2,500 maintenance jobs are set to be cut, leading to 670,000 fewer hours of maintenance work each year, according to analysis by the RMT. The TUC said track maintenance was essential to avoid fatal accidents such as the Hatfield crash in 2000, caused by unnoticed metal fatigue, or Potters Bar in 2002, which was due to poorly maintained points. As well as the track, Network Rail has safety responsibility in providing signalling, power supply to the railway, and the public spaces of the UK’s largest rail stations. The TUC said the government should withdraw any requirement for it to make cuts. It said Network Rail could save £115m a year by bringing all outsourced services back in-house. British railways had the best safety record in Europe for over a decade but crashes at Stonehaven in 2020 and Salisbury last year have renewed concerns. The Treasury has also ordered the Department for Transport to cut its annual budget by 10%, which has led the DfT to tell train operating companies to make major cuts to costs. The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Our railways are still recovering after the pandemic. The last thing the government should be doing is slashing funding. “We need a better vision for the future of Britain’s railways than commuters packed like sardines in unsafe trains. Rail is one of the greenest ways to get around. Ministers need to make rail the most attractive option for more journeys. But you can’t do that by cutting back on safety and services.” The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said over 40,000 rail workers could join picket lines in a strike over the planned cuts. “We are not going to be able to run a safe, clean and efficient railway network if staff are being cut to the bone,” he said, adding that the dispute was not just for his members but “the public’s right to a safe and affordable railway system”. A Network Rail spokesperson said: “Britain’s railway is the safest major network in Europe, and we’d never make changes that would compromise that hard-won achievement. “The modernisation proposals we’ve put on the table would help our workforce be more flexible, enabling us to avoid compulsory job losses [and] help our workforce be safer because they won’t work on live tracks as often. So far our ideas have fallen on deaf ears.” A DfT spokesperson said: “The industry is exploring a range of reform options but none of these should lead to the reduction of safety standards nor impact the railways’ safety for passengers. Industry will still have to fulfil their legal obligations in respect of health and safety.”",News/Business,"Cuts to rail funding threaten passenger s, unions warn",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/network-rails-proposed-cuts-put-passengers-at-risk-say-unions
5/4/2022,"By his own description, Ray Martin has been a journo for “well over half a century”. That tenure has included multiple stints hosting A Current Affair, the job that made him a household name, as well as spots on everything from ABC’s Four Corners to First Contact on SBS. Along the way, Martin has picked up five Gold Logies and an Order of Australia for his work. Last month, the media star unveiled a new documentary, Norfolk Island with Ray Martin, which is now streaming on SBS On Demand. It sees Martin journey to the beautiful island with landscape photographer Ken Duncan in search of the perfect shot. Getting behind the lens is one of Martin’s passions – in fact, he owns over half a dozen cameras and an archive of around 60,000 photographs. Here, Martin tells us why he’s come to prefer photography over writing – plus the story of two other important personal belongings. I spent my early childhood moving from town to town across country New South Wales. All up it was 13 towns before I went to high school. My father was a mechanic and mostly worked on dams, which, for some reason, was a booming business after the second world war. Packing our family’s world into a collection of suitcases meant that toys, personal possessions and especially books were mostly left behind. So there’s little from my childhood that I would sadly miss should a fire strike. Except, perhaps, for a collection of AB Paterson poems, my first Christmas present book. I still have it. It is filled with rollicking pages of verse by The Banjo, published in Sydney in 1955. I cherish this dog-eared, tattered, literary classic that somehow survived my peripatetic wanderings, secreted with my boyhood shirts and underwear. It was given to me by a young English migrant named Eric who came to stay with us for a few days, became my friend and ended up marrying my sister, Joy. Maybe the fact I never grew up surrounded by books explains why they clutter up my study, bedroom and media room today. Many of them are signed, original editions. But it’s the Banjo collection, with the faded dust jacket, that I’d almost certainly grab as the flames licked the stairs behind me. Having been a journalist for well over half a century, I owe my “fame and fortune”, cobwebbed as it is, to words I’ve written. Or spoken. Or jotted on stray bits of paper when I have been caught short of a notebook. But these days, I think I prefer taking photographs. That’s why my cameras are my most useful object. I have probably half a dozen, maybe more. No exaggeration, I must have 60,000 photos in my personal collection. If, as the cliche goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, then no snap I have ever taken is as good as my best thousand-word essay. Or column. Yet I find my camera more satisfying – even therapeutic – than writing. These days, with digital cameras or mobile phones, it’s also instant gratification. Click. Done. And with photos you set your own bar. If you’re happy with the image, well, it’s your art after all! I most regret losing my … virginity. Just kidding. But now that I have your attention, there was one item I’m sorry I lost. When I was first graded as a journalist, in my ABC youth – back in the 1960s – I was sent to Perth as a reporter. My girlfriend, who became my fiance and is now my wife of 50 years, came with me across the other side of Australia. We had no money and even borrowed from the Credit Union for our wedding. Now, as we were making arrangements for our nuptials, an ABC colleague made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. Almost. He was going to London to try his luck with the BBC and had a car that he wanted to give me. Well, he actually wanted 1,500 quid for it. But it certainly was a gift at that price. It was a British racing green, two-door Cooper Bristol tourer which he had found in a farmer’s shed and restored immaculately. Built of aluminium, it had survived the nesting chooks and the elements. Only 1,500 quid. My wife-to-be issued the ultimatum: her or the Cooper Bristol.

5/4/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said reaching a third Champions League final in five seasons with Liverpool felt as good as the first one after his team recovered from a punishing first half to beat Villarreal on a pulsating night in eastern Spain. Liverpool conceded twice before the interval for a 2-2 aggregate scoreline, the stadium rocking as Villarreal advertised a stunning comeback. But inspired by the half-time introduction of Luis Díaz, Liverpool regained their poise to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 overall. Fabinho, Díaz and Sadio Mané scored the goals to set up a final against Real Madrid or Manchester City in Paris, with Mohamed Salah hoping it will be the former. Salah wants to avenge the 2018 loss to Real in the final when he was manhandled out of the game by Sergio Ramos. “I want to play Real Madrid, I have to be honest,” Salah said. “Hopefully we’ll win it from them as well.” Klopp was overjoyed, particularly at the mental toughness that his players showed in the second half. “Outstanding, massive – it feels like the first one because it’s always so special,” the manager said. “I love it, the sound of it … the whole night. “It feels so special because it was so difficult for us. Before the game, I told the boys I wanted the headlines to be the mentality monsters were in town. I wanted it from the first moment but the second half was like that. How we came back in the second half was so special. It was a top performance.” Klopp had wanted to show his players one clip at the interval of something that had gone well in the first half to give them a boost. But the assistant manager, Pete Krawietz, told him there was nothing. Díaz helped to spark the turnaround when he came on for Diogo Jota. “But Jota was not the problem in the first half – we had 11 problems in the first half,” Klopp said. “The start was really difficult. We looked like we were impressed by them. We had no real build-up and we didn’t play in the right spaces. We played into their hands. Our minds were not right. We felt the pressure. It was a football problem in the first half. And we had to solve it with football.” Klopp has made history by becoming the first manager of an English club to reach the finals of the League Cup, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season. “It is really difficult – that is why nobody has ever done it before,” he said. “We will make sure we are ready for these finals. We will give it a go. That’s for sure.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp hails ‘mentality monsters’ after comeback against Villarreal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/jurgen-klopp-hails-mentality-monsters-after-comeback-against-villarreal
5/4/2022,"“You suffer and then ...”, Jürgen Klopp clicked his fingers: “... you react.” It may not have been quite that simple, nor quite so instantaneous, and it certainly wasn’t as effortless as that, but as it turned out Liverpool’s manager wasn’t far off in his prediction. Oh, they had suffered, that was for sure, and they had reacted too. Not so much a click of the fingers, perhaps, as a fist on the red button. A decision too, made in the dressing room at half-time: life is different with Luis Díaz, not least because he is different. And so when it all started up again, there he was. They had needed him. When the half-time whistle went, the Cerámica rose and started to chant: “Yes, we can!” It wasn’t the first time they had done – those words had appeared every so often from the very start – but this time they really meant it: 2-0 up on the night, the aggregate score 2-2 and the game in their grip, Villarreal were on the cusp of something special, another absurd achievement for the team that the Super League would have left behind and that had dignified the Champions League like no one else. Juventus, Bayern ... and Liverpool? Those three clubs have 14 European Cups between them. Villarreal didn’t even have a final, but it was closer now than it had ever been, a roll call of the continent’s biggest clubs defeated en route. Only, much as Liverpool were two goals down for the first time, they weren’t defeated yet and, as Unai Emery had warned, this is a side that can hurt you a thousand ways. “There is no perfect script,” Pau Torres had said, but there was and this was it, better even than they had planned, still less dared to believe. Maybe it was too good? “I look at Villarreal and think: ‘What would I do?’ Two-nil down, maybe you didn’t play your best football. Give it a go. That’s exactly what Villarreal will do. They will go for it,” Klopp had said, another prediction proven correct. It had all seemed so unlikely. Liverpool had not been beaten by more than two goals all season and even the atmosphere didn’t seem conducive to a comeback. A biblical storm had rumbled overnight and all day, rivers in the streets, supporters scurrying for shelter as much as they were singing in the streets. Rarely can the minutes before a European semi-final have felt like less of an occasion, Villarreal’s president Fernando Roig saying he worried that the weather might “take something away from this”. Even if Villarreal were to turn it round, the plan always seemed set to be a cautious one. Emery had talked about needing to be “brutal defensively”. Torres had said that one goal would put them in it and insisted: “If doesn’t matter if that comes in the first minute or the 6oth.” Instead, it came after just three. A second followed after 41, that quiet blown away, belief flooding through them, the noise making this a special night, even ultimately in defeat. Villarreal overran Liverpool, the intensity that had inhibited them before matched now. This was the perfect storm, the rain pouring around them no longer noticed in the stands, too much fun for that. Francis Coquelin, supposedly a defensive midfielder, was dashing behind the full-backs. Dani Parejo was taking control. Gerard Moreno, absent at Anfield, all clever touches. Albiol brought the ball out. Étienne Capoue delivered two wonderfully subtle moments to provide the two goals, the first scored by Boulaye Dia, the second by Coquelin. That was the good news for Villarreal. The bad news was that they had done so much so fast that, like Liverpool, they had a decision to make. Maybe it had been too fast? Level now, they had something to lose, something to hold. The second half would suggest that they might have chosen unwisely or perhaps – a simple fact so often, so easily forgotten – this was more about the team they had in front of them. The team that, led by Díaz, some footballing Sonic the Hedgehog, now tore into them. There was also, it may be as cruel to mention as it would be unrealistic not to, the goalkeeper that stood behind them. Suddenly activated, with Trent Alexander‑Arnold let loose, Mané moving into the middle, that whole red machine moving forward, faster and faster, Liverpool hit Villarreal three times in 12 minutes. Twice the ball went into the net through Gerónimo Rulli’s legs, once he honoured his name by charging from his goal to leave it unguarded. In a flash, a click of the fingers, it was gone. The reaction was ruthless and it was complete. Rulli, the man whose penalty save and penalty scored had taken Villarreal to the Europa League title last season, allowing them to reach the Champions League in the first place, crouched looking lost. Behind him, the Cerámica applauded, broken but proud. As it turned out, no, they couldn’t but for a moment they had really thought they would. They had come a long way. “How could I not love you, when you made me win in Europe for the first time?” the supporters sang, as the final moments played out and Liverpool headed to Paris, seeking their seventh.",Sport/Football,Sonic the Hedgehog rescues Liverpool and ruins Villarreal’s big night | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/03/sonic-the-hedgehog-rescues-liverpool-and-ruins-villarreals-big-night
5/4/2022,"A 77-year-old woman who has only one meal a day and travels on buses during the day to keep her household bills down was “disappointed” with Boris Johnson’s response to her plight in an interview with Good Morning Britain, the show’s presenter Susanna Reid has said. The prime minister was challenged by Reid about Elsie’s financial predicament and increasing energy bills on the ITV programme. Johnson, the former London mayor, replied: “The 24-hour freedom bus pass [allowing free bus travel for over-60s in London] was actually something that I actually introduced.” Speaking to LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr about her interview on Tuesday with the prime minister, Reid said: “I’ve spoken to Elsie, since the interview this morning with the prime minister, and she says how disappointed she is with what he said. “Because she says there are people who are even worse off than she is, and there was no answer for them, apart from ‘oh I was the person who was responsible for the bus pass,’ I mean, as if she’s supposed to be grateful.” Andrew Marr added: “Which is by the way, not entirely accurate itself because it was the London boroughs who brought that in.” According to Reid, Elsie’s gas and electricity bill has soared from £17 to £85 a month. She has lost weight after reducing herself to one meal a day and shops only in the late afternoons when price-reduced “yellow sticker” items come on sale. The prime minister had said to Reid that there were “plenty of things more that we are doing”, adding: “What we want to do is make sure that we have people who are in particular hardship looked after by their councils, so we are putting much more money into local councils. “We have the particular payments to help elderly people in particular with the cost of heating.” Pushed on what Elsie should cut back on, he said: “I don’t want Elsie to have to cut back on anything.” Johnson added: “The best answer is to help her abate the cost of energy as we are, but also … to make sure there’s a direct cut in her council tax as a result of what we’re doing.” During the interview, the prime minister also highlighted the winter fuel allowance and other “measures that we’ve put in place to help people”. He said the government is “making sure that we take the steps now to invest in our energy supply” to “ensure that we have the supply for the medium and the long term”.",News/Business,"Elsie ‘disappointed’ with Boris Johnson’s response, says Susanna Reid ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/elsie-disappointed-with-boris-johnsons-response-says-susanna-reid
