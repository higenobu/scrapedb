1/2/2022,"A charity founded by Denise Coates, the billionaire boss of online gambling firm Bet365, has reduced its donations to good causes from £9m to £6m, despite its reserves swelling by almost 50% to £568m. Accounts filed at Companies House detail the charitable activity of the foundation set up by Coates, Britain’s best-paid woman, whose £421m pay-and-dividend package for 2020 took her earnings beyond £1bn in four years.  Divisions of her Stoke-based Bet365 empire donated £100m to the Denise Coates Foundation in the year to 28 March 2021, the accounts show, while investments held by the charity grew in value by £86.5m. The twin windfalls meant that the reserves of the charity, founded in 2014, soared from £385.3m to £568.4m, a rise of 48%. The volume of charitable donations declined, however, falling from £9m in 2020 to £6.2m. The accounts state that donations were “constrained” because the organisations the charity funds have been restricted in their activities. The volume of grants was expected to “bounce back” in future years, the foundation said. While the reserves of the Denise Coates Foundation increased by £183m, according to the accounts, the charities regulator does not have strict policies on how much should be held relative to donations. Charity Commission guidance published in 2016 stresses there is “no single level, or even a range of, reserves that is right for all charities”. According to the guidance, organisations with bigger reserves than necessary could re-examine spending and “trustees must consider whether the purposes of the charity should be amended to enable the charity to operate more effectively”. The Denise Coates Foundation does address the volume of reserves it holds in comments attached to its accounts. It states that the charity’s policy is to use the donations it receives from the Coates family business empire to build up its reserves of cash and investments, which rose from £385.3m to £568.3m. Any income and gains on investments is then distributed over the course of one to five years. “This policy should allow the foundation to operate on an enduring basis without being dependent on donations from any one source,” the accounts state. During the year, the charity increased the amount of “unrestricted” funds available for donations by £15.5m to £20.2m. Donations made in 2021 included £1.9m to University Hospitals of North Midlands, the NHS trust in Stoke-on-Trent, the home of the Coates family, who own Stoke City football club and have based Bet365 there. In April last year, Denise Coates, who is worth more than £8bn together with her family, announced a £10m donation to the trust, to support staff battling the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, the foundation made 17 donations to 12 institutions, including a £500,000 grant to the Chronic Disease Research Foundation to research Covid-19. Other recipients include the Douglas Macmillan Hospice, which received £300,000 to help fund care for 137 patients. The charity also gave £200,000 towards a Covid-19 appeal launched by Catholic overseas development organisation Cafod and £300,000 towards Kick4Life, a project building a sports stadium in Lesotho to promote social change. The charity did not make any donations to charities tackling gambling-related harm, either this year or last. Like other gambling companies, Bet365 donates to gambling-related charities via a voluntary industry-wide levy, which campaigners have said should be mandatory, in order to address the lack of treatment options for gambling addicts in the UK. The company’s roots are in the network of bookmaking operations started by Peter Coates in Stoke-on-Trent. His daughter Denise is credited with spotting the opportunities offered by taking bets online, building Bet365 into a pioneering and hugely profitable betting firm with global reach. Bet365 reported an 8% fall in revenue to £2.81bn last year, partly due to the cancellation of sporting events due to the Covid pandemic. Operating profit fell by 74% to £194.7m, down from £758.3m in 2019.

1/2/2022,"Individual experiences and suffering are, of course, at the heart of the pandemic. But one way to understand what has happened is through putting those experiences together – and statistics are those personal stories writ large. And this pandemic has brought unprecedented demand to explain all the numbers that have been flying around. This has not been without its problems and we’ve had to learn some hard lessons, such as the journalistic skill of brevity. Since January 2021, we’ve been writing a weekly column in this paper about Covid numbers, covering everything from infections to deaths, vaccines to mental health, masks to lockdowns.  It can be frustrating not being able to show all the graphs, but the same holds for radio and TV interviews and More or Less on Radio 4 has shown how much can be done to explain statistics without visual aids. Mathematical formulae and technical jargon need to be avoided, but we have also had to be sparing with numbers, which is harder when they are so precious to us. We had to agree our purpose, as a particular challenge is to fend off the voracious media appetite for blame, speculation and controversy, naturally fed by the broad spectrum of opinion among experts. One camp has supported viral suppression and even elimination, while others have expressed scepticism about the measures taken; it’s become a cliche that their extreme followers can be identified by the phrase “I’ve done my own research”. In the theatre of political combat, numbers are often weapons to beat opponents, but they should really be used to raise the quality of the debate. So we see ourselves as part of a group who have attempted to keep away from policy disputes and some of our most trusted sources are skilled individuals doing analyses in their spare time, who then share their insights on Twitter – to inform rather than persuade. Unfortunately, this pandemic has been rife with false claims and misinformation, particularly about vaccines. One approach for dealing with this, supported by empirical evidence, is the idea of “inoculation” – pre-empting misinformation and telling people about the incorrect interpretation before they catch it in the wild. We tried this strategy back in June 2021 when Public Health England first published data showing that, among older people who had recently died with Covid-19, most had been vaccinated. We wrote an article pointing out that this did not mean the vaccine was ineffective – just that it was imperfect – and that the great majority of people had been vaccinated: in essence, a small proportion of a large number can be bigger than a larger proportion of a small number. Another useful analogy is with seatbelts: most people who die in car accidents are wearing seatbelts, but this does not mean that seatbelts are not effective – it’s just that nearly everyone wears one and they are not perfect. The response to our “pre-bunking” was not encouraging. The Twitter link to our article included only its title, Why most people who now die with Covid in England have had a vaccination, and not the subhead, Don’t think of this as a bad sign, it’s exactly what’s expected from an effective but imperfect jab. As such, it was mistakenly interpreted as an anti-vaccination article (or worse) and circulated online. This, in turn, led to critical comments suggesting that we had encouraged vaccine scepticism and even an extraordinary tweet saying we (and the paper’s editors) were “genocidal” and should be “hunted down and destroyed”. We made light of this, saying this seemed a bit harsh, but we had had worse referees’ reports. That account was subsequently removed from Twitter. Among the repeatable insults, DS has been called an “idiot”, a “shameless liar” and “Nazi collaborator”. Of course, this is mild compared to what others have received (although “fossil” did hurt). It got more complicated in September 2021 when ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, tweeted (and later deleted) “Infections higher among double vaxxed for those 40 to 79 than for non-vaxxed”. Surprisingly, he was not referring to the absolute case numbers, which could be explained using the reasoning above. Instead, this referred to the case rates per 100,000 people reported by Public Health England. That seems strange, but can be explained by PHE’s use of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) for population figures, which uses GP lists and so tends to overcount due to many and defunct registrations. Using Office for National Statistics (ONS) population estimates, themselves uncertain, leads to the expected lower case-rates in vaccinated than unvaccinated groups. This UK data, apparently showing higher case rates in the vaccinated than the unvaccinated, was later used by Brazil’s President Bolsonaro to support his bizarre claim that vaccines cause Aids. Complaints by the watchdog Office for Statistics Regulation have had little impact and PHE’s successor, the UK Health Security Agency, stubbornly refuses to change its publication (even though unvaccinated rates are in a lighter font), so that these misleading numbers continue to feed vaccine misinformation. These stories might give a poor impression of how the media has handled Covid-19 numbers. But, on balance, our impression is that a valiant attempt has been made by most outlets to explain their complexities. All, of course, impossible without the extraordinary behind-the-scenes work of those who produce the Covid dashboard, the ONS Infection Survey, and the other sources that it is too easy to take for granted. We started working together through the Royal Statistical Society, since statisticians care deeply about the use of numerical evidence in public debate. Data does not speak for itself – it needs people to speak honestly and carefully on its behalf. A misunderstood statistic could have terrible consequences – in health, wealth and justice. By contrast, better statistics should lead to better debate and, we hope, better decisions.  David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

1/2/2022,"“The poor are always with us. So speaks the man who has not learned to use a whip correctly!” And also thus spake the unsung genius comedian Simon Munnery, in character in his 90s parody of impotent bedsit fascism, The League Against Tedium. The act seems arguably less satirical today as its best lines have become actual government thinking. What is Priti Patel’s proposed Channel migrant policy if not, however it is dressed up in the sterile language of info-deterrence and reasonable force and common sense and re-seized sovereignty and taking back control, merely cudgelling children back into the cold sea to die, the Kindertransport in satanic reverse? But what are we to do with the poor, who have the temerity to seem especially visible over the festive season, the smelly bastards? A week before Christmas, I waited in the small hours at a bus stop outside Dalston’s Rio cinema, having spoken at the Covid-decimated London premiere of a film I wrote, King Rocker (“the new gold standard for rockumentaries” – the Scotsman). A babbling woman in a bobble hat approached me for money and, it being Christmas, I fished in my pocket. After all, it was highly likely the exuberant lich was in fact a manifestation of Christ himself, come to test my generosity, something that I am convinced has happened to me on several previous occasions. I would not banish this Dalston Christ to the lowly stable. I would welcome her at my Christmas Inn of Spare Change. For I am a good man.  Sadly, the only cash I had on me was a sizable Scottish £10 note, having just got back from Glasgow, which I was reluctant to part with. Even the disguised Christ would probably consider such ostentatious generosity over the top, the work of a whited sepulchre. I’m not made of money, especially after two years of no live gigs and the cost of the resultant need to drink heavily in order to compensate for the withdrawal of the massed nightly adoration of strangers. Nonetheless, I didn’t see any way out of the increasingly awkward situation except to hand the money over, as I was wary of being judged as ungenerous by the other two people at the bus stop, who might also have been further manifestations of the Christ. Perhaps they were appearing together as the holy trinity: the father, the son and the babbling woman in the bobble hat? “What the fuck is this?” said my beggar Christ, angrily, on receiving the money, divine but nonetheless a Cockney, and thus culturally baffled by unfamiliar sterling, and also excellent at swearing. “It’s a Scottish £10 note,” I said, before adding: “If you can’t use it I’ll have it back,” sensing a way of getting my money returned while nonetheless having made the kind of generous offer that would secure me a decent placing in St Peter’s judgmental ledger. “No, no, you’re all right,” said Christ, scuttling off into the Dalston dark with my Scotch dosh. But the dilemmas didn’t end there. “I’ll have a tenner if you’re giving them away,” shouted a tall man at the other end of the bus stop, angrily. “I didn’t mean to give her £10, it was all I had,” I said, defensively, realising it was possible to interpret my unintended generosity as offensively profligate. But then, realising the man may also be yet another Christ, attempting to provoke me into revoking the moral worth of my charity, I quickly added: “But it is Christmas, so if you can’t give a beggar £10 at Christmas when can you?” But the angry Christ continued. “They just spend it on crack. That’s where she’s gone now, to a crack den. You’re a fucking idiot.” Then an old woman Christ, who until now had been sitting quietly on the artfully angled bus sheltered seat, “defensively designed” to be just too thin and too slippery to enable a homeless person to sleep on it, piped up: “It’s fucking Christmas, let him give his fucking money to whoever he wants.” This, of course, would be exactly what Christ would say, albeit in less-colourful language. Could both my Dalston bus-stop debaters be Christ? Yes, if you subscribe to the Manichaean doctrine of dualism, made manifest here tonight, an inexplicable theological survival, in this east London street. The angry man and the kind woman continued to argue with each other as my bus arrived and I slipped away unnoticed, leaving behind me a scatological street-level reimagining of Radio 4’s bloodless Moral Maze, passionate debate replacing masturbatory self-congratulation, educated arrogance and Baroness Fox. But what is to be done? Will it be the be-jumpered LadBaby, loyally singing about inoffensive sausage rolls at No 1 for the Trussell Trust food banks every Christmas for all eternity now, without addressing the roots of the poverty their offal-inclusive songs seek temporarily to alleviate? Or will the novelty-single-loving British public join the dots and condemn the policies that create the need for both food banks, and the meat and pastry music of LadBaby, and vote out those responsible, who explicitly see wealth as a reward for virtue and poverty as punishment for laziness? On its website, the Trussell Trust’s own “strategic plan” is cautious to avoid direct political comment, anxious, I expect, to avoid being made into a culture war pawn by the usual unscrupulous bad faith operators on the right. Shadows take my hand and mist is on the land. Do we just wait until Christ comes back, with his baked-bean hampers and his top-down plan to end poverty? Until then, we live in a crumbling city built not on rock, but on sausage rolls.

1/2/2022,"Of the handful of historic working farms in the UK, Acton Scott Farm is perhaps the best known. The Shropshire farm was the setting for the BBC series Victorian Farm, and generations of schoolchildren have visited the rolling Shropshire hills to see the shire horses plough the fields and the dairymaid milk the cows. Yet the future of the farm is in serious doubt. Shropshire council, which runs the farm, shut it down in June after an outbreak of E coli and there are no plans to reopen it.  In the coming weeks, the council will launch a consultation inviting the public to come up with ideas about how to fund Acton Scott Farm, which it says loses £168,000 a year. But campaigners are desperate to ensure the survival of England’s first historic working farm, where workers in period costume demonstrate traditional skills and use horse-drawn ploughs to work the land and manage the rare breed livestock. Already there are concerns among the villagers in Church Stretton that the decision has in effect been taken. Shropshire council’s cabinet had been due to consider an “options appraisal” in November, but the decision was delayed by the byelection caused by Owen Paterson’s resignation as the MP for North Shropshire. This month’s consultation was announced only after a local campaign had begun. Some of the farm animals have already been sold. The flock of six pygmy goats is gone. Of the five Gloucester Old Spot pigs, only two are left. The Shropshire sheep, the Dairy Shorthorn cattle and the pair of magnificent shire horses remain, as do the ducks, geese and chickens, although they are in lockdown to avoid becoming infected with bird flu. Shropshire council said that animals are sold regularly as part of the farm’s stock management programme and the majority of the rare breed animals have remained. The campaign to save the farm was started by Alice Walker, a barmaid in Church Stretton who has been a regular visitor since she was a child. “It’s a really special place,” she said. “You can see them tacking up the horses and ploughing the ground, then drilling it with old drills. We have visitors from all over – Australia, America – there’s a big Canadian following.” The farm was founded in 1975 by Tom Acton, whose family has owned the farm estate for more than 900 years. His ancestor, Richard Acton, built the family’s Elizabethan manor house in 1580. Acton, who died last year aged 95, had been keen to retain traditional farm methods and had built a collection of Victorian seed drills and ploughs. It was picked by the BBC for Victorian Farm, a series charting a year when the historian Ruth Goodman and archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn lived on the farm reliving the experience of Victorian farmers. The farm also offers training and qualifications in traditional rural crafts and trades, from stone masonry to wheelwrighting, and Walker did an NVQ there when she was young. “We started to hear whispers,” Walker said. “We had the Covid closures, and then the E coli outbreak. I thought it was slipping off the radar and it might have closed without anybody realising it was even an option. So I started a group. “I thought it would be me and my mum shouting in a room, but we had 1,000 Facebook members in less than a month.” The group has had all sorts of support – from a woman whose mother donated her old English game chickens to the farm when it opened to people whose grandfather was educated in the schoolhouse. The Rare Breed Survival Trust has also offered its support, and the chief executive, Christopher Price, wrote to the council last month, urging it to “ensure that the farm remains safeguarded for the future”. The E coli outbreak in June involved two visits and a council health and safety report recommended “essential works” costing £130,000 were required. Shropshire council said that visitor numbers peaked at around 45,000 a year in 2009, when Victorian Farm first aired. However, since then, numbers have fallen to an average of 20,000 a year since 2014, the council said. A spokesperson said: “Shropshire council, like many other local authorities, is facing an extremely challenging financial future and it is in this climate that an options appraisal has been undertaken to determine whether an alternative commercially viable model is achievable.” Cecilia Motley, Shropshire council’s cabinet member for communities, culture, leisure and tourism, and transport, said: “Shropshire council recognises the value Acton Scott holds for many people and is committed to supporting the landowners and the local community over the coming months and we look forward to hearing thoughts and suggestions when we open discussion in the new year.” Francis Acton, for the Acton Scott Estate, said: “It is clear that there is a large community who have a great affection for the historic working farm. The Acton family will support the consultation and work with Shropshire council to explore future options.”",Arts/Culture,Villagers fight to keep BBC Victorian Farm in business,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/02/villagers-fight-to-keep-bbc-victorian-farm-in-business
1/2/2022,"A female conductor will take the helm at an Italian opera house for the first time in January. The Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv said she was surprised to learn she was making history after receiving the offer from the Teatro Comunale opera house in Bologna. The 43-year-old begins the three-year posting as musical director on 22 January.  “I didn’t realise, when I received the letter from the Teatro Comunale, that I would be the first female conductor of an Italian opera house,” she said. “I am very honoured and happy to be part of this historical turning point.” It is not the first time Lyniv, who was previously principal conductor of Austria’s Graz Opera, has broken new ground. In July, she became the first female conductor to open Germany’s Bayreuth opera festival in its 145-year-history. She conducted Richard Wagner’s Flying Dutchman to a rapturous audience that included the former German chancellor Angela Merkel. Born in Brody, western Ukraine, to musician parents, Lyniv conducted her first orchestra at the age of 16 before going on to study at the Lysenko music school in Lviv. She said it was difficult for female musicians to get on at the time as the majority of conductors and teachers were male. “There was no live example of a woman who we could learn or get advice from,” Lyniv added. “But it is less of a struggle now – in orchestras today you see many more women. The conditions are much better now as society is thinking more about equal rights – so young female conductors should not hold back, they should grab the opportunities and go for it.” Lyniv said Italy was “a very important place for the arts and opera” and that “it’s important that this change is happening now”. Her first opera production will be Andrea Chénier by Umberto Giordano and she will also conduct the music of some of her favourite composers, including Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Bruckner, Richard Strauss and the Ukrainian composer Boris Lyatoshinsky. Bologna’s Teatro Comunale opened its doors in 1763 with a performance of Christoph Willibald Gluck’s Il trionfo di Clelia (The Triumph of Cloelia), and went on to host Wagner as well as some of Italy’s greatest composers, including Verdi, Rossini and Bellini.

1/2/2022,"‘They grow up fast’ is a thing people say to parents of toddlers and we generally nod in agreement because, I mean, I guess – but do they, really? Sure, we have to buy him new clothes more frequently than we do ourselves, but it’s not exactly blink and you’ll miss it stuff. They grow up fast? Compared to what? Whales? Trees? Kids certainly grow slower than cats or dogs or cows or any other animal I can think of. I think elephants and whales take a while, but I’m not willing to look it up because I’m too busy cleaning tomato soup from every surface of the kitchen for the fifth time this week – something I’m fairly sure a three-and-a-half-year-old porpoise or badger would have grown out of by now. In the hopes of getting a sense of my son’s development over the past year, let’s take a clear-eyed survey of how much has actually changed. Speech is one of the areas of his development where time really does seem to have flown. When we watch videos of him from this time last year, helooks broadly the same, albeit a bit more squished and pudgy, but is still communicating in semi-garbled baby speech, whereas nowadays he’s one of the finest conversationalists I know. I am willing to admit that his propensity for chat is genuinely impressive, and the difference 12 months has made seems to stretch the bounds of reason. He has also gained the ability to learn any song you care to teach him, which has entered critical mass during the Christmas period. In terms of growing up fast, I’d have to give this a 9 out of 10, losing points only since he has miraculously not yet memorised any of the swear words he’s occasionally copied from us.  In terms of hygiene, he’s come on in leaps and bounds and this could be another high scoring quadrant for this year end review, – certainly when it comes to issues such as wanting to eat soil and/or drink toilet water. That being said, the ups and downs of toilet training have occasionally left us having to dispose of human waste in plastic bags while in public places. In conclusion, a mixed bag, and one occasionally filled with human waste. Arguably the most impressive change has been in coordination, since there’s no doubt the boy has progressed rapidly in this regard. He can now climb surfaces, manipulate objects and navigate his way around the wider world with an aplomb that would have seemed like science fiction 12 months ago. But, as his mobility and ambition have increased so, too, have his opportunities to enfilthen himself, and at higher places in our home. This time last year, for example, he would not have been able to open a jar of jam, nor climb into our bed. Now he can, and will, do both at the same time; allowing us to gently wake to the sensation of being stuck to our own sheets in a sugary, syrupy mess. At such moments, my wife and I rejoice in our sticky, strawberry morning, and are likely to marvel at his development anew. ‘If this is him growing up so fast,’ we say with calm delight, ‘then, frankly, it’s taking ages.’ Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

1/2/2022,"A Very British Scandal (BBC One) | iPlayerThe Tourist (BBC One) | iPlayerAround The World in 80 Days (BBC One) | iPlayerStay Close (Netflix) | netflix.com Four very different dramas got us through that zone between Christmas and new year that can feel as though your soul is a half-masticated blini hurtling into the void. BBC One’s three-part A Very British Scandal, written by Sarah Phelps and directed by Anne Sewitsky, told the real-life story of unrepentant “scarlet woman” Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll (Claire Foy), whose vicious 1963 divorce from the Duke of Argyll (Paul Bettany) featured a notorious photograph of her fellating a mysterious (headless) lover.  Here, then, is another high-end soapy serving of sexed-up British history (2018’s A Very English Scandal dealt with the Jeremy Thorpe affair), with Foy as an intriguing duchess. The appeal of her Elizabeth in The Crown was as a young housewife-queen: flustered, blushing, eager to please. Margaret is just as porcelain-skinned, but also glacial, sexual, a pouting wolf. The decadence is there when she and her future husband flirt up a storm on a train. Less so when she attends the sex party of her aristo-friend Maureen (a viperish Julia Davis), where debauchery is represented by a somewhat tragic clockwork penis trundling across a table top (toff-swinging, it seems, wasn’t all it was cracked up to be). Later, Margaret rounds on Maureen for mocking her sexual appetite, snapping: “I do like it. I like it very much. And I’m extremely good at it.” A Very British Scandal isn’t really about sex; it’s about the hypocrisy surrounding sex. It’s also about cut-glass savagery. The duke, acidly played by Bettany, is vile, druggy, violent and after Margaret’s money. Margaret stammers helplessly in front of her scathing mother (Phoebe Nicholls, chilly and superb). After the duke steals the photographs, and the divorce turns even more rancid, Margaret is expelled from elite circles: “We will close ranks.” There are no innocents here: Margaret, the third wife, forges letters to try to get his sons disinherited. Though she was an early victim of media-shaming, she’s too haughty and entitled to break your heart. Wisely, Foy doesn’t focus on making Margaret sympathetic; instead she makes her human – complex, messy, bold. You’re rooting for her as she sticks out her chin in court and admits to being the woman in the photograph. Within a few short years, the 60s would be swinging; sure, predominantly for men, but free spirits like Margaret may have benefited. She may not be a perfect fit for feminist or heroine, but she was a woman born cruelly out of time. Harry and Jack Williams (The Missing, Liar) wrote The Tourist, an Australian-set, six-part thriller starring Jamie Dornan (The Fall) and directed by Chris Sweeney and Daniel Nettheim. It starts out like a homage to Steven Spielberg’s 1971 film Duel. Dornan is driving alone in the sweaty, hazy outback when he’s menaced by a dusty truck with an unseen driver – all we see is a boot pressing on a pedal. After being rammed off the road, Dornan wakes up in hospital, with amnesia, as the Man. When he goes to a meeting in a diner he has written on a scrap of paper, he narrowly avoids being blown up. From there, The Tourist is a blur of mysteries: who is the Man? Does he genuinely have amnesia? Who’s the other guy we see buried alive in the desert? Other characters drift through: Danielle Macdonald (Dumplin’, Unbelievable) as a self-effacing, underestimated cop you could imagine ambling about in Fargo; Shalom Brune-Franklin (Line of Duty) as a waitress who seems more involved than she’s letting on. Dornan convinces as the good guy who could be a bad guy, and there’s a rough, homemade feel to the proceedings that at times turns nightmarish, hallucinatory. The outback scenes burn through the screen, grimy and desperate. Tension builds as the Man manoeuvres his wheelchair down a dark hospital corridor. I have only seen the opener, but already The Tourist feels taut, jagged and distinctive, the best Williams offering since The Missing. Sadly, watching the opening two episodes of Around the World in 80 Days (BBC One) felt like it took 80 days. Set in 1872, this eight-part version of the Jules Verne story about the gentleman-adventurer, dramatised by Ashley Pharoah and Caleb Ranson, stars David Tennant: a good actor (so scary in Des), but his Phileas Fogg is so underpowered, navel-gazing, feeble, it’s a surprise he can cross the road unaided, never mind take on wagers to circumnavigate the globe. The onus is on Fogg’s companions – Ibrahim Koma as roguish valet Passepartout; Leonie Benesch as an intrepid journalist – to provide the vim: first amid Paris riots, then on board an Italian train as, with Fogg’s ingenuity, they cross a wrecked bridge to save a child’s life. I rather enjoyed the brazen anachronisms: “I need a man like a fish needs a penny farthing!” However, the excitement of the hot-air balloon – the first sighting, the maiden voyage – is dampened by soggy Fogg’s lachrymose yearning to prove himself: “No man in the world knows more about lost opportunity than me.” Less hot air from Fogg and more into the balloon, and this series might yet take off. Over on Netflix, Stay Close, adapted by Harlan Coben from his novel, is an eight-part thriller about hunting a serial killer from the same team, including writer Danny Brocklehurst, that made Coben’s The Stranger for Netflix in 2020. The ever-brilliant Cush Jumbo (The Good Fight) plays a woman who has fled her past but finds it catching up with her. James Nesbitt (The Missing) is a morose cop who falls for Sarah Parish’s earthy bar manager. Richard Armitage, who was also in The Stranger, turns up as a dishevelled photographer, and Eddie Izzard is a lawyer with a social conscience. Stay Close is slick, bullishly fast-paced and – spoiler alert – features antiheroes, played by Hyoie O’Grady and Poppy Gilbert, who make Killing Eve’s Villanelle seem eminently reasonable. I guessed the killer early on, but that didn’t stop me enjoying it. Coben knows how to make plots bounce, swerve and tantalise until the finish. Death to 2021(Netflix)This annual roundup, co-executive-produced by Charlie Brooker, is getting heat for jokes about the “Duke of Deadinburgh”. With pops at Trump, anti-vaxxers and Jeff Bezos, and contributors including Hugh Grant and Diane Morgan, it’s better (sharper) than last year.

1/2/2022,"Alexis Gauthier used to sell 20kg of foie gras a week. Now the chef, whose London-based restaurant became entirely vegan in 2021, only sells a plant-based version. Since becoming vegan, he admits, Gauthier Soho has “lost a lot of customers, sadly”. But he says he has gained even more new diners, all looking for something different and sustainable and prepared to pay the price. Gauthier is not the only chef to abandon the animal produce traditionally associated with fine dining. While the number of meat-free menus has been burgeoning for some time in lower- and mid-priced restaurants, now a growing number of the world’s top chefs are starting to put plants centre stage.  Chef Daniel Humm has created headlines on both sides of the Atlantic twice in recent months. First when he announced that his three Michelin-starred New York restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, would be reopening after a pandemic hiatus in June minus meat or seafood on its $335 menu (but not completely free of animal products. “The current food system is simply not sustainable,” he said). Then, in November, it was announced that he had parted ways with five-star hotel Claridge’s after it rejected his “bold new vision” of a fully plant-based menu for its restaurant, Davies and Brook, which serves, amongst other things, foie gras and caviar. The hotel said it was “not the path we wish to follow”. And in January, Geranium in Copenhagen, ranked number two by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, will unveil a new meat-free menu of vegetarian, plant-based and seafood dishes. Announcing the move, chef Rasmus Kofoed said that he hadn’t eaten meat for the last five years at home, “so to no longer use meat on the new menu was a logical decision and a natural progression for Geranium”. Even the Michelin Guide, which rarely used to award stars to vegetarian and vegan restaurants, appears to be moving in a plant-based direction. Last year, Claire Vallée’s restaurant ONA (which stands for origine non-animale) in Arès, near Bordeaux, became the first vegan restaurant in France to be awarded a star. They have also introduced green stars, a new award to recognise sustainability. Gauthier – whose plant-based menu is 50% vegan versions of classic French dishes like soufflé or foie gras and the other half is more experimental – said many chefs, particularly French chefs, fear losing Michelin stars and remain bound by the “tyranny of classical French gastronomy”. The ongoing influence of Auguste Escoffier, author of the 1903 Le Guide Culinaire and former director of kitchens at the Savoy, is, he said, a “massive problem for French gastronomy to move forward”. By contrast, Gauthier sees plant-based food as an opportunity to be truly creative. “We can write recipes that are totally out of the ordinary and nobody can come and say ‘well actually, it should not be done like that’ because it’s all new. That’s the beauty of it.” While animals are off the menu, he said everything else remains the same. “It’s remaining 100% French, the flavours, all the tralala you think about when you go to a French restaurant.” So far, he said, the move to veganism has been “a commercial success”. As chef patron of one of the few high-end vegan restaurants in London, Gauthier hopes more chefs will follow suit. “Not a lot of chefs are brave enough to embrace a fully vegan restaurant, but a lot are looking into it and testing the water,” he said. French chef Dominique Crenn, stopped serving meat at her three Michelin-starred San Francisco restaurant Atelier Crenn in 2018. Speaking from her farm in Sonoma, where she grows produce for her three restaurants, she said it is vital that restaurants and consumers know where their products come from and do not support factory farming. But, unlike some, she is not averse to experimenting with lab-grown meat. She has partnered with Upside Foods to develop recipes for cultured chicken that, once it gets regulatory approval, she plans to serve at her restaurant. She said that when she first heard about the concept in 2015, “I thought that was genius because the bottom line is we’re not going to have the world eating just vegetables. There’s going to be people that are always going to want to eat meat or fish and all that, so I think it’s about finding ways of rebalancing this world.” She is also looking at cutting cow’s milk from her establishments, which she hopes to do in 2022 and, when it comes to seafood, she works with small-scale fishers and mostly serves molluscs. “I’m just looking at what I can do and keep working on to become better and become more conscious.” In the UK, younger people are leading the charge when it comes to switching to a vegan diet, while the availability of documentaries such as Cowspiracy, Seaspiracy and The Game Changers on Netflix has opened up conversations around the subject. But, in many ways, UK institutions have been slow to catch up. The latest series of BBC One show MasterChef: The Professionals drew criticism after it featured just 10 vegetarian savoury dishes out of 100 and only two for vegans. Channel 4’s The Great British Bake Off also attracted ire after its first vegan contestant, Freya Cox, was required to use animal products in one of the rounds. And while recent years have seen a proliferation of lower-budget or “grab and go” vegan eating-out options, top-end establishments have proven more reluctant. Peter Harden, co-founder of Harden’s restaurant guides, said Claridge’s “missed a trick” by not taking up Humm’s plant-based menu, but that perhaps it indicates that the market is not yet big enough. “They obviously did it because they thought it would be commercial suicide. And I think that highlights the problem, especially for top chefs, is that when people are eating out and spending a lot of money then a very large proportion of them do expect to be able to eat meat.”",Lifestyle/Food,"Out with the meat, in with the plants as world’s top chefs offer vegan menus",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/02/out-with-the-meat-in-with-the-plants-as-worlds-top-chefs-offer-vegan-menus
1/2/2022,"Aman gets a call from a police officer. He is told that, while he has done nothing criminal, his social media posts have offended someone, so the police have recorded them as a non-crime hate incident that may show up on criminal record checks. The officer warns that if he continues to “escalate” matters, the police may take criminal action against him, a message later reinforced by his superiors. It may sound like something out of a police state. But this happened in Britain in 2019, in a case that led the high court judge who later ruled the actions of Humberside police force unlawful to warn them, “in this country we have never had a Cheka, a Gestapo or a Stasi”. Despite there being no evidence that Harry Miller, the man in question, might ever stray into unlawful speech, the police took action that reasonably led him to believe that he was being warned not to exercise his right to freedom of expression on pain of potential criminal prosecution; they also opined to the press that Miller’s tweets were “transphobic”.  And just before Christmas, in a landmark judgment that has attracted surprisingly little commentary from human rights lawyers given its profound implications, the court of appeal went further in ruling that the College of Policing’s guidance that the police should record all non-crime hate incidents, as perceived by those taking offence at them, is an unlawful incursion on citizens’ freedom of expression. How did we get to the position where an individual had to risk financial ruin to legally defend his right to free expression in the face of unlawful police actions? The well-intentioned roots of police recording non-crime hate incidents stem from the 1999 Macpherson report into Stephen Lawrence’s murder in 1993, which found institutional racism in the Metropolitan police. Macpherson recommended that the police adopt the definition of a racist incident as any “perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person” and that non-crime incidents should be reported, recorded and investigated with equal commitment to crimes. The aim was to help the police overcome their institutional racism and to build confidence within ethnic minority communities. This has today evolved into a system of recording non-crime hate incidents that cover five of the nine protected characteristics in the Equality Act, including transgender identity (but not, bizarrely, sex). In a world where the police do not have the resources to investigate non-crime incidents, partly because of the volume of reports generated by social media, the College of Policing tells police officers to record as hate incidents all those perceived by the person reporting them as motivated by hostility, including unfriendliness or dislike. This has become open to manipulation, with sinister consequences for freedom of expression. Anyone can complain to the police if they don’t like something someone says. It will get recorded as a hate incident, in a way that could significantly damage careers and reputations but with none of the due process of a criminal charge. And it is impossible to understate the chilling impact of getting a call from a police officer warning you off exercising your democratic rights. Miller is chair of the Reclaim party, led by Laurence Fox; hardly a political ally of this newspaper. The judge noted his tweets were “for the most part, either opaque, profane or unsophisticated”. But that does not justify impeding his right to contribute to a live and contentious political debate on the relative importance of biological sex and self-declared gender identity in determining how society constitutes things such as single-sex spaces and sports. It is a far from settled matter with legitimate competing perspectives. Yet people (often women) of the “gender critical” view – that biological sex cannot be wholly replaced by gender identity in law and society – have been vulnerable to incursions on their free expression, because opponents have sought to misrepresent their position as so hateful that it is beyond the limits of legitimate discussion. (The absurdity of this mischaracterisation is shown up in the confirmation by the courts last year that the scientific understanding that biological sex is immutable is a protected belief under equalities law.) There are several other cases where the police have acted inappropriately against people lawfully expressing this position. Some forces even have a track record of misstating the law to the public: last February, Merseyside police wrongly claimed “being offensive is an offence”, while the West Yorkshire police in 2018 threatened to prosecute anyone posting “insulting” messages on its Facebook page. The police need to be politically impartial – they must not police people differently because of their political opinions. Yet there are numerous examples of police forces actively taking political sides in the sex and gender debate. Paul Giannasi, the national policing adviser for hate crime, has praised Lancashire police for expressing disappointment at lawful expressions of gender critical belief, congratulating them for their “initiative and empathy” in doing so. Several police forces pay the LGBT charity Stonewall for advice and training, despite Stonewall’s promotion of a contested political stance on gender identity. The police officer who unlawfully warned off Miller told him, Miller said, that a foetus could have a female brain but grow male body parts, later confirming he learned this unscientific belief on a training course. Greater Manchester police social media accounts have used and defended the derogatory and misogynistic term “terf”, associated with rape and death threats against women expressing gender-critical beliefs. Several dreadful murder cases from the last year have served as a reminder that many police forces remain tarnished by institutional misogyny, racism and homophobia. But there are no shortcuts to the cultural change essential for the non-discriminatory policing all citizens have the right to expect. Telling the police to record all non-criminal hate incidents or to believe all victims despite their role as investigators are inappropriately blunt approaches that undermine fair and impartial policing. The court of appeal judgment’s implications for free expression go way beyond policing: it observes “how quickly some involved in the transgender debate are prepared to accuse others with whom they disagree of showing hatred, or as being transphobic when they are not”. We see this everywhere: from Harry Potter actors condemning JK Rowling for her “hateful” views, to broadcasters saying interviewees should be “cancelled” for saying biological sex is immutable, to academics such as Kathleen Stock abused for wrongthink. There is no democracy without freedom of expression. That the police have unlawfully acted to shut down legitimate political debate in 21st-century Britain should remind us that, even in mature democracies, the most basic human rights should never be taken for granted.
