1/25/2022,"There’s so much public health officials are still learning about the Omicron COVID-19 variant, but one thing is certain: It spreads really quickly. Omicron now causes 99.5% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S.—a staggering number considering that this strain was only detected in the country in early December. With that, it’s understandable to wonder about Omicron’s incubation period, i.e. the amount of time it takes from when you’re infected to when you start showing symptoms of Omicron. Here’s what you need to know about Omicron’s incubation period, how long you’re contagious with Omicron, and what all of this means for the future of the pandemic. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed data from six people who contracted the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and found that 73 hours (or three days) was the typical incubation period for patients. However, there was a range: Some developed symptoms as early as 33 hours after being exposed and some became symptomatic after 75 hours. Those symptoms, according to another CDC report, typically include: Cough Fatigue Congestion Runny nose The CDC’s researchers point out that Omicron’s incubation period is definitely shorter than the original SARS-CoV-2 (five days or greater) and the Delta variant (four days). In late December, the CDC shortened the recommended time that people should isolate after they’ve been diagnosed with COVID-19. The agency now recommends that you isolate for five days, provided your symptoms are better or you’re asymptomatic, and follow that up with five days of wearing a mask. The change, the CDC explained at the time, was driven by research that found that most people spread SARS-CoV-2 in the one to two days before they develop symptoms and the two to three days after. So, by that measure, most people are contagious with Omicron for about five days. Regardless of the length of time you're contagious with Omicron, the variant is “much more contagious than previous variants,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The reason, he explains, is that “people exhale much more of the virus and it gives the recipient a larger dose of the virus.” Having a shorter incubation period doesn’t mean Omicron is easier to control, Dr. Schaffner says. “Omicron is so contagious,” he says. “It’s very difficult to inhibit its spread on a population basis.” What the shorter incubation period does mean, though, is that you should consider testing yourself sooner if you had a known exposure to someone with the virus, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. The CDC currently recommends that you test yourself “at least” five days after you’ve had close contact with someone who has COVID-19, but Dr. Russo says it should be shorter with Omicron. “You want to jump on those home tests after about day three of being exposed so you can isolate yourself from others if you’re positive,” he says. If you’re positive, it also means that you may be able to access treatments like monoclonal antibodies or antiviral medications sooner if you’re considered high risk for serious complications from the virus, Dr. Russo says. “Overall, you just have to be ready to be a little more expedient in your actions,” he adds. Omicron’s shorter incubation period is closer to the flu (which has an incubation period of one to four days), Dr. Russo says. “It is definitely more flu-like in that way,” he says. “At the end of the day, though, testing is what will help you differentiate between what you need to do next.” This article is accurate as of press time.

1/25/2022,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Investigators have narrowed the window of the disappearance of a New Hampshire girl missing since late 2019 at age 5 to a 13-day period coinciding with the eviction of her father and stepmother from their home, with witness accounts of the family living in cars, the attorney general's office said Monday. Adam and Kayla Montgomery, together with their two children of their own and Adam's daughter, Harmony Montgomery, were evicted from the Manchester home on Nov. 27, 2019, the office said in a news release. Police searched the home earlier this month, but have released no further information. “Multiple individuals have reported seeing Harmony with Adam and Kayla in the following days; however, by approximately December 6–10, 2019, Adam and Kayla apparently had only their two common children, and Harmony was no longer with them,"" the news release said. “This information leads police to believe that it was sometime during this window of approximately November 28–December 10, 2019, that Harmony Montgomery disappeared."" The witnesses reported that during that time, Adam and Kayla Montgomery and the children were homeless and living out of cars. The attorney general's office provided a description and photos of a silver 2010 Chrysler Sebring, and a dark blue 2006 Audi S4. In court Monday during an appearance for Kayla Montgomery, Assistant Attorney General Jesse O'Neill told a judge “there’s no evidence” that Harmony Montgomery was with her mother after Thanksgiving 2019 — or long before that. He said that Harmony’s mother has been “extremely cooperative” in the investigation. She first reported her daughter was missing last November, and that she had last seen her during a FaceTime conversation in Easter 2019. Kayla Montgomery pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that she lied last year that Harmony was in her household to claim food stamp benefits. O'Neill asked Monday that Kayla Montgomery's $5,000 cash bail continue, saying she was a flight risk and that “she knows what law enforcement is closing in on."" Kayla Montgomery, now estranged from Adam Montgomery, told police on New Year's Eve that she believed Harmony had been returned to her mother back in 2019 after that Thanksgiving and never saw or heard about her again. “Whatever is suggested to or alluded to by the state is not before the court. It is not an allegation facing Ms. Montgomery,"" said her lawyer, Paul Garrity. Garrity said that Kayla Montgomery has appeared in court in past years on various misdemeanor charges and has strong ties to the Manchester area. He suggested that she would qualify for release to be part of a residential program with her children that's described on its website as offering “clinically-intensive rehab treatment"" for substance use disorders. Kayla and Adam Montgomery's children — they now have three — are currently living with Kayla Montgomery's mother in Manchester. The judge took the matter under advisement. Adam Montgomery, 31, was charged earlier this month with several counts, including failing to have Harmony in his custody. He pleaded not guilty and has been jailed without bail. Manchester police said they last saw Harmony in September 2019, during a call to the house. Police are still requesting help from the public in locating Harmony. Anyone with information can call 603-203-6060, he said. Manchester police have also said a reward for information that helps find Harmony has also grown to $144,000.

1/25/2022,"Gov Doug Ducey is suing the Biden administration, claiming he has a constitutional right to use federal funds to help spread a highly contagious, sometimes deadly virus in a state that already is among the nation’s leaders in its rate of COVID-19 infections. Yeah, it doesn’t make sense to me either. But then precious little has made sense since Arizona’s governor long ago decided to ignore public health experts and instead cater to those in his party who see masks as the end of the world as we know it. So now, we’re paying a team of pricey private lawyers to sue Biden. It played well on Fox News and, no doubt, with this term-limited governor’s political advisers. “The Biden administration is attempting to hold Congressionally-appropriated funds hostage and is trying to bully Arizona into complying with this power-grabbing move,” Ducey said on Friday, in announcing his lawsuit. “They’re going after education programs that are designed to help kids access in-person instruction, ensure schools stay open and give parents the ability to make decisions that are best for their kids.” This “power grabbing move” is a pair of letters from the U.S. Treasury Department, warning Ducey that he can’t use American Rescue Act funds to reward school districts and parents who ignore Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend masks inside schools. Ducey, having long ago given up on science, ascended to a whole new level of bizarre in August as the school year got under way and school districts began requiring masks. A new state law barring mask mandates hadn’t yet taken effect and until it did, certain school boards reasoned that it only made sense to try to protect against the spread of COVID-19, as recommended by federal, state, county public health departments as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health care groups. So, naturally, Ducey, desperate to appease to his political base, dreamed up two new inducements to ignore that advice, using federal COVID-relief funds. He offered $1,800 per student in bribes to school districts and charter schools that agreed to forgo mask mandates until the state ban kicked in on Sept. 29. And he offered $7,000 vouchers to parents who wanted to move their children out of public schools that require masks and into private schools that don’t. School districts rushed to cash in. Parents, not so much. As of November, just 93 of them got a voucher to escape a mask mandating school, according to a review by The Arizona Republic. Ultimately, the state ban on school mask mandates was tossed out by the Arizona Supreme Court, but the offer of COVID-relief funds to schools that refuse to require masks stands. And this month, Ducey dreamed up a third federally funded program, offering a $7,000 voucher to any child whose classroom closes even for a day due to COVID-19 infections. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department sent Ducey yet another warning earlier this month – the first came in October – threatening to withhold $173 million in funding, the amount Ducey has spent for the first two programs. “By discouraging families and school districts from following (the CDC’s) guidance, the conditions referenced above (in Ducey’s programs) undermine efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19,” the Treasury Department wrote. Ducey immediately shot back with one of the applause lines from his State of the State speech: “When it comes to education, President Biden wants to continue focusing on masks. In Arizona, we’re going to focus on math and getting kids caught up after a year of learning loss.” When it comes to education, President Biden wants to continue focusing on masks. In Arizona, we’re going to focus on math and getting kids caught up after a year of learning loss. 4/ — Doug Ducey (@dougducey) January 14, 2022 Apparently, all the kids who catch COVID-19 and are now absent from school because of Ducey’s appalling lack of leadership are at home, in bed … doing math? Schools have enacted mask mandates and other public health policies precisely so that they can remain open. Yet here we have a governor who rewards schools that refuse to require masks even as he demands that they remain open. Given that logic, is it any wonder he is (we are) suing Biden? How dare those bullies tell us we can’t use federal money designed to combat a public health emergency to take action that’ll actually worsen that public health emergency?
