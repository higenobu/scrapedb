3/7/2022,"The same day Doreen Langham ended her “controlling and abusive” relationship, she called police seeking help. The Queensland coroner’s court has heard how Langham told officers on that morning – 7 February 2021 – that her former partner, Gary Hely, had threatened her. He told Langham she had “three weeks to live”. Fifteen days later she was killed in a house fire, along with Hely. The counsel assisting the state coroner, Ben Jackson, told a coroner’s inquest on Monday that the police response to Langham’s plea for help was beset by “so many inadequacies”. Langham’s complaints were “quite simply … not properly investigated”, he said. The inquest is examining the police response, including several interactions between Langham and officers between 7 February and 22 February, the day Hely carried out his earlier threat. The court heard Hely had bought 10 litres of petrol, entered Langham’s Browns Plains home and set the property alight. A preliminary hearing last year had been told about a triple-zero call by Langham “seeking protection” earlier that night. Jackson told the hearing that police took an hour to respond, knocked on the door of her unit, and left. In his opening address on Monday, Jackson told the courtroom Langham had endured “many months of controlling and abusive behaviour by Mr Hely” before her first call to police on 7 February. “In the morning he’d made threats to Ms Langham that would send a chill down anyone’s spine. He said she had three weeks to live,” Jackson said. “It was a call to Policelink that alerted police initially to her concerns. They advised her not to return home … she went to a friend’s place in Marsden. It was there that Ms Langham’s many personal interactions with police would begin. “Two officers arrived … her interaction with those officers would be representative of so many inadequacies. “Not all police showed that level of inadequacy. Some understood Ms Langham’s concerns and the risks she faced, and they did what they could to help. Those positive actions were not enough.” Langham’s death last year was one of a number that placed renewed focus on police handling of domestic violence cases. The Queensland government is considering a recommendation to hold a royal commission into police responses to domestic violence cases. The first witness at the inquest, a police officer, said she did not believe she was adequately trained. The officer broke down in tears in the witness box when asked what she would do differently about her interaction with Langham. “I wouldn’t have had so much reliance on her presentation to me, her demeanour,” the officer said. “I would have asked more probing questions. Could she provide messages to me? Did she have any further evidence of anything … that she could offer me? Was there any previous history between the two?” Earlier, Jackson had said he did not suggest any officers had acted with malice towards Langham. “Rather and quite simply, Ms Langham’s complaints were not properly investigated. “Ms Langham had done all she could. She’d shown herself to be … articulate. She knew the danger and the risks that Hely [presented] and as the days went by she did all she could to bring Hely to account and to try to get him to stop.” Jackson said the events of the early morning of 22 February were “clear”. “Hely entered her home. It’s almost impossible to think that Ms Langham let him in. He forced his entry. Hely brought with him an amount of petrol. He’d bought an amount of 10 litres the previous day while in the area. “Hely … had a plan and that plan actually came about. Ms Langham would perish in her own home and that was due to a fire that Hely had started. “Whatever they were, and whatever your honour finds, one thing is clear: Ms Langham’s last moments must have been filled with utter terror.” The court has temporarily suppressed the names of police officers giving evidence.",News/Australia news,"Police response beset by ‘so many inadequacies’ ahead of Doreen Langham’s death, inquest hears",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/07/police-response-beset-by-so-many-inadequacies-ahead-of-doreen-langhams-death-inquest-hears
3/7/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a strident address to his nation on Sunday night, warning Russian troops he will punish those who committed atrocities in Ukraine while saying the “only quiet place” that awaits them is the grave. “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war on our land.” Zelenskiy spoke of the death of a family who were attempting to flee the Ukrainian city of Irpin, near Kyiv in northern Ukraine, in an emotional plea to honour humanitarian corridors that Russian forces appear to have ignored. Eight civilians were killed in the city as evacuations were under way, according to mayor Oleksandr Markushyn. The Ukrainian president criticised western leaders for failing to respond to the Russian defence ministry’s announcement that it would strike Ukraine’s military-industrial complex. “I didn’t hear even a single world leader react to this,” he said. “The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the west that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not sufficient.” A plane carrying Russian diplomats expelled by the United States left New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport en route to Moscow about 7.30pm EST, according to Flight Radar24 data. The US does not believe a Russian amphibious assault in or near the Ukrainian city of Odesa is imminent, a senior US defence official said, according to Reuters. There have been growing concerns about a possible attack on the city. Russia has instructed all state-owned websites and services to switch to the Russian domain name system by 11 March, according to Russian state media outlets. Many fear the move is a sign that Russia is beginning active preparations for disconnection from the global internet. Meanwhile, hacking collective Anonymous claimed to have hacked into the Russian streaming services Wink and Ivi and live TV channels Russia 24, Channel One and Moscow 24 to broadcast footage from Ukraine. Ukraine will ask the United Nations’ top court on Monday to issue an emergency ruling requiring Russia to stop its invasion, arguing that Moscow’s justification for the attack is based on a faulty interpretation of genocide law, Reuters reports. British prime minister Boris Johnson has pledged to send more defensive equipment and $100m to Ukraine to hold off Russian troops and mitigate financial pressures facing the country, but was accused of moving too slowly and timidly to clamp down on oligarchs’ dirty money in the UK. The UK’s ministry of defence released its latest intelligence report, speculating that Russian forces made “minimal ground advances” over the weekend, while a “high level of Russian air and artillery strikes” continued to hit military and civilian sites across the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol. Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak, who sported an insignia linked to the invasion of Ukraine on a medals podium alongside a Ukrainian competitor, has been called out for his “shocking behaviour”. More than 4,300 people have been arrested in Russia after demonstrators took to the streets across 21 cities to condemn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Another round of talks between Ukraine and Russia is due on Monday, according to Ukrainian officials. However, in a phone conversation with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Putin said the conflict would only stop if Ukraine stopped fighting and Russia’s demands were met. The Russian president also said Ukraine’s negotiators should take a more “constructive” approach in talks with Moscow to take into account the reality on the ground. Ukraine has said it is not willing to compromise on its territorial integrity.",News/World news,Ukraine war: what we know on day 12 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukraine-war-russia-what-we-know-so-far-day-12-russian-invasion
3/7/2022,"The identity of South Korea’s next leader will be determined this week by the economy, housing prices and incomes, but the road to the presidential Blue House will also be dotted with the wreckage of the country’s poisonous gender politics. The successor to Moon Jae-in, who is restricted by law to a single five-year term, will not be able to ignore the fallout from a campaign defined by the culture war being waged in the world’s 10th-biggest economy. On one side, a feminist movement that led the Me Too movement in Asia; on the other, young men whose resistance to the modest gains made by South Korean women has been exploited by the two main candidates. In 2018, women took to the streets in record numbers to call for government action against an epidemic of molka – the use of spy cams to secretly film women, often in public toilets – and helped bring down several public figures, including a candidate for the presidency, for sexual misconduct. A year later, they helped overturn a decades-old ban on abortion, and shone a light into the darkest corners of an entrenched culture of male chauvinism, unequal pay and the expectation that their careers will end when they have children. Despite the global success of its pop music and TV dramas, South Korea continues to perform poorly in international comparisons of women’s rights. The 2021 World Economic Forum global gender gap report ranks it 102 out of 156 countries in an index that examines jobs, education, health and political representation. South Korea has by far the largest gender pay gap among OECD countries, at about 32%, while women account for just over 19% of MPs in the national assembly. Only 5.2% of Korean conglomerates’ board members are female, and experts say the country’s record-low birthrate proves how difficult it is for its women to combine careers with family life. Women have responded by challenging social norms, from refusing to wear bras and publicly destroying their makeup collections to vowing never to marry or have children or, in some cases, have sex with men. Five years after its first female president, Park Geun-hye, went on trial on corruption charges, South Korea’s election campaign has brought the anti-feminist backlash into sharp focus. Online “men’s rights” groups have condemned hiring quotas, while calls to abolish the ministry of gender equality and family – created in 2001 – have been seized on by the frontrunner. The anti-feminist movement’s list of grievances includes the weighty subject of military service exemptions but often finds expression in vicious personal attacks on prominent women. They include An San, the triple Olympic archery gold medalist, who was abused during last summer’s Tokyo 2020 Games simply for having short hair. Last year, South Korea’s biggest convenience store pulled ads for sausages after a a so-called men’s rights group complained that a promotional image – a hand gesture commonly used to indicate something small – had once been used by a feminist group to exploit male anxiety over penis size. The misogyny contagion spread to the country’s politics late last year, when Cho Dong-young, a military specialist, was forced to resign just three days after she had been appointed co-chair of the ruling Democratic party’s election committee. Cho, a Harvard graduate with successful military and academic careers behind her, stepped down after a YouTube channel and broadcaster questioned her suitability for office. Her crime: having a child out of wedlock during her first marriage. As the campaign enters its final stages, the conservative People Power party candidate, Yoon Suk-yeol, and his ruling Democratic party rival, Lee Jae-myung, have been accused of pandering to sexism to win the votes of young men who regard women’s advancement as a threat to their financial security, amid a bleak job market and rising living costs. Many resent having to do 18 months of military service, a requirement for all able-bodied Korean men aged 18-28, while women are exempt. Hong Eun-pyo, who runs an anti-feminist YouTube channel, has tried to justify the gender pay gap, insisting that men work longer hours and do more difficult jobs. “If [women] want to reach as high as their male peers and be paid the same wages, they should keep working and not get pregnant,” he said. Yoon, a former prosecutor general, has accused the gender equality ministry of treating men like “potential sex criminals” and has promised to introduce tougher penalties for false claims of sexual assault – a step campaigners say will deter even more women from coming forward. In addition, scrapping the gender ministry could weaken women’s rights and “take a toll on democracy”, said Chung Hyun-back, an academic who served as gender equality minister under Moon. Yoon, 61, is said to be heavily influenced by his party chairman, Lee Jun-seok, a 36-year-old Harvard graduate and “men’s rights” advocate who has criticised hiring targets for women and other female-friendly policies as “reverse discrimination”, and described feminist politics as “blowfish poison”. Even Lee, the potential liberal successor to self-proclaimed feminist Moon, has said he opposes “discrimination” against men, and cancelled an interview with a media outlet because of its supposed feminist leanings. Although he opposes Yoon’s plans to abolish the gender equality ministry, he wants to drop the word “women” from its official Korean-language title. By the weekend, Yoon had established a small lead over Lee, after Ahn Cheol-soo, a minor party candidate, withdrew from the race and threw his support behind the People Power candidate. According to a Realmeter poll published on Wednesday, 46.3% of respondents said they would vote for Yoon, with 43.1% backing Lee. While the two frontrunners go out of their way to avoid offending young male voters, women say the election has plunged South Korea back into the dark ages. “We are being treated like we don’t even have voting rights,” said Hong Hee-jin, a 27-year-old office worker in Seoul. “Politicians are taking the easy path. Instead of coming up with real policies to solve problems facing young people, they are fanning gender conflicts, telling men in their 20s that their difficulties are all down to women receiving too many benefits.” Agencies contributed reporting",News/World news,South Korea’s poisonous gender politics a test for next president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/south-koreas-poisonous-gender-politics-a-test-for-next-president
