5/11/2022,"Insurance market Lloyd’s of London is urging members to watch its annual general meeting from home next week, amid fears that it will be the latest City event disrupted by climate protests. Lloyd’s chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, warned members about the potential for disruption at the 19 May AGM back in April, but said in an updated memo that “the risk of disruption has significantly increased”. “To ensure the safety and security of our members and to allow the meeting to proceed in an orderly and fair manner, it is with regret that I must now strongly encourage all members attending the AGM to join virtually and not to attempt to enter the Lloyd’s Building on that day,” Brown said in a notice aimed at the market’s close to 100 syndicate members. The warning comes nearly a month after Lloyd’s was forced to close the doors of its landmark Grade I-listed building at One Lime Street, when more than 60 protesters from Extinction Rebellion (XR) used superglue, chains and bicycle locks to block workers from entering. Lloyd’s has pledged that members will phase out all existing insurance policies for fossil fuel projects by 2030, but activists say the policy does not go far enough. “We are committed to nonviolently disrupting business as usual until Lloyd’s of London ends its underwriting of fossil fuels,” a spokesperson for XR said. “Instead of trying to hide from public anger by shifting their AGM online, Lloyd’s needs to be brave, take bold action and stop insuring morally hazardous projects.” XR claimed its protests were already prompting change, with two Lloyd’s syndicates cutting ties with Canada’s controversial Trans Mountain pipeline since April. A string of City institutions, including HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered, have already had their AGMs disrupted by climate protesters in the past month. Activists at Standard Chartered chanted and wore masks the depicting chief executive, Bill Winters, with devil horns as part of efforts to raise the alarm over the banking group’s climate track record. Meanwhile, protesters were forcibly removed from Barclays’ AGM in Manchester after gluing themselves to chairs, setting off alarms and delaying the start of the event for nearly an hour. “Lloyd’s faces a growing level of protests because, as the world’s largest insurance market, they have a responsibility to act in accordance with climate science and the recommendations of the IEA - and they are failing to do so,” Lindsay Keenan, European coordinator of the Insure Our Future climate campaign, said. “Indeed, despite what Bruce Carnegie-Brown would like you to believe, the reality is that Lloyd’s continues to provide insurance for new coal, oil and gas projects despite its supposed ESG [environmental, social and governance] policy.” Lloyd’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",News/Business,Lloyd’s of London attempts to shift AGM online to avoid climate protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/lloyds-of-london-attempts-to-shift-agm-online-to-avoid-climate-protesters
5/11/2022,"Simple, unbelievable and simply unbelievable. That, roughly, is the arc of Lucie Jourdan’s 90-minute Netflix documentary about fertility doctor Donald Cline, who spent 30 years secretly using his own sperm to impregnate the women who came to him for treatment. He probably would have got away with it too, if it hadn’t been for the pesky kids that resulted and the advent of home DNA-testing kits. Jacoba Ballard grew up suspecting that she, the only blond, blue-eyed member of a family of brunettes, was adopted. When she was 10, her parents told her they had used donor sperm to conceive her. “I wanted a child so bad,” her mother, Debbie Smith, says, the pain clearly visible on her face. The Smiths went to Cline, who had a reputation as the best in what was then the new field of fertility treatment and artificial insemination. The good doctor – and devout Christian, church elder and respected member of the community – told them that medical students were used as donors, each no more than three times to limit any future problems with consanguinity (the medical term for unwitting siblings later having children together). The couple went ahead and nine months later Jacoba was born. “She’s my everything,” says Debbie. When Jacoba grew up and took a DNA test, she found she had seven half-siblings. From there, they just kept coming. At the time of broadcast, there are 94 children known to have been covertly fathered by Cline. A high proportion have auto-immune disorders, which they attribute to Cline, whose rheumatoid arthritis would have disbarred him from qualifying as one of his own official donors. Many live within a 25-mile radius of each other. Lisa Shepherd-Stidham (“Sibling 22”) notes that when another name appears on a database as “close family” they all pray it’s no one they know or have dated. Her children go to school with the children of another sibling and her husband unknowingly coached them all at softball. Cline has already acted as gynaecologist to one of his daughters. It’s an undeniably gripping story. But Our Father is content merely to tell it – to wring every ounce of shock value without adding anything of greater value. It is stuffed with superficial testimonies from traumatised mothers and children. These are, by their very nature, repetitive, which quickly leads to diminishing returns, and does their suffering a disservice. It gives too little space to the unresponsiveness of the district attorney’s office – alerted by Jacoba early on – and the extraordinary fact that it was impossible to prosecute Cline over what he did to the women because none of that amounted to a crime under the then-current law. It glances at deeper, more intriguing and potentially meaningful matters. Jacoba’s research reveals that one of the people in the DA’s office who might have been expected to follow up on her complaint is associated with the Christian fundamentalist movement Quiverfull, which encourages the faithful – or at least the faithful of certain colouring – to have as many children as possible and groom them for power so they can become ambassadors for God. Is it relevant that church elder Cline has produced what Jacoba likens to “this perfect Aryan clan … it’s disgusting”? The best of the true-crime documentaries that are now strewn across Netflix and other platforms take their stories as starting points, thin ends of wedges with which to crack open wider issues. Our Father takes none of the opportunities offered by Cline and his unfortunate offsprings’ experiences to look at medical hubris, male entitlement, the almost religious faith we place in doctors, the possible alliance between racism and white supremacy and Christianity in the States. And, against the current horrifying rollback of reproductive rights in the US, its lack of interest in the bias against women that runs so deep in the legal system that their unconsenting impregnation by a doctor does not amount to a crime seems even more glaring than it would under “normal” circumstances. Presented, by Jacoba and some of his other children, with mounting evidence of what he had done, Cline – an intimidating physical presence who also seems to have attended their first meeting armed with a gun – denied the charges for as long as possible before threatening to sue and begging them not to keep going lest they destroy his 57-year marriage. Are these symptoms of grandiosity, psychopathy or merely patriarchy?

5/11/2022,"Troops and armoured vehicles have been deployed across the city of Colombo and security officials given orders to shoot on sight anyone deemed to be participating in violence as anti-government protests continued to rock Sri Lanka. The crisis turned volatile earlier this week after pro-government supporters began attacking a camp of peaceful demonstrators who had been protesting against the government and the devastating economic crisis that has engulfed the island of 22 million people. As footage emerged on Wednesday of armoured military vehicles in Colombo and military checkpoints being set up across the country , fears grew that the path was being laid for a military takeover. A nationwide curfew has done nothing to stop protesters gathering to demand the resignation of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who stands accused of economic mismanagement and corruption that has left it in its worst financial crisis since independence. Security officials confirmed they had been ordered to use “live ammunition” on those found to be involved in violence or vandalism, alleging that outbreaks of violence were a “coordinated” campaign. Eight people have been killed and more than 200 injured in the violence that has ensued across the country since Monday’s attacks by pro-government supporters. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of the president, who resigned as prime minister on Monday following mounting public pressure, had to be evacuated at dawn on Tuesday from his official residence in Colombo after protesters tried to storm the building. He is currently sheltering at a naval base in the north-eastern city of Trincomalee. More than 100 buildings were set alight, including the homes of 41 pro-Rajapaksa politicians and a luxury hotel said to be owned by the Rajapaksas, as well as several buses that had been rumoured to be used as transport for pro-Rajapaksa supporters. The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday means the government has been dissolved and there is no cabinet. The opposition has refused to form a proposed “unity government” until Gotabaya Rajapaksa also steps down. Many expressed concern that the military might try to step into the resulting power vacuum. But speaking at a news conference, the defence ministry’s top official, Kamal Gunaratne, denied allegations of a military takeover. “None of our officers have a desire to take over the government. It has never happened in our country and it is not easy to do it here,” said Gunaratne. Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the main opposition SJP party who has refused to participate in a government under the Rajapaksas, accused the government of orchestrating mob violence in order to bring in martial law. “In the guise of angry mobs, violence is being incited so military rule can be established,” he said. “Rule of law should be maintained through the constitution, not with guns. It is time to empower citizens, not disempower them.” The US state department expressed concern over the military deployment in Sri Lanka. “We stress that peaceful protesters should never be subjected to violence or intimidation, whether that’s on the part of the military force or civilian units,” said a spokesperson, Ned Price. On Wednesday, Pope Francis appealed for calm in Sri Lanka and for authorities to “listen to the aspirations of the people”. “I offer a special thought to the people of Sri Lanka, in particular to the young, who in recent times have made their cry heard in the face of the country’s social and economic challenges and problems,” he said at the end of his weekly audience.",News/World news,Sri Lanka unrest: shoot on sight order issued as troops deployed in Colombo,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/sri-lanka-unrest-shoot-on-sight-order-issued-troops-deployed-colombo
5/11/2022,"Mini-referendums that allow homeowners to loosen planning rules and build bigger and taller extensions risk doing nothing to increase the supply of affordable housing, campaigners have said. “Street votes” are set to be included in the levelling up and regeneration bill as part of what the housing secretary, Michael Gove, has described as a way to boost democratic involvement in homebuilding. But CPRE, the countryside charity, said the policy would allow homeowners to simply have more space and increase the value of their properties, making it harder still for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder. “We don’t think it will provide any more affordable homes, [it] will make existing homes in urban areas less affordable, and there are no guarantees it will lead to more homes overall,” said Paul Miners, the group’s policy director. The local votes are part of a new package of planning reforms due to be unveiled in detail after ministers scrapped an earlier attempt to allow property developers to build new estates without having to repeatedly apply for planning consent. Successive government have struggled to boost housebuilding to tackle the affordability crisis in the face of vociferous local opposition to greenfield development and rural sprawl. The 2020 attempt to free up construction led to a backlash in the Tory heartlands, and backbench MPs including Theresa May called the approach “ill-conceived”. The government is now playing down the likelihood that it will hit a manifesto target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s. Gove said on Wednesday: “Arithmetic is important but so is beauty, so is belonging, so is democracy, and so is making sure that we are building communities. “People, when it comes to housing development, should be partners. We are going to do everything we can in order to ensure that more of the right homes are built in the right way in the right places. I think it is critically important that even as we seek to improve housing supply you also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of.” Social housing landlords said any reforms should boost the delivery of affordable homes. Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said planning changes should “deliver the number and type of affordable homes the country desperately needs”, citing 4.2 million people currently in need of social housing in England. Gove’s predecessor as housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said on Tuesday that the government would miss its manifesto target “by a country mile” and it could be years before the output hits even 250,000 a year again. He said: “We have to get those homes built because we are letting down hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens. People are homeless today because we are failing to build those houses.” On “street votes”, May warned parliament of “unintended consequences”. She said: “I can well imagine a situation in which somebody persuades their neighbours in a street to agree to the sort of development that might enhance the value of their houses but which actually has a negative impact on the wider community and wider neighbourhood.” Street votes were proposed last year by the Policy Exchange thinktank, with the backing of several architects and planners associated with Prince Charles who have advocated for the “densification” of urban areas, in part to reduce pressure to build on open fields. The thinktank said: “Residents of a street should be able to agree by a high majority on new strict rules for designs to make better use of their plots. A street of suburban bungalows, for example, could agree on the right to create Georgian-style terraces. In many cases, an adopted ‘street plan’ would greatly increase the value of residents’ homes, giving them strong reasons to agree on it.” It suggested redevelopment of listed and pre-1918 properties should be prohibited.",News/Society,Street votes on planning rules ‘will not increase affordable housing’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/street-votes-on-planning-rules-will-not-increase-affordable-housing
5/11/2022,"Very over the top, extremely brutal and as French as a Johnny Hallyday calendar – here’s a rerelease for the gonzo crime thriller from 1997, directed by Jan Kounen and adapted from the pulp policier series by Joël Houssin. The hyperactive pop video aesthetic has dated a bit, and the crash zooms and the extreme close-ups are tiring, but there’s no doubting the ultraviolent, ultratasteless energy of it all: the movie gives the finger to all those arthouse wimps who might be thinking about wrinkling their noses and objecting to this film. Romain Duris plays a gangster who takes a shit in the street and actually wipes his arse with a page from the esteemed film magazine Cahiers du Cinéma (an editorial from the distinguished critic Serge Toubiana, as it happens, entitled, ironically, “Les auteurs sont dans le bain”.) A lithe young Vincent Cassel plays Dobermann, a fearless bank robber who takes down financial institutions with his lairy crew, chief among them Dobermann’s deaf girlfriend Nat (Monica Bellucci). On his case is the psychopathic cop Cristini, played with genuine menace by Tchéky Karyo, and there’s a brief acting role for Gaspar Noé as a guy who works at a fast food stand and witnesses a gruesome act of misogynistic violence. Now, it could be that Dobermann was an influence, of a kind, on Noé, who might well have transformed the coke-addled frenzy of Dobermann, as well as casting Cassell and Bellucci, into his deadly serious vision of hell in his film Irréversible. Perhaps Dobermann doesn’t look as cool as it once did, but the film is still high-octane, and the scenes of members of the public nervously jumping out of the way of police cars are worryingly real.  Dobermann is released on 13 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Dobermann review – Vincent Cassel’s brutal pulp thriller still bites,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/dobermann-review-vincent-cassels-brutal-pulp-thriller-still-bites
5/11/2022,"A day before Democrats staged a vote in the Senate to codify into law the right to abortion, a right under threat from the supreme court, the Republican leader in the chamber said his party would not be able to pass an abortion ban should it take control in midterm elections in November. “Historically, there have been abortion votes on the floor of the Senate. None of them have achieved 60 votes,” Mitch McConnell told reporters. “I think it’s safe to say there aren’t 60 votes there at the federal level, no matter who happens to be in the majority, no matter who happens to be in the White House.” The chamber is split 50-50 and therefore controlled by the tie-breaking vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Democrats and progressives have urged the party to seek to scrap the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation. Such reform seems unlikely. With key Democrats opposed, Punchbowl News, a Washington outlet, reported on Wednesday that the issue was not even discussed at a party Senate lunch the day before. When Donald Trump was in power McConnell, too, came under pressure to scrap the filibuster to advance the Republican agenda. On Tuesday, the Kentucky senator told reporters there were “no issues that Republicans believe should be exempt from the 60-vote threshold”. The measure before the Senate on Wednesday – for which the Democrats do not even have 50 votes, with opposition from some in their own party as well as pro-choice Republicans – is the Women’s Health Protection Act. It would codify Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that protects the right to abortion. Roe has been under imminent threat since last week, when a draft supreme court ruling overturning it, reportedly supported by five conservative justices, was leaked. On Wednesday, Politico, which published the leak, said the draft ruling by Samuel Alito was still the only one in circulation, with publication expected in June. The Democratic Senate vote is a response to protests that have spread since the draft ruling was published. Many Republican-run states have trigger laws ready to ban abortion at various stages should Roe fall. McConnell said: “If the leaked opinion became the final opinion, legislative bodies – not only at the state level but at the federal level – certainly could legislate in that area.” Total abortion bans would be possible, he said. Polling shows consistent majority support for abortion rights but Republicans say they doubt the issue will damage them at the midterms in November. McConnell’s deputy, John Thune of South Dakota, told the Hill: “Our members are going to continue to hammer away on inflation, the economy, the border, crime.” Democrats hope the vote on Wednesday will prove politically useful. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, told reporters: “Every senator will have to vote, and every, every American will see how they voted. And I believe the Republican party … will suffer the consequences electorally when the American people see that.” Jackie Rosen, of Nevada, said: “We have to take that fear, we have to take that anger that we’re feeling, channel it into action to defend our majority. You have to elect more pro-choice senators. We’re not living in a hypothetical.”",News/US news,Mitch McConnell says Senate Republicans couldn’t pass abortion ban,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/mitch-mcconnell-senate-republicans-could-not-pass-abortion-ban
5/11/2022,"Despite Lee Westwood’s claims, golfers have not been singled out for special attention during dalliances with Saudi Arabia. In fact the ease with which the Saudis have breezed into the golf scene – both male and female – serves as a reminder of the charmed life players lead. What a rude awakening they – and their representatives – would encounter if they had the levels of focus bestowed on Premier League clubs. Westwood is candid about participating in the upcoming LIV Golf Series on the basis of chasing money. As a cost of living crisis impacts upon the ability of millions to heat their homes or put fuel in their cars, the relish of Westwood – hardly a pauper – for a $25m golf tournament in Hertfordshire is pretty distasteful but not a patch on an extended defence of his actions. “They [Saudi Arabia] are trying to make changes quickly, and that’s probably worrying a lot of people and scaring a lot of people,” Westwood said. On 12 March this year, the Kingdom carried out the execution of 81 people. That feels considerably more scary than the rapid pace of modernisation Westwood perceives. A spokesperson for UPS, a longtime sponsor of Westwood, hardly delivered a ringing endorsement when asked what the firm thinks of high-profile athletes gleefully accepting Saudi swag. “We are constantly evaluating our sponsorship and partnership decisions and will continue to monitor this situation,” they said. As Greg Norman, the public face of Saudi’s golf exploits, carries out media duties with hand-picked outlets this week, there is further cause to ponder the absurdity of the entire scheme. Norman announced a $2bn boost to something that made no commercial sense in the first place. The Australian stated he did not answer to Mohammed bin Salman, as if the crown prince would take a direct interest in the tee times of Robert Garrigus. Norman is very keen to portray golfers as independent contractors. Maybe they are. It remains depressing that golfers are so willing to assist the Saudis in a sportswashing exercise. Human rights atrocities cast a shadow over everything the Public Investment Fund writes cheques for. Yet in a competitive sense Norman’s plans for an opening tournament, taking place at the Centurion Club in early June, are already undermined by the cast list (which, oddly, LIV remains reluctant to reveal). Martin Kaymer, now the world No 195, has been touted in some quarters as a star turn. Centurion had initially been named as the host venue of an Asian Tour event, but was jettisoned when LIV decided it wanted to carry on with tournaments of its own that have no world ranking status. The Asian Tour shuffled off to Slaley Hall. Meanwhile the world’s top players stated their commitment to existing tours. The DP World Tour refuses to comment on the status of its members in respect of Centurion. However, research by the Guardian has shown that five of the six top-ranked Englishmen in the world – Matt Fitzpatrick, Tommy Fleetwood, Paul Casey, Tyrrell Hatton and Justin Rose – will not feature in their homeland. Which says something about the low level of appeal. The one exception is the 49-year-old Richard Bland. Fitzpatrick, Fleetwood, Casey, Hatton and Rose are taking preparations for the following week’s US Open seriously. Neither Westwood nor Ian Poulter – who will also play at Centurion – are in the field for that Brookline major. Norman can speak of a “start-up” tour all he wants but what he is currently presiding over is second rate. The playing of 54 holes with a shotgun start looks gimmicky. There is no main broadcasting deal and no current hope of capturing the minds of the public. Norman will pin hopes on Phil Mickelson but the reality is he has been discredited by remarks made about Saudi Arabia that forced him into professional exile. Then there is the case of Sergio García. The Spaniard created ripples last week with an outburst at a rules official that suggested he is not long for the PGA Tour. Should García choose to abandon the PGA Tour – which has afforded him on-course winnings of $54.4m – or the DP World Tour, this is of course up to him. Yet two LIV events later this year, in Bangkok and Jeddah, clash with DP World Tour stops in Madrid and Andalucía. Does García, adored in his homeland, realise how preposterous he would look as a show pony for Saudi Arabia as Spain simultaneously holds these tournaments? The PGA Tour has taken its first meaningful step towards a courtroom battle by denying the request of members to play at Centurion. The DP World Tour will adopt an identical stance. It remains to be seen what penalties for players follow. “We will not be stopped,” Norman responded. What level of field appears for LIV’s second outing, in the United States on the first weekend in July, was already intriguing. On American soil, a direct challenge to the PGA Tour exists. It is just hard to avoid the sense that, for now, it remains a weak and contrived one.",Sport/Sport,Players taking Saudi money for weak events is a bad look for golf | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/11/players-taking-saudi-money-for-weak-events-is-a-bad-look-for-golf
5/11/2022,"Recycling rates in England are falling and the government has failed to meet its target to recycle 50% of waste from households by 2020. But Wales has become a world leader, with the country recycling 56.5% of its household waste. Household recycling rates in England went down from 46% in 2019 to 44% in 2020. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the Covid pandemic had disrupted collections in some areas. The Welsh government said its high rate of household recycling had prevented more than 400,000 tonnes of CO2 a year from being released into the atmosphere and further accelerating climate change. Data shows that Wales was the only UK nation to reach the minimum 50% recycling target by 2020 set by the European Union. The minister for climate change in the Welsh government, Julie James, said: “Our recycling stats are world class thanks to a Team Wales effort. Despite the pandemic and all the challenges it bought with it, local authorities managed to prioritise recycling, the collectors worked heroically all the way through, and the fantastic people of Wales continued to recycle. “We must now continue to raise our ambitions to reach zero waste by 2050 and net zero carbon emissions so we can tackle the climate and nature emergencies in earnest, and pass on a resilient, green and prosperous planet to our future generations.” The amount of waste generated in the UK continues to rise. UK households produced 27m tonnes of waste in 2020, an increase of 2.1% from 2019. England is responsible for the vast majority of the waste, 22.6m tonnes, or 84% of the UK total. Most household waste is made up of food, paper, cardboard, glass bottles and plastics. Only forty-four per cent of the 2.5m tonnes of plastic packaging waste produced in 2021 was recovered for recycling, according to the data. The government has yet to introduce a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles, which was promised in 2018 to reduce the pollution caused by the public’s use of 13bn plastic drinks bottles a year. It has consulted on a policy to ban more single-use plastic items but has yet to announce when this would come into force. The government said in a statement: “We want to recycle and reuse more of our waste, and support households to do so. Our Environment Act is transforming the way we deal with waste; we have already responded to our consultation on extended producer responsibility, we are introducing a deposit return scheme and we will shortly respond to our consultation on consistent collections in England.” In 2018, the government released its resources and waste strategy which said the UK would aim to process more of its waste domestically. Two years ago, Interpol reported an alarming increase in illegal plastic trade pollution across the world. The UK exports roughly two-thirds of its plastic waste. James Bevan, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, called recently for the UK to impose a complete ban on the export of waste to combat crime. “Sending certain kinds of waste abroad is legal, but is it right? Is it morally right to dump the waste we create on another country to deal with?” he said. Bevan was criticised by the Recycling Association, which said conflating waste crime with exports was wrong and failed to address the real reasons behind criminal activity. Bettina Gilbert, head of programme delivery at the government’s waste advisory body Wrap, said: “2020 was an unprecedented year with full lockdown and huge disruptions, which likely caused the decline. Priority was given to maintaining residual waste collections for health and safety reasons, while garden waste collections and recycling often had to be suspended or severely curtailed. “That the levels have not fallen further is testament to the amazing job done by the thousands of key workers continuing to collect our waste and recycling. Recycling helps protect our planet, so it’s crucial that we continue to recycle as much as we can.”",News/Environment,England fails to reach household waste recycling target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/england-fails-to-reach-household-waste-recycling-target
5/11/2022,"After years of threats and Conservative manifesto commitments, it looks like a British “bill of rights” to scrap and replace the 1998 Human Rights Act is finally upon us. “My ministers,” read the Prince of Wales in his mother’s place on Tuesday, “will restore the balance of power between the legislature and the courts.” But scratch the surface and you find this bill of rights to be precisely the opposite – not a document to empower ordinary people in post-Brexit Britain, but a power grab by the state. Remember, this is the prime minister who once illegally shut down parliament for irritating his political agenda – for the No 10 Praetorian Guard, “legislature” is euphemism for the “executive”. The Human Rights Act (HRA) is one of the greatest constitutional achievements of any government. Like all modern bills of rights, it constrains those in power. It draws on the best liberal rule of law traditions, as well as progressive internationalist instincts, ensuring that rights and freedoms are accessible close to home. It incorporates the European convention on human rights into our law, meaning that anyone here can seek its protection before any public official or local court without a long and costly journey to the court in Strasbourg. What’s more, it doesn’t undermine our own legal system. UK courts must “take account of” Strasbourg decisions but they’re not bound by them. This allows domestic judges to consider our own cultural and legal contexts, while contributing to a continuing conversation about how the convention articles should be applied across Europe. The freedoms themselves should be uncontroversial to all genuine democrats. There is the protection of life, freedom from torture, slavery and arbitrary detention and the right to a fair trial; there is the right to respect for privacy and family life, and freedoms of conscience and expression. The rule against discrimination in the delivery of the other rights and freedoms is key. As well as achieving balance between domestic and international law, the act contains another exquisite compromise. It protects parliamentary sovereignty as the overarching principle of our unwritten constitution – it does not allow higher courts to strike down unconstitutional primary legislation. Instead, it enforces protections via more delicate means. Legislation needs to be read in a rights-compatible way “so far as it is possible to do so”. When this isn’t possible, higher courts can only issue a symbolic “declaration of incompatibility” – leaving it to parliament to decide what to do next. A cursory scan of Hansard reveals that ministers defending indefensibly broad new powers have relied upon the very HRA duty they now want to trash. So, if the current scheme works and actually provides the balance the government claims to want, what are they really after? Under their plans, our courts will no longer need to read European judgments at all. The government will tell some voters it is still abiding by the convention and others that it has “taken back control of our laws”. Extreme executive cake-eating and magical thinking will license our courts to diminish rights as set out by Strasbourg but never “exceed” them. Ministers will swear blind they are complying with it, while ignoring international law. This has profound implications for all three devolution settlements, which legally require active compliance with the European convention on human rights. It is especially dangerous for the Good Friday agreement; a treaty requiring that these rights be guaranteed in Northern Ireland. As with the refugee convention, we will remain notional signatories, but the government will limit the scrutiny of the international community and domestic courts. Gone will be the duty to read legislation compatibly with rights and freedoms if possible and, most likely, to make declarations in the face of incompatible laws. Public bodies’ obligations to respect rights will be slashed. This constitutional butchery can hardly be described as a bill of rights at all. New hurdles will be placed in the way of human rights claims, such as having to prove “significant disadvantage” and “good behaviour”. How many rights violations throughout world history have been justified as being either trivial (being made to sit at the back of the bus) or aimed at “unworthy” people who have been perceived as acting badly? If this anti-bill of rights had been in place, the Godin-Mendoza decision, which famously reinterpreted the Rent Act (under the Human Rights Act duty) so as to pass tenancy protection to a surviving same-sex partner, would have been impossible. Ditto the Belmarsh ruling, with its HRA declaration of incompatibility in favour of terror suspects detained indefinitely with neither charge nor trial. It will be sold to some voters as curtailing the rights of foreigners and criminals and to the press as free speech trumping privacy. To hell with Windrush apologies or solidarity with even Ukrainian refugees if rights are only for citizens, not humans. To hell with positive obligations on the police to protect victims of crime. This government finds such rights too expansive and constraining on the state. Johnson may be no Machiavelli, but his so-called bill of rights is a princely deception that all decent democrats must expose.
