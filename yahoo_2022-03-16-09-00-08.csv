3/16/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - When the air-raid siren went off mid-funeral on Tuesday there was no pause from the priest and scarcely a blink from mourners, who ignored the threat of Russian missiles to bury loved ones killed by them two days before. Inside the baroque Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church in Lviv, hundreds assembled to pay their respects to four soldiers, including one who had buried his brother only days before. All were among the 35 killed by a Russian air strike on Yavoriv military base on Sunday, in which missiles penetrated farther into Ukraine than at any time during the three-week conflict, landing just 20km from the border with Poland. Mothers hugged the coffins as weeping family members laid flowers – some blue and yellow after the Ukrainian flag - atop the polished wood. Pallbearers carried away the bodies of Oleh Yashchyshyn, Kyrylo Vyshyvanyi, Rostyslav Romanchuk and Serhiy Melnyk. Three were laid to rest at the military memorial of the city's historic Lychakiv Cemetery, the most famous cemetery in Ukraine, while a fourth went to his family's plot in a small village near Lviv. It was the second blow within a fortnight for Vyshyvanyi’s family, who buried his younger brother Vasyl on March 4. Also a soldier, he was killed near the southern city of Mykolayiv, hundreds of kilometers away. The most senior of those killed was Oleh Yashchyshyn, whose daughter was also in Yavoriv but was not seriously wounded. One child carried a teddy bear, the words 'Love, Love, Love' imprinted on a strap around her shoulder. As the priest assured their families that the quartet's loss was not in vain, the choir chanted the encomium ""Memory Eternal"" in Ukrainian.

3/16/2022,"Spencer Platt The image of 31-year-old Eva Lopez was falsely used in a wanted poster by the New York Police Department back in August. Now, the Instagram influencer is suing the department for $30 million. NYPD officials had been searching for a “thieving” prostitute when the mix-up occurred, according to the New York Post. The escort in question was reportedly involved in a theft incident at an East Village apartment, where she was accused of stealing a $13,000 Rolex and Chase credit card. On Aug. 16, Lopez said that she and her boyfriend were coming back from Florida when she received a startling text from a friend about the wanted poster, court records revealed. “I thought it was something fake. I really couldn’t believe the police would put me on a wanted poster,” she recalled. Initially, Lopez didn’t think anything of the mistake until her boss urged her to notify the NYPD about the error. Lopez contacted the 9th Precinct, where a detective named Kevin Dwyer, appeared to have been already notified about the bogus wanted poster. According to court filings, he “knew it was an issue before she called.” Dwyer reassured Lopez that the wrongfully used poster had been taken down, but sadly, the image had already begun to circulate across social media. “…. It was still being passed around, still being talked about, still making me look like a thief and a prostitute,” Lopez told The Post, noting that on Facebook the false image had been shared over 10,000, 20,000 times. The poster also appeared on Instagram where the young woman boasts a large following of nearly 862,000. In the photo, Lopez wore a sexy tube top, high heels, and tight leggings. Lopez said she was dressed up for her friend’s birthday party in the image used. The poster bore the words “Wanted for Grand Larceny,” along with “Perpetrator — probable cause to arrest.” Lopez vehemently denied the allegations, telling the publication that she had never had a prior history of arrests and had never engaged in prostitution work.  Since the image went viral, Lopez said the damaging situation has impacted her ability to work. “People didn’t think I was being honest. It was just really, really embarrassing, not only for me but for my family as well.” she added. “I just really want people to know that’s not me, in any way, shape or form. The girl has nothing to do with me.” Dwyer and the NYPD declined to comment about the suit to The Post.

3/16/2022,"A judge has sentenced a 19-year-old man to 15 years in prison for the hit-and-run traffic crash that killed a 7-year-old boy who was riding his bicycle. When Circuit Judge Peter Brigham announced his decision, Kameron Randell Blessitt turned around, looked at family and friends sitting behind him and appeared shocked. When a bailiff handcuffed Blessitt, the defendant told Brigham ""I'm so sorry,"" and ""please, I'm so sorry about this,"" and then added, ""it was a terrible accident."" Blessitt's supporters were saddened and sobbing. They assured Blessitt that he will be fine and they will be there for him. Awaiting a decision: 18-year-old changes plea, awaits sentence in crash that killed 7-year-old Marion boy Report: Driver not at fault in crash that killed 10-year-old walking to bus stop in NW Marion No prison: Probation for man charged in 2016 traffic crash that killed bicycle rider in south Marion Emotions ran high on both sides of the courtroom Friday afternoon. Family and friends of the victim, Bryce Benson, were sitting behind Assistant State Attorney Eric Rauba. They got up and left while bailiffs asked Blessistt's supporters, sitting across the aisle, to remain in their seats. For two hours, Brigham listened to legal arguments and witness testimony and reviewed documents. Local defense lawyer James Reich told the judge that sending Blessitt, his client, to prison would cause more harm than good. Reich said Blessitt has been a productive member of society since the November 2019 crash. Reich also noted that, according to a Florida Highway Patrol report, Bryce was the primary cause of the crash. The lawyer said Blessitt could be under supervision for six years and should be sentenced as a youthful offender, since he was 17 at the time of the crash. He told the judge that he could wave the minimum mandatory four years in prison for the charge of leaving the scene of a crash involving death or serious bodily injuries. ""He was scared,"" Reich said. Rauba countered that Blessitt shouldn't be sentenced as a youthful offender and deserves more than four years behind bars. The prosecutor said two other teenagers who were in the vehicle at the time of the deadly wreck told Blessitt to stop, but he didn't. Rauba said when Bryce was hit, his cap went inside the vehicle. Blessitt, he said, tossed the cap outside. He said Blessitt drove home, which was not far away, and parked the vehicle in the back. Rauba said instead of calling 911, Blessitt called his grandfather, who called 911. The prosecutor said Blessitt was not truthful in an interview with FHP Cpl. Crystal Sollazzo, the traffic homicide investigator who spoke with him. Then, Rauba said, Blessitt committed a crime in another county not long after the crash. ""He should be punished,"" the prosecutor said. One boy who was in the vehicle when the crash occurred took the stand. Now 16, he said they were driving around and Blessitt was speeding before the crash. The teen said they told Blessitt to stop when Bryce was hit, but he didn't. The teenager said when he went home, he told his mother and 911 was called. In her testimony, Sollazzo said Blessitt never told her about having other people in the vehicle. She said Blessitt showed no remorse and shed no tears during the interview. She said he was calm and chatted about his friends and future plans. Reich questioned Blessitt about the ordeal. Blessitt said he has been working and always had a job. He called what happened to Bryce ""tragic"" and said he feels ""really bad."" ""I wish I could take it back,"" he said. Blessitt said he has had bad dreams and was unable to sleep after the crash. Rauba questioned Blessitt about the burglary in Alachua County that took place not long after Bryce's death. Testimony presented at the hearing indicated that Blessitt was sentenced to a pre-trial diversionary program in that case. The judge said he had been thinking about what to do ever since Blessitt decided he was changing his plea in 2021. Blessitt decided to forego a trial and had no plea bargain in place; sentencing was left up to the judge. Back then, the judge told him he did not have to sentence him as a youthful offender. Brigham said one report given to him states there weren't any services available for Blessitt and he should be sentenced as an adult. Brigham said he was not going to sentence Blessitt as a youthful offender or as a juvenile. He said Blessitt should have been looking out for Bryce and wondered what the victim's last thoughts were. The judge said after the crash, Blessitt lied, which is a ""red flag for me."" He said Blessitt threw the little boy's hat from the vehicle, ignored his friends telling him to stop, and later got into trouble for burglary. Bryce was hit in Florida Highlands, in the 10800 block of Southwest 155th Street. Another boy was riding with Bryce, but on the opposite side of the road. Bryce was a second grader at Sunrise Elementary School. Blessitt was also charged with not having a motor vehicle registration. He could have been sentenced to a 30-year prison term for leaving the scene of a crash involving death or serious bodily injuries offense. The judge sentenced Blessitt to 21 days in jail for the registration charge. He received credit for time already served at a juvenile facility and the Marion County Jail. Bryce's mother, who was in court but did not speak, gave a woman a letter she wrote to read aloud to the court. In the letter, the woman said she has been living an ""emotional hell."" She said she will never get to see her son graduate from school, go to prom, get married, have a career or children. She said Blessitt could've stopped after the crash, and her son was loved by everyone. Contact Austin L. Miller at 867-4118, austin.miller@starbanner.com or @almillerosb.

3/16/2022,"Valeria Shashenok, a Ukrainian photographer, is documenting her family's experience from inside a bomb shelter amid Russia's invasion of the country. Since the war, Shashenok has shared a series of videos on TikTok, which show how her family is coping while, she says, they are hunkered down in the shelter, which is located Chernihiv. In one clip, Shashenok — who goes by the username @valerissh and has garnered over 800,000 followers — chronicles how she cooks pasta. In the clip, the 20-year-old is seen showing off a pan of noodles as she imagines ""she is in Italy."" Another clip shows Shashenok's mom preparing borscht — a sour soup common in Eastern Europe — on a small electric hot plate. TikTok In a video posted on March 11, Shashenok demonstrates how she and her family made coffee during a power outage at the shelter. With limited resources, Shashenok adds ground coffee beans and water to what, appears to be a heat-proof cup, before lighting the container with a blow torch, which instantly creates the coffee. ""I'm shocked, but it works!"" Shashenok wrote over the clip. TikTok Her account also chronicles the damage done to Ukraine. In a different video shared on March 4, Shashenok leaves the bunker to retrieve some items from her home, and while on the way, she shares footage of the country's destruction. Despite the heartache of war, Shashenok manages to incorporate humor in her TikTok videos, joking in one clip that the bomb shelter is like a ""5 star hotel"" and the bathroom area is a ""place for reading books!"" TikTok Speaking on her decision to document her experience, Shashenok told The Cut: ""I want to show what's happening in my country... I'm that person who always ragged on everything with humor. It's the best way to show people the problem. I'm that person who always sees light in the dark, and it's a nice way to do something for my country.""

Details of the fighting change by the day, but hundreds of civilians have already been reported dead or wounded, including children. More than a million Ukrainians have also fled, the United Nations says. The invasion, ordered by President Vladimir Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world and increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia. With NATO forces massing in the region around Ukraine, various countries have also pledged aid or military support to the resistance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for peace talks — so far unsuccessful — while urging his country to fight back. Putin, 69, insists Ukraine has historic ties to Russia and he is acting in the best security interests of his country. Zelenskyy, 44, vowed not to bend. ""Nobody is going to break us, we're strong, we're Ukrainians,"" he told the European Union in a speech in the early days of the fighting, adding, ""Life will win over death. And light will win over darkness."" The Russian attack on Ukraine is an evolving story, with information changing quickly.
