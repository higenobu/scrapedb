12/10/2021,"The market’s legendary investors built their names, and their fortunes, on success, the paths they followed were as varied and interesting as in any human endeavor. And one of the best such stories for market success is that of Ken Griffin, whose firm Citadel manages approximately $39 billion in total assets. Griffin founded Citadel in 1990, and last year the firm’s funds brought in an average return of 24%. Griffin himself has seen his personal net worth grow to $16 billion. It’s not a bad place to be, for a guy who got his start in the trading world from his Harvard dorm room, armed with a phone, a fax, and an early desktop computer. Taking this into consideration, we wanted to get all the details on three stocks the billionaire’s fund snapped up recently. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, we found out that the analysts are also fans, with each name scoring a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each ticker offers solid upside potential. Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) The first of Griffin's new positions is Rocket Lab, a space launch company offering customers a range of capabilities. Rocket Lab currently has two active spacecraft, the Electron small orbital launch vehicle and the Photon satellite platform. The company is developing a larger launch vehicle, Neutron, which will increase the payload capacity to 8 tons. Rocket Lab has sent up a total of 107 satellites, for a wide range of purposes, from national security to space debris clearance to scientific research to communications. Space travel is a difficult enterprise, with a high failure rate, but Rocket has had 19 successful missions of its Electron vehicle out of 22 launch attempts, for an 86% success rate. The company entered the public markets through a SPAC transaction earlier this year. The merger, with Vector Acquisition Corporation, was approved by the SPAC’s shareholders on August 20 and the combination closed on August 25. Rocket Lab realized $777 million in new capital from the SPAC transaction, and has a current market cap of $5.85 billion. In addition to completing its SPAC move in the third quarter, Rocket Lab also reported revenue of $5.3 million. Even better, for the company’s prospects, the order backlog – work contracted but not yet completed and paid for – increased from $141 million at the end of Q2 to $183 at the end of Q3, a gain of 29%. Rocket Lab finished the third quarter with $792.7 million in cash on hand, reflecting the new capital from the completed SPAC transaction. Private space launch is a growth niche, and it caught Griffin’s eye. His firm bought in to this new stock during Q3, to the tune of 1,727,899 shares. At the current valuation, these are worth over $22.5 million. The billionaire isn’t the only RKLB fan. Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller rates the stock a Buy, and his $28 price target suggests a substantial upside of 115% for the year ahead. (To watch Moeller’s track record, click here) Backing his stance, Moeller writes: “We believe that Rocket Lab’s substantial first-mover advantage in the small launch sector, robust customer base and overall launch pedigree (the second most successful commercial launch company to-date) will allow RKLB share to enjoy a significant premium over industry peers."" ""Only two other commercial rocket companies (SpaceX and Virgin Orbit) have successfully reached orbit to-date. We also believe that Rocket Lab’s dedicated small launch market niche has already established segmentation relative to competitors like SpaceX. We believe that the company’s competitive advantage over new market entrants and production scale justify significant upside in the stock price,"" the analyst added. What does the rest of the Street think? The 4 to 1 breakdown in the analyst reviews, favoring Buys over Hold, clearly shows that Wall Street is in broad agreement: this is a stock to Buy. The shares are selling for $13 and the average target of $21.20 implies a one-year upside of ~63%. (See RKLB stock forecast on TipRanks) F45 Training Holdings (FXLV) Next up is a franchised fitness company operating in 65 countries around the world through more than 3,000 franchised operations. F45 has over 1,600 studios offering 45-minute fitness workouts. The company uses a digital tech platform to both standardize and diversify workout routines, and provide customers with more than 3,900 unique and functional training movements. Like Rocket Lab above, this is a company new to the public markets. F45 started trading on July 15 in an IPO that featured 18.75 million new shares of public stock. The shares were sold at $16 each, and the company raised approximately $300 million gross proceeds. As for Ken Griffin, he picked up 1,335,812 shares in this stock during Q3, a clear vote of confidence. Griffin’s holding has a current value of ~$16 million. But not everything in the garden is rosy. In the second week of November, the company released its 3Q21 results – and the results spooked investors. F45 shares fell some 19% after the release due to revenue shortfall and lingering shipping/COVID risks. The company’s Q3 results got the attention of Jefferies' 5-star analyst Randal Konik, while the fall in share price really sparked his interest. Konik sees an opportunity here, and writes of the company: “We believe shares of FXLV are de-risked in the near term due to recent weakness post-IPO, which presents a compelling entry point. Additionally, we believe the company's long-term growth prospects are attractive as the business has experienced a strong recovery from pandemic lows in 2020... F45 is one of the fastest growing fitness franchisors in the U.S. (by number of franchises sold) with contractual, recurring revenue and a strong and growing global presence.” To this end, Konik rates FXLV a Buy, and his $23 price target suggests it has room to run ~90% in 2022. (To watch Konik’s track record, click here) Overall, this fitness company has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating from the Wall Street reviewers, with 3 positive reviews on record. The average price target of $19.67 implies ~63% upside from the share price of $11.68. (See FXLV stock forecast on TipRanks) Jasper Therapeutics (JSPR) The last Griffin buy is a biotech company. Jasper Therapeutic is a clinical-stage researcher working on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapies. These are the stem cells that give rise to mature human blood cells. Transplants of these stem cells are used to treat both immune system disorders and various cancers. Jasper has one lead product, JSP191, a novel compound designed to assist and facilitate HSC transplant treatments. The drug candidate is a ‘targeted, humanized monoclonal antibody,’ under development as a clearing and conditioning agent for use prior to HSC transplant. JSP191 causes cell death in immature HSCs, leaving an open space in the bone marrow where transplanted stem cells can engraft and grow. JSP191 is designed to overcome limitations in current conditioning therapy, by acting as a non-toxic clearing agent, and removing one need for more dangerous chemotherapy. Preclinical studies showed safe use of JSP191 in animal transplant models. The drug candidate is currently in two early stage human clinical trials. A Phase 1b trial for SCID (Severe combined immunodeficiency) is evaluating JSP191 as a sole conditioning agent. SCID is usually only treatable through HSC transplantation. A second trial, also at Phase 1b, is testing JSP191 in a combined therapy with another clearing agent, for use in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Jasper recently reported that the AML/MSD study is enrolling patients in expansion cohorts, and top-line interim data is expected in the first quarter of next year. And this week, the company announced that data on JSP191, showing its long-term benefits as a monotreatment clearing agent in the SCID study, will be presented at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, on December 12. This is another company that has jumped on the SPAC bandwagon. Jasper merged with Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition Corporation, completing the transaction on September 24 of this year. The combination brought $100 million in gross proceeds to the biopharma, giving the company sufficient capital to operate through the middle of 2023. Ken Griffin must really like this newly public stock. His firm bought 3,005,035 shares, taking a stake that’s now worth $24.3 million. Wall Street, like Griffin, sees plenty to appreciate here. Credit Suisse, Judah Frommer writes: “We see promising preliminary safety and efficacy data for JSP191 – a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) – as supportive of a ~$500M peak sales opportunity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), underscored by a broadening addressable patient population. While initial severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) results are encouraging, SCID’s ultra-orphan status likely limits the commercial opportunity but could de-risk other indications.” ""We see the potential for JSPR to emerge as an attractive M&A candidate if there is further de-risking of the pipeline assets. However, in the near term, we expect interest to be more limited as potential acquirers await clinical data for the various programs,"" the analyst added. Frommer’s comments back his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $15 price target indicates a potential for 86% share growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Frommer’s track record, click here) All in all, Jasper shares get a unanimous thumbs up from the analyst consensus, with 4 recent Buy reviews adding up to a Strong Buy rating. The stock is priced at $8.06, while the $18.33 average price target indicates room for an impressive 127% growth on the upside.

12/10/2021,"If you collect Social Security, the monthly deposit to your account is about to grow by the largest amount you’ve probably seen since you started receiving payouts. Starting with the January 2022 payment, 64 million Social Security recipients will receive the biggest annual benefit bump since 1982. At first glance, this is exciting news. But upon closer inspection, the increase is actually quite concerning. It looks like older Americans may have to resort to other creative money-saving strategies. Here’s what you can expect if you’re retired or still working. What price increases have you noticed lately? Maybe to your grocery receipt, your heating bill or your medical expenses. Are you paying more for your home in recent years? Rising inflation is unnerving many Americans, but these higher living expenses make people who depend on Social Security squirm as they try to stetch their monthly payments. Advocates for older Americans say the raises over the years — even the bigger boost in 2022 — fail to keep up with rising costs, especially ballooning expenses that eat up most of older people’s budgets, including housing and health care. The COLA for 2022 is 5.9%, the Social Security Administration recently announced, significantly higher than average annual increases of about 2.2% during the previous 20 years. The average Social Security benefit will increase to $1,657 per month, up by $92 from 2021. But the Senior Citizens League says the amount may not even make up for price increases the government predicts for next year: 2.5% to 5% for food, up to 25% for natural gas heating this winter, and 5% for Medicare prescription coverage. “It appears that inflation is not done with us yet, and the buying power of Social Security benefits may continue to erode into 2022,” says Mary Johnson, a policy analyst with the organization. And Medicare Part B premiums for doctors visits, lab tests and other services are set to increase about $22 a month, or 14.5%, the biggest jump in the insurance program’s history. You can’t control inflation or the cost-of-living adjustment, but you can take measures to protect yourself if the buying power of your retirement income fades. If you haven’t retired, focus on multiplying your nest egg: Save more aggressively. Max out your employer-matching 401(k). Did you know that 17 million Americans miss out on free money they’re owed from their employers? If you’re healthy, wait until you turn 70 to claim your Social Security benefits. If you’re under 40, pretend Social Security doesn’t exist. There’s no guaranteeing how long it will last. If you’re retired, you could make a dent in any shortage left by an inadequate COLA: Rework your budget. Don’t assume that the Social Security increase will be enough to keep spending the way you do now. Consider picking up a part-time job if you’re able. Many desirable jobs are open with today’s labor shortage. If health conditions limit your options, freelancing from home could boost your income. Speaking of home, consider downsizing or relocating. Pile the proceeds from a house sale into your retirement fund. If you rent, downsizing shaves one of your biggest expenses. If you live in a state that taxes Social Security benefits, you could move to a more tax-friendly location. The 2022 Social Security COLA won’t cut it for many Americans, but several methods can fortify your finances at any point in life: Attack your debt. Credit cards acted as a lifeline for many people during the pandemic, but holding high-interest debts weighs you down. Consolidating your balances into a single loan can help you pay off what you owe faster. Refinance your home. If you’re still paying a mortgage, it's a good time to refinance to cut your monthly payment. Mortgage rates are hovering near modern lows, and the shorter-term interest rates — about 2.4% for 15-year loans, for example — are especially enticing for people who want to clear that debt for retirement. Save when you shop. Stop overpaying for online purchases. Several handy browser extensions hunt for lower prices and automatically apply promo codes during checkout. Lower-risk investments also may help tamp down the impact of rising costs: Investigate an investment in farming. Buying part of a farmland parcel is a way some investors hedge against inflation. After all, the population is growing, and people always need food. New platforms help investors tap into this often-overlooked asset. Put your nickels and dimes to work.

12/10/2021,"After a prolonged bull run, many stocks seem to be taking a break lately. Several high-flying tech stocks have already entered correction territory. Could this be a “buy the dip” opportunity for investors who were previously standing on the sidelines? Well, not all stocks are the same. But according to Goldman Sachs, plenty of companies are worth buying at their current prices. Here’s a look at three stocks that recently received “buy” ratings from the Wall Street giant. You might want to pounce on one of them with some of your extra cash. Chipmakers are firing on all cylinders this year, and Marvell Technology has enjoyed a nice rally. From May to November, shares of the Wilmington, Delaware-based semiconductor company climbed a whopping 60%. But that could just be a start. Marvell reported third quarter earnings Dec. 2. In the following trading session, the stock shot up 17.7%. Revenue for the quarter grew 61% year-over-year to $1.21 billion. Adjusted earnings per share improved 72% from a year ago to 43 cents. A nice post-earnings pop brought Marvell’s share price to about $84. But Goldman Sachs sees more upside ahead. The bank upgraded Marvell from “neutral” to “buy” on Dec. 3 and raised its price target to $95. Many consider big data to be the next big thing. And that’s where Snowflake found its opportunity. The cloud-based data warehousing company, founded in 2012, serves thousands of customers across a wide range of industries, including 223 of the Fortune 500. Snowflake has received more investor attention and now commands a market cap of over $100 billion. In the three months ended Oct. 31, revenue surged 110% year-over-year to $334.4 million. Notably, net revenue retention rate was a solid 173%. The company continued to score large customer wins. It now has 148 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue of more than $1 million, compared to 65 such customers a year ago. Last week, Goldman Sachs raised the price target on Snowflake from $340 to $390 and maintained its “buy” rating for the company. Snowflake has traded recently at about $340 to $360 per share. But you can get a piece of the company using a popular stock trading app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you’re willing to spend. With a market cap of roughly $1 billion, Weave Communications is substantially smaller than the names mentioned above. But according to Goldman, it could be one of the biggest opportunities in the market. Weave offers an all-in-one customer communications platform for small businesses. The platform helps those operations attract, communicate with, and engage customers to grow their business. The company went public on Nov. 11 at an IPO price of $24 per share. But the stock didn’t pick up much upward momentum. Today it’s at $13.54. In Q3, Weave added 1,326 new customer locations, bringing its total sites to 22,553. Revenue came in at $30.3 million, up 42% year-over-year. Goldman initiated coverage of Weave on Dec. 6 with a “buy” rating and a $37 price target, saying that the current share price represents a “compelling entry point.” Based on where Weave stock is at right now, Goldman’s price target translates to a potential upside of 173%. Remember, if you don’t want to pick individual stocks in today’s volatile market, you can always build a diversified portfolio automatically by using just your “spare change.” At the end of the day, stocks are volatile. And even Wall Street experts are not right 100% of the time. If you want to invest in something that has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market, take a look at some alternative assets. Traditionally, investing in fine art or commercial real estate or even marine finance have only been options for the ultrarich. But with the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors too. A single investment can build a fixed-income portfolio spread across multiple asset classes. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/10/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. is railing against a proposed import ban on a key chipmaking ingredient, saying the move would worsen an already-perilous shortage of semiconductors. Most Read from Bloomberg Anatomy of a Bad Road The 15 Best Beers We Drank This Year The World’s Relentless Demand for Chips Turns Deadly in Malaysia Sand and Soldiers Mix as Troops Move In to Protect Cancun Tourists Former Oil Trader Is Now Betting on Lumber for Skyscrapers The company is trying to dissuade the U.S. International Trade Commission from halting imports of so-called chemical mechanical planarization slurries that are sold under the name Optiplane. DuPont’s Rohm & Haas unit makes the products in Taiwan and Japan, and they’ve drawn allegations that they infringe technology owned by Illinois-based CMC Materials Inc. The ITC was scheduled to announce its final decision later Thursday but postponed it until Dec. 16. It gave no reason for the one-week delay. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, has told the commission that “banning Optiplane slurries from U.S.-based semiconductor chip fabrication lines without a 24-month transition period could conflict with national security and economic interests.” If the ban is approved, it could thrust an obscure legal battle into the spotlight. CMC’s Cabot Microelectronics sought the move, saying Optiplane was using Cabot’s “cutting-edge” technology for silica particles in a slurry for polishing the semiconductor layers. Cabot uses the composition for its iDiel family of slurries. A trade judge in July said a component made overseas infringes Cabot’s patent and rejected DuPont’s argument that the patent is invalid. Semiconductors, which provide the brains and storage of most devices that have on/off switches, are made in a complex process that involves putting layers of conductive and insulating materials on disks of silicon. Circuit patterns are then burned onto them. That process, which takes months to complete, involves some layers that are only an atom thick and results in the cramming of billions of transistors onto postage-stamp-sized pieces of silicon. The slurries are used at different steps in the manufacturing process and “subtle variations between them have outsized impacts in a fabrication environment,” Intel said. The company looks to tap into concerns about the global shortage of semiconductors, which has hit a wide swath of the economy. The automotive industry alone is on course to lose more than $200 billion in sales because they can’t build enough vehicles to meet demand. The ITC ban could hurt Intel more than some rivals because the Santa Clara, California-based company relies more heavily on U.S. facilities. Manufacturers with Asian factories wouldn’t be affected by the change. But the ITC staff lawyers, which act as a third party in these cases on behalf of the public interest, have supported Intel’s call for a 24-month delay in any import ban. That lag would “provide a sufficient period for Intel to transition to acceptable noninfringing alternatives, particularly if the commission finds there is a semiconductor chip shortage,” Thomas Chen, an investigative attorney with the agency, told the commission last month. Cabot said Intel and DuPont are just using the chip shortage as an excuse to avoid an import ban. “The reported ‘semiconductor shortage’ is a result of a complex set of economic factors and has nothing at all to do with the supply of CMP slurries, let alone the supply of the specific infringing products at issue in this investigation,” Cabot said in its own filing with the agency. The case is In the Matter of Certain Mechanical Planarization Slurries, 337-1204, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington) (Updates with one-week delay in decision in second paragraph.)

12/10/2021,"Ignore a more hawkish Federal Reserve at your own peril, warns RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina.  ""They [our strategists] think the market is too sanguine. They think people are underestimating the number of hikes in 2023 and how high the Fed could ultimately go,"" said Calvasina on Yahoo Finance Live.  The markets have rallied back to within all-time highs this week as traders push aside a shift in the tone by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell just one week ago. Instead, investors are taking their cues on positive news on the Omicron variant from the likes of Pfizer (vaccine holds up well if given three doses) and emerging studies that show the variant is less lethal than expected to those vaccinated.  Amid the latest risk-on rally that has lasted the better part of four sessions, investors have aggressively bid up re-opening stocks such as Carnival Cruise and Delta Air Lines.  But the rally may be put to the test starting on Friday as Wall Street consensus thinks the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) may show a startling increase near 7%. In turn, that would possibly reignite the debate on the Fed having to end its bond buying program earlier than expected or lift interest rates in 2022 to stomp out inflation.  Some are already betting on this happening, even if the broader equity market is ignoring it. Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid notes the odds of an interest rate hike from the Fed in May 2022 now stands at 78.8%, up from a 66.1% probability seen just before Omicron variant fears took hold on Black Friday.  Says Calvasina, ""Over the course of a few months, markets will have to come to terms with a Fed that is tightening a little more aggressively than what they had been positioned for."" Calvasina is telling clients the best way to play the shift in the Fed — and potential additional market volatility — is to invest in value stocks.  Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
