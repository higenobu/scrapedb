2/8/2022,"A controversial $252m New South Wales government grant program “lacked integrity” and did not use any consistent guidelines in awarding more than 95% of the money to local councils in Coalition state seats. A scathing report on the scandal-plagued Stronger Communities Fund, released by NSW auditor general, Margaret Crawford, on Tuesday revealed former premier Gladys Berejiklian and deputy premier John Barilaro personally chose projects for the fund with “little or no information about the basis” for their selections.  The auditor’s findings also confirmed the government had never published program guidelines and instead favoured local councils that had “worked constructively” with them in the past over council mergers. On the same day that Crawford’s report was released, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that more than 75% of a separate $100m gambling revenue grant program was given to Coalition-held and battleground seats over a decade. Responding to the Stronger Communities Fund grants made in 2019, in the leadup to the state election, the auditor general found a lack of formal systems in place “prevent(ed) accountability and transparency over the government’s approach to selecting councils for funding”. “Councils and projects were instead identified by the former premier, deputy premier and minister for local government and communicated to (the Office of Local Government) with little or no information about the basis for the council or project selection,” the report read. “There was no merit assessment of identified projects. This process resulted in 96 per cent of funds allocated to Coalition state seats.” The report found the only records kept of the approved grants made to 22 councils were found in a series of emails from the staff of both Berejiklian and Barilaro. That was interpreted in a briefing note to Berejiklian as councils that “did not take legal action against us”. The audit found Berejiklian personally identified 41 projects for funding, valued at $142m while Barilaro selected 188 projects totalling $61m. First announced in 2016, program guidelines for the Stronger Communities Fund, developed by the Office of Local Government, were found to be “deficient” in a number of areas, yet were still not used to guide funding selections, Crawford found. She pointed to $8m in funds which were earmarked before guidelines were approved. “It is difficult to understand the merit of project funding decisions, and it is troubling that the Office of Local Government did not seek justification to support projects put forward with limited documentation by the staff of the then premier, deputy premier and minister for local government,” the auditor stated. The auditor’s report comes after a NSW parliament inquiry last year found the fund had been deliberately designed to allow pork-barrelling, and to punish councils which had opposed the government’s controversial local council mergers. Inner West mayor, Darcy Byrne, is calling for his council and others that missed out to be compensated. “The Stronger Communities Fund was established to support forcibly amalgamated councils like the Inner West and Canterbury-Bankstown with local infrastructure, but we were improperly prevented from even applying for funds,” he said. “We still desperately need financial assistance for infrastructure, and the premier should stand up today and commit to working with us on a compensation fund. “It’s time now to act and show that he (Perrottet) is the premier for all of NSW not just blue-ribbon Liberal electorates.” Shadow special minister of state, John Graham, called on the state government to tighten regulations for grants. “This confirms all the worst fears that the public would have had about these schemes,” he said. “Most concerningly, this could happen again.” The auditor general’s report also examined the $100m Regional Cultural Fund, finding that while it was “robust and produced transparent and defensible recommendations” for the then arts minister, Don Harwin, he and Barilaro did not follow the recommendations in more than a fifth of cases. “Reasons for these changes were not documented by Create NSW,” the report found. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Crawford found the “integrity of the approval process for funding allocations was compromised” because Harwin and Barilaro “did not follow the recommendations” in multiple cases and did not document the reason for the changes. “The then minister for the arts, in consultation with the former deputy premier, did not follow the panel’s recommendations for 22 per cent, or more than one in five, of the applications assessed for funding,” the report stated. “Thirty-four applications that were recommended by the independent panel did not receive any funding. In the second funding round, seven of the top 10 ranked applications were not funded. “The minister for the arts approved funding for 22 applications that were not recommended by the independent panel. This resulted in around $9.3m being awarded to applicants that were not rated highest by the independent panel, including six applicants that received grants of $500,000 or more. Most did not meet one or more assessment criteria and received low ratings.” On Tuesday, the Herald reported how about $75m of the $103m raised from poker machine taxes was then spent in Coalition electorates between 2013 and 2021. In response to the revelations NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, highlighted the positive impact of grants programs and said all ministers were aware of their responsibilities. “Grants are important. People criticise grant programs - I’ve seen on my visits to regional NSW - a number of playgrounds and netball courts that never would have been built without grants,” he said. “There is zero tolerance for pork barrelling. I’ve made it abundantly clear to every one of my ministers that they are responsible for those grant programs.”",News/Australia news,NSW auditor general lashes program that directed 96% of grants to Coalition electorates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/nsw-auditor-general-lashes-program-that-directed-96-of-grants-to-coalition-electorates
2/8/2022,"Juan Romero shakes his head as looks out across the lake at the wading spoonbills, the pipe-cleaner silhouettes of the flamingos and the glossy ibis that flash against the Andalucían sky. “This is an illusion,” says the ecologist, a retired teacher. The birds are real enough, of course, and so too are the tufty-eared Iberian lynxes that will be sniffing out a breakfast of rabbit in the quieter, wilder reaches of the huge Doñana national park in southern Spain.  The illusion is what the water level in the lake before him says about the health of the reserve. Although there is far less water in the Charco de la Boca than there should be at this time of year, it is faring better than many parts of the sprawling wetlands known as one of Europe’s green lungs. Water supplies to Doñana, whose marshes, forests and dunes extend across almost 130,000 hectares in the provinces of Huelva, Seville and Cádiz, have declined drastically over the past 30 years because of climate change, farming, mining pollution and marsh drainage. A fresh crisis now looms as regional authorities consider granting an amnesty to the farmers illegally tapping its aquifer to feed the booming strawberry sector. Nine years after Unesco warned that the area’s world heritage status was being jeopardised by such illegal tapping, the regional branch of the conservative People’s party (PP), which has governed Andalucía for the past three years, has announced a proposal to regularise the illicit farms and wells that stretch across 1,460 hectares near the protected natural space. On Wednesday, the Andalucían parliament will vote on whether to begin the legislative process. The PP, whose bid is backed by both the far-right Vox party and the centre-right Citizens party, claims the move would help “safeguard historic rights and a traditional activity [practised] since time immemorial”. Opponents fear it will spell further disaster for the local environment, and point out that the area’s love affair with strawberries, known locally as “red gold”, began in the 1980s. Between January and June last year, Huelva’s exports of soft fruit – almost 20% of which are to the UK – were worth €801.3m (£678m). The campaign group Ecologists in Action describes Doñana as “a hostage to agriculture” and says the aquifer is already being stressed by irrigation demands. SEO BirdLife, the Spanish Ornithological Society, sees the plan as “a new assault on the Doñana natural space that favours a proliferation of irrigation and runs contrary to regional, national, European and international legislation”. Unesco, which declared the Doñana national park a world heritage site in 1994, has asked the Spanish government for an urgent report on the issue “before any decisions are taken that might be difficult to reverse”. The mooted law comes eight months after the European court of justice ruled that Spain had not fulfilled its obligations on preventing illegal water extraction around Doñana and had failed to take the measures needed to stop “significant alterations” to its protected habitats. The European Commission says it is “deeply worried” at the possible impacts of the proposed changes and has not ruled out taking Spain to the court of justice once again. For Felipe Fuentelsaz of WWF Spain, the environmental importance of the region cannot be overstated. “Doñana is a unique place that sits between the south of Europe and north Africa and it’s the main migration route for all the birds in Europe,” he says. “More than 6 million birds – and 200 or 300 different species – come through it each year. It’s mainly a wetland, but it also has a very important coastal dune zone and lots of surrounding forest. So it’s three ecosystems in just one place and it’s the lung of Europe.” Romero, a spokesperson for Ecologists in Action who has lived in the area all his life, dismisses the PP’s plan as a naked attempt to win the votes of legal and illegal farmers before a possible early regional election. “If people haven’t been obeying the law, then the People’s party can’t come along and tell them – for electoral gain – that they’re going to [get their] land legalised,” he says. “It’s a trick and a ruse.” The plain truth, he adds, is that Doñana simply cannot cope with the water demands of any more fruit farms. Drive around the area, where huge white polytunnels break in plastic waves across a landscape of pine and prickly pear, and the feelings of many local farmers are plain to see. Not far from some of the many decommissioned illegal wells – 420 have been shut down in recent years but others soon spring up elsewhere – are signs graffitied with a slogan that demands “no more harassment” from the Guadalquivir Hydrographic Confederation, an agency of Spain’s ecological transition ministry. While the local small farmers’ union, UPA Huelva, supports the PP-led proposal, arguing it will help those who missed out on their “historical rights” under a 2014 moratorium that banned any new cultivation or well-sinking, it says it will not “defend those who have invaded forest areas to turn them into agricultural lands without the correct authorisation”. Not all the local farmers approve of the plan. At the end of January, 300 farmers from nearby Almonte walked away from a regional group that backs the amnesty, complaining that the move would “only serve the interests of a minority of irrigation users”. One local fruit farmer, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, says the new plan is neither fair nor sensible. “I think it’s just madness,” he says. “Doñana is something we all love and respect. But there’s a political party that are proposing something – supported by two other parties – that I simply can’t understand.” The farmer says the planned amnesty is fundamentally flawed and dangerously short-sighted. “You have to start with the water and not the land,” he says. “If you hand out the land, then everyone’s competing with each other, the aquifer’s suffering and awful things happen. We can’t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. But that’s what they’re trying to do and it’s bad for everyone – bad for the park and for the farmers.”",News/World news,Bitter fruit: strawberry boom water plan raises fears for Spanish wetlands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/bitter-fruit-strawberry-boom-water-plan-raises-fears-for-spanish-wetlands
