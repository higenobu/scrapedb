3/2/2022,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) ‚Äî A 46-year-old woman has been arrested on animal cruelty charges after throwing a 3-year-old pug named Bucky off of a seventh-floor balcony Clearwater condominium during an argument with her ex-boyfriend, authorities said. Eric Adeson told Clearwater police investigators the woman, who he had dated for several months, also threw his keys and cellphone over the balcony Sunday. The dog was found dead on the pavement below, police said. Adeson's attorney, Katherine Neal, filed a civil complaint against the woman Monday, seeking $30,000 in damages. The complaint said the couple had ended their relationship in February, but she had arrived at Adeson's condo Sunday smelling of alcohol and being verbally aggressive toward him. He asked her to leave, but she refused and instead picked up the dog and threw it over the balcony. Adeson told the Tampa Bay Times he adopted Bucky as a puppy when his 10-year-old dog named Sandy was undergoing cancer treatments. He said the two had been playmates ever since. ‚ÄúHe (Bucky) just actually had his third birthday,‚Äù Adeson said. ‚ÄúI never thought that Sandy would outlive Bucky.‚Äù The woman, who was arrested Monday, also faces criminal mischief and domestic battery charges, according to Pinellas County jail records. Neal said the civil complaint was filed to send a message to the woman and others that ‚Äúacts of cruelty against animals are utterly outrageous, indecent, and completely unacceptable in our society.""",U.S./Associated Press,Ex-girlfriend tosses man's dog off condo balcony in Florida,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-girlfriend-tosses-mans-dog-152237486.html

3/2/2022,"In less than a week, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted international outcry and strong sanctions from the United States and European Union. In an opinion column for USA TODAY last week, retired Gen. Wesley K. Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, wrote that ""NATO must be prepared to recognize the new reality of a more adversarial Russia. This will require new force deployments, logistics and emergency procedures, and deepening cooperation in the nonmilitary spheres."" USA TODAY Opinion asked Clark this week for his perspective on what's happening as Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine unfolds. His conversation with Editorial Board member Austin Bogues has been edited for length and clarity: 'It's been really hard but we are still': Life in Ukraine as Russian forces assault Kyiv, Kharkiv Q. What is Putin‚Äôs next move after it appears his initial efforts have been stymied to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv? A. He is going to bring in more forces. This far he has used ‚Äúforward detachments‚Äù to probe Ukrainian defenses and attempt to coerce the government to surrender. It hasn‚Äôt worked. Now he is bringing his main force forward, along with Belorussian forces. He will probably intensify his air activity and use heavy artillery strikes. Q. How will the war come to an end? Is there still a possibility of a diplomatic solution? A. A diplomatic solution is unlikely. It could end with Kyiv overrun and a Ukrainian government in exile. Or it could end in a Russian withdrawal to face another operation. Or it could end with a Western and United Nations demand that Putin cannot ignore, due to sanctions and international pressure. Q. What does the nuclear deterrence activation Putin issued Sunday mean in practical terms? A. This was a means of pressuring Ukraine in possible negotiations and also a warning for the West not to intervene. Q. Is there a chance the Ukrainians could win? What would that look like? A. The Ukrainians could win if warm, wet weather and poor Russian logistics immobilize the Russian force and they have the means to attack and destroy that force. Ukraine could also win if the West and international efforts force Putin to withdraw. Q. What are the chances the conflict escalates? A. If Putin wins here, he will go after his next targets, Georgia and the Baltic states. This will bring escalation. At some point, if the fighting in Kyiv intensifies, the U.S. may have to intervene even if it risks escalation. Q. Will the sanctions issued be effective in stopping Putin? A. Sanctions might stop Putin eventually but probably not immediately. Commentary editor Austin Bogues is a member of USA TODAY's Editorial Board.

Even Switzerland, a favorite home for the money of ultra-wealth Russians, said Monday it will comply with the EU sanctions and asset freezes of certain oligarchs close to Putin. The measures are hitting everyone in Russia, but they are aimed at Putin's inner circle. The White House on Saturday announced a new transatlantic task force ""to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs ‚Äî their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains."" Russian oligarchs own some of the world's most expensive yachts and private jets, and they apparently want to keep them.

One Ukrainian mechanic on a Russian super-yacht docked in Mallorca, Spain, took matters into his own hands on Saturday, Spain's Ultima Hora reported. The mechanic, Taras Ostapchuk, saw a video of Russian missiles striking an apartment complex in Kyiv and decided to sink the $7 million yacht, the Lady Anastasia, he said is owned by a Russian arms tycoon, his boss. ""I told myself: 'What do I need a job for if I don't have a country?'"" he told Ultima Hora.

3/2/2022,"(Reuters) - About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday. The vote sparked the biggest protests in months as thousands took to the streets in Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko has imposed a sweeping crackdown on dissent after a contested election challenged his grip on power in 2020. The vote to change the constitution, passed by 65% according to official data, could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. It comes at a time when Lukashenko has fallen in line behind Russian President Vladimir Putin's military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role between the two neighbours. ""Despite the numerous calls from destructive Telegram channels to destabilize the situation, which were spread by citizens outside the country, mass protests did not happen. Police officers were focused on prompt response and suppression of provocations,"" the interior ministry said. The new constitution also gives powers to an assembly created by Lukashenko and populated by party loyalists, officials and pro-government activists, and gives lifetime immunity from prosecution to the president if he leaves office. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said that he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. ""If you (the West) transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,"" Lukashenko said. Lukashenko's rival in the 2020 vote, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, had called on Belarusians to use the referendum vote to protest against the war against Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" to disarm Kyiv. In videos and photos posted on social media, dozens of people gathered at polling stations in Minsk and other cities in Belarus on Sunday. Several videos showed the crowd chanting ""No to war"". ""There is little we can do now, with all this terror and horror in which we live. But I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't try to do something. We are already considered accomplices,‚Äù said Elena, 45, who came to one of the polling stations along with a couple of dozen people. She declined to provide further information about herself for security reasons. The West has already said it will not recognise the results of the referendum.

Police are looking for the man who they say attacked the woman, 43, as she was sitting on a bench at the East 241st Street subway station in the Bronx on Monday, Feb. 21. Video shared by the New York City Police Department shows the man holding what appears to be a black plastic bag approach the woman and throw the bag into the front of her face at 5:15 p.m. In the footage, the unidentified man appears to push the bag into her face. When she buckles forward, he continued to put the bag on the back of her head then walked away. Police are asking for help identifying the man behind the incident. The attack took place just three days before another woman was viciously kicked down the steps and hit in the head with a hammer several times at the Queens Plaza subway station. That woman, 57, suffered a fractured skull and lacerations to her head, authorities said. She was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital in critical condition.

3/2/2022,"France's finance minister said Tuesday that Western sanctions would cause the Russian economy's collapse. A top Russian official responded immediately, saying that economic wars often turn into ""real wars."" The West has leveled sweeping sanctions against Russia that appear to be disrupting its economy. A top Russian official appeared to threaten France with ""real war"" on Tuesday as he responded to saber-rattling comments from the French finance minister about the effects of punitive Western sanctions. In an interview with French radio on Tuesday morning, Bruno Le Maire said the West aimed to ""cause the collapse of the Russian economy"" through an ""economic and financial war on Russia,"" for which the Russian population ""will also pay the consequences."" Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former prime minister and now deputy chairman of its security council, was quick to respond on Twitter. He said: ""A French minister said today that they have declared an economic war on us. Watch what you say, gentlemen! And don't forget that in the history of mankind, economic wars have often turned into real wars."" Western nations including France have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, targeting everything from its central bank and leading financial institutions to President Vladimir Putin himself. The sanctions seem to have already disrupted the Russian economy. On Monday, the value of the ruble crashed by as much as 30% against the US dollar, forcing Russia's central bank to more than double its base interest rate to 20%. Meanwhile, Russians were pictured at ATMs trying to withdraw foreign currency. In the interview with France Info on Tuesday, Le Maire said that economic and financial sanctions leveled by the West against Russia were ""extremely effective,"" adding: ""I don't want to leave any ambiguity about the determination of Europe on this subject. We are going to wage an economic and financial war on Russia."" He continued: ""We want to target the heart of the Russian system. We'll target Vladimir Putin. We'll target the oligarchs. But we'll also target the entire Russian economy."" He added: ""Sanctions must strike fast, strike hard, and we are already seeing the effects. The ruble has collapsed by 30%. Russian foreign-exchange reserves are melting like snow in the sun, and Vladimir Putin's famous war chest has already reduced to almost nothing."" Le Maire said, ""We are going to cause the collapse of the Russian economy.""

3/2/2022,"By Parisa Hafezi VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday the war in Ukraine should be stopped and accused the ""mafia-like regime"" of the United States of creating the conflict. Russia, whose troops invaded Ukraine last week, is a strategic partner for Iran, which has been under Western sanctions for years. While Tehran and Washington have been foes for decades, Iran and Russia have deepened trade ties and have been allies in the Syrian conflict. ""The U.S. regime creates crises, lives off of crises and feeds on various crises in the world. Ukraine is another victim of this policy,"" Khamenei said in a televised speech. ""In my view, Ukraine is a victim of the crises concocted by the United States,"" he said. ""There are two lessons to be learnt here. States which depend on the support of the U.S. and Western powers need to know they cannot trust such countries."" Khamenei criticised Washington and other Western nations as talks reached a critical stage in Vienna between Iran and world powers about reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. Despite progress in the talks, the key sticking point is Tehran wants the issue of uranium traces found at several old but undeclared sites in Iran to be dropped and closed forever, an Iranian official told Reuters. Iran said on Monday efforts to revive the pact could succeed if the United States took a political decision to meet Tehran's remaining demands, as months of negotiations enter what one Iranian diplomat called a ""now or never"" stage. The stakes are high, because the failure of 10 months of talks could carry the risk of a fresh regional war, more harsh sanctions on Iran by the West and continued upward pressure on world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman has said the remaining issues included the extent to which sanctions would be rolled back and providing guarantees that the United States would not quit the pact again. All parties involved in the talks say progress has been made toward the restoration of the pact to curb Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, which the United States abandoned in 2018. But both Tehran and Washington have said there are still some significant differences to overcome.

3/2/2022,"SOFIA (Reuters) -Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov on Monday fired Defence Minister Stefan Yanev for his reluctance to describe the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a war, reiterating that Sofia would speak in one voice with the European Union. Petkov said his centrist coalition government would ask parliament on Tuesday to approve Yanev's dismissal and appoint Todor Tagarev, who was a caretaker defence minister in 2013, to the post. ""My defence minister cannot use the word operation instead of the word war. You cannot call it an operation when thousands of soldiers from the one and the other side are already killed,"" Petkov said in a televised statement. ""The Bulgarian interest is not in bending our heads down...When we see something we do not agree with, something so obvious, we cannot keep quiet,"" Petkov said. Bulgaria is a member of the EU and NATO but many in the Balkan country - which was the closest Communist satellite of the Soviet Union during the Cold War era - feel a strong cultural and historical affinity with Russia. Some fear that taking a very strong stance against the Russian invasion could hurt Bulgaria, which is reliant on Russian energy supplies and tourist inflows to its Black Sea summer resorts. President Rumen Radev said the change of defence ministers in the midst of a military crisis not far away was risky and the ruling coalition would be responsible. Bulgaria has pledged to bolster NATO's eastern flank and lead a battle group in cooperation with NATO, but comprised mainly of Bulgarian troops. Analysts say Yanev's replacement may spur the deployment of more troops of NATO allies in Bulgaria. ""Bulgaria will not transform into an anti-Russian hawk in NATO, but will follow the tone set by Petkov for a clearer voicing of the Bulgarian position in NATO against the aggression in Ukraine,"" political commentator Ivo Indzhov said. In a Facebook post late on Sunday Yanev wrote that he was the subject of a targeted attack aimed at replacing him with someone who would be more open to taking decisions that serve foreign interests, which could put Bulgaria's security at risk. Petkov slammed Yanev's statement saying neither of his ministers had the right to ""their own foreign policy, especially on Facebook"". Petkov said Bulgaria was not forced to take any decisions by its Western allies but stressed that the biggest guarantee for the country's security lay in standing united with its EU peers. Separately, the foreign ministry said on Monday Bulgaria had evacuated the staff of its consular mission in the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Odessa.

3/2/2022,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -A man shot and killed his three children and a fourth person before taking his own life on Monday in an outburst of gun violence that unfolded in a church near California's capital, police said. Sacramento County Sheriff's Department spokesperson Rod Grassmann told reporters near the scene that investigators were seeking clues to a motive for the bloodshed but believed the shooting stemmed from a domestic dispute. ""This was not a random shooting,"" Grassmann said, adding that the gunman and his victims ""knew each other."" The shooting erupted at about 5 p.m. local time inside The Church in Sacramento, located in the Arden-Arcade community on the eastern edge of Sacramento's city limits, Grassmann told reporters. A church employee on an upper floor of the church at the time told authorities he heard a single gunshot, followed by several more shots before he ran out of the building and called police, according to Grassmann. Sheriff's deputies arriving at the scene found five people shot to death - three children under the age of 15, the father and another adult who was not immediately identified by investigators, Grassmann said. He said the father was believed to have shot the four other victims before turning the gun on himself. Authorities did not say whether the second adult was related to the other family members or whether the person was a man or woman. Local television station KTVU cited Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones as saying that investigators believe the shooting unfolded during a supervised visit between the father and the children, and that the fourth victim was the adult chaperone. Governor Gavin Newsom commented on the shooting on Twitter, saying, ""Another senseless act of gun violence in America ‚Äî this time in our backyard. In a church with kids inside. Absolutely devastating.""

3/2/2022,"When archaeologists first glimpsed the gilded splendor of King Tutankhamun‚Äôs tomb, they never thought that one of the most fascinating artifacts didn‚Äôt originate in Egypt ‚Äî or on Earth. Tutankhamun ascended the throne at 9 and died at 19. While he may not have reigned long, he did wield an iron dagger that was (in the most literal sense) out of this world. It might have not looked like much compared to all the riches unearthed from his tomb, including a gold death mask that seems to gaze into the hereafter, but the blade of this dagger was actually carved from a meteorite that had previously fallen to Earth. The question is where that dagger was forged. Never mind the origin of the asteroid that burned up in the atmosphere and sent a meteorite hurtling to Earth. Where the dagger itself came from is debatable, but the type of space rock it was made from might have now revealed something. Researcher Tomoko Arai of the Chiba Institute of Technology in Japan looked up close to find out what type of meteorite was used for such a weapon. She coauthored a study recently published in Meteoritics and Planetary Science. ‚ÄúThe era of King Tutankhamun was around 1300 BC, during the late Bronze Age,‚Äù she told SYFY WIRE ‚ÄúIt is widely believed that the subsequent Iron Age started around 1200 BC. That is when the presence of the Tut iron dagger have raised doubt.‚Äù This and other pre-Iron Age artifacts made of iron suggest the metal was obtained from meteorites before there was a surge in smelting and steel production. It had a pattern that could have only been from an octahedrite. Octahedrites are actually the most common iron meteorites, and what gives them away is known as a Widmanst√§tten pattern, formed by lines of kamacite (an iron-nickel alloy) that intersect. This was previously unknown because a Widmanst√§tten pattern is impossible to see without a microscope. It showed up after the dagger was zapped with X-rays to give the researchers a better idea of what it was made of. Photo: T. Matsui et al./Meteorit. Planet. Sci.  Another sign of an octahedrite is embedded flecks of iron sulfide. They were almost mistaken for rust. The metal in the boy king‚Äôs dagger is also the same kind as that from the Japanese meteorite Shiragahi, from which several royal swords are known to have been made. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the blade or its raw material came all the way from Japan. What it does mean is that, because Shiragahi is an octahedrite, there is something to compare the dagger to. How it was forged also became apparent because the Widmanst√§tten pattern was still visible. ‚ÄúThis structure consists of Ni-poor Fe metal (kamacite) and Ni-rich Fe metal (taenite),"" said Arai. ‚ÄúGeneral forging temperature of steel is above 1,742¬∞ F. The dagger was generated by low to moderate temp forging, so the Widmanst√§tten structure survived during its manufacture.‚Äù Where that meteorite landed and where the dagger was made is unknown. However, the Amarna Letters might be whispering about it from the past. These 3,400-year-old tablets kept records of diplomatic matters and are from around the time Tutankhamun was pharaoh. Something is mentioned about an iron dagger being given to his grandfather, Amenhotep III, who married the daughter of the Anatolian king of Mitanni. It is possible that it was a wedding present that was passed down as an heirloom until it was finally buried with Tutankhamun. ‚ÄúThe hypothesis of the dagger being foreign is consistent with the Amarna letters,‚Äù Arai said. ‚ÄúWe find the plaster used for the gold hilt was also what was not used in the ancient Egypt during that era. We think this is also in line with a foreign origin.‚Äù King Tut‚Äôs mummy was also found with an iron bracelet and headrest. Apologies to this guy, but that still doesn‚Äôt mean his bloodline had extraterrestrial origins.

3/2/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia on Monday doubled down on the logic for sending its forces into Ukraine as it condemned a European Union decision to fund the delivery of weapons to Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that Western arms supplies to Ukraine showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour. He said that many Russians were deeply pained by what was happening to their relatives in Ukraine, but blamed it on the actions of Ukrainian nationalists. ""The European Union is an association that is taking an unfriendly position towards us and taking measures that are not friendly, but hostile towards us,"" he told reporters. Weapons supplies to Ukraine would become ""an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor"" that would not help restore stability but could in the long run have much more dangerous consequences, Peskov said. ""This, once again, confirms that Russia was right about the measures that are being taken in order to ensure the demilitarisation of the country,"" he said. The West has stepped up arms supplies to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the biggest invasion of a European state since World War Two. Moscow says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" to protect civilians. Peskov said, without providing evidence, that many Ukrainians were being used as human shields in what he called a crime by Ukrainian nationalists. He described them as victims of their country's propaganda. ""Not only in the presidential administration, but throughout Russia, the vast majority of the population has friends or relatives who live in Ukraine. Naturally, everyone's hearts are aching for what is happening to these relatives,"" he said. He declined to comment on casualties suffered by Russian forces, referring the question to the defence ministry. He also declined to elaborate on President Vladimir Putin's instructions at the weekend for Russia's nuclear deterrence forces to be placed on a ""special regime"" of alertness, or to comment on whether there was a risk of confrontation between Russia and NATO.

3/2/2022,"The two reportedly complained to flight attendants for over an hour before the Black woman was asked to move to the back row. A California woman claims she had a Rosa Parks experience on a recent Delta Airlines flight when she was asked to give up her seat and move to the back of the plane in order to accommodate two white women. As reported by Revolt, Camille Henderson was on her way back to the Bay Area from Atlanta on Feb. 3 when Delta flight attendants asked her to give her her seat after the two white women sitting next to her in the same row complained about not having enough room. ‚ÄúThey felt like they were ticketed first-class seats, but they couldn‚Äôt provide the tickets,‚Äù Henderson told ABC7 News. The two women reportedly complained to flight attendants for over an hour before Henderson was asked by airline staff to move to row 34, the plane‚Äôs last row. Henderson shared an audio recording with ABC7 News, in which someone is heard asking her, ‚ÄúAre you flying by yourself?‚Äù Henderson confirms that she is, and the person responds, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a seat back there in aisle 34. It‚Äôs an aisle seat.‚Äù That‚Äôs when the recording stops, according to the report. Henderson‚Äôs ticket was for a window seat in row 15. Instead of standing her ground and refusing to give up the seat, Henderson complied out of fear of retaliation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make it a race thing, but instead of asking the two white women that were seated next to me [to move], in an attempt to accommodate them, they basically made me have to move,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know why I had to move because that was the seat that I paid for; that was my assigned seat.‚Äù Henderson said the walk to the back of the plane was humiliating. ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm walking back there, it‚Äôs just humiliating,‚Äù she said of the experience. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like having the entire flight look at you and asking what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù After the flight, Henderson attempted to file a complaint with Delta customer service but was told the matter was out of their hands. The customer service representative actually seemed a bit perplexed about the motive behind her complaint. Henderson said the rep asked her, ‚ÄúHow were you humiliated for them to ask you to go to another seat?‚Äù Delta released the following statement to ABC7 in response to Henderson‚Äôs experience: ‚ÄúWe are looking into this situation to better understand what happened. Delta has no tolerance for discrimination in any form and these allegations run counter to our deeply-held values of respecting and honoring the diversity of our customers.‚Äù ‚ÄúI just want them to acknowledge that they made me feel powerless, and they can‚Äôt do that to customers moving forward,‚Äù Henderson said. ‚ÄúMe, as a Black woman, I was displaced to make two white women comfortable.

3/2/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Former President Donald Trump has appealed a judge‚Äôs decision requiring he answer questions under oath in New York state‚Äôs civil investigation into his business practices ‚Äî a widely expected move that's likely to prolong the fight over his testimony by months. Lawyers for Trump and his two eldest children filed papers on Monday with the appellate division of the state's trial court, seeking to overturn Manhattan Judge Arthur Engoron's Feb. 17 ruling. They argue ordering the Trumps to testify violates their constitutional rights because their answers could be used in a parallel criminal investigation. In an eight-page ruling, Engoron set a March 10 deadline for Trump and his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., to sit for depositions. Lawyers for the Trumps asked the appellate court for a stay to spare them from questioning while it considers the matter. The court did not set a date for arguments. It typically issues decisions several months after that, but could be inclined to rule on an expedited basis given the urgency of New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation and the Trumps' desire to swiftly overturn Engoron‚Äôs ruling. A message seeking comment was left with James' office. In a statement on Friday, as lawyers for the Trumps were preparing their appeal, the attorney general signaled she was ready for a long fight to get them to testify. ‚ÄúDonald J. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump were ordered by the court to comply with our lawful investigation into Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization‚Äôs financial dealings,"" James said in the statement. ""While they have the right to seek a delay, they cannot deter us from following the facts and the law wherever they may lead. Make no mistake: My office will continue to pursue this case without fear or favor because no one is above the law.‚Äù Trump did not immediately comment on the appeal. In a statement following Engoron's decision, he called the ruling ‚Äúa continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in history."" ‚ÄúTHERE IS NO CASE!‚Äù he said, claiming he's unable to get a fair hearing in New York ‚Äúbecause of the hatred of me by Judges and the judiciary‚Äù and accusing James‚Äô office of ‚Äúdoing everything within their corrupt discretion to interfere with my business relationships, and with the political process.‚Äù James, a Democrat, has said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump‚Äôs company, the Trump Organization, used ‚Äúfraudulent or misleading‚Äù valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits. In his ruling, Engoron wrote: ‚ÄúA State Attorney General commences investigating a business entity, uncovers copious evidence of possible financial fraud, and wants to question, under oath, several of the entities‚Äô principals, including its namesake. She has the clear right to do so.‚Äù If Engoron‚Äôs decision is upheld it could force Trump into a tough decision about whether to answer questions, or stay silent, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Anything Trump says in a civil deposition could be used against him in the criminal probe being overseen by the Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office. Yahoo Immersive: Where are Russian forces attacking Ukraine? At a hearing prior to Engoron‚Äôs decision, Trump‚Äôs lawyers argued that having him sit for a civil deposition is an improper attempt to get around a state law barring prosecutors from calling someone to testify before a criminal grand jury without giving them immunity. A lawyer for the attorney general‚Äôs office told Engoron that it wasn‚Äôt unusual to have civil and criminal investigations proceeding at the same time, and Engoron rejected a request from lawyers for the Trumps to pause the civil probe until the criminal matter is over. Last summer, spurred by evidence uncovered in James‚Äô civil investigation, the Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office charged Weisselberg and the Trump Organization with tax fraud, alleging he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty. The future of the criminal probe was thrown into question last week when the two prosecutors leading it abruptly quit. Lawyers for the Trumps asked the appellate court Monday to consider three questions: ‚Äî whether James' office is violating their rights by issuing subpoenas for their testimony while also participating in the criminal investigation; ‚Äî whether protections for grand jury witnesses under state law, such as immunity, can be ‚Äúeviscerated, if the same agency involved in the criminal investigation simply opens a ‚Äòcivil‚Äô investigation into the very same matters‚Äù; ‚Äî and whether Engoron erred in rejecting the Trumps' contention that James has engaged in selective prosecution. Engoron, in his ruling, said the thousands of pages of evidence he‚Äôs reviewed in the case shows there‚Äôs sufficient basis for continuing the investigation and undercuts ‚Äúthe notion that this ongoing investigation is based on personal animus, not facts and law.‚Äù ___ Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak  and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/",U.S./Associated Press,Trump appeals ruling forcing him to testify in NY probe,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-appeals-ruling-forcing-him-214019622.html
3/2/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico will not impose any economic sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. He also criticized what he called censorship of Russian state-sponsored media by social media companies. ""We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all the governments in the world,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference. Lopez Obrador's position stands in contrast to the international sanctions imposed on Russia for President Vladimir Putin's actions. Russia has built strong links to various governments in Latin America, especially authoritarian administrations in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, but its ties with Mexico are seen to be limited due to the strong U.S.-Mexico relations. The Mexican and U.S. economies are deeply intertwined. But leftist leader Lopez Obrador has at times had testy relations with the United States and has criticized U.S. foreign policy. Lopez Obrador's comments came in response to a question about the interest in Mexico of Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil and Russian airline Aeroflot. Lukoil said on Friday it has completed its acquisition of a 50% operator interest in an offshore oil project in Mexico, part of its drive to expand its global reach. The Mexican president also criticized what he characterized as the censorship of Russian state media. ""I don't agree with the fact that media from Russia or any country is censored,"" Lopez Obrador said. Alphabet Inc's Google barred Russia's state-owned media outlet RT and other channels from receiving money for ads on their websites, apps and YouTube videos, similar to a move by Facebook after the invasion of Ukraine.

3/2/2022,"By Andreas Rinke and Sarah Marsh BERLIN (Reuters) - The entire staff of former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's taxpayer-funded office have quit as the long-time friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin resists growing pressure to cut his ties to the Kremlin following its invasion of Ukraine. Schroeder, who took several jobs at Russian energy companies after leaving office in 2005, and other politicians from the ruling Social Democrats (SPD) have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks for their lobbying for Russian firms. Such links have become a growing liability for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was long accused of being soft on Russia over the Ukraine crisis until his government last week did an about-face on various energy and defence policies. Over the weekend, SPD leaders urged Schroeder to give up his Russian posts as other former European politicians have, including France's former Prime Minister Francois Fillon. But Schroeder has resisted such pressure and, while he expressed rare criticism of Russia over its invasion in a statement last Thursday, he also said mistakes had been made ""on both sides"". Europe must ensure it does not cut its ties to Russia completely, he added. Staffer Albrecht Funk told Reuters that he, two secretaries and a driver had asked to be reassigned to other jobs in the chancellery, out of Schroeder's office. Funk declined to comment on the reason. Reuters was unable to reach Schroeder for comment. The chancellery did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Politicians of all stripes and Germany's taxpayers association have called in recent weeks for the state to stop funding the office Schroeder is legally due as a former chancellor. Putin piled lavish praise on Schroeder during Chancellor Scholz's visit to Moscow two weeks ago, saying it was thanks to him that Germans' gas bills were lower than elsewhere. ""He speaks only for himself, not the government,"" said Scholz. Critics say Germany's reliance on Russia for half its gas needs long constrained its ability or appetite to get tough with Russia. On Monday, the SPD premier of a northern state that set up a public foundation to help Gazprom complete the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, despite U.S. sanctions, said it would be wound down.
