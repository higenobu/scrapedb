5/15/2022,"A baby formula shortage gripping the U.S. since March has parents in a panic over where and when they’ll be able to find the products they need to feed their kids. The out-of-stock rate, representing the amount of formula that’s not in stock compared to what’s typically available, was 43% for the week ending May 8, according to Datasembly, a provider of real-time product data for retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands. With no easy end in sight, caregivers nationwide have been forced to devote their free time to driving between stores in search of formula, prompting retailers to limit the number of cans customers can buy. Others have turned to Facebook groups and informal support networks to acquire the nutritional products that work best for their kids. “I've looked online, I have my mom in Boston looking, my mother-in-law in Florida looking,” Elyssa Schmier previously told Fortune about her trouble finding formula for her 8-month-old son. “Everyone we know is looking for us and no one can find it.” How did a baby formula crisis spring up in one of the world’s richest countries? Experts say a recall by one of the industry’s largest manufacturers, persistent supply-chain issues, and a market dominated by only a few players have combined to form what one consumer goods expert calls a “perfect storm” affecting the supply of essential formula to millions of babies across the U.S. And the shortage could last for months. Here’s how we got here. Abbott Nutrition is the food sector arm of medical device and health care giant Abbott Laboratories, making products that range from carb-loaded drinks that help patients rebound from surgery, to energy drinks, to powder and liquid baby formula. Though it maintains a global manufacturing network, its plant in Sturgis, Mich., is among the few in the U.S. that produce formula. On Feb. 17, Abbott voluntarily recalled its Sturgis-manufactured products and shut down the plant following reports that four infants fell ill from bacterial infection and two died after consuming formula produced in the plant. A whistleblower report, submitted to the FDA in October 2021, alleged further health and safety compliance issues at the facility and contributed to a formal inspection by the agency earlier this year. Abbott is now waiting for approval to reopen. “We understand the situation is urgent—getting Sturgis up and running will help alleviate this shortage,” the company said in a statement to Fortune. After conducting its own investigation, which included genomic sequencing of bacteria, the company reported that nothing on its premises matched the specific strain of bacteria that caused the illnesses and deaths. “The Cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non-product contact areas of the facility and has not been linked to any known infant illness,” the company said in a statement. The FDA, however, found more problems with the facility that extended beyond the possibility of previous contamination. Following its own inspection, which occurred from Jan. 31 to March 18, the FDA says that it observed Cronobacter sakazakii “in medium and high care areas of powdered infant formula production”—a problem regardless of whether or not it was the same strain that caused the specific infant deaths. The agency additionally said in its report that the company “did not ensure that all surfaces that contacted infant formula were maintained to protect infant formula from being contaminated by any source.” According to the FDA, the company is still working to “correct findings” from its inspection. The plant has not yet been able to reopen as a result. Abbott won’t be able to get product from its Sturgis facility on shelves for another six to eight weeks, according to the company. And that’s only if it reopens as soon as possible. “From a parent’s perspective, there’s no easy, magical answer right now,” says Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring product integrity. Even after the plant reopens and begins to provide formula to families again, a larger question remains: How can closing a single manufacturing facility have such a drastic effect on millions of babies’ access to nutrition? The baby formula market exists as a shared monopoly, with only a few manufacturers controlling nearly all supply. Abbott had an approximately 43% market share a decade ago, according to a USDA report from 2011 — the most recent number available. Little has changed since then. The company still maintains exclusive provider contracts in many states with WIC, the USDA’s supplemental nutrition program for low-income families, which makes up nearly half of formula sales nationwide. A few other manufacturers, including Mead-Johnson and Nestlé, also have WIC contracts and control the rest of the market. In addition to its highly concentrated structure, the baby formula market is difficult for another reason. Its demand is set by the nation’s birth rate, and the market has been shrinking for years. The number of births has declined every year since 2008, except for 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With only a few key players whose capacities are tied to a shrinking market, repercussions are inevitable when anything gets in the way of a certain product getting to store shelves. Other manufacturers are bound to struggle with an influx of new demand from consumers who can’t get what they’d typically buy. “The dilemma [manufacturers] have is that it's not a very lucrative market,” says Patrick Penfield, a professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. “The only way you can grow your market share is if you’re aggressively going after competition.” Because Abbott is one of the biggest players in the game already, significantly expanding its share is not really an option. “If you can't grow your market share, then you look at how you can reduce costs,” says Penfield. “And sometimes when you reduce the costs, you may not have the right protocols or procedures in place to make sure that you're doing things properly.” “I’m not saying that's what Abbott Laboratories did,” he cautions. “But that would be an assumption of mine.” Abbott is not the only entity possibly at fault. “There's plenty of blame to go around here,” says Scott Faber, a professor at Georgetown University’s law center and vice president of government affairs at Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit aimed at empowering consumers. Faber sees the FDA itself as in part responsible for the shortage. The agency, he says, did not react fast enough to the whistleblower report and should have conducted a plant inspection sooner. “When a drunk driver causes a car crash, the drunk driver bears much of the blame, but so does the bartender who looked the other way while serving one too many drinks,” he says. When submitting the report for the record last month, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) wrote: “I am equally concerned that the FDA reacted far too slowly to this report. The report was submitted to the FDA on Oct. 20, 2021. The FDA did not interview the whistleblower until late December 2021. According to news reports, FDA did not inspect the plant in person until Jan. 31, 2022, and the recall was not issued until Feb. 17, 2022.” The agency did not finish its inspection and issue observations to Abbott until March 18. The company says that it has been working since then to update its education and training protocols as well as its cleaning and maintenance procedures. “The FDA would not have shut down that factory if they didn’t find anything. So there's definitely some type of noncompliance that's going on,” Penfield says. Now the FDA is working to catch up to a crisis that seems to have been unfolding in slow motion for months. “The FDA recognizes that many consumers have been unable to access infant formula and critical medical foods they are accustomed to using and are frustrated by their inability to do so,” the agency said in a statement to Fortune. “The agency is doing everything in its power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when they need it.” This week, the White House held a press conference to address the shortage and how it plans to get formula restocked as quickly as possible without compromising safety. “Those steps include first cutting red tape to get more infant formula to the shelves by urging states to provide flexibility in the WIC program, which can be a key driver of some supply disruptions,” said a senior administration official. The official added that the administration is calling on the FTC and state attorneys general to monitor price gouging by third-party sellers. The official outlined a third avenue for alleviating the shortage: foreign imports. “The U.S. normally produces 98% percent of the infant formula it consumes, and trading partners in Mexico, Chile, Ireland, and the Netherlands are key sources of imports,” said the administration in a release that accompanied the press conference. However, there’s no timeline yet for when those formula imports will arrive in the U.S and be distributed. Friday, FDA commissioner Robert Califf tweeted that the agency will announce its plan next week. When pressed about how long the shortage will last, the official said there is no estimate for when Abbott’s facility will resume functioning. “I see continued shortages,” says Penfield about the coming weeks. “I think there's a lot of pressure on Abbott to get that plant up and running. And until they do so, you're gonna see these continued shortages.” Fortune would like to hear about your experiences navigating the baby formula shortage.

5/15/2022,"After a State Department fact sheet was changed to observe Taiwan’s “best interests,” U.S. officials have maintained that Washington upholds the ""one China"" policy and therefore does not support the island’s independence.

The fact sheet change, which apparently angered Beijing, removed an acknowledgment of “the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China,” as well as a statement saying the U.S. “does not support Taiwan independence.”

In a press briefing on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the fact sheet had not been updated for years. “I think we care most about ensuring that our relationships around the world are reflected accurately in our fact sheets,” he said.

China, in response, slammed the change as “political manipulation of the Taiwan question.” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian stressed that the island is an “inalienable” part of China and that “the attempt to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait will hurt the United States itself.”

On Wednesday, Price affirmed that the U.S. does not support Taiwan’s independence, pursuant to its official commitment to Beijing’s ""one China"" policy made in 1979. Under the policy, Washington recognizes Beijing as the “sole legal government of China,” though it allows for unofficial ties with Taiwan, including assistance with self-defense.

“We do not support Taiwan independence, and we have repeatedly made this clear both in public and in private,” Price said in a press briefing.

“Though the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and does not support Taiwan independence, we do have, as you know, a robust unofficial relationship with Taiwan as well as an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”

Washington, however, maintains ambiguity on the extent of its military assistance to Taiwan. This policy supposedly deters Beijing from launching an assault and Taipei from seeking independence at the same time.

Still, the U.S. reiterates its “rock-solid” commitment to Taiwan’s defense. The fact sheet update also says it “continues to encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan.”

“We will continue to stand with our partner Taiwan. Our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid, including in the face of acts of potential intimidation,” Price said.

On Tuesday, the guided-missile cruiser USS Port Royal made a “routine” Taiwan Strait transit “in accordance with international law.” This was the second U.S. mission in two weeks, drawing an angry response from Beijing.
