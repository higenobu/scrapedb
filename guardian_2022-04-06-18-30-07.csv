4/6/2022,"Holidaymakers and travellers are facing yet more disruption to their plans after easyJet and British Airways cancelled more flights as a result of staffing shortages resulting from soaring coronavirus cases. BA cancelled 78 flights scheduled to take off from or land at Heathrow on Wednesday, while easyJet cancelled at least 30 flights scheduled to take off from or arrive at Gatwick. Some of the routes affected include journeys to Amsterdam, Kraków, Bologna and Berlin. The latest cancellations mark another day of widespread disruption for airline passengers, many of whom are taking advantage of the lifting of travel restrictions to get away on Easter holidays. More than 1,000 UK flights have been cancelled by airlines in recent days because of high levels of crew absences related to Covid-19. Demand for foreign travel has soared after the easing of almost all Covid travel restrictions but it comes as high levels of Covid cases are exacerbating existing staff shortages caused by large numbers of aviation workers being laid off during the pandemic. EasyJet had previously warned that it expected to cancel hundreds more flights during the week because of staff absences. It said at the weekend it had tried to offset shortages by rostering standby crew but was forced to make fresh cancellations at short notice. Passengers whose flights have not been cancelled have faced long queues for check-in, security and baggage reclaim at several airports. Airports, airlines and much of the aviation industry dismissed or furloughed many workers when travel ground to a half during the pandemic, and trade unions have said the sector is struggling to attract new staff because of low levels of pay and poor conditions. Queues have been particularly bad at Manchester airport, which appears to have been less prepared that some of its rivals for the return of more passengers. The airport’s managing director, Karen Smart, stepped down on Tuesday after coming in for criticism from passengers and airport staff after weeks of chaos where thousands of passengers missed their flights because of queues up to seven hours long.",News/Business,BA and easyJet cancel more flights to pile on misery for travellers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/ba-and-easyjet-cancel-more-flights-to-pile-on-misery-for-travellers-heathrow-gatwick-staff-shortages-covid
4/6/2022,"Emergency services’ response to the catastrophic flooding in the northern rivers over the past month has been defended by officials including Resilience NSW boss Shane Fitzsimmons. Speaking at budget estimates in the state’s parliament house on Wednesday, Fitzsimmons said there had been no confusion about who was in charge of responding to the crisis and denied that the government had “dropped the ball” in its response. It was also revealed that five of the six flood management plans for local government areas in the northern rivers were out of date, having last been updated in 2013. The Lismore plan was updated in 2018 and is due for review next year. “Just because it has a past due date doesn’t necessarily mean it is invalid. The data may well still be accurate,” acting State Emergency Service (SES) commissioner Daniel Austin told the hearing. Reviews are trigged every five years or when new information and data comes to hand, including flooding events and changing circumstances. Fitzsimmons said the scale of the floods was not predicted because the conditions that led to them had not been accurately forecast. This view was echoed by Austin, who repeatedly pointed to improvements needed in forecasting abilities by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). When asked why Lismore residents were evacuated on 29 March before being told to return home – only to be issued with a second evacuation order in the middle of the night – Austin said the advice had changed. “The renewed projection was somewhat below the top of the levee, at which point the decision was made that the risk posed by the overtopping of the levee by the Wilsons River no longer existed,” Austin said. “At that point, the evacuation order for the Lismore CBD was revoked. “Later that evening, unforecast significant weather hit that area and flooding occurred in the CBD of Lismore. It was not until after that flash flooding occurred that the Wilsons River later that morning finally overtopped the levee and came back up.” Austin said the government could look at investing more into modelling technology to better predict flash flooding and thunderstorm events. After the Lismore flood – the second suffered by residents this year – the Guardian revealed two of the BoM’s most sophisticated simulation models showed the storm front, which some forecasts predicted would head out to sea, instead returning inland. Fitzsimmons told the hearing that the scale of the events had not been predicted. “It caught all manner of people unawares, and it resulted in extraordinary widespread, unprecedented damage and destruction,” he said. “In hindsight it would have been great to have all manner of additional things in place if there was a forecast that indicated what ultimately happened – and there wasn’t.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When asked by opposition MP Walt Secord who had “dropped the ball” – Resilience NSW or the SES, Fitzsimmons said he was “not aware of what ball has been dropped”, insisting the SES was the lead agency “without question, without confusion”. A focus for his agency – created in the wake of the black summer bushfires – would be getting power back in Lismore by Easter. Opposition spokesperson Jihad Dib said the government needed to come clean “What we heard today was the government’s denial of reality,” he said. “Indeed, when they were questioned, the response was, we haven’t dropped the ball and that’s really hard to believe.”",News/Australia news,Disaster agency chiefs defend response to ‘unpredicted’ NSW floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/disaster-agency-chiefs-defend-response-to-unpredicted-nsw-floods
4/6/2022,"Ed Sheeran has won a high court battle over whether he plagiarised another artist’s track for his hit single Shape of You, the most streamed song in Spotify’s history. In a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Zacaroli concluded that Sheeran “neither deliberately nor subconsciously” copied a phrase from Oh Why when writing Shape of You. Sheeran and his Shape Of You co-writers, Snow Patrol’s John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, denied copying the 2015 song by Sami Chokri. Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, and his co-writer Ross O’Donoghue, claimed an “Oh I” hook in Shape Of You was “strikingly similar” to an “Oh Why” refrain in their track. Legal proceedings began in May 2018, with Sheeran and his co-writers asking the high court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O’Donoghue’s copyright. Sheeran also said his reputation had been sullied by the allegations. Two months later, Chokri and O’Donoghue issued their own claim for “copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement”. Both parties anticipated costs in the region of £3m between them. Sheeran had denied he “borrows” ideas from unknown songwriters without acknowledgement and insisted he “always tried to be completely fair” in crediting people who contributed to his albums. The singer, who spent two days in the witness box, told the court he was trying to “clear my name” and denied using litigation to intimidate Chokri and O’Donoghue into abandoning the copyright dispute. During the proceedings, the superstar frequently burst into song and hummed musical scales and melodies from Blackstreet’s No Diggity and Nina Simone’s classic Feeling Good to demonstrate how common the melody Shape of You uses is. He said it uses “a basic minor pentatonic pattern” which is “entirely commonplace”. The singer has already given the writers behind TLC’s 90s hit No Scrubs a credit on Shape of You after comparisons were made between the two songs. All three Shape Of You co-authors denied allegations of copying Oh Why and said they did not remember hearing the track before the legal fight. Ian Mill QC, representing the three men, said the legal battle had been “deeply traumatising”, arguing the case should never have reached trial. He claimed the case against them was “impossible to hold”, alleging evidence supported the argument that Shape of You was an “independent creation”. But the Oh Why co-writers’ lawyer, Andrew Sutcliffe QC, labelled Sheeran a “magpie” and “an obsessive music squirrel” who “habitually copies” other artists, adding that it was “extremely likely” he had previously heard Oh Why. Sutcliffe alleged that Sheeran’s lawyers brought the legal proceedings because PRS for music – the industry body that collects and distributes royalties – had “frozen” an estimated £20m in royalties from the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. He said the case was not about “how famous the claimants are, it boils down to that the defendants are not … Shaggy, Coldplay, Rihanna or Jay-Z. If they were they would have been treated in a very different way.” Sheeran, it was alleged, was targeted with a “concerted plan” by Chokri’s former management to secure his interest in the singer, with Oh Why being sent to those around the star, including the late SBTV founder Jamal Edwards. It was also claimed Sheeran must have been aware of Chokri because they appeared on SBTV at about the same time, shared friends, Chokri had sent messages to him on Twitter, and Sheeran had allegedly shouted his name at a performance. Chokri told the trial he felt “robbed” by the music star and was left shocked when he first heard Shape Of You on the radio. Musicology experts gave contrasting views at the trial. While the American forensic musicologist Anthony Ricigliano said it was “objectively unlikely” that any similarities between the two tracks “result from copying”, Christian Siddell, another musicologist, said he found melodic similarities were “so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is… highly improbable”. Both agreed that neither of them had found “the same combination of either the ‘Oh Why’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – nor the ‘Oh I’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – in any other compositions”. Shape Of You – which Sheeran said he had originally envisaged being performed by Rihanna or Little Mix, was a worldwide hit, becoming the bestselling song of 2017 in the UK.",Arts/Music,Ed Sheeran wins court battle over Shape of You plagiarism accusation,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/06/ed-sheeran-wins-court-battle-over-shape-of-you-plagiarism-accusation
4/6/2022,"The West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has slammed the “idiots” and “morons” who parked a truck outside his home with a political ad linking Labor with the Chinese Communist party. Large trucks with advertisements showing the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, voting for Labor have been seen in cities across Australia this week, depicting the CCP leader voting with a ballot reading “Labor 1” alongside the words “CCP SAYS VOTE Labor”. McGowan said one of the trucks was parked outside his home while unidentified individuals filmed. “They’re idiots. And they’re morons,” McGowan said on Wednesday. “And whoever is behind that should be ashamed of themselves. They go and park it outside my house and then film.” The advertisements are authorised by conservative lobby group Advance Australia and align with the Coalition’s attempt to attack Labor over a perceived weakness on China ahead of the election. The advertisements, also seen in Melbourne and Canberra, have caused renewed concern over regulation around political advertising. The Australia Institute’s democracy and accountability senior researcher, Bill Browne, said it was natural for voters to ask questions. Seen in Melbourne. Gonna be a fun campaign. pic.twitter.com/FnE1RDCKNn “The reality is in Australia, it’s perfectly legal to lie in a political ad,” Browne said. “And it shouldn’t be.” “We know that regulation along the lines of South Australia’s laws against misleading advertising would help address these problems generally. “In South Australia, members of the public who think a political ad is misleading can make a complaint to the electoral commissioner who can can order the misleading ad to be withdrawn as well as give out financial penalties.” Similar laws have been adopted by the ACT. A spokesperson for the Australian Electoral Commission said the commission was not the “arbiter of truth” and did not have the authority to block the advertisement. They did, however, remove the tick which had originally been placed in the box next to “Labor” and replace it with a “1” to ensure it did not mislead voters on the proper method of filling out a ballot. “We just can’t police the truth behind things and we can only make sure that it doesn’t breach the Electoral Act,” the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked whether the advertising was misinformation, Advance Australia said it was “no secret that China would prefer Labor win the election”. “Advance is committed to campaigning for our country’s freedom, security, and prosperity – and believe this is an important issue for voters to consider,” a spokesperson said. “We will continue to campaign on this and the other key message that Australia needs to be aware of before they go to the polls – if they vote Labor, they will get Green.” Reforms to enforce truth in political advertising face some practical barriers and often raise concerns about constraints on freedom of speech. But misinformation and falsehoods in recent elections have prompted calls for action. Last election, the United Australia party used its vast advertising spend to spread an incorrect claim that Labor would introduce $1tn in new taxes. Fringe Facebook groups claimed Labor was planning a “death tax”. At the 2016 election, Labor infamously ran a “Mediscare” campaign against the Turnbull government. Some experts believe limiting campaign expenditure through spending caps is the best way to reduce the ability for misinformation to influence voters. Marian Sawer, an emeritus professor and a political scientist with the Australian National University, said: “I continue to believe that one of the best ways to stop us all drowning in a sea of negative advertising during election campaigns is through caps on campaign expenditure.”",News/Australia news,Mark McGowan condemns ‘morons’ for displaying ads outside his home linking Labor with China,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/mark-mcgowan-condemns-morons-for-displaying-ads-outside-his-home-linking-labor-with-china
4/6/2022,"The European Union and the US are expected to announce further measures against Russia, with reports that sanctions targeting the daughters of President Vladimir Putin were under consideration. A day after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, gave harrowing testimony to the UN about atrocities he described as war crimes, EU diplomats were preparing to discuss a ban on Russian coal, ceasing transactions with four key banks and banning many Russian ships from EU ports later on Wednesday. The Russian leader’s closest family members could be added to the growing list of sanctions, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported, citing people the news outlets said were familiar with the plan. It is not clear if those sanctions, against Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, will come from the US, EU or both. However, tensions were rising among member states in the EU around the new measures. Lithuania, one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies in the EU, said the current proposals were “not really an adequate response” to the horrors being discovered in Ukrainian towns, following the departure of Russian troops. “Coal, four banks (deswifted already), a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,” said Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis. “A feeble response is just an invitation for more atrocities. It could and should be stronger.” Lithuania announced on Sunday it had stopped all imports of Russian gas, the first EU member state to do so, but the bloc as a whole, which gets 40% of its gas imports from its eastern neighbour, is reluctant to take that step. The EU accelerated faltering talks on further sanctions against Russia, as evidence emerged of alleged war crimes against defenceless civilians in towns that had been controlled by Russian forces. In harrowing testimony to the UN security council on Tuesday, Zelenskiy described how people had been shot, tortured, raped and crushed by tanks, urging that Russian leaders be brought to justice for war crimes via an international tribunal modelled on the Nuremberg trials of Nazis. “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there,” he told the assembly. “They killed entire families – adults and children – and they tried to burn the bodies.” As well as a ban on coal and on Russian ships (with exceptions for humanitarian aid, food and energy), the European commission has proposed a full transaction ban on four Russian banks, including the second largest, VTB. The EU, however, has already decided to cut VTB off from the Swift messaging system, meaning it is already much harder to do business with the bank. Under the proposals announced by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Tuesday, Russian and Belarusian road transport companies would be banned from entering the EU. The commission also wants to ban the export of hi-tech goods, including quantum computers and advanced semiconductors, to Russia. Certain Russian imports would be banned, including wood, cement, seafood and alcohol products estimated to be worth €5.5bn to Russia each year. The plans are now being studied by EU capitals, which are likely to amend the measures before seeking unanimous agreement, either on Wednesday or Thursday. After a meeting with his German counterpart in Berlin, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said European sanctions will include “coal and oil”. If passed, the measures would be the fifth package of EU sanctions since Vladimir Putin declared he would recognise the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, groundwork for the unprovoked invasion he launched days later. While the first four rounds of EU sanctions were agreed relatively quickly, tensions have been rising over the next steps. Poland and the Baltic states have been calling for a total ban on Russian fossil fuel exports, while Germany, which gets 55% of its gas from Russia, is concerned about unemployment and rocketing petrol prices. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who was congratulated by the Kremlin on his electoral victory on Monday, also opposes a ban on gas and oil. Austria is also seen as lukewarm on the plans. “It’s clear Vienna, Budapest and Berlin are less happy,” said a diplomat from one of the so-called “sanctionista” countries that favour a tough line. Germany supports the coal ban, which would target trade worth €4bn a year to Russia. Last month the deputy chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced a plan to phase out Russian coal by the end of the summer and oil by the end of the year. “By the end of the year, we aim to be almost independent,” he said. The Netherlands, home to the EU’s largest port, Rotterdam, is understood to support the ban on Russian ships. Supporters of strong sanctions are also urging for “some weird derogations” in existing sanctions to be removed, for instance closing loopholes in earlier measures banning the sale of EU luxury goods to Russia. In a separate speech to the Spanish parliament on Tuesday, Zelenksiy appealed for a ban on lucrative Russian oil exports. Drawing parallels between the 1937 bombing of Guernica during the Spanish civil war and the attack on his country, Zelenskiy said the “fate of the entire European project, the values that unite us” were at stake in Ukraine. Russia has denied any responsibility for the deaths, claiming that photos were staged or people were killed after their forces pulled out. Satellite images, however, show bodies lying in streets in towns under Russian occupation. EU sanctions are being drawn up in coordination with the White House, which has promised a ban on all investment in Russia. “The goal is to force them to make a choice,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said. “The biggest part of our objective here is to deplete the resources that Putin has to continue his war against Ukraine.” “You can expect … that they will target Russian government officials, their family members, Russian-owned financial institutions, also state-owned enterprises,” she said. She declined to comment on reports in the Wall Street Journal that the sanctions would target Putin’s two daughters.",News/World news,EU and US sanctions against Russia could target Putin’s daughters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/eu-sanction-russia-reports-putin-daughters-ukraine
4/6/2022,"On 14 March 2022, Karl-Anthony Towns pirouetted, leapt and dunked his way to a 60-point performance with the grace of a ballet dancer and the strength of, well, a 7ft, 250lb NBA player. After the game, he started to text the most important person in his life: his mother, Jackie. Then he stopped himself and started to cry. “This was a moment for us,” Towns later told ESPN. “She would’ve loved it.” If Kyrie Irving is the NBA’s posterboy for how to get away with not taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously, then Minnesota Timberwolves star center Towns represents why it’s important that you do. Since the start of the pandemic, Towns, who is just 26 years old, has lost Jackie and six other family members to Covid-19. His own bout with the virus left him hospitalized in January of last year. He has spoken about the grief that he went through and the need for people to get vaccinated after seeing several prominent NBA stars express their reasons for holding out. It turned out 14 March was significant for other reasons. “Yesterday was two years to the date that my parents walked into the ER at JFK Medical Center in Edison, NJ and were admitted with COVID-19,” he wrote on Twitter the next day. “The same hospital that my mother gave me life, and tragically, the same hospital where I saw her life begin to slip away. I say this to say…no matter what life throws at you, you can come out of it stronger. Tough times don’t last, tough people do. Miss you Momma. This game….my life…is for you ❤️🕊 “Two years later, I walked into AT&T Center with the greatest guardian angel that I could ever ask for and dropped 60 against the winningest coach of all time. I say this to say…no matter what life throws at you, you can come out of it stronger. Tough times don’t last, tough people do. Miss you Momma. This game….my life…is for you.” Towns had to grieve the loss of his mother with the world watching. And, to make matters worse, he was simultaneously dealing with an unstable and disappointing workplace culture in Minnesota, where the Timberwolves have been going through strife of their own since drafting Towns No 1 overall in 2015 — and long before that, too. In fact, with a new head coach and general manager in the last 13 months, Towns is now up to five head coaches and six heads of basketball operations in his six-and-a-half seasons in Minnesota. Throughout all the off-court turmoil, Towns has struggled to carry the heavy burden placed upon him on the court. He has consistently put up big numbers but Minnesota won only 39% of their games and reached just one playoff series in his first six seasons there. Fortunately for Towns, that 60-point performance wasn’t just an anomaly, and the Timberwolves appear to be turning a corner. They currently sit seventh in the Western Conference in what will go down as just the franchise’s second winning season in the past 17 years. They score the most points per game of any team in the league, and are guaranteed at least a play-in berth. The Wolves are full of young, athletic players such as guards D’Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards, and they play a fun and exciting brand of basketball led by new head coach Chris Finch. But a lot of their improvement this season – and I mean a lot – is because of Towns. He’s averaging 24.6 points, 9.8 rebounds and 3.6 assists, along with 1.1 blocks and 1.0 steals per game. He was also named an All-Star for the first time since 2019 and won the league’s three-point contest in Cleveland too. “It certainly says a lot about the character of him,” Finch tells the Guardian about Towns’ bounceback season. “I think he had two years where his basketball ascension was hijacked through a lot of reasons. So, he’s been able to put that aside. He’s still super young, not even into his prime. And he’s come into this season with the mindset to get back to where he was a few years before that.” His teammates agree when they talk about the 26-year-old. “KAT is special, man. There are not too many people that can do what he does on the floor. He’s one of a kind. He’s different. There’s not too much I don’t expect from KAT,” Edwards said. “He’s more than capable. So, it’s no surprise. He’s as good as he wants to be and when he’s playing at that level, we’re as good as we want to be as a team.” So, what exactly makes Towns so special? First of all, availability is the best ability, and after missing a combined 55 games over the previous two seasons due to injuries and Covid-related absences, Towns has appeared in all but seven games in 2021-22, becoming the reliable force that the Wolves need him to be. Secondly, Towns has improved his defensive effort and positioning to the point where he is quarterbacking the 11th best defense in the league this season, up from 28th last season. Towns has always had the size to protect the rim and the fluidity to cover a lot of ground, but with so much strife in Minnesota, he didn’t always play with the vigor and effort that he displays now. Plus, Finch has implemented a new, hyper-aggressive scheme that takes advantage of Towns’ footspeed and length, helping generate more turnovers than any team except the Toronto Raptors and the most points scored off of turnovers in the league. “We’ve got a great coaching staff, a great coach, and guys who are willing to put winning first,” Towns says about the Wolves buy-in. “I think we’ve done that all year: I think we’ve played with a great determination this year, a great mindset.” But where Towns is really special, and has been his entire career, is on offense. He’s a seven-footer who moves at the speed of a guard and keeps the ball on a string, allowing him to dribble and contort his body into any space he desires. There are sequences in a game where Towns hits a step-back three on one play, attacks a closeout for a dunk on the next, posts up for a mid-range fadeaway on the next and then euro-steps through multiple defenders to get the and-one at the rim. Finch calls KAT “Cheat Code” and says he is the “most skilled player that I think I’ve ever worked with,” despite that list including talents like James Harden, Nicola Jokic, and Anthony Davis. And Finch shows confidence in Towns by giving him the freedom to take what the defense gives him. Towns is arguably the best shooting big man of all time, with a career true-shooting percentage of 62.4 that is higher than reigning MVP Jokic and a smidge below Steph Curry. He is currently shooting an outrageous 40.8% on 4.9 three-point attempts per game, taking defensive attention away from his teammates as he sees double and triple-teams that allow his teammates to play in more space. It’s no wonder the Wolves go from scoring like the NBA’s best offense with Towns on the floor to a bottom-five offense without him. Towns and the Timberwolves have surpassed most peoples’ expectations this season. And regardless of what accolades come his way, or how deep the Wolves go into the playoffs, the most important thing is that Towns – who has gone through so much in the past two years – is back to being himself. “Fun. Enjoyment. I’m just enjoying the game right now,” Towns says when asked about the biggest difference between this season and in years past. “I appreciate it more than ever.”",Sport/Sport,Karl-Anthony Towns lost seven family members to Covid.

4/6/2022,"“It’s the second month since Russia used all possible ammunition to shell the Luhansk region. Now they are gathering equipment, mobilising conscripts … The battle here [will] be the fiercest,” the governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Gaidai, told me when we met recently in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s intentions are clear: the Kremlin calls its war against Ukraine the “special operation to free Donbas”. It wants some real gains to present at home before the anniversary of Russia’s victory in the second world war, on 9 May. After Russian troops failed to beat the Ukrainian military and occupy Kyiv and major towns like Kharkiv, Moscow is concentrating on taking the parts of the Donbas that remain in Ukrainian hands. Up to 2.5 million people live in the unoccupied Donbas, Moscow claims. The territory had already suffered drastically since the start of this war, particularly in the south. “Ninety per cent of Mariupol cannot be rebuilt. Up to 5,000 civilians might [have been] killed during the siege that started on 1 March. There are still up to 120,000 remaining there. Another town of Volnovakha, north of Mariupol, is basically swept away,” said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region. Kyrlenko is 35 years old and was born in Donetsk. He’s a former prosecutor, and is now on the death list in the occupied territory. He has ceased any contact with family members in the Donbas, and has not returned home for eight years. In the Luhansk region, the Ukrainian military now controls just three major industrial towns. The most populous, the administrative capital Severodonetsk, continues to be heavily bombed. I spent a few hours there recently, and could hear the constant sound of explosions. Few people had proper mobile connections or electricity. Roman Vodianyk, the chief doctor of the biggest and now only hospital in Severodonetsk, is able to speak on the phone thanks to a satellite internet connection that has been provided to key facilities. Vodianyk’s office is full of medicine, but he needs surgeons and more insulin. In a town where 100,000 people lived, up to 30,000 remain. I met Vodianyk recently, and walked through a modern facility many regional hospitals would envy. Yet the oxygen cylinders brought two months ago were hit by the shells, and one of the departments was seriously damaged. Vodianyk revealed that his own home had been demolished. Patients lay in hospital beds in the corridors, but not because the hospital was full. People were afraid to be near the windows. I met a woman called Lyuba, who survived the attacks a few hours before my visit. Rescue workers had taken her from the debris of her house. Yana, 45, an English teacher, wasn’t so lucky. She had been hiding in the basement with her 18-year-old son, Nikita (who has autism), since the winter. Yana decided to go home and collect some lighter clothes for spring. A shell hit her and Nikita on the street. He lost his hand, and his mother died. When I met Nikita in the hospital, his other hand didn’t leave that of his grandmother Larysa. Governor Kyrylenko has urged locals to leave the Donetsk region. He is uneasily preparing the region for a colossal assault. His aim is not to show heroism, but preserve lives. His colleague from Luhansk regrets that many people only realised they had to evacuate once their neighbour’s homes had been destroyed. The Ukrainian authorities are cautious about publicising places where people have evacuated to, afraid that mass gatherings could be attacked. Kyrylenko told me about the lessons learned over the past months, and what the Donbas was doing to prepare for new assaults. As supermarkets and warehouses have been targeted, more food will be delivered and stored in different facilities. Evacuation convoys will be split into smaller groups, after the first convoy of 50 evacuation buses sent to Mariupol was bombed (20 vehicles were demolished). In my native city, Kyiv, I have been distracted by graphic images from Bucha and Irpin. These are middle-class, suburban areas on the outskirts of the city. Many of my colleagues and friends live there. I’ve look at photos of a mass grave and read testimonies of rape and torture. I’ve gazed at a photo an elderly man who was shot on his bicycle, and listened to a description of mutilated bodies in a local morgue. I’ve reported on the war in eastern Ukraine for eight years, focusing on civilian casualties and human rights violations. But we have never seen anything compared with this. After the Bucha massacre, it feels like we have to change the way we treat this war. Before, we tried to figure out Russia’s military strategy, to be better prepared. But a case of rape in a village near Kharkiv, the mines in a botanic garden in Trostyanets, and shooting men with tied hands in peaceful suburbs of Kyiv – these actions do not make any sense, aside from a desire to punish Ukrainians. Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, used to be a professional crisis manager. When I asked him about Severodonetsk, where he was born, he cried. “I feel pain because these bastards are shelling everything: hospitals, kindergartens. We have recently reconstructed a swimming pool. My mother taught me to swim there. Was that swimming pool guilty of anything?” He wipes his tears. “I cannot look at my mobile without [seeing] requests for help. It’s the concentration of pain.” On 24 February both Gadai and Kyrelynko told me they received calls from Russia urging them to take the other side. “It was before the phrase ‘Russian warship go fuck yourself’. I didn’t know such an eloquent way to answer, so I blocked the number,” Kyrylenko recalls. Later, both received death threats. Numerous mayors and civic servants in the Ukrainian Donbas and their families have also received threats. The concern is that the west, and those who want to broker any deal with Russia, will be tempted to let Vladimir Putin take the Donbas. This could be an exit strategy that would allow him to save face. After the horrors in Bucha, I am terrified for what could happen to the people in the Donbas who have demonstrated loyalty to the Ukrainian state for the past eight years. It’s not just bureaucrats and the military: locals worked for Ukrainian businesses and taught in Ukrainian schools. Before leaving the Donbas, I rushed to see my friend, who I had first met eight years ago during a reporting trip. He has developed a successful greengrocer business. He sent his wife and daughter to western Ukraine but remains in the territory to care for his business. I gave him a hug, and insisted that he needed to finish what he was doing and leave. After Bucha, there is no other choice for Ukraine but to fight for the Donbas. The battle may be brutal and long.

4/6/2022,"At a vast refugee centre in northern Warsaw, a table holds a generous mix of free goods: baby food, clothing, coffee and sim cards. A pyramid of dog food cans sits in the middle. At the front desk, volunteers field questions. Yes, public transport is free; yes, everyone qualifies for a 300zl (£55) stipend; yes, you can register for a social security number at the national stadium. On the walls, QR codes provide information about onward travel to western Europe. The Poles, it seems, have thought of everything. In six weeks, they have mounted an extraordinary response to a refugee crisis that has seen 2.5 million Ukrainians (along with thousands of pets) arrive in the country. Around one in 10 people in Poland is now Ukrainian. “Maybe it’s a miracle,” says Jarosław Obremski, governor of Lower Silesia, one of Poland’s larger regions, which has taken in at least 250,000 Ukrainians. “In 2015, Germany took one million refugees in one year, and it was a big success,” he tells the Guardian. “We had to receive two million in a few weeks. It is a big difference.” An entire nation mobilised, from the railway workers who organised a mass dispersal of newcomers throughout Poland to the tens of thousands of volunteers who dropped everything to help out at the border, train stations and refugee centres. There is free food everywhere in the cities, from burger vans at the national stadium to food tents outside stations. Schools have welcomed new pupils, and hundreds of thousands of hosts opened their homes. Newcomers can stay for at least 18 months and everyone has the right to work. Criticism remains of Poland’s refusal to allow non-Ukrainians refugees to enter the country. But few would deny that the efforts of the past few weeks have been remarkable. “On a scale of 1-10, I would say it’s 10-plus,” says Olena Bahriantseva, a child psychologist from Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine. “They have taken us in like their own family. I sit at home and cry for my friends and relatives but the Polish welcome still makes me smile.” But now, the weeks are turning into months. The cities are heaving, and the all-important volunteers starting to drift away, returning to work or college. As resources stretch ever thinner, with no end to the war in sight and more than 20,000 still crossing into Poland every day, a big question hangs in the thin east-European air: how long will the Polish welcome last? There are a number of reasons why this crisis is turning into arguably Poland’s greatest triumph since the end of communist rule in 1989. Firstly, there was a dress rehearsal: the 2014 war sent a first wave of more than a million Ukrainians west. “There was no problem because they worked, rented apartments, paid taxes,” says Obremski. “There was great respect for them because they worked hard.” So when the Russians invaded Ukraine, officials already knew several things: there would be a lot of people; they would integrate well if helped; and most importantly, they would have to be dispersed throughout the country to avoid the burden of vast border encampments. There are far more Ukrainians now in Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław than in border towns such as Przemyśl and Lublin. The second vital strategy was to find homes for everyone. Ukrainians have been guaranteed a roof over their heads for at least two months. Crucially, the vast majority were taken into private apartments, either sharing with other Ukrainians or with a host family. The third factor was the response from the public. Drivers turn up at border crossing points to take people where they want to go. Refugee centres are staffed by office workers taking a week’s holiday. Hundreds of schools have offered places to Ukrainian children, some even putting on lessons in Ukrainian to help the youngsters settle in. At Warsaw central station a volunteer group has grown to 350 people, including students, marketing professionals, IT experts and even a psychologist. “I’m between jobs, and my plan was to go to Mexico, but when I was about to leave, the war started,” says IT manager, Jakub Niemiec, who is in charge of the housing and transport desk at the station. “I decided to cancel my tickets and stay here to help out.” Yet volunteers have noticed a shift. Private accommodation offers are starting to dry up, so more people must be directed to huge refugee centres, where it is hard to feel settled. Major cities are very full – the populations of Warsaw and Wrocław have grown by about 15%. New arrivals are being urged to seek refuge in smaller provincial towns to ease the pressure. “We are not able to take in many more people,” says Doris Maklewska, a coordinator for the Grupa Centrum volunteers at Warsaw central station. “Warsaw is overcrowded. When people took in Ukrainians, they didn’t know how long it would be for.” Indeed, there is great uncertainty over how long Ukrainians will be able to stay with Polish hosts, and when they may have to fend for themselves. Irina Tsymbal, who left her husband in eastern Ukraine and arrived in Warsaw at the start of March, found a family willing to host her and her boys. But soon she will need somewhere of her own. “They gave up so much for us and said we could stay, definitely for one month, and probably up to two months,” she says. “But after that, I don’t know.” The refugee response will require Poland to spend perhaps 3% of GDP this year, according to Liam Peach, a regional expert with research consultancy Capital Economics. And questions are mounting as to who will foot the refugee bill. Education is another big challenge. “We have about a million new children in Poland,” Obremski says. “It means I need, immediately, 80 new kindergartens and nurseries. And we must create a parallel Ukrainian curriculum because children without the Polish language will have no chance in the Polish system.” It is the same with healthcare: patient numbers could increase by 10% or more this year, particularly given the psychological problems that many haunted Ukrainians are bringing with them. The Polish health system will be sorely tested. Beyond cash, housing and infrastructure, there is a more subtle issue. Will Poles succumb to a psychological fatigue if the war drags on, if housing issues flare, if schools and hospitals become crowded? If millions more come? “I don’t believe we can take another two million,” says Obremski. “Even one million would be difficult.” Yet more than 20,000 have arrived every day over the past week. At this rate, the 3 million mark will be hit within another month. “It’s clear that we will get tired – not of the refugees but of the situation,” says Niemiec. “But this is a moment for us to verify if the western values that we believe, are only values on paper – or are real.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Poland has worked a refugee miracle.

4/6/2022,"The increase in national insurance payments for millions of people already struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis is both right and fair, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the levy of an extra 1.25 percentage points, due from Wednesday, was needed to pay for health and social care as a result of the Covid pandemic. The government has pressed ahead with its plans to increase national insurance contributions for workers and companies, despite calls from business groups, unions and some Conservative MPs to at least delay the introduction. A planned change to free some of the country’s lowest earners from national insurance contributions altogether is not due to be implemented until the summer. Defending the increase, Javid told Sky News the impact of the pandemic had been unprecedented. “When we spend money on public services, whether it’s NHS or anything else, for that matter, the money can only come from two sources. You raise it directly for people today, that’s through taxes, or you borrow it, which essentially you are asking the next generation to pay for it,” he said. “I think it is right that we pay for what we are going to use as a country but we do it in a fair way. This levy, the way it is being raised is the top 15% of earners will pay almost 50%. I think that is the right way to do this.” Critics have accused the government of placing a disproportionate burden on lower earners by choosing to levy a regressive tax. “It is the wrong tax at the wrong time and people are really, really struggling to pay their bills. And this is just going to impact on them very, very hard,” said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. Starmer told BBC Radio 5 Live the government had chosen to place the burden on people in employment, while protecting those who made income from renting out property and share dividends. “There are lots of landlords who’ve got many, many properties and they are not going to be paying a penny more in tax. Their tenants, who are going out to work, are going to be paying more in tax.” Instead, Starmer said the “general approach should be that income of all its forms should be taxed fairly” and promised to set out Labour’s plan to follow that before the next general election, due to take place in about two years. Ministers have also increased the tax due on share dividends by the same proportion, though this is predicted to hit small businesses and sole traders hardest, without substantially affecting large-scale traders in shares.",News/Politics,"National insurance increase is right and fair, says Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/06/national-insurance-increase-is-right-and-fair-says-sajid-javid
4/6/2022,"Bobby Rydell, who enjoyed numerous US hits during the teen pop craze of the early 1960s, has died aged 79. He suffered complications from pneumonia, and died in hospital in his native Philadelphia. With songs of decorous romance sung in his clean, hearty voice, Rydell reached the US Top 10 five times – with We Got Love, Swingin’ School, his version of the standard Volare, Wild One (also a UK Top 10 hit) and Forget Him. The latter is believed to be the inspiration for the Beatles’ She Loves You after Paul McCartney said the song was inspired by an unnamed Rydell number. Rydell had 29 other hits spanning raucous rock’n’roll to swooning, string-backed balladry, including numerous other pop standards such as That Old Black Magic, Sway and Jingle Bell Rock, as well as songs hymning his region, such as Wildwood Days, an ode to the seaside town in New Jersey, which stayed in the US charts for nine weeks. Born Robert Ridarelli in 1942, Rydell’s first break came aged nine on the talent show Paul Whiteman’s TV Teen Club. He was an adept drummer as well as a singer, and his path crossed with that of another future teen heart-throb from Philadelphia, Frankie Avalon, in the group Rocco and the Saints, before Rydell became a solo singer. Rydell toured Europe and Australia, and played New York’s renowned Copacabana nightclub. He made a brief jump to acting with a supporting role alongside Janet Leigh, Dick Van Dyke and Ann-Margret in the 1963 romantic comedy Bye Bye Birdie, but didn’t want to move to California to focus on a film career. Like many of his teen-idol brethren, Rydell’s pop-cultural heft swiftly waned in the wake of Beatlemania and the British Invasion, but his career was sustained with music and acting appearances on numerous variety shows, most notably The Red Skelton Show. And buoyed by an enduring, increasingly nostalgic fanbase, he continued to tour for the rest of his life, such as in a trio with Frankie Avalon and Fabian as the Golden Boys of Bandstand. He also hopped on the late 70s disco craze, re-recording Sway in the style. Among those paying tribute to Rydell was the writer Stephen King, who said he was among “the most talented of the 50s and early 60s teen idols”.",Arts/Music,"Bobby Rydell, US pop idol of the early 1960s, dies aged 79",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/06/bobby-rydell-us-pop-idol-of-the-early-1960s-dies-aged-79
4/6/2022,"Parliament should have the power to define “aliens”, including to allow the deportation of Aboriginal non-citizens or even dual nationals, the Australian government has argued. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, made the submission on behalf of the commonwealth in a high court appeal seeking to overturn an earlier ruling that Aboriginal people cannot be deported, even if they lack Australian citizenship. At a hearing on Wednesday, the commonwealth urged the court to junk the landmark decision of Love and Thoms handed down in February 2020 or, if it is accepted, to rule that people without Aboriginal biological ancestors are not exempt from deportation. In November, the federal court ordered the release of Shayne Montgomery, a New Zealand citizen who has argued that because he is culturally adopted as Aboriginal he cannot be an alien for the purposes of the constitution. The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has appealed to the high court and in doing so sought to reopen Love and Thoms on the basis it was wrongly decided. The case is an important test not just of whether Aboriginal people can be aliens, but the circumstances in which the court will revisit one of its own decisions. On Wednesday Donaghue argued that the parliament should have the power to define “aliens”, unless it seeks to exclude people who “could not possibly answer that description”, such as people born in Australia. Justice James Edelman asked if this meant that parliament could define a person born overseas with dual citizenship due to an Australian parent or grandparent who had “lived in Australia as a citizen for 60 years, served in the military, voted, and fulfilled every civic duty” as an alien. Donaghue said this was an “extreme example” that was politically “unlikely” but, yes, parliament would have that power – subject to one qualification, that it may not be fair to be ejected from the Australian polity if it was not possible to renounce foreign citizenship. Justices Edelman and Michelle Gordon appeared to take issue with parliament being allowed to define who is an “alien”. But justice Patrick Keane suggested it was “preferable to leaving who is a member of the Australian community to a court”, to which Donaghue added “or the elders of a traditional” society – picking up one of the main objections of the minority in Love and Thoms. Craig Lenehan, also representing the commonwealth, argued “there is no universal one-size-fits-all test of Aboriginality”, but a test for the purposes of immigration law should include biological descent because it provided an “unambiguous” limit. He warned if cultural adoption were accepted then Aboriginal societies could be the “exclusive determinant” of who is an alien. Earlier, Gordon and Edelman grilled Donaghue about the attempt to revisit Love and Thoms through his claim there was no clear common reasoning between the majority judges. Edelman suggested Donaghue was isolating “slight differences” between the judgments, adding that identifying common reasoning “since first year law school” has always been about finding the level on which the judges agree. Edelman also warned against a “fairytale” view of the law about retrospectivity of changes, noting that “as a matter of fact” Montgomery and other non-citizens released due to Love and Thoms will lose their liberty. Former solicitor general Justin Gleeson began the case for Montgomery on Wednesday afternoon. He warned against any ruling about whether cultural adoption was sufficient for Aboriginality, citing the fact Montgomery had not been allowed to lead all of his evidence about his Aboriginality in the federal court. Montgomery also noted that if Hawke decided to give Montgomery a visa, after the federal court ordered he remake his decision according to law, the entire proceeding would be “moot”. On Thursday the Victorian government, Australian Human Rights Commission, National Native Title Council, and Northern Land Council will be heard – all of which have intervened on Montgomery’s side. Since the February 2020 Love and Thoms decision, two justices in the majority retired and were replaced by Jacqueline Gleeson and Simon Steward.",News/Australia news,Government seeks legal power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/government-seeks-legal-power-to-deport-aboriginal-dual-nationals
