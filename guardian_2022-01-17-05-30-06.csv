1/17/2022,"Boris Johnson has been accused of targeting the BBC in a desperate attempt to save his own premiership, as the Labour leader accused him of breaking the law by attending lockdown parties and then lying about it. A number of Tory MPs are said to be poised to demand Johnson’s resignation amid anger from constituents over allegations of a party culture in Westminster while coronavirus restrictions were in place.  There have been reports that up to 35 of the 54 letters needed to trigger a vote of no confidence are already in, though the actual number is a closely guarded secret. As Downing Street hoped to find ways to contain the crisis, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, one of Johnson’s most loyal allies, confirmed on Sunday the BBC licence fee will be abolished in 2027 – and the broadcaster’s funding will be frozen for the next two years. Though the move will force the corporation to close services and potentially make thousands of redundancies, it is likely to prove popular with Conservative party members and supporters, as well as the rightwing media who have yet to call for Johnson to quit. “The prime minister thinks those reporting on his rule breaking should pay consequences, whilst he gets off free,” said Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary. Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, described the announcement as “a last ditch attempt [by Johnson] to save his failing premiership”. The BBC funding cut, which could fundamentally change the corporation as it enters its centenary year, appears to be a central theme of Johnson’s fightback strategy, which is reportedly called Operation Red Meat. Other measures said to be in the pipeline include a renewed drive to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats, measures to tackle the NHS operations backlog, extra investment in skills and lifting Covid restrictions on 26 January. . Although the BBC had been braced for bad news for some time – Johnson declared that he would consider abolishing the licence fee in the 2019 election campaign (on a day when a hospital scandal was dominating the headlines) – one government insider said the announcement had not been expected this weekend. Some Tory MPs have been particularly critical of the way the BBC has covered Johnson’s latest leadership crisis, with the backbencher Michael Fabricant even claiming at the weekend that relentless coverage of anti-Johnson comments in news reports amounted to “a coup attempt against the prime minister”. No 10 insiders insisted on Sunday that these reports were not a factor in the licence fee decision, which they said was the culmination of a process going on for more than a year, but the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, claimed there was a link “Slashing the funding of a beloved national treasure just because you don’t like the headlines on the 6 o’clock news is no way for a responsible government in a democracy to behave,” he said. With Downing Street still reeling from revelations that its staff had partied the evening before the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral, it was forcedto deny a claim that the prime minister failed to intervene to cancel a 20 May party last year when he had the chance. No 10 said the claim made by Dominic Lawson in his Sunday Times column was “untrue”. But one former Downing Street staffer told the Guardian they knew at least one colleague who had warned Johnson personally that the “bring your own booze” gathering, organised by Johnson’s aide, Martin Reynolds, should not go ahead. Asked whether the PM knew about the party before it took place, the former insider replied: “Yes.” Reynolds is one of several No 10 figures expected to leave after the senior civil servant Sue Gray publishes her reporton the scandal. On Sunday Oliver Dowden, the Conservative party chair, said Johnson was committed to implementing a “change of culture” in Downing Street to stop these problems occurring again. With many Tory MPs waiting until the Gray report comes out , the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there was no need to wait because it was already “obvious” that Johnson “broke the law … [and] then lied about what happened”. Starmer was referring to Johnson’s statement to MPs last week in which he all but admitted that the party he attended at No 10 on 20 May 2020 was against the rules. Starmer said the PM’s admission that he was at the event showed he was not telling the truth when he told MPs before Christmas there had been no parties at No 10. Six Conservative MPs had publicly called for Johnson’s resignation by late Sunday and one backbencher said that he knew there were “a lot of letters written but not necessarily sent yet” to the chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee demanding a confidence vote. The MP said the mood in his “red wall” constituency had gone from “anger to ridicule” and that Johnson had become the butt of jokes among some who voted for him in December 2019. The backbencher said “the term shitshow was used a lot last week [by Tory MPs]” and that they were waiting for the forthcoming report into the partygate scandal before deciding what to do next. James Johnson, a Tory pollster, delivered a similar insight into popular revulsion with the PM on Sunday when he tweeted the findings from focus groups carried out with long-term Conservative voters, and people who backed the party for the first time in 2019, and he reported that calls for the PM to quit were “almost universal”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson accused of targeting BBC to save his premiership,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/boris-johnson-accused-of-targeting-bbc-to-save-his-premiership
1/17/2022,"Prada called on Hollywood heavyweights Jeff Goldblum and Kyle MacLachlan to bookend its catwalk on Sunday afternoon, bringing a close to a quiet menswear fashion week that saw multiple brands cancel their shows in light of increasing Covid cases across Europe. The appearance of the actors at the Fondazione Prada punctuated the second physical catwalk show from founder Miuccia Prada and her co-creative director Raf Simons since the latter came onboard in early 2020, marking an unprecedented union of two of the fashion industry’s most influential and famed designers.  The fruits of their collective output have so far proved to be critically acclaimed and this autumn/winter 2022 collection had the hallmarks of the same. Taking the concept of uniform as their stimuli, Prada and Simons elevated boiler suits in silk tech, leather and cotton, and blurred rose-print – replacing “the traditional historical shirt/tie/bow tie and giv[ing] a new energy and reality, a younger attitude also,” said Simons. Outerwear loomed large in trench coats and utilitarian parkas with shearling panels. Elsewhere, the accessories that will get the social media universe buzzing arrived in compartmentalised backpacks, fluorescent gloves and miniature pocket belts in the signature Prada triangle. “The collection celebrates the idea of working – in all different spheres and meanings,” said Prada, emphasising the idea of the importance of formal work and the wardrobe she imagines represents it. “Through these clothes, we emphasise that everything a human being does is important. Every aspect of reality can be elegant and dignified … elevated, and celebrated.” Joining Goldblum and MacLachlan to present the collection to a socially distanced audience of 200-plus guests was a new generation of actors: the Queen’s Gambit star Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Sex Education lead Asa Butterfield and the award-winning Moonlight actor Ashton Sanders. “Actors are interpreters of reality, employed to echo truth through their portrayals,” said Prada. “Real men, recognised figures, they bring a new facet of reality.” The reality of the Italian fashion week was something different from what had been scheduled. Giorgio Armani, one of the showcase’s biggest draws, was the most high-profile designer to cancel his eponymous and Emporio Armani shows – “with great regret and following careful reflection in light of the worsening epidemiological situation” – in early January. Carlo Capasa, president of the governing body of Italian fashion, the Camera della Moda (CNMI), said that while he respected Armani’s personal decision, it was important to find ways to push on with live events that facilitate face-to-face interaction and drive revenue into the Italian fashion industry. “Given the situation we’re doing the best we can do in this moment and we have proven we can manage the situation,” said Capasa, referring to the strict distancing, FFP2 masks, and proof of full vaccination that were required at all 16 physical shows on the schedule. “Generally speaking, fashion week needs to go on [to give] the sign that the industry needs. It’s very important [as] it’s the second biggest industry [in this country] and we have 1.2 million people working in fashion in Italy. We don’t know how long it’s going to take to be out of the current situation [with the pandemic] and so it’s about trying to find a balance between real life and security.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Prada’s Milan fashion week show ends with Jeff Goldblum on the catwalk,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/16/pradas-milan-fashion-week-show-ends-with-jeff-goldblum-on-the-catwalk
1/17/2022,"Good morning. Novak Djokovic has left Australia after his last-ditch court challenge failed. And the England Test side has once again failed to turn up with much fight, handing Australia a 4-0 Ashes series win. Novak Djokovic has been deported from Australia after the full federal court dismissed his bid to restore his visa. The Serbian tennis player was seen boarding a flight from Melbourne to Dubai hours after the court rejected his challenge to the decision of Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to cancel the visa. In a statement Djokovic said he was “extremely disappointed” with the ruling. “I respect the court’s ruling and I will cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country,” he said. Serbia’s leaders have hit out at Djokovic’s treatment. The prime minister, Ana Brnabić, criticised the decision to cancel the visa as “scandalous”. “I find it unbelievable that we have two completely contradictory court decisions within the span of just a few days,” she said. The tennis world reacted with a mixture of silence and disappointment to Djokovic’s deportation and frustration that it had overshadowed the Australian Open.  About 100 doctors have been locked out of Western Australia after being refused G2G passes despite state borders opening, and the likely influx of Covid, just weeks away. Shut-out doctors are warning the health system needs adequate time to prepare for the influx of Covid, and the state government should urgently grant all doctors a G2G pass. Mark Duncan-Smith, the WA president of the Australian Medical Association, said the process was complex. “They’re not being excluded, the problem is not in the approvals, these excluded people are having problems navigating the system. Should the system be simpler? Yes.” Australia has secured a 4-0 Ashes series victory over England. The English team collapsed on the third day of the fifth test, going from 68-0 to 124 all out to hand Australia a 124-run victory. Despite the latest flogging and ongoing questions about the team’s leadership, England captain Joe Root has declared himself ready to lead England’s Test team into a new era. “At the minute we’re going through a real tough period. Performances haven’t been good. But I believe I’m the right man to take this team forward,” said Root, who has now won 27 of 61 matches as captain over four and a half years. Vulnerable welfare recipients have been told they’ll have their benefits cut if they don’t attend face-to-face job agency appointments, despite an unprecedented surge of Covid cases. Australia’s free-to-air TV channels have called on the government to introduce legislation guaranteeing them prominence on smart TV home screens. The networks say they are becoming “increasingly hard to find” among global streaming rivals. Western Australia’s offshore gasfields are paying almost no royalties, create few jobs and are a large and rising source of greenhouse gases, according to a new report from the Australia Institute.

The former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly close to reaching a plea bargain in his corruption trial. In the reported agreement, Netanyahu will admit to two counts of breach of trust, resulting in a suspended prison sentence and a few months of prison time that will be converted to community service. Some may presume that catharsis can be found in memoir writing, but for Joe Simpson, putting Touching the Void down on paper was “horrible”. He retreated to a friend’s attic to write the book over seven weeks, purely because the facts of his stricken ascent up Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes as a 25-year-old had been greatly misrepresented through rumours in the climbing world. Now, decades on, he’s flummoxed to see his story as a play, making its Australian premiere in Melbourne this week.

1/17/2022,"US president Joe Biden has condemned a tense 11-hour hostage standoff at a synagogue in Texas on Saturday as “an act of terror”, as the FBI named the armed assailant as Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British national. Akram was pronounced dead after the FBI stormed the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville on Saturday evening. All four hostages survived the siege and were unharmed, according to local police.  UK security sources confirmed to the Guardian that the suspect had been a resident of Blackburn in Lancashire. The standoff began during a Saturday morning service at the Reform synagogue in the affluent city of around 26,000 residents. The service was being live streamed on Facebook when a man with a British accent could be heard shouting off camera. The feed was eventually cut hours later and police were called at around 10.41am. One male hostage, believed to be the synagogue’s rabbi, was released at around 5pm as negotiations continued throughout the day. Armed FBI officers stormed the building and rescued the three remaining hostages at around 9pm, authorities said. Details of the manner of Akram’s death have not been released. Counter terrorism police in London confirmed they were liaising with their US counterparts on Sunday as the FBI confirmed an active investigation but added they believed Akram had acted alone. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, president Biden described the incident as “an act of terror” and confirmed he had been briefed by the US attorney general, Merrick Garland. Asked by reporters how Akram could have procured weapons in the US, Biden said he did not have all the facts of the case but “the assertion was he got the weapons on the street. He purchased them when he landed.” It was not immediately clear how long Akram had been in the US before carrying out the attack. The US Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to questions about when Akram entered the country, and on what visa. The president said he had contacted the synagogue’s rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, who posted an account of the incident to Facebook on Sunday. “I am grateful that we made it out,” Cytron-Walker wrote. “I am grateful to be alive.” In a statement issued earlier, Biden, praised the “courageous work” of law enforcement officials who responded to the scene and sent “love and strength” to the synagogue’s worshippers and to members of the Jewish community. FBI special agent in charge, Matt DeSarno, said the hostage taker was specifically focused on an issue not directly connected to the Jewish community, and there was no immediate indication that the man was part of any broader plan. But DeSarno said the agency’s investigation “will have global reach”. During the live stream, Akram could be heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida, who was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan. Siddiqui is in federal prison in Texas serving an 86-year sentence. The hostage-taker referred to Siddiqui as his “sister” on the livestream, but John Floyd, board chair for the Houston chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations – the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group – confirmed Siddiqui’s brother, Mohammad Siddiqui, was not involved. On Sunday the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, condemned the incident in a statement posted on Twitter. “My thoughts are with the Jewish community and all those affected by the appalling act in Texas. We condemn this act of terrorism and antisemitism,” Truss said. She added: “We stand with US in defending the rights and freedoms of our citizens against those who spread hate.” Shortly after Akram was named as the hostage taker, a post on the Blackburn Muslim Community Facebook page was uploaded, purportedly written by his brother Gulbar. The post stated that Akram “was suffering from mental health issues” but the family were “confident that he would not harm the hostages”. It stated that family members had been sat in an incident room all night liaising with Akram, the FBI and hostage negotiators. The post claimed that Akram released all the remaining three hostages before “a firefight has taken place and he was shot and killed”. “There was nothing we could have said to him or done that would have convinced him to surrender,” the post states. It adds: “We would also like to add that any attack on any human being be it a Jew, Christian or Muslim etc is wrong and should always be condemned.” The Guardian has not confirmed the veracity of the post, but a written statement with the same words was reported by Sky News.",News/US news,‘An act of terror’: Biden condemns Texas synagogue siege while FBI names Briton as hostage-taker ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/16/texas-synagogue-siege-biden-condemns-act-of-terror-fbi-names-briton-hostage-taker
1/17/2022,"When Courtney Lawes left the field with a grimace in the 64th minute, Franklin’s Gardens held its breath. It was the England forward’s 250th appearance for Northampton and Eddie Jones, among the crowd as he prepares to name his 2022 Six Nations squad on Tuesday, looked concerned. Lawes, who impressed as a stand-in skipper in England’s autumn victory over South Africa, had been hoping to mark his special day in style. He was accompanied by his four children as he led the Saints team out to rapturous applause and pyrotechnics before kick-off.  The 32-year-old appeared in discomfort when he was replaced, yet afterwards Phil Dowson delivered a prognosis that came as a relief to Lawes’ club and country. “We thought we’d bring some fresh legs on so it was more precautionary than anything else,” Dowson, Northampton’s forwards coach, said. “He was exhausted, and we had lots of forwards on the bench to bring on. Courtney is experienced enough, old enough and 250 games ugly enough to tell us when he’s done. He’s OK.” Lawes appeared to have taken a heavy knock around 10 minutes before he was forced off, but again Dowson played down the seriousness of the complaint. He added: “He was winded and that’s one of the worst injuries you can get for a short period. I’ve spoken to the medic and there’s nothing glaring. When he says he’s done, he’s very honest.” Exhaustion aside, this was no way for a man who has given so much to the Northampton cause during the past 15 years to mark his milestone appearance. Credit to Ulster, of course. This deserved bonus-point victory marked a third straight win in this season’s Champions Cup and secured their progress to the last-16 of the competition. Mike Lowry, the full-back, took centre stage with a brilliant two-try display and the wingers Robert Baloucoune and Ethan McIlroy were not far behind him in a youthful backline. The Ulster coach Dan McFarland said of his dashing back three: “It’s a time in their career where they feel they are invincible. They are able to produce some magic moments.” Indeed, the visitors took their chances with deadly aplomb and capitalised on Northampton’s error-strewn performance which the director of rugby, Chris Boyd, watched from the behind the posts as he served the first game of his two-match ban. After he watched his side beaten 30-6 by Saracens in their Gallagher Premiership clash at Franklin’s Gardens on 2 January, Boyd hit out at the game’s referee Adam Leal. The New Zealander – who will leave his role at Saints at the end of the season – criticised Leal’s handling of the scrum. Boyd said Leal “didn’t have enough nuts” to penalise Saracens at the set piece and, while the 63-year-old is suspended from all matchday coaching duties, he can attend the games as a spectator. Ulster won 27-22 when the sides met last month and they led here when Baloucoune evaded the Northampton defence to dive over in the right corner. That sixth-minute opener was soon added to when Lowry collected a kick from Rory Hutchinson one-handed and found Baloucoune who sent the scrum-half Nathan Doak scurrying clear. Saints replied when Dan Biggar finished off a delightful move down the left flank after fine work from Tom Collins. The wing took a fine pass from Hutchinson and showed intelligence to usher the supporting Biggar over the line for a try which revived Northampton hopes. But on the stroke of half-time, Ulster struck again when a kick from the fly-half Billy Burns fell kindly for Lowry to score and the try was awarded by the TMO despite suspicions of an earlier knock-on. In the 55th minute, the Saints scrum-half Alex Mitchell was sin-binned for a deliberate offside after Lowry had threatened the home line with another explosive burst. Five minutes later, Lowry took centre stage again, finishing off in style after Baloucoune’s pass had sent Mcllroy through the leaden-footed home defence. Northampton claimed a late consolation through Hutchinson, but their hopes of qualification are all but over. Dowson added: “Courtney is a big part of this club and is one of England’s captains. We wanted to make it a special day for him and we failed on that front.”",Sport/Sport,Lawes injury mars Northampton’s narrow Champions Cup defeat by Ulster,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/courtney-lawes-injury-northampton-ulster-champions-cup-rugby-union
