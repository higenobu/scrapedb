12/29/2021,"After taking a drag on a cigarette thought to be laced with spice, Gyula Remes collapsed in the freezing underpass at Westminster tube station, three years ago last week, just across the road from the Houses of Parliament. The Hungarian national’s lips went blue, and he stopped breathing. He had come here for a better life but was soon being rushed a few hundred yards across Westminster Bridge to St Thomas’ hospital, where he died, aged 43. Remes was one of 726 people estimated to have died homeless in England and Wales in 2018, and his death could so easily have been prevented. A week before he died, Remes had applied to the Connection at St Martin-in-the-Fields, a highly regarded homeless night shelter that benefits from the Radio 4 Christmas appeal every year. The Connection said it was unable to let Remes access its night shelter because, in its words, he did not have a “realistic and sustainable route off the streets”. Kafka would have been hard pressed to come up with a more dystopian scenario. Ironically, it emerged later that Remes was doing part-time kitchen work and had just been offered full-time work.  His death (the second in 10 months in the same underpass) sparked outrage in parliament. The next day, the then secretary of state for housing, communities and local government James Brokenshire, who died in October this year, told parliament: “Every death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. Each is a tragedy, each a life cut short. We have a moral duty to act.” However well-intentioned Brokenshire’s words, the government reneged on this duty. In 2019, the number of deaths among homeless people in England and Wales rose for the fifth year in a row to a record high of 778. Meanwhile, the number of people who were entirely homeless or living in temporary accommodation and hostels in England soared to 280,000 in 2019 from a low of 40,000 in 2009 and 2010. While the government failed to tackle homelessness, many members of the public continued to do the same thing they had always done to address the issue – donate to charity. Over the Christmas appeals of 2017 and 2018, Radio 4 listeners raised more than £5m to support the Connection at St Martin-in-the-Fields. Then the pandemic came along and proved what many of us have always known: by and large, eradicating street homelessness can be done (though some people will inevitably return to the streets), and it’s the responsibility of government, rather than charities, to do this. Under the policy introduced at the beginning of the first lockdown called Everyone In, the government found £105m to get England’s homeless people off the streets and into emergency accommodation to keep them safe from Covid-19. The idea behind Everyone In was to provide rough sleepers with accommodation; hopefully support, tailored to individual needs, would follow. But there is already a name for a policy that combines immediate housing with the crucial “wrap-around support” that should follow it: Housing First. In Britain, Housing First is still regarded as a radical model to end homelessness, but it shouldn’t be. It’s common sense. You house people, then address their complex needs, rather than tell them that if they manage to address behaviours such as addiction, they will qualify for housing. Housing First was developed in New York in the early 1990s, and has virtually ended rough sleeping in some states – Utah, for example, has reduced chronic homelessness by 91%. Meanwhile, in Finland Housing First has been an unqualified success since being introduced in 2007. Rough sleeping has been all but eradicated in the capital, Helsinki, where there remains only one night shelter, of 50 beds. In Britain we cannot measure the effectiveness of Housing First because we have been neither brave nor humane enough to trial it on a national level. But we can look at how successful our impromptu version of it was, and the fact is, we managed to get most of Britain’s rough sleepers housed within days. According to one study, the scheme saved an estimated 266 people from death in the first lockdown. Boris Johnson had won a huge majority only three months earlier and was terrified of his popular support being eroded by the prospect of homeless people dying on the streets in large numbers. But the concern over street homelessness did not last long. By June 2020 only 16 of the 46,687 deaths registered as Covid-related in England and Wales were identified as people who were homeless. The government reverted to type, and the homelessness crisis once again became a low priority. In February 2021, according to Shelter, 77% of the 37,430 people helped under the Everyone In banner were not living in settled accommodation (somewhere they could stay for at least six months); and almost one in four were no longer being accommodated at all. As for wraparound support (the second, vital, part of Housing First), the project did not last long enough and was insufficiently resourced (understandable in those chaotic days). This was a real opportunity to transform homelessness and British society. Johnson had a chance to steal a huge head start on his promise to eradicate street homelessness by May 2024, and he blew it. But as he’s shown throughout his career, he’s never given a tuppenny toss for his own pledges. Promises are simply there to be broken. As London mayor in 2009, he promised to “end rough sleeping in the capital by 2012”. By the time he left office, the number of homeless people on the street had more than doubled, from 3,673 to 7,500. As early as January 2021, Citizens Advice was already reporting that half a million people had gone into rent arrears during the pandemic, while a study by the debt charity StepChange in September showed that 225,000 people feared losing their homes. The ending of the £20 uplift in universal credit, and rocketing energy prices, make it even more likely that people will be turfed out of their homes. In summer, the Big Issue launched a Stop Mass Homelessness campaign, and last month it estimated that if the government pays off the £360m rent arrears accrued over the pandemic it could save £2.6bn in the long term by preventing homelessness. Last Tuesday the government announced that Everyone In would be reintroduced for rough sleepers this winter, as well as funding of £310m for councils to prevent vulnerable people from becoming homeless. At first glance, it looks great. But the reality is, it’s little more than a repeat of emergency pandemic measures. The risk is that it becomes another temporary fix, which falls off the priority list as soon as winter passes. Everyone In has already proved how simple it is to tackle rough sleeping. Now the government needs to go further. The countrywide introduction of Housing First (funded by central government) is in the interests of homeless people, the economy, society at large and Johnson himself. All Johnson has to do is put his money where his mouth is to show that he is capable of keeping a promise, and he will create a legacy worthy of Remes and the thousands who have died needlessly on our streets, as well as for Brokenshire – and, dare we say it, even for himself.

12/29/2021,"Germany’s highest court has ruled that disabled people must be protected by legally binding guidelines in case hospitals are forced to introduce a triage system as the country braces itself for a new, more infectious wave of coronavirus. The constitutional court announced its decision on Tuesday, ordering legislators to create a legal framework which would prevent disabled people from being unfairly treated.  It urged the state to establish a set of criteria to which doctors would have to refer before deciding which patients received lifesaving treatment if intensive care units were overwhelmed and resources were exhausted. The case was brought by a group of nine people with disabilities and pre-existing medical conditions who feared that current medical guidelines would not protect them from being overlooked or disregarded if they became seriously ill with Covid-19. They called for the state to lay down the selection criteria that would be used to determine which patients continued to receive possibly lifesaving treatments if a choice had to be made. One of the complainants, Nancy Poser, a 42-year-old judge at a district court in the western city of Trier, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, said she was relieved by the ruling. “Lawmakers are now obliged to protect us based on the clear understanding that disabled people like me are protected by the basic law – in an emergency situation this law cannot be simply levered out and that is very comforting,” she told the news magazine Der Spiegel. In its ruling the court said that parliament had flouted the constitution, which states that “no person shall be disregarded because of disability”. The issue has been a matter of debate for years, and the court has been considering the case for the past 18 months, since the issue was brought into sharp relief in the early stages of the pandemic. So far Germany has not had to resort to a triage situation, though there is heightened awareness of the method having had to be used elsewhere in Europe, in particular Italy, during the pandemic. In recent months patients have had to be transferred to other regions in Germany and abroad in an operation involving the air force, as intensive care units have filled up in some areas. The decision was welcomed by Karl Lauterbach, the health minister, who tweeted that “people with disabilities need the protection of the state more than any other, especially in the case of triage”. But he added that Germany now needed to try to prevent triage situations, through “effective protection measures and vaccinations”. The onset of a new wave of coronavirus in Germany driven by the new, more infectious variant Omicron has led to the introduction of tighter contact reduction measures in recent days, and is driving the demand for third booster jabs of Covid vaccines as well as increasing the number of those getting the vaccine for the first time. With just over 70% of Germans having been fully vaccinated, legislators are due to debate the introduction of a vaccine mandate next month, in an effort to tackle the slow uptake. With the expectation that infection rates are likely to rise exponentially in the coming days, medics and lawyers have broken a taboo by raising the ethical question of whether those who have chosen not to be vaccinated can be turned away for treatment or face an increase in health insurance costs should they need a hospital. Tatjana Hörnle, the director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Crime, Security and Law in Freiburg, has argued that it is time for a rethink of “the prevailing opinion that a patient’s previous actions” – in this case, not getting a vaccination – should not play a role in treatment decision-making. She said that a person’s own decisions if they were of legal age and mentally capable had to be taken into account in an emergency situation such as a pandemic, in which not all patients needing intensive medical care would be able to receive it if resources were short. Hörnle told Spiegel it was “legitimate and rational to point out” to those who might have “essentially or exclusively caused their own emergency situation” that other sick people might be treated ahead of them. The German Institute for Human Rights has rejected the idea of using vaccine status as a criteria for deciding whether to treat anyone. “Vaccine status should not be allowed to play any role as to who should receive intensive medical treatment or not,” said its director, Beate Rudolf. “Not even amongst those who have behaved carelessly or without solidarity.” ",News/World news,German court rules disabled people must be protected in Covid triage cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/german-court-disabled-people-covid-triage
12/29/2021,"At the end of 2002, Australia retained the Ashes inside 10 days. In 2021, the official figure will be 12 days. But that includes a surrender just after lunch on the fourth day in Brisbane, and well before lunch on the third day in Melbourne, scarcely enough in each case to be included as a day’s play.  On Monday, in these pages, we wrote about the extraordinary emergence of Scott Boland. On the second evening, his two wickets before stumps set the match on a path towards an inevitable conclusion. On the third day, Boland realised that conclusion himself, taking four more wickets to round out an astonishing second innings on debut, finishing with six wickets for seven runs. The second Indigenous man to play Test cricket for Australia won the Johnny Mullagh medal named for his long-ago predecessor, Unaarrimin, in an extraordinary moment of symbolic and practical significance. In raw numbers, only once in Test history has a six-wicket haul cost fewer runs, across 144 years of the game. More than anything, this emphasises how right everything has gone for Australia, even when things have gone wrong. The home team would have gone into this series expecting Josh Hazlewood, Patrick Cummins and Mitchell Starc to play as many matches as possible, with a couple of rotations where required. Instead, Hazlewood has been missing since the first game. The captain Cummins missed the second game, and only the notionally least reliable of the three, Starc, has played every match. And yet Starc has led the lot, bowling an excellent line with consistency, reliability and perseverance, despite the doubts thrown his way before the contest commenced. Behind him, every substitute that Australia has employed has delivered above expectations. Jhye Richardson took five for 42 in the final innings in Adelaide. Michael Neser was his support act, doing everything he could in exactly the style that we have come to expect from him. Then when the pair were rested, there was Boland as the Melbourne specialist polishing off a usually attritional Test in the shortest possible time. Perhaps this is the benefit of playing at home, where most things can work out well for the home team. But that was not the case for Australia against India in the previous home summer, in which India found ways to survive and then prosper against the local attack. This leads to the final question, which is how good this Australia team actually is. A couple of months ago, the focus was on the coach Justin Langer’s fractious relationship with senior player in the national team. A few weeks ago, the focus was on the former captain Tim Paine’s resignation amid stories that still require closer examination. Now, having retained the Ashes in straight sets, as has been the practice in several recent series, glowing reviews will be written. But that could be very different by the end of 2022, after the Australian players have travelled to Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India. There is no clear way to define this team’s quality against the lack of quality of England’s tourists. The visiting captain, Joe Root, spoke after the Melbourne loss about pride in the badge and the need to deliver. But that can’t mean much when players are not given adequate preparation for a contest. Nobody batting in the county championship in the last couple of years has demanded a place in England’s team. It looks increasingly evident that the competition itself is not fit for purpose. But that is equally the case when Australian players tour Asia, and has been for a long time. Recent visits include a loss to Pakistan in 2018, a tie in Bangladesh in 2017, a loss to India earlier the same year, and a whitewash by Sri Lanka in 2016. There will be deserved celebrations after winning the Ashes at home, but far sterner tests await in the year to come. As for England, the problems are vast and complicated. Neither Root nor coach Chris Silverwood wanted to damn their current squad, but neither was prepared to deny that there are broader systemic problems in providing England players who can handle the challenges of overseas tours. There are two Tests remaining in this Ashes series, but neither can change anything in terms of these bigger problems. For now, Australia’s team can enjoy the primacy of home conditions. There is little more significant than the fact that the home team’s most questionable player in the series, Marcus Harris, made 76 in Melbourne and outscored England’s second innings on his own. What can a visiting team do from there? With the series decided, there are bigger challenges now awaiting Australia. The meaning of beating England, given England’s now evident weaknesses, remains very much a point for debate.",Sport/Sport,Scott Boland’s perfect day sums up Australia’s seamless Ashes series,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/28/scott-bolands-perfect-day-sums-up-australias-seamless-ashes-series
12/29/2021,"North Sea gas producers could face a windfall tax on the near-record profits they are likely to make from booming prices, in an effort to help protect households from the soaring costs of the energy crisis. The government faces growing pressure to take urgent action to prevent a national energy crisis that could double home energy bills to £2,000 a year, including a multi-billion pound raid on North Sea gas earnings.  Operators in the North Sea are expected to rake in their highest profits since the 2008 financial crash after a surge in global market prices, while UK households shoulder record high heating bills as well as the cost of dealing with energy suppliers that have gone bust. “What the government needs to do is step in,” Dale Vince, the chief executive of the energy supplier Ecotricity, told the BBC. “If they really believe the energy prices are too high and truly want to control them then they should subsidise the cost of energy right now.” “The North Sea operators, for example, supply 40% of Britain’s gas [and] they have made a killing in this crisis because they’re getting paid at nine times more than they were last year – and nine times more than they need because the cost of getting gas out the ground has not gone up,” he said. The UK’s North Sea oil and gas companies are expected to report near-record cashflows of almost $20bn (£14.9bn) for the current financial year, according to industry experts at Wood MacKenzie, after prices on the UK’s gas market climbed nine times higher in the last year. In recent years, many of the larger publicly-owned oil and gas companies, which once dominated the North Sea, have been replaced by smaller companies. Some are listed, such as Harbour Energy, but a growing proportion of North Sea companies are backed by private equity, including Siccar Point, or overseas governments. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the trade association Energy UK, told the BBC that the government’s thinking had “shifted over the last few weeks” because the crisis was likely to affect the whole economy. “There’s definitely scope to look at how we intervene in the price shock, and I think it would be very welcome for [the Treasury] to be involved in discussions on what to do next, and to be looking really broadly at the energy sector,” she said. The UK’s gas market breached the record high set in October this year by climbing to about £4.50 a therm last week, from about 50p at the beginning of the year, reigniting calls for an urgent intervention to protect customers from spiralling costs. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, met energy bosses for emergency talks on Monday, but the discussions failed to produce a solution to what the Ovo Energy boss, Stephen Fitzpatrick, warned could lead to “an enormous crisis for 2022”. Windfall taxes were first raised in September after the Spanish government set out plans to subsidise bills through a raid on companies which profited from the crisis. At the time, Kwarteng told a committee of MPs that the government was considering “all options”, including Spain’s €3bn (£2.5bn) windfall tax on generators and energy traders. “I’m not a fan of windfall taxes,” the business secretary added. “But of course [the energy system] is an entire system and we have to think about how we can get the energy system as a whole to help itself.” Wood Mackenzie said a windfall tax on the UK’s North Sea companies “cannot be ruled out”, particularly in light of the UK government’s ambiguity towards fossil fuel development within its 2050 net zero climate plan. “There would be strong resistance from producers, who would typically stop investment in response. But if the government is already considering winding down the sector, this threat may not be as persuasive as it has been in the past,” the consultancy said. The government is also reportedly considering a £20bn Treasury-backed fund, which could provide loans to help struggling energy companies cover the cost of rising wholesale energy prices, according to the Daily Telegraph. The loans would be repayable over a number of years to help protect households from a sudden rise in home energy bills next year.
