3/1/2022,"The value of Russia’s Ruble against the United States Dollar is worth less than a cent. To prevent a further collapse, the Russian Central Bank raised the interest rates to 20% from 9.5% Bitcoin purchases against the Russian Ruble rose to $1.5 billion in a single day. The imposition of sanctions, elimination of Russia from SWIFT, European Union’s ban of Central Bank’s transactions is already beginning to affect the country’s economy. In less than 24 hours after the US announced its sanctions and the decision of removing Russia from SWIFT, Ruble tumbled. One Ruble was worth about 1.2 cents or $0.012 until a few hours ago. Then, however, due to the invasion of Ukraine worsening and considering the response from the world, its value fell. Plunging by a mind-boggling 21.29% is currently worth less than a cent at $0.009. The broader impact of this fall of value is that the Central Bank raised its key interest rates. In addition, as the Ruble’s value collapses, Russia is taking steps to avoid hyperinflation. And for the same reason, the Bank raised its interest rates on deposits to 20%, which is higher than most of Russia’s securities and stocks. Furthermore, the Bank is looking into ways to fight the ban and elimination from SWIFT. Since the country cannot access any of its 14 trillion Rubles and the $1.1 trillion forex reserves, it is looking at another way. Incentivizing investors with a 20% interest rate is a step in that direction. The State Duma deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), Nikolai Arefiev, even went on to say: “If they block all the funds that are abroad, then the government will have no choice but to seize all the deposits of the population – there are about 60 trillion rubles – in order to get out of the situation” Thus to save money, as predicted by FXEmpire, the citizens have officially begun to turn to crypto. Data from Coindesk – Kaiko shows that over 1.5 billion Rubles worth of Bitcoin in Rubles pair was traded in just 24 hours. Recently, the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine appealed to every cryptocurrency exchange around the world to block and freeze the addresses of Russian and Belarusian politicians and the citizens of Russia and “sabotage” them. As the war worsens, problems for Ukrainian and Russian people will increase as their lifestyle gets much more expensive. One can only pray that neither of the countries’ citizens ends up paying a wheelbarrow of money to buy one loaf of bread.

3/1/2022,"Investors love a bit of share buyback action, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been partaking in plenty of it recently. Last week, the chip giant disclosed it had authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program which comes hot on the heels of last May’s $4 billion authorization – for which the company has already purchased $3 billion worth of shares over the last 4 quarters. “Overall,” said Deutsche Bank’s Ross Seymore, “We believe the expansion of AMD's share repurchase program reflects the company’s continued confidence in its cash generation capabilities and commitment to shareholder returns while still investing for strong revenue growth.” More than that, however, Seymore thinks the repurchase program is timed to coincide with the Xilinx acquisition. Given the all-stock deal structure, the share count is expected to increase by around 35%, so taking a chunk of shares off the market will help “offset the significant share count dilution.” It will also help make the EPS accretion the company guided for in the first year of the deal more palatable to Seymore; he had previously thought it was a bit of reach. “The addition of this large buyback program brings us closer to EPS neutrality (albeit still slightly dilutive),” said the analyst. Ultimately, Seymore has reduced the EPS forecast for 2022 from $4.15 to $4.05. That said, Seymore also notes that should either company’s fundamentals improve, or if cost synergies “come in higher” than the original $300 million guidance, there could be “room for upside” to that figure. The 5-star analyst summed up, “We look forward to seeing realization of the benefits of this transaction over time (AMD penetration into new markets, incremental opportunities for revenue/cost synergies, etc.) with more detail likely to come on the company's 1Q22 earnings call as well as its June Analyst Day.” For now, Seymore stays on the sidelines with a Hold rating, while his $140 price target suggests room for 13.5% growth over the coming year. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here) 7 of Seymore’s colleagues join him on the sidelines but with 15 other Buys, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy. The average target stands at $154.28, implying one-year share gains of ~25%.

3/1/2022,"OSLO (Reuters) -Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will vote against ratification of tech giant Apple Inc's management remuneration plan after an advisory firm urged investors to act, the fund's manager said on Sunday. The Norwegian fund owns 1.03% of Apple's shares, making it the company's eighth largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data. The maker of iPhones, computers and other devices is due to hold its annual meeting of shareholders on March 4. Chief Executive Tim Cook's pay in 2021 was 1,447 times that of the average Apple employee, a company filing on Jan. 7 showed, fuelled by stock awards that helped him earn a total of $98.7 million. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) last week urged investors to vote against Cook's remuneration, citing concerns around the magnitude and structure of his equity award, which amounted to some $82.3 million. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which operates the Norwegian wealth fund, said in a statement it would follow the advice. ""A substantial proportion of annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for five to ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement,"" NBIM said. ""The board should provide transparency on total remuneration to avoid unacceptable outcomes. The board should ensure that all benefits have a clear business rationale.""

3/1/2022,"By Tommy Wilkes LONDON (Reuters) -Russia is very likely to default on foreign debt and its economy will suffer a double digit contraction this year after the West launched sanctions unprecedented in scale and coordination, a global banking industry lobby group said on Monday. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated that half of the Russia's central bank's foreign reserves are held in countries which have imposed freezes on its assets, severely shrinking the bank's policymaking firepower. The central bank, which on Monday hiked interest rates and introduced capital controls, would prioritise the protection of domestic savers with foreign investors ""one of the last on the list,"" the IIF said. ""If we stay here and this (the crisis) escalates, then default and restructuring is likely,"" Elina Ribakova, the lobby group's deputy chief economist told reporters during a media call. She said default would be ""extremely likely"", although the relatively small size of foreign holdings - at around $60 billion - of Russian debt would limit the fallout. Default on domestically held bonds was far less likely, she added. Russia's central bank and the Russian finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Russia last week invaded Ukraine, leading the West to impose a series of sanctions. These have included the freezing of the central bank's assets, removal of many Russian banks from the global payments system SWIFT and the blacklisting of individuals and entities. Russia calls its military action in Ukraine a “special operation.” The sanctions sent the rouble plunging to record lows on Monday, and Western investors are scrambling to dump Russian assets as the country finds itself increasingly isolated. The IIF's Ribakova said the measures, which could yet be toughened even further, were ""the most severe economic sanctions imposed on a country"" ever and would send the Russian economy into a tailspin, with a low double-digit contraction this year likely and inflation soaring by a double digit amount too. She said conversion of Russian domestic foreign exchange holdings into roubles was also on the table, although the central bank would be reluctant to deploy that initially as it tried to spare hurting domestic savers. The central bank retains tools to try to calm markets, including hiking rates further, providing liquidity to domestic banks and limiting capital flows. It may also be forced to impose bank holidays to stop a run on banks, the IIF said in a report issued on Monday and written before the latest sanctions. Ribakova said an estimated $10 billion had been pulled from Russian banks on Friday alone. The sanctions could get tougher, including preventing U.S. and European entities from trading in existing Russian government debt, expanding the list of institutions banned from SWIFT and removing energy-related trade exclusions. Such measures would amplify financial, trade and pure contagion risks for the global economy too, and especially Europe, Ribakova added. In its earlier report the IIF said that should Russia's biggest lenders, Sberbank and VTB, get kicked off SWIFT, expect ""a fundamental destabilization of the entire financial system, with profound implications for the real economy.""
