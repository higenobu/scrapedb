1/12/2022,"California prisons have reported a staggering rise in Covid cases among staff this month, as the highly contagious Omicron variant has sent infection cases surging across the US.  Staff infections increased 212% in January with more than 3,800 active cases in dozens of state facilities. The surge comes amid debate over a federal judge’s order that all prison staff must be vaccinated, a mandate facing legal challenges from the governor and the corrections officer union. Currently, 69% of prison workers are fully vaccinated, according to the California department of corrections and rehabilitation, although the percentage varies drastically from prison to prison. At three facilities, fewer than 50% of staff are fully vaccinated, according to the department. Meanwhile, 80% of inmates in state prisons are fully vaccinated. As cases have risen among the workforce, state prisons have reported 2,358 active infections among incarcerated people over the last two weeks. Infections among incarcerated people rose 301% between 26 December and 2 January. The state announced last week that it would suspend visits at every facility for 15 days in order to reduce the spread of infections. “CDCR recognizes visiting is an important way to maintain family and community ties. At the same time, our first priority is the health and safety of those who live in and work in our facilities,” the department said in an announcement. With 257 active staff cases, the California healthcare facility, Stockton, which houses incarcerated people with long-term medical and mental health needs, currently has the most staff cases of any state prison facility. The prison has a staff vaccination rate of 84%, the highest in the state – workers at prisons with healthcare facilities are required to be vaccinated. The surge comes as cases rise across California due to the Omicron variant. This weekend the state reported more than 300,000 new cases. Omicron appears to cause less severe illness, particularly among the vaccinated, but it has led to a steep rise in infections that is straining California’s health system. Attorneys for inmates have warned that unvaccinated prison staff could lead to another deadly Covid surge in state facilities, and alleged that workers are failing to undergo twice weekly testing as required. Meanwhile, the legal battle over a vaccine mandate for prison workers is still under way. In October 2021, a federal judge ordered that all prison workers must be vaccinated because of the risk they pose to incarcerated people. Gavin Newsom, the California governor who had previously ordered Covid-19 vaccines or testing for all state workers, sought to appeal the mandate. A federal appeals court in November temporarily blocked the judge’s order, which was supposed to take effect this month. The appeal hearing will be scheduled in March. Along with corrections officers, law enforcement across California has pushed back against Covid vaccine mandates. The Los Angeles police union sued over the city’s requirement that all employees be vaccinated or have an approved medical or religious exemption, claiming that the order violated their civil rights. This week a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit. Since the start of the pandemic, 268 people incarcerated in California prisons have died of Covid-19 and more than 54,000 have been infected. Forty-nine prison staff have died of Covid.",News/US news,Omicron wreaks havoc across California prison facilities as staff cases surge,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/omicron-covid-california-prisons-staff-cases-surge-us
1/12/2022,"Last year was New Zealand’s hottest year on record, according to the country’s National Institute of Water and Aeronautic Research (NIWA), and seven of the past nine years are among New Zealand’s warmest ever. The country’s steadily rising temperature brings increased risk of major floods, bushfires and storms. According to NIWA, New Zealand’s average temperature in 2021 was 13.56 degrees Celsius. It’s the highest average NIWA has recorded since it began its seven-station annual temperature series in 1909, and breaks the previous record set in 2016 by 0.11 degrees.  The increases won’t end anytime soon without significant action on climate change, said Victoria University of Wellington’s Dr Nathanael Melia. “Every year we spin the roulette wheel of weather variability; however, like a casino, we have rigged the game, and the hothouse always wins in the end.” Dr James Renwick at the same university said: “We can expect more and more of the same in future – the record high temperatures we have just experienced would be counted as a cold year by the 2040s.” Heightened temperatures cause more extreme weather, says Renwick. For example, higher temperatures means the atmosphere holds more moisture, which causes more severe flooding in some regions. In July 2021 heavy rain engorged the West Coast’s Buller River, accelerating its flow to 10 times its normal rate – the highest recorded in a New Zealand river since 1926. The resulting flood devastated the town of Westport. Many residents had to be evacuated after hundreds of houses were inundated, causing an estimated NZ$132m in damage. Development West Coast’s chief executive, Heath Milne, expects the rebuild to take up to two years. Higher temperatures also mean other regions will become dryer, according to Renwick, causing more frequent bushfires. SCION, New Zealand’s forestry research service, estimates that the number of days of “very high” or “extreme” fire risk will double or triple in coming years. Firefighters in New Zealand are currently on their 26th day of fighting a major bush fire in the Far North District. “These changes are typical around the world,” says Renwick. “These are all symptoms of the way the climate is changing, and New Zealand is no different from other countries in that respect.”",News/World news,2021 was New Zealand’s hottest year on record,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/2021-was-new-zealands-hottest-year-on-record
1/12/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack closed in on Donald Trump’s inner circle on Tuesday, issuing subpoenas to three new White House officials involved in planning the former president’s appearance at the rally that preceded the 6 January insurrection.  The new subpoenas show the select committee is moving ever nearer to Trump in its investigation and suggests the panel is now examining whether the former president’s speech suggested that the White House had advance knowledge of plans to attack the Capitol. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, issued subpoenas to the former White House strategists Andy Surabian and Arthur Schwartz, suggesting they helped coordinate Trump’s appearance by communicating with the organizers and speakers at the rally. The chairman also authorized a subpoena for Ross Worthington, the former White House official who drafted the speech Trump delivered at the rally, during which the former president lied that he won the 2020 election and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. “The select committee is seeking information from individuals who were involved with the rally,” Thompson said. “Protests that day escalated into an attack on our democracy. Protesters became rioters who carried out a violent attempt to derail the peaceful transfer of power.” The rally at the Ellipse has grown in significance for the select committee in recent weeks, as it examines whether Trump obstructed a congressional proceeding by inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. The Guardian first reported last week that the panel is also examining whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy that connected his plan to have then-Vice President Mike Pence refuse to certify Biden’s victory with the extremist groups that attacked the Capitol. Thompson said in the subpoena letters to Surabian and Schwartz that they were targeted since they appeared to have repeated communication with some of the top organizers and speakers at the rally, including Trump’s eldest son Don Jr, and his fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle. The chairman added that they also had contacts that touched on securing the participation of far-right activists such as Ali Alexander and Alex Jones at the rally, discussed media coverage of the rally, and appearance fees for others who did speak at the rally. Thompson said in the subpoena letter to Worthington that he was being targeted since he helped draft Trump’s speech for the rally, where the former president urged his supporters to “fight much harder” and “stop the steal” – before promising to march with them to the Capitol. The select committee gave the three former Trump aides until 24 January to produce documents detailed in the subpoenas, with deposition dates set from the end of the month through the first week of February.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel closes in on Trump inner circle with three new subpoenas,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/capitol-attack-panel-trump-subpoenas
1/12/2022,"Antonio Conte says that he delivered the unvarnished truth to Daniel Levy at a meeting to discuss Tottenham’s January transfer business and it is up to the chairman to deliver on his recommendations. Levy returned from the Bahamas at the weekend, where he spent time with the Spurs owner, Joe Lewis, and he sat down with Conte and the managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, on Monday.  Conte, who said the club had opened talks with Hugo Lloris about a contract extension – the captain’s deal expires in June – has conducted a thorough evaluation of the squad he inherited from Nuno Espírito Santo at the start of November. Conte believes it needs surgery and he has not been slow to highlight how the club have slipped to a mediocre level, seeing a gap open up to teams such as Chelsea, who Spurs host in the Carabao Cup semi-final, second leg on Wednesday night. Chelsea are 2-0 up. Conte feels he needs a centre-half, a midfielder, a right-sided player and a back-up striker and, although he accepts that January is a difficult window and the summer is a more realistic time for an overhaul, he wants to see progress before the end of the month. The manager has a strong interest in Wolves’ Adama Traoré, who can play at right wing-back or right wing, and he would like to be reunited with the Internazionale centre-half Stefan de Vrij, with whom he worked at San Siro. De Vrij, 30 in February, would not appear to fit Levy’s desired profile for signings. Spurs have been linked with a move for the Milan midfielder Franck Kessie, although they may prefer to wait until the summer when he is out of contract. “When you have the possibility to speak to the owner [Levy] and the sporting director … with Paratici I have the possibility to speak every day … but to speak with our owner, it was important,” Conte said. “Also because I like to be honest and always tell the truth. You know that I don’t like to tell a good lie to keep a good relationship or show myself to be very soft or too polite. It was good to tell the truth and it was a good meeting. “I’d asked the club for time to make my evaluation. They asked me after one month to have a meeting but I said: ‘No. I prefer to have another month to make the right evaluation.’ To show me who deserves to stay here. Now the situation is very clear and I was satisfied to have this conversation with the owner. “Now I have only one way – it’s on the pitch and the training sessions every day … to improve the level of my players. Then, the club know the situation and, if they want to help me another way, I appreciate it.” Conte expressed confidence that agreement could be reached for Lloris to stay, which felt like him exerting a little more pressure on the board. “I think that they have started to talk,” Conte said. “You know very well what I think about Hugo. He’s an important player and I’m sure that they are going to find a solution for him to continue to play with Tottenham. For sure I am very confident about this situation to be positive.” Conte reported that Cristian Romero had “taken a little part” in training on Tuesday and was “very close” to a return after a hamstring tear. He added that he continued to count on Steven Bergwijn, who is also close to coming back from injury. Ajax want the winger but the clubs are a distance apart on their valuations.",Sport/Football,Conte delivers transfer truth to Levy with Tottenham in need of overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/conte-delivers-transfer-truth-to-levy-with-tottenham-in-need-of-overhaul
1/12/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said that he will not try to get the best out of Romelu Lukaku by asking the Chelsea striker to alter his game.  Lukaku has not convinced since leaving Internazionale for £97.5m and he missed Chelsea’s recent 2-2 draw with Liverpool after airing his frustrations in an interview with Sky Italia. However the Belgian returned when the European champions took a 2-0 aggregate lead in their Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham last week and Tuchel believes that the 28-year-old is on the right path before Wednesday night’s second leg at Spurs. “Romelu had a huge physical impact in the game against Tottenham,” Tuchel said. “Maybe he wasn’t so spectacularly involved, but he was involved in playing a crucial part with his physical qualities. We saw that in his data. “Once he adapts to the physical style of the league there is no doubt he will have a huge impact. We will not reinvent his style or reinvent the player. He can simply be Romelu and then we are all fine and then he will score because this is what he always does.” Lukaku, who cleared the air with Tuchel last week, scored his eighth goal of the season when Chelsea beat non-league Chesterfield in the third round of the FA Cup last Saturday. “Nothing helps more than goals with strikers,” Tuchel said. “There is no talk, no video that can build up the same feeling as a goal.” Chelsea’s manager was asked whether Timo Werner could act as a foil for Lukaku, who flourished alongside Lautaro Martínez at Inter last season. “He could be but I see no reason that we should copy Inter,” Tuchel replied. “We have our style and enough possibilities. We can play with two strikers, we can play 3-5-2. We have the possibility to play three strikers. “We played a 4-4-2 against Tottenham in the first leg. I don’t mean it in a harsh way: the players need to show they are good enough to start. We are not inventing new stuff to make players better or more happy. They have all it takes. It’s on them to show it.” Thiago Silva and N’Golo Kanté missed the first leg against Spurs after testing positive for Covid-19, but the influential duo could boost Chelsea’s chances of reaching Wembley by returning to the squad. Tuchel reported that Chelsea had no new injury concerns. Billy Gilmour has returned to Chelsea for assessment on a knee injury. The Scotland midfielder has struggled since joining Norwich on a season’s loan.",Sport/Football,Tuchel insists Romelu Lukaku does not need to alter style to thrive at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/tuchel-insists-romelu-lukaku-does-not-need-to-alter-style-to-thrive-at-chelsea
