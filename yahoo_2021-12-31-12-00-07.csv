12/31/2021,"Just before Thomas Randele died, his wife of nearly 40 years asked his golfing buddies and his co-workers from the dealerships where he sold cars to come by their home. They gathered to say goodbye to a guy they called one of the nicest people they’d ever known — a devoted family man who gushed about his daughter, a golfer who never bent the rules, a friend to so many that a line stretched outside the funeral home a week later.  By the time of their final visit last May at Randele’s house in suburban Boston, the cancer in his lungs had taken away his voice. So they all left without knowing that their friend they’d spent countless hours swapping stories with never told them his biggest secret of all. For the past 50 years, he was a fugitive wanted in one of the largest bank robberies in Cleveland’s history, living in Boston under a new name he created six months after the heist in the summer of 1969. Not even his wife or daughter knew until he told them in what authorities described as a deathbed confession. How he was able to leave behind one family and create a new life — while evading a father and son from the U.S. Marshals Service who never gave up their hunt — is just now being pieced together.  ___ Ted Conrad quickly figured out that security was fairly loose at the Society National Bank in Cleveland after he started as a teller in January 1969. He told his buddies, “It’d be so easy for me to walk out with all kinds of money,” Russell Metcalf, his best friend from high school, said in an interview with The Associated Press. They thought he was blowing smoke when he brought it up a few more times. Then just a day after his 20th birthday that July, Conrad walked out at closing time on a Friday with a paper bag stuffed with $215,000 from the vault, a haul worth $1.6 million today.  By the time the missing money was noticed the following Monday, Conrad was flying across the country. Letters sent to his girlfriend showed he made stops in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles within the first week.  In one letter, he mistakenly thought he could return in seven years when the statute of limitations expired. But once he was indicted, that was no longer true. Conrad apparently cut off contact with his entire family, including three siblings and his parents, who were divorced. Some family members eventually presumed he was dead because so many years had passed, said Matt Boettger, whose mother was Conrad's older sister. His mom, he said, was relieved more than anything to find out her brother had lived a happy life. “She thought she would go to her grave and never know,” he said. ___ The bank heist in 1969 didn’t capture the attention of the nation, or even the city of Cleveland. Everyone else was focused on Apollo 11′s historic flight to the moon that week. But for John Elliott, a deputy U.S. marshal, it was personal. He and Conrad came from the same side of town. Elliott used to take his family to the ice cream shop where Conrad worked. They shared a doctor.  The problem was that Conrad's head start allowed him to disappear, and he was disciplined enough not to make any missteps. The last credible sighting came in October 1969, when a Cleveland couple visiting Hawaii met a man they later realized looked very much like Conrad. Elliott traveled across the U.S. looking for Conrad and even after retiring in 1990 he would come in the office just about every week and pour over the files, said his son, Pete Elliott, now the top U.S. marshal in Cleveland, who inherited the hunt for Conrad nearly 20 years ago. His father died in March 2020 before investigators pieced together details from Randele's obituary and signatures from his past. Then in November, Randele's family confirmed that just before he died he told them his real identity and what he had done, Elliott said.  “It always stayed on my dad’s mind,” he said. “We kept this case going because it was important to my father.”  ___ Why Conrad committed the robbery has been analyzed endlessly. “It wasn’t about the money. He always wanted to impress people,” said Metcalf, his high school pal, who remembered how Conrad once stole a deck of cards just to prove he could. “He had no fear.” Investigators believe he was inspired by the 1968 movie “The Thomas Crown Affair,” about a bank executive who got away with $2.6 million and turned the heist into a game. Conrad saw the film at least six times and copied Steve McQueen’s character, driving sports cars and drinking high-end liquor, according to friends. After the real-life robbery in Cleveland, Conrad wound up in the Boston area, where much of the movie was filmed. It's a good possibility that he chose his new first name “Thomas” based on the movie, Elliott said. “He modeled his whole life after the movie,” he said.  ___ The man known as Thomas Randele came into existence the first week of January in 1970, investigators have found in recent weeks. That’s when Conrad walked into a Social Security Administration office in Boston, asked for an identification number under his new name and made himself two years older, Elliott said. At that time, it wasn’t unusual to wait until you were an adult, so his application didn’t raise any red flags. With a new identification card, he was able to open a bank account, build credit and create his new life, Elliott said.  During the 1970s, Randele worked as an assistant golf pro, giving lessons at a country club outside Boston and later becoming its manager. He spent a few winters golfing in Florida, according to his obituary. He also met his future wife not long after arriving in Boston. They were married in 1982. Around then he began working in the car business, selling Land Rovers and Volvos at a handful of dealerships until he retired after nearly 40 years. It was a job that put him in front of dozens of strangers every day.  What’s not clear yet is what happened to the money. The Marshals Service is looking into whether he lost it early on through bad investments. While Randele and his wife, Kathy, lived most of their years in a pleasant Boston suburb, they filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Court records showed they then owed $160,000 in credit card debt and had few assets.  His wife told Cleveland.com in November that her husband was a great man and that she was still grieving. She has declined interview requests. ___ No one would have guessed that Randele, who was 71 when he died, was someone trying to hide from authorities. Among the many people he became friends with over the years was an FBI agent in Boston, Elliott said. He never shied away from anyone on the golf course or in the auto showrooms where he'd keep a set of clubs and swing his 7-iron when sales were slow.  “He was just a gentle soul, you know, very polite, very well spoken,” said Jerry Healy, who first met Randele at a Woburn, Massachusetts, dealership where they talked daily for years.  The two were among a group of five or six car salesmen who stuck together for much of their careers. None of them, Healy said, ever suspected something like this in Randele's past.  “It never dawned on us, and that’s a half a dozen guys that aren’t easy to fool,” he said.  His former co-workers said they never heard Randele say a bad word about anybody or raise his voice. They all said he was the best golfer they ever knew. Everyone wanted him on their side when there was a tournament. He wasn't much of a drinker and never put down any side bets while playing, said Bob Van Wert, who first met Randele while golfing and then later worked with him. They remembered he could always control his emotions and rarely got upset, even on the course, where he had such a pretty swing that he once bested Hall of Fame golfer Johnny Miller at a charity event, his former boss remembered. Matt Kaplan, who managed two dealerships where Randele worked and golfed with him every Sunday morning for many years, called him the definition of a gentleman. “The only way it makes sense is that at that age he was just a kid, and it was a challenge kind of thing,” Kaplan said. “It’s not like he became a professional bank robber."" ""If he would have told us way back when, I don’t think we would have believed him because he wasn’t that kind of guy,” he said. “The man was different than the kid.” ___ In the early days after Randele's identity was revealed, his friends couldn't believe it. But now looking back, there are a few things that make sense.  How he always had a beard. The photos of him wearing dark sunglasses on the golf course. His reluctance to talk about where he grew up or his extended family.  “You know all the years I knew Tommy, I never heard him mention a sister or a mother or a brother or a father. Everything was kind of generalized,” Healy said. “You could never pry anything from him,” said Brad Anthony, another close friend. “I figured maybe he had a bad childhood and he didn’t want to talk about it.”  Still, he said it's almost impossible to believe. “It just seems so out of character for the Tom I knew,” he said. All of his friends agreed that what happened long ago hasn't changed how they feel about him. “The man I knew didn’t change all of a sudden because of something he did a lifetime ago,” Healy said. “He was a good man, he was my friend and I think no less of him today than I did before this all came out. And I’d love to go play a round of golf with him.”",U.S./Associated Press,"Friendly family man's 50-year secret: He was fugitive, too",https://news.yahoo.com/friendly-family-mans-50-secret-122110124.html
12/31/2021,"A cosmetics and skin care products company founded by married Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang has had assets worth 600 million yuan (US$94 million) frozen due to an investigation by China's market regulator over an alleged pyramid scheme. The market regulator in Shijiazhuang, the capital of northern China's Hebei province, said it had received several reports about a suspected pyramid scheme involving Shanghai Dowell Trading, according to a letter widely circulated on Chinese social media platforms on Tuesday. ""Because of its use of financial institutions to transfer or conceal funds involved in pyramid schemes, the administration has applied to the People's Court to take preservation measures under the law, and the case is currently under further investigation,"" said the letter dated last week. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Shanghai Dowell Trading responded on Wednesday, and said that it ""is a legally operating company that has always complied with the government guidance, adhered to the legal operation, and paid taxes according to the law"". ""We are very grateful to the Administration for Market Regulation of Shijiazhuang Yuhua District for guiding our company to check the risk; at present, the company is operating normally. Our company will actively cooperate with relevant departments,"" said the statement on the company's Twitter-like Weibo account. Shanghai Dowell Trading, which was founded in 1996, is the main operator of cosmetics and skin care products brand TST Tin'Secret, which lists Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling as a spokeswoman. Chinese actor Xu Zheng is also a former shareholder, while several famous Chinese stars have posted photos on social media using the brand's face masks. The Taiwan Affairs Office within China's State Council said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that the business incident had nothing to do with cross-strait relations. Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling is listed as a spokeswoman for TST Tin'Secret. Photo: Handout alt=Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling is listed as a spokeswoman for TST Tin'Secret.

Lin made a name for himself starring in the Chinese TV series Fantasies Behind The Pearly Curtains in the 1970s, while Zhang featured in the Legendary Chien Lung TV series in 1991. Pyramid schemes, which are illegal in China like many other countries, are businesses that recruit people whose job is to enrol others into the scheme rather than selling a specific product or service. The business model means only a few people at the top of the pyramid earn money, while the large number at the bottom will make little to zero return on their investment. Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang founded Shanghai Dowell Trading in 1996. Photo: Weibo alt=Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang founded Shanghai Dowell Trading in 1996. Photo: Weibo> They are similar to multilevel marketing in terms of structure, but do not involve a specific product. As early as 2016, the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper reported several skin irritation and acne cases caused by the face masks. The ""China Consumer Reports"" journal also featured cases of skin damage caused by the products as one of its annual cases as part of International Consumer Rights Day in 2017. Li Xu, the founder of the Chinese civil society organisation ""Li Xu anti-multi-level marketing team,"" said Shanghai Dowell Trading uses three typical features of a pyramid scheme, namely the need to pay a joining fee, the number of people involved and the method of payment. The correlation between agents' salaries and the size of their teams means the more members people bring in, the more commission they receive, he added. Li said traditional pyramid schemes are based on pure money flow and are more likely to gather funds in the name of investment, which differs from the current pyramid micronet businesses that own legitimate companies and products. ""They have legitimate companies as a cover and will even have celebrity endorsements, but it's still a pyramid scheme in nature,"" said Li. Shanghai Dowell Trading was recognised for making the highest annual tax payment in Shanghai's Qingpu District in both 2017 and 2018, with the company claiming to have paid 2.1 billion yuan (US$330 million) in tax in 2018 alone.

12/31/2021,"An Asian food court stall in Illinois has gone viral on TikTok after an employee refused to serve two Black sisters because of his alleged encounter with another Black person earlier that day.

What happened: TikTok user @labellamonay shared the incident on Sunday, and the clip has been viewed more than 1.1 million times at the time of this writing.
 In the two-minute video, the TikTok user confronts an Asian server of Fox Valley Mall’s Nori Japan in Aurora, Illinois, after he allegedly refused to serve the woman’s sister, because she is Black. @labellamonay argues that her sister is paying the man for her order, but he still refuses to serve her, because a Black customer did not pay for their meal earlier that day. “‘Cause she’s Black? ‘Cause another Black person took your food and didn’t pay, you’re not going to serve my sister?” the TikTok user asks. “You can’t do that, sir. That’s discrimination. You can’t tell her you’re not going to serve her, ‘cause she’s Black because of what someone else did today.” “You people no pay money,” the man replies. The TikTok user then asks, ""What does that have to do with us? I don’t know what you’re talking about, sir. We’re not affiliated with them."" “I thought I would never have to do something like this,” the woman can be heard saying in the video. “Well, what’s worse, the person that we don’t know not paying you $5 or us suing you for discrimination?” The man then replies, “I don’t know. Same face.” 
The reaction: Many users’ reactions were divided, with some defending the Asian server and others calling him out for discrimination.
 “He’s wrong but I also understand him this man is traumatized and hurt. Understanding should come from both sides,” one TikTok user said. However, @labellamonay called out everyone who was defending the man by posting another video showing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.” 
   “I’m half Asian and I’m sick of my people DEFENDING people like him just cuz he’s old and doesn’t speak English much. He’s a grown adult,” a TikTok user wrote. “I do not understand how y’all are looking at obvious discrimination and choose to defend this man,” another user wrote.

12/31/2021,"Members of the Saudi hit squad that killed Jamal Khashoggi are reportedly living it up. The Guardian reported that at least three were spotted in luxury villas in a Saudi-run compound. Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Multiple members of the Saudi hit squad that brutally murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 are living in luxury villas in a government-run Saudi security compound, according to the Guardian. According to the report, at least three of the killers are residing and working in villas operated by the Saudi State Security Agency, in a compound in Riyadh. Family members are reportedly allowed to visit the men, and the ""seven-star"" housing units include gyms and offices. The Guardian reported that Salah al-Tubaigy, the forensic expert who dismembered Khashoggi, was seen inside the compound. Mustafa al-Madani, the man who posed as Khashoggi's body double, and Mansour Abahussein, the lead operative, were also spotted in sightings between 2019 and 2020. Over the last two years, witnesses saw caterers, family members, and gardeners visiting the men, the Guardian reported. Khashoggi, a prominent commentator and columnist for The Washington Post, was once within the Royal family's circle, but their opinion of him soured once his work became critical of the family's dealings. Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 after he went to the consulate to pick up marital documents needed to marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. Turkish officials, along with UN and US officials, corroborated the allegations that Khashoggi's body was dismembered with a bone saw. His remains have yet to be found. In February, the Biden administration declassified a CIA intelligence report, which directly implicated the Saudi Crown Prince in Khashoggi's murder. ""We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman (MBS) approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" said the report, provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. A UN report issued after Khashoggi's killing seconded the claim, saying that ""Assessments of the recordings by intelligence officers in Turkey and other countries suggest that Mr. Khashoggi could have been injected with a sedative and then suffocated using a plastic bag."" A Turkish court is currently trying 26 Saudi nationals connected to the murder in absentia, with the next trial date set for July 8. The Saudi government, after a series of excuses, admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a ""rogue operation,"" and placed 11 individuals on trial. Five people were sentenced to death in December 2019 by the Riyadh Criminal Court for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"" while three others were handed prison sentences. The Guardian reported all of the men spotted in the complex were tried and sentenced as part of the trial, which was heavily criticized around the globe. Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, two high-ranking officials close to MBS, scraped by with no charges. After the ruling, Cengiz said, ""The ruling handed down today in Saudi Arabia again makes a complete mockery of justice."" Khashoggi's murder ignited a global pressure campaign against the Saudi regime, prompting officials in the US and abroad to briefly question their diplomatic relationships with Saudi Arabia. After President Biden's first meeting with MBS in early March, he reportedly refused to sanction the Saudi regime over Khashoggi's killing.

12/31/2021,"The Duke of York has been warned that the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell proves that justice will prevail “whether you’re a president or a prince”. Prince Andrew came under fresh pressure as lawyers in the US said that the guilty verdict in the Maxwell case will give succour to the woman who has accused the Duke of sexual assault. One said he should be “quaking in his boots”. The Duke, who denies the claims, hopes that a judge will throw out a civil case being brought against him by Virginia Roberts Giuffre at a hearing scheduled for January 4. Attempts to paint her as an unreliable witness, however, have been dealt a blow after Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking underage girls for paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison in 2019. Both Epstein and Maxwell were friends of the Duke. Not only did a New York court decide that four other victims were telling the truth, but one of Maxwell’s convictions included a reference to Ms Giuffre. Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Giuffre and Maxwell victim Annie Farmer, told The Telegraph: “This verdict told the American public that regardless of power, or privilege, whether you’re a president or a prince, you will be held accountable. “What we saw at the trial is a mention of Prince Andrew and people of his stature. The jury looked at Ghislaine, who has summered at the Queen’s homes and lived a life of incredible privilege associating with those types of people, and yet they disregarded all that. I see a real change in the legal landscape.” Ms Giuffre is seeking unspecified damages, claiming the Duke assaulted or raped her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was 17. The Duke denies her claims and says he has no recollection of meeting her. After Maxwell was found guilty of five of the six counts she faced, Ms Giuffre, now 38, said: “It’s definitely not over.” The scandal has dogged Prince Andrew for more than a decade, ever since Ms Giuffre’s allegations, and the photograph of her with the Duke and Maxwell, were made public. The accusations have caused great embarrassment to the Royal family and saw the Duke step down from public duties before Ms Giuffre’s civil suit was launched in New York in August. Ian Maxwell, Ghislaine’s brother, told The Telegraph on Thursday that his family planned to appeal her guilty verdict on the grounds she was “denied” a fair trial. “This is a shocking result which reflects the fact that Ghislaine has been denied the right to a fair trial, starting with the appalling conditions in which she has been held for over 18 months and which seriously impacted her ability to participate in her own defence,” he said. Lawyers for the victims said Maxwell, 60, should not be the last defendant brought before a jury over the Epstein scandal, amid speculation that other high-profile associates whose names were found in his so-called “little black book” might now face questions. While Ms Giuffre was not a witness in Maxwell’s trial, she loomed large over proceedings, with almost 250 mentions of her and multiple photographs shown to the jury. Legal experts also noted that the required burden of proof in a criminal trial was higher than in a civil case. Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor who now works as a defence attorney in New York, said: “Every case rests on its own facts. The jury verdict, however, will surely embolden the Plaintiff’s attorneys in the case against Prince Andrew.” The comments from Ms Giuffre’s lawyer heap pressure on the FBI to re-examine the claims against the Duke. Federal prosecutors in New York formally requested through the British Government to speak with the Duke last year as part of their criminal investigations into both Epstein and Maxwell. The Duke’s lawyers responded by saying that they offered his help as a witness on at least three occasions in 2020. Despite his long and close friendship with Maxwell, the Duke is understood to have been reassured by his UK-based team that the guilty verdict will make “no difference” to his own case and has nothing to do with him. Andrew Brettler, the Duke’s lead counsel, has asked Lewis Kaplan, the judge, to halt proceedings on the basis that Ms Giuffre lives in Australia and not Colorado, as her lawsuit suggests, which would invalidate her claim under federal court law. However, a source close to Ms Giuffre insisted that her team was well aware of her living arrangements, branding it “pretty desperate stuff” that showed a “lack of confidence” in their other arguments. Lisa Bloom, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who represented eight of Epstein’s victims, said that in the wake of Maxwell’s conviction, the Duke’s technical objections “aren’t going to fly”. She added: “He should be quaking in his boots because this shows that a jury is willing to come back with a guilty verdict even if the accusers are not perfect, as no human being is.” Scotland Yard confirmed that it was still liaising with prosecutors in the US regarding the Epstein investigation, but was not currently taking any action. Meanwhile, a former Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor told The Telegraph that Maxwell had a limited time to decide if she wanted to “flip” on other former associates of Epstein. If she wants to receive a reduced sentence, she will have to reach out to SDNY prosecutors before they submit a report to the judge ahead of the sentencing. The former prosecutor, who asked that his name not be published, said it was likely his former colleagues would look favourably on such a request if she has any information on other individuals. He said: “Certainly, she could still flip. That’ll help with regards to the sentence. It’s still possible. If she flips, she’ll flip now. “With a guilty verdict, the best way to help herself is to co-operate. It would benefit the prosecution and it benefits her prior to sentencing because they put it in the sentencing report. It’s a point system.” Epstein and Maxwell’s little black book was admitted in evidence during the trial and contains the names of some 300 Britons. There are 16 separate telephone numbers for the Duke, including a mobile phone number, one marked “Palace ex-directory”, one for Balmoral – the Queen’s private retreat in Scotland, where the Duke invited Epstein – and one marked “Sand”, which appears to be Sandringham, the other royal retreat where he spent time. Tony Blair, the former prime minister, is recorded once, while Lord Mandelson of Foy has 10 numbers, including one marked “direct line”, one marked “home” and one marked “country home”. Earl Spencer, the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales, also features. There is no suggestion that those named were involved in any wrongdoing. Maxwell faces up to 65 years behind bars on the sex trafficking charges and four others. A date has yet to be set for her sentencing.",U.S./The Telegraph,Prince Andrew told he will face justice after Ghislaine Maxwell verdict,https://news.yahoo.com/prince-andrew-told-face-justice-205426449.html
12/31/2021,"TOKYO (Reuters) -A 61-year-old man suspected of setting fire to a psychiatry clinic that killed 25 people in the Japanese city of Osaka this month died in hospital on Thursday, public broadcaster NHK said. The man, identified as Morio Tanimoto by NHK and other Japanese media, had been in critical condition due to carbon monoxide inhalation from the fire. Security camera footage from the clinic showed the fire broke out when Tanimoto carried two bags of liquid into building and set the liquid on fire, police have said. Tanimoto was a patient at the clinic, local media have said. Among those who died was the doctor who ran the facility, Kotaro Nishizawa, who has been praised for his support of mental health. The clinic, on the fourth floor of a commercial building in a busy area near a train station, treated patients for depression and panic disorder, with a focus on helping them return to work.

12/31/2021,"As Florida reported nearly 47,000 new coronavirus cases, again shattering its single-day record since the start of the pandemic, Democrats and critics called on Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to do more to address the state's spike in infections driven by the highly-transmissible omicron variant. The state on Wednesday reported 46,923 new cases from Tuesday, as the omicron surge nearly doubled Florida's previous peak over the summer. The state, which broke the record for new daily infections that was just set on Christmas Eve, is now averaging more than 30,300 new covid-19 cases a day, according to data tracked by The Washington Post - second in the nation to New York. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. While deaths continue to decline in Florida - an average of 18 a day as of Wednesday - the number of cases has exploded by 182% compared to the previous seven-day period. Florida now has reported 4 million total cases since the pandemic began, joining California and Texas as the only states with at least 4 million coronavirus infections since 2020. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) spoke about his opposition to coronavirus-related mandates in his state at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas on Nov. 6. Amid the surge, some in the state have argued that DeSantis, who recently signed multiple bills into law to curtail vaccine and mask mandates, has not done enough to help against omicron. Orange County, Fla., Mayor Jerry Demings, a Democrat, claimed at a news conference this week that counties have yet to receive funding for increased coronavirus testing during the holidays. He also questioned why DeSantis has been largely absent during the state's record-breaking period. ""We have not received any assistance from the state of Florida at our testing sites,"" he said on Tuesday. ""Our residents, all Florida residents, should be outraged and they should ask the question, 'Where is our state? Where is our governor? Where is Ron DeSantis now?'"" DeSantis, one of the most prominent Republican critics of President Joe Biden's handling of the pandemic, has not made a public appearance since a Dec. 17 news conference, according to Florida Politics. DeSantis also appeared on Fox News on Dec. 19, saying that he had yet to receive a coronavirus booster shot. ""I've done whatever I did, the normal shot, and that at the end of the day is people's individual decisions about what they want to do,"" the governor told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo at the time. Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, told The Washington Post on Thursday that omicron is responsible for most of the new cases in Florida, adding that many of the new infections appear to be ""asymptomatic or mild."" She noted how states such as California and New York are also breaking records for new infections, saying it is ""evident that the vaccine passports, mask mandates and other heavy-handed government interventions did not achieve their stated goals."" ""In Florida, we are continuing to emphasize the importance of early treatment and doing everything possible to expand access to clinically effective treatments,"" Pushaw said in a statement. ""Governor DeSantis is not imposing any mandates or lockdown policies that have already proven ineffective in other parts of the country."" More than 4,400 people in Florida are hospitalized with covid, including 498 in the intensive care unit. While the hospitalization rate has increased by more than 100% compared to last week, Pushaw argued that ""the percentage of cases requiring hospitalization as of now is lower overall than we saw with previous variants."" The spike in Florida comes as coronavirus cases are soaring nationwide, with the nation averaging about 240,000 new infections a day. Ahead of New Year's Eve, Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, has urged Americans to rethink any potential party plans and encouraged smaller gatherings to help prevent the spread of the virus. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Wednesday that hospitalizations remain ""comparatively low,"" noting that those totals tend to lag behind infections by roughly two weeks. But she emphasized that omicron appears to cause milder symptoms, especially for vaccinated people. In Florida, 63% of the population is vaccinated, which is slightly above the national rate of 62%. Since DeSantis's last appearances, cases have skyrocketed in Florida and across the country thanks to omicron, which is now the nation's dominant variant. The recent focus from the DeSantis administration has been on the U.S. government's pause on distributing monoclonal antibodies that have been used as treatment for many coronavirus patients who have not been vaccinated. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo recently accused the Biden administration of ""actively preventing"" the distribution of the monoclonal antibody treatments from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly. The government noted that the treatments were unlikely to be effective against omicron. In a Tuesday letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Ladapo wrote that the pause from the administration would cause an ""immediate and life-threatening shortage of treatment options."" DeSantis has touted monoclonal antibody treatments, specifically Regeneron, as an effective way to keep people out of the hospital. Many of the new cases are coming from South Florida, where the state's three most populous counties - Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach - have seen their case totals increase by close to 400% in recent days, according to the Miami Herald. Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist with the University of South Florida, told WPTV that omicron outpacing the delta variant could be cause for concern for the state's hospitals. It took more than a month for delta to average 21,000 daily cases. ""For omicron, that's happened in 12 days,"" Salemi said. Pushaw said that the Jackson Health System in Miami reported Thursday that more than half of its patients who tested positive for the virus were ""incidental positives"" - ""people who were admitted to the hospital for other reasons (not covid-19 symptoms) and incidentally tested positive upon admission."" More than 776,000 new coronavirus tests have been administered in Florida over the past seven days, the second-highest total in the nation, according to data tracked by The Post. Twenty-two percent of those who've tested were positive. Raul Pino, director of Florida Department of Health in Orange County, acknowledged the lack of resources for even more testing in the area. Not even adding more testing sites could prevent the department from being overwhelmed, he told the Associated Press. ""A lot of people are wanting to get tested,"" he said. Some on social media documented the long lines for in-person testing in the state. A video posted to Twitter by Brian Entin, a journalist with NewsNation Now, showed the miles-long line of cars waiting to enter Miami-Dade County's 24-hour testing site on Wednesday night. ""This is the wait before you even get into Tropical Park where you have to zig zag around cones before the testing area,"" he tweeted. Democrats and critics were quick to accuse DeSantis of being ""MIA."" Democratic State Sen. Annette Taddeo, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2022, shared a message she purportedly received from a friend about a difficult situation at a hospital in her district. ""And where's Ron DeSantis?"" she tweeted. On MSNBC, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who is also running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was asked by host Tiffany Cross on Wednesday if she knew why DeSantis had not made a public appearance during the holiday surge. ""I have no idea ... I haven't seen him since December 17,"" Fried said. ""I don't know where he is."" On Thursday, as DeSantis's name trended on Twitter, Pushaw tweeted that the governor ""has a wife and 3 kids ages 1-5, and it's not surprising if he wants to take a few days off at Christmas to spend time with his family, especially as his wife is battling cancer."" ""I don't criticize Biden for going to Rehoboth Beach all week, right?"" she wrote. Related Content This tree has stood here for 500 years. Will it be sold for $17,500?

12/31/2021,"Mercedes Benz has become the latest company to face backlash in China for allegedly perpetuating Western stereotypes about Chinese people in a recent advertisement.

Driving the news: The critical response reportedly blew up on Monday after the German carmaker posted a video that featured a model with “slanted eyes.” The ad was particularly criticized for the makeup it had used on the model, which critics found to be “ugly” and “offensive.”
 The state-run Global Times claims the image of a Chinese person with “slanted eyes,” as well as braids, is a Western stereotype of the Chinese from the 19th century. The outlet further explains that the stereotype is not “an objective description… but a label for East Asians” predicated on Western supremacy. “The premise is that Chinese cannot let the West shape our aesthetics. For those malicious slander, we should maintain sufficient vigilance and counter-attack,” one Weibo user wrote, as per Global Times. Mercedes Benz, which published the video on Weibo on Dec. 25, appears to have deleted it in the wake of backlash. The company has not released a statement in relation to the matter as of this writing. 


The big picture: Mercedes Benz is the latest business to be accused of depicting Chinese people unflatteringly by consumers in the country. Last week, ads from a local snack company called Three Squirrels drew flak for similar reasons after also featuring a model with “slanted eyes.”
 Three Squirrels was forced to apologize; however, the model in question pushed back against the vitriol by asking, “Am I disqualified to be Chinese just because I have small eyes?” Dior found itself in a similar controversy in November when a Chinese photographer whose work was featured in the brand’s Shanghai exhibition provoked accusations that her work perpetuated a “Western aesthetic.” Other international brands that have faced scrutiny in China include H&M, Nike and Zara. One of the largest cases to date involved Dolce & Gabbana, which most recently faced a $660 million defamation lawsuit.

12/31/2021,"Adam McKay’s newest movie Don't Look Up (now on Netflix), starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett, tells the fictional story of a comet set to destroy Earth in six months — but could that really ever happen? Dr. Amy Mainzer, an astronomer and advisor on the movie, said it’s “really, really unlikely.” “The good news is a really major event like what's portrayed in the movie, we know that, that can't happen very regularly…because we're here,” Mainzer explained to Yahoo Canada. “If that sort of thing happened on a regular basis in our time span, compared to the span that humans have been on the planet, well we wouldn't be here."" “The last such major event was the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. So we know that this is a very infrequent event, that said, smaller events can happen more frequently. So that's why we go out and we look for the objects and try to figure out where they are.” Mainzer and her team actually discovered Comet NEOWISE in 2020, the brightest comet in the northern hemisphere since Hale-Bopp in 1997. While Mainzer started working on Don’t Look Up before NEOWISE was discovered, some aspects of the comet in the movie were modelled after this particular real-life comet. “It had a pretty good set of orbital characteristics for what we were looking for, for the movie,” Mainzer said.”In fact, I even think I took some of the discovery images of comet NEOWISE.” “I looked at a bunch of different comet orbits and kind of picked one that I thought best represented what we were looking for in terms of the plot.” The movie starts when astronomy graduate student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) discovers a massive comet, under the supervision of her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio). While there’s excitement about the discovery, it turns out that it’s on a direct course to collide with Earth in six months, which would destroy the planet. Kate and Randall try to alert the public and government officials about the severity of this comet, but are just met with pushback, and even comet deniers who spread misinformation about the severity of the situation. Mainzer worked with both Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio on making their characters as authentic as possible, but specifically, Mainzer had several detailed conversations with Lawrence about being a woman in the male-dominated field of science and astronomy. “It's a historical fact that this field has been extremely male-dominated throughout most of its existence, and it is changing, more and more women are getting into the hard sciences, which is great to see, but we still have a really long way to go,” she said. “The movie, I think, touches on this in a couple of important ways, there are a couple of scenes where you can just sort of see Kate's face fall when she's not acknowledged for her important work in a couple of spots.” Ultimately, Mainzer hopes that people who watch Don’t Look Up will understand that scientists are “knocking [themselves] out” trying to bring their research and knowledge to the public. “The movie, hopefully, is a plea to make decisions based on the tools of science,” she said. “Science-based decision making is really at the core of this movie and the future, how we live as humanity on this planet, is very much up to us.” “So if we make good science-based decisions, we can avoid the worst outcomes, we can make them less bad. So let's do that.” In this time of the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, in particular, Mainzer said it is “absolutely frustrating” when scientists are sounding the alarm bells, but are met with pushback and counter arguments based on misinformation. “We are kind of hardwired…to fear the thing that's right in front of us, it's hard to sometimes grasp the immediacy of a problem with a gas that's invisible, or a virus that you can't see with your own eyes,” Mainzer explained. “Yet, it doesn't make it any less real and that's why I think we really want scientists to be seen as human beings.” “We do science because we love it and I hope that people take away from this is that we are trying to bring you the best and most accurate information that we can, even if the news isn't always good.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,Could a comet really destroy Earth like in 'Don't Look Up' on Netflix?

12/31/2021,"Creators who are a part of YouTube's Partner Program can monetize their videos with ads. YouTubers can make thousands of dollars each month from the program. Eight creators with 1 million subscribers or more shared how much money they make on YouTube. This is the latest installment of Insider's YouTube money logs, where creators break down how much they earn. Surpassing the 1 million subscriber mark on YouTube is a huge milestone, and, in practical terms, it often means a creator can earn a full-time living from the platform. YouTube creators earn money a number of ways, but money from the ads that play in their videos usually constitutes a big chunk of their income. Andrei Jikh, a finance YouTuber with 1.7 million subscribers, has earned $1.6 million in ad revenue in less than three years, for example. Read a full breakdown of how much Jikh has made this year so far and how he's done it. Another YouTuber, lifestyle creator Tiffany Ma, earns up to $11,500 a month from ads on her videos, she told Insider. Read a full breakdown of how much Ma money earns per month and how she grew her channel. To start earning money directly from YouTube, creators must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past year. Once they reach that threshold, they can apply for YouTube's Partner Program, which allows them to start monetizing their channels through ads, subscriptions, and channel memberships. For every 1,000 ad views, advertisers pay a certain rate to YouTube. YouTube takes 45% of the revenue, and the creator gets the rest. Two key metrics for earning money on YouTube are the CPM rate, or how much money advertisers pay YouTube per 1,000 ad views, and RPM rate, which is how much revenue a creator earns per every 1,000 video views after YouTube's cut. Some subjects, like personal finance and cryptocurrency, can boost a creator's ad rate by attracting lucrative advertisers. ""The ad revenue for crypto is a lot higher than anything else finance-related, like credit cards or banks,"" Jikh told Insider. While Ma's lifestyle content makes less money, she's perfected a strategy to maximize payout. ""To really optimize your audience, I think YouTubers should definitely put three to four ads within a video,"" Ma said. Many of these creators make money outside YouTube as well. Graham Stephan, who has 3.4 million subscribers, launched his own coffee brand, for instance. (Read how he did it, what it cost, and how much he's made in our interview with Stephan.) But the money made directly from YouTube forms a key pillar of many creators' incomes. Here are 8 exclusive earnings breakdowns in which YouTubers with 1 million followers or more share exactly how much they earn from the platform: Nate O'Brien has 1.1 million subscribers and films videos about personal-finance Kevin David has 1.3 million subscribers and films videos about ecommerce  Marina Mogilko has 1.3 million subscribers and films business-related videos Michael Groth has 1.5 million subscribers and films Pokémon-related videos Shelby Church has 1.6 million subscribers and films tech and lifestyle videos Andrei Jikh has 1.7 million subscribers and films videos about cryptocurrency  Tiffany Ma has 1.8 million subscribers and films lifestyle videos Graham Stephan has 3.4 million subscribers and films personal-finance videos Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/Business Insider,How much money YouTubers with 1 million subscribers make,https://news.yahoo.com/much-money-youtubers-1-million-124853437.html
12/31/2021,"The Los Angeles police officer who fatally shot a 14-year-old girl as she tried on Christmas dresses has been identified as a veteran Black cop who, before killing the unarmed teenager, tried to build his brand as a community advocate and reformer. He also launched an apparel line called “Use of Force Fitness” but dissolved it in December 2020, after months of unprecedented protests against police violence across America. William Dorsey Jones Jr., 42, was formally identified by his lawyer in The New York Times. Attempts to reach Jones for comment this week were unsuccessful, and his attorney, Leslie Wilcox, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Valentina Orellana-Peralta and her mom, who had recently moved to the U.S. from Chile, were in a changing room when cops stormed a Burlington Coat Factory in North Hollywood on Dec. 23 to confront a man who was swinging a bike lock at women, bloodying at least one of them. That cops opened fire in spite of the suspect not being armed with a gun quickly served to revive long-standing tensions between the LAPD and communities of color, as well as the debate over police use of force nationally. Surveillance footage and body-cam video released by the LAPD shows one officer firing three shots from a rifle in the direction of suspect Daniel Elena-Lopez, 24. Elena-Lopez was killed, but a bullet also penetrated a dry wall, piercing Valentina in her chest. Soledad Peralta said at a Tuesday press conference that her daughter locked the changing room door as the chaos unfolded “to try to protect us,” and that the pair hugged and prayed until they “felt an explosion that threw us both to the ground.” Peralta looked down to see her daughter convulsing, with white powder coming out of her body. “She died in my arms, and there was nothing I could do,” she said. Mom Says LAPD Left Teen Daughter to Die After Horrific Clothing Store Shooting Social media accounts, now either locked or removed, and past interviews reveal that prior to the disastrous incident, Jones was determined to position himself as a bridge between police and communities of color. “I’m a black man, I’m the father of a black son, I’ve been the vict[im] of racism,” he wrote in one now-removed tweet. “I’m the LAPD. I have the power & determination to affect CHANGE in the community. Im a proud member of the #thinblueline & #blacklivesmatter.” Cached posts on his vanished Twitter page show him promoting a nonprofit, Officers for Change, and related charitable activities, while another now-inaccessible account indicates he coached a local high-school football team. He appears to have closed Officers for Change’s Facebook and Twitter accounts, and substantially dismantled its website. But archived material shows it plugged itself as “a 501(c)(3) nonprofit org. on a mission to positively impact the lives of those living in At-Risk & Low Income communities” with a “Sworn platform to Educate, Inspire, Mentor & Motivate."" The Kentucky native spoke of his experiences and interests in a now-deleted December 2020 article on the website of his alma mater, the University of Louisville. “Being an African American police officer and from Louisville has given me a very unique perspective,” he said. The article reported that Jones moved to L.A. in 2006 to pursue a career in entertainment but instead became a cop, spending eight years on patrol and then three years as a community relations officer. Public records also suggest he may have sought additional avenues to profit off his policing career: Business, trademark, and website information The Daily Beast uncovered show Jones launched an athletic apparel line in 2019 called “Use of Force Fitness.” In recent days, Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin led a chorus of residents and activists calling the LAPD’s use of force in the deadly incident unjustified. “Police gave no verbal command and didn’t try to to [sic] de-escalate. The suspect didn’t have a gun and wasn’t advancing at officers or potential victims. Police opened fire in a shopping mall with people in it,” he wrote on Twitter. Bystanders who called 911 about Elena-Lopez offered contradictory information. One caller incorrectly said he was armed with a gun and had fired shots. Tom Saggau, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing Jones, said officers went in expecting an active-shooter situation. “You’re trained to enter the facility and try to eliminate the threat so that more people aren’t shot. That’s the mindset as they’re responding to that call,” he told The Daily Beast. He said Jones was “absolutely devastated” by the outcome. However, Valentina’s family, which is being represented by high-profile civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, demanded accountability on Tuesday, and claimed officers left Valentina to die alone on the floor as they evacuated others from the store. In a statement Monday, LAPD Chief Michel R. Moore said he was “profoundly sorry” for her death and promised a “thorough, complete and transparent investigation.” The California Attorney General’s Office and California Department of Justice also launched separate probes.

12/31/2021,"No in the New Year is Yahoo Life’s series about the power of saying no, establishing boundaries and prioritizing your own physical and mental health. For some people who imbibe, the champagne toast at midnight on New Year’s Eve is the last drop of alcohol they typically touch for the next month. That’s the official start of Dry January, an initiative that was originally started in 2012 by Alcohol Change UK in order to get people to see the mental, physical, and even financial benefits of living without alcohol. Yet most people who participate in Dry January have no intention of quitting alcohol for good — completing the month-long break is the goal. However, if the point of Dry January is to feel better and be overall healthier, is 30 days (or in January's case, 31) even enough? Unfortunately, the experts Yahoo Life spoke with all agreed that 30 days isn’t enough time to reset your body after years of drinking regularly. However, there may be other surprising benefits of trying out sobriety in the short term. According to Dr. George F. Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, participating in Dry January can be a great way to learn more about your drinking habits, which can help you make healthier choices moving forward. “There are many potential benefits to taking a break from alcohol if done wisely,” Koob tells Yahoo Life. “At the very least, taking a break from alcohol gives a person a chance to evaluate their relationship with alcohol and cultivate alternatives for relaxing, socializing, coping and other reasons why people drink."" It can also shed light on how drinking alcohol affects your physical and mental health. ""Some people might discover that their alcohol use was irritating their stomach, disrupting their sleep, contributing to weight gain, interfering with their morning exercise routine, affecting their relationships, or that they relied more on alcohol for stress relief than they thought,"" says Koob. ""Waking up without the fatigue, malaise and other common symptoms of hangovers could potentially improve a person’s quality of life. And for some people the financial savings could be substantial.” In terms of purely the physical results of Dry January, heavy drinkers may find they see the biggest change, Dr. Tyler Oesterle, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Health System’s Foundation Centers, tells Yahoo Life. “Alcohol is toxic to a lot of organ systems in the body,"" Oesterle says. ""It can affect the liver, pancreas, heart and the nervous system, just to name a few. One month of abstinence, if any of these organ systems are compromised, could improve acute symptoms. For example, if individuals are heavy drinkers and have suffered some liver damage, then abnormalities in their liver enzymes can improve over the first 30 days."" Oesterle adds: ""There may also be other improvements for heavy drinkers in the first 30 days depending on the physical impact of their alcohol use. If an individual is a light drinker, the one month abstinence can be used to establish a new abstinence-based habit. However, it is not really enough time to make any significant difference physically for light drinkers.” Click and scroll in the window below to explore the body after 30 days without alcohol. Elective sobriety coach Amanda Kuda agrees that, while 30 days may not be enough time to make any meaningful physical changes, it can be a great start for someone who is sober curious. For those who might worry about the stigma of giving up alcohol, Dry January offers a built-in excuse to be sober, especially after what is most likely the “most intense drinking period of the year,” she says. Kuda explains that “Dry January is a socially acceptable way to take a step back from alcohol, in a world that’s obsessed with booze. If you live in a place where alcohol is something you’re expected to participate in, Dry January is a perfect opportunity for you to take a step back without anyone questioning your motives. It offers you the opportunity to take a step back and say, ‘Is this something I want to explore further?’ I see 30 days as a great catapult to a longer term change, as well as a short-term break for your body.” While she notes that people who believe they may have an alcohol dependency should consult with a medical professional before going cold turkey, even for 30 days, overall Kuda thinks Dry January can be “a great opportunity to be observant about our behavior around alcohol.” It might even encourage you to continue the sober experiment past January 31. “Anyone can do anything for 30 days,” Kuda says, “but that real change in your relationship with alcohol is when you can extend it and see how it goes longer term.” For those who are looking forward to or are curious about trying out alcohol-free living, even in the short-term, it’s now easier than ever, Kuda says. “There are so many amazing non-alcoholic alternatives that you probably love to drink right now,"" Kuda says. ""There are non-alcoholic wines, spirits, beers, that come pretty close to the real thing. If you’re looking for something special to enjoy, there are now so many options to make you feel included.""

12/31/2021,"A Pennsylvania mother is warning other parents to be vigilant about monitoring their children’s social media use after she says her daughter died attempting the “Blackout Challenge.” Nyla Anderson’s family found her unconscious in her bedroom in Chester, Pennsylvania, earlier this month. Family members rushed the 10-year-old to the hospital but she was pronounced dead soon after arriving. During the “Blackout Challenge” participants perform some kind of auto-asphyxiation until they pass out. The challenge dates back prior to TikTok but the app has fueled a resurgence of the challenge. Users gain millions of views recording themselves taking part in challenges on TikTok. Nyla is the fifth child to die attempting the challenge this year. Oxygen deprivation can cause cardiac arrest, organ and brain damage or death. In March, 12-year-old Joshua Haileyesus died after spending 19 days in a Colorado hospital His family believes he accidentally choked himself with shoelaces while attempting the challenge. “She was a butterfly,” Nyla’s mother, Tawainna Anderson, told ABC7. “She was everything. She was a happy child.” “Make sure you check your kids’ phones,” Anderson added. “You never know what you might find on their phones. You wouldn’t think 10-year-olds would try this. They’re trying because they’re kids and they don’t know better.” Elizabeth Wood, a licensed clinical social worker at Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware where Nyla recieved treatment, told “Today” that the girl has a history of viewing the challenge on social media. There are multiple variations of the challenge, which sometimes includes the use of something to cause choking or strangulation to stop the flow of oxygen. Videos of people participating in the challenge on TikTok have been removed. A search for the term “Blackout Challenge” on the app does not yield results. The social platform told The New York Post in a statement, “This disturbing ‘challenge,’ which people seem to learn about from sources other than TikTok, long predates our platform and has never been a TikTok trend.” The statement continued, “We remain vigilant in our commitment to user safety and would immediately remove related content if found. Our deepest sympathies go out to the family for their tragic loss.” Nyla’s family is mourning over the child’s sudden death. “She was everything. She was a happy child,” Anderson’s mom said. “This is a pain that won’t go away. It’s at the top of my throat. I am so hurt.” The “Blackout Challenge” is not the first dangerous trend to be associated with TikTok. Viral videos of people stacking milk crates and walking across them spread rapidly on the app in August before the platform banned the challenge. After people were hospitalized with serious injuries after attempting the challenge, doctors warned against taking part in the challenge.

12/31/2021,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China will take ""drastic measures"" if Taiwan makes moves towards formal independence, a Beijing official warned on Wednesday, adding that Taiwan's provocations and outside meddling could intensify next year. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and in the past two years has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claim, fuelling anger in Taipei and concern in Washington. China was willing to try its utmost to seek peaceful reunification with Taiwan but would act if any red lines on independence were crossed, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, told a media briefing. ""If separatist forces in Taiwan seeking independence provoke, exert force or even break through any red line, we will have to take drastic measures,"" Ma said. In a statement late on Wednesday, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to ""seriously reflect on its work towards Taiwan and make correct judgement on the situation"". The Council reiterated its call for dialogue on an equal basis and said it has maintained a policy of ""not provoking"" to safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait and in the region. Taiwan has emerged as a key factor in strained relations between Taiwan and the United States, the island's most important international backer and arms supplier despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan says it is an independent country and vows to defend its freedom and democracy. China regularly describes the island as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States. Ma said provocation by pro-independence forces and ""external intervention"" could grow ""sharper and more intense"" in coming months. ""Next year, the Taiwan Strait situation will become more complex and severe,"" he said. Beijing has sent repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait in recent months to pressure Taiwan. It has said it will not give in to threats. While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who established the People's Republic of China.

12/31/2021,"I tested positive for COVID-19 in December after testing positive for the virus in November 2020. My symptoms were mild both times, but the differences came in testing and the reaction of others. I didn't think I could get COVID-19 twice. But I couldn't have been more wrong and spent Christmas experiencing symptoms, scrounging for tests, and figuring out how to deal with COVID-19 all over again. On December 23, I tested positive for COVID-19 just 13 months after first testing positive for the virus in November 2020 and 9 months after receiving both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. After testing positive for COVID-19 the first time, my world stopped. But I knew what I had to do to isolate and quarantine. I was living with my parents at the time and retreated to my bedroom for a strict 14 days, having meals delivered and emerging, with a mask, only to use the bathroom. My parents even fled the house for two weeks when my sibling tested positive in early November. My symptoms were fairly mild, consisting of fatigue, chills, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell. Still, calls to friends and family members yielded gasps and extreme concern. While I felt fine, the knowledge that I had a virus inside of me that had killed more than 1 million people around the world weighed heavily on me. And as someone who is considered high risk, there was always the worry that even if I felt OK in the moment, things could get worse. The 14 days passed slowly, but after my isolation and recovery, the pandemic seemed over for me. I didn't think I could contract the virus again. Then I did, and my experience with COVID-19 the second time could not have been more different. On December 20, I felt a tickle in my throat that I could tell was the start of something bigger. I thought it was just a cold, given my recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, but decided to get tested in advance of Christmas. The testing apparatus in New York had gone from stellar to abysmal seemingly overnight. All of my go-to testing sites I tried to use had been overrun and people on social media were reporting that wait times soared to more than three hours at some locations. Result times have also been markedly longer at some locations, I've found. Since testing sites were proving slow and unreliable, my first stop was a CVS Pharmacy to buy an at-home test, even though I thought it was unlikely that I contracted the virus again. But a run on COVID-19 tests meant that CVS was sold out. My local independent pharmacy, to my surprise, had the tests in stock. Store clerks were calling customers to tell them about the newly arrived supply of tests. It cost $30 to purchase a two-pack of rapid antigen tests, and I took the first test as soon as I got home. The result was negative. The next day, I woke up and signed on to work feeling lethargic and fatigued, in addition to the sore throat, but I still tested negative. I was also intermittently coughing up phlegm, but the cough didn't persist. I signed off early as I felt weak and rushed to lie down. I didn't run out to get another COVID-19 test because of the negative result I had received the night prior. The next day, a live-in family member called to tell us she had tested positive, even after testing positive in 2020, and we had all been exposed. I bought two more packs of tests from the same pharmacy, which had increased the price from $30 to $35. My 15-minute test came back positive. I ripped open the second test and 10 more nostril swabs revealed the same result. But unlike November 2020, I didn't know what to do. I didn't immediately know what the quarantine requirement was for a vaccinated person, I didn't know if there were any exceptions if that person had COVID-19 before, and I didn't know what resources were available to me. My immediate family, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, instantly came to terms with the fact that if I had the virus and they likely had it as well. They didn't feel the need to stay away from me. That was the most confusing to me: They seemed all right with contracting the same virus they were all afraid of just last year. Calls that I made to friends and family either resulted in surprise that someone could get COVID-19 twice or them telling me that they had tested positive themselves. Getting COVID-19 in New York City had seemingly gone from taboo to inescapable. Canceling Christmas was not on the table in my house since we were all exposed to the virus. I wasn't opposed to isolating for the holiday, but we resolved to quickly inform all of our planned guests so that they could make their own decisions on whether they would come. Some of our guests canceled, understandably, but others came as if nothing had happened. I spent Christmas Day, about five days after my first symptom, wearing a mask and staying away from visitors who were also undeterred by the COVID-19 case in the house. I was mostly able to stay 6 feet away from others but declined to participate in some festivities and took my meals in a different part of the house. My family members didn't treat my COVID-19 diagnosis as a threat at all, and that was something I couldn't fully comprehend. Even if the symptoms were mild, I wondered why anybody would want to increase their chances of getting sick. ""Come downstairs and take your mask off,"" one family member who had also contracted the virus in 2020 said, despite the fact that he obviously could contract the virus again, too. I'll end isolation soon. The symptoms weren't life-threatening and were no worse than a mild cold. The worst of my symptoms ended up being a sore throat and fatigue for a few days — though each person experiences this virus in their own way. I didn't even fully lose my sense of taste. Contracting COVID-19 is not the same as it was in 2020, and we have the tools to help ensure that many who contract the virus have a mild experience. I credit my quick recovery with being vaccinated and having natural immunity from my first round of COVID-19. If my recovery hadn't been quick, I'm heartened by the fact that new drugs are coming to market that can help reduce symptoms. I hope that, for me, the pandemic is finally over. But I've been wrong before. The experience of the author may be different from the experience of others who contract COVID-19 in the severity, type, and duration of symptoms.

12/31/2021,"By Nancy Lapid    (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.    Omicron cannot escape body's second-line defense    A key part of the immune system's second-line defense - its T cells - are highly effective at recognizing and attacking the Omicron variant, thereby preventing most infections from progressing to critical illness, a new study shows.    Omicron's mutations help it escape from antibodies, the body's first line of defense against infection. Researchers have speculated that other components of the immune response would still target Omicron, but there has been no proof until now.    In test tube experiments, researchers in South Africa exposed copies of the virus to T cells from volunteers who had received vaccines from Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer/BioNTech or who had not been vaccinated but had developed their own T cells after infection with an earlier version of the coronavirus.    ""Despite Omicron's extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, the majority of T cell response, induced by vaccination or natural infection, cross-recognizes the variant,"" the researchers reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.    ""Well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron is likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19,"" which supports what South African doctors had initially suspected when most patients with Omicron infections did not become seriously ill, they said.    The ""T"" stands for thymus, the organ in which the cells' final stage of development occurs.    Boosters reduce risk of Omicron household transmission    The odds that vaccinated people will catch the virus if a household member becomes infected are nearly three to four times higher with Omicron than with Delta, but booster doses reduce that risk, new findings suggest.    Researchers analyzed transmission data collected from nearly 12,000 infected households in Denmark, including 2,225 households with an Omicron infection. Overall, there were 6,397 secondary infections in the week after the first infection in the house. After accounting for other risk factors, the rate of person-to-person spread of the virus to fully vaccinated people was roughly 2.6 times higher in Omicron households than in Delta households, the researchers reported on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Booster-vaccinated people were nearly 3.7 times more likely to get infected in the Omicron households than in the Delta households, they found.    Looking only at Omicron households, however, booster-vaccinated people were 56% less likely to become infected compared to vaccinated people who had not received a booster. And overall, when booster-vaccinated people were the ones who first brought home the virus, they were less likely than unvaccinated and vaccinated-but-not-boosted people to pass it to others.    Click for a Reuters graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3c7R3Bl on vaccines in development.    (Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Editing by Howard Goller) ",Health/Reuters,Omicron cannot escape T cells; boosters protect households from Omicron,https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-cannot-escape-t-cells-202413250.html
12/31/2021,"Following Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction, accusers said they hoped more Epstein associates would be brought to justice. But prosecutors won't charge Jeffrey Epstein's associate Lesley Groff, her lawyers told Insider. Accusers filed civil lawsuits alleging Groff facilitated Epstein's sexual abuse. Those suits have been withdrawn. Federal prosecutors have no plans to bring charges against Lesley Groff, an associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who was reportedly under criminal investigation for sex trafficking, according to her attorneys. Groff's lawyers, Michael Bachner and Jon Whitcomb, said Thursday in a statement provided to Insider that prosecutors in Manhattan would not file an indictment against their client. ""After a more than two-year investigation by the Department of Justice into Jeffrey Epstein's conduct, which included lengthy interviews of witnesses and a thorough review of relevant communications, we have been informed that no criminal charges will be brought against Lesley Groff,"" Bachner and Whitcomb said. The attorneys added that Groff ""never witnessed anything improper or illegal."" The New York Times first reported in 2019 that federal prosecutors were considering sex-trafficking charges against Groff, who worked as an executive assistant for Epstein for nearly 20 years. A spokesperson for Groff told Insider that she was cooperating in the investigation. Groff was one of four Epstein employees named in a non-prosecution agreement the financier signed with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007. The agreement, which has been widely criticized, allowed Epstein to serve a lenient sentence in Palm Beach County jail in Florida on prostitution solicitation charges rather than face a federal sex-trafficking indictment. The document also said that federal prosecutors would not bring criminal charges against Groff and the other women, who it described as ""potential co-conspirators."" Federal agents arrested Epstein in August 2019 following an investigation from Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown that exposed the scope of the agreement. He died in his jail cell while awaiting trial. In 2020, the FBI arrested Ghislaine Maxwell on suspicion of sex-trafficking girls to Epstein and sexually abusing them herself. Prior to her conviction, Maxwell argued that the same non-prosecution agreement protected her from all federal prosecution. US District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversaw her case, rejected that argument. Bachner had previously indicated that Groff would avoid prosecution, telling Brown for her book ""Perversion of Justice"" that federal prosecutors ""do not intend to bring criminal charges against Lesley Groff."" A representative for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is conducting the investigation into the conduct of Epstein and his associates, declined to comment to Insider on the decision of whether to charge Groff. A jury convicted Maxwell at trial on Wednesday. Maria Farmer, whose sister Annie Farmer testified against Maxwell at the trial, told Insider that while her family was ""elated by the verdict,"" the case was ""only the tip of the iceberg."" ""As thrilled as I am by this arrest, it is only the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""There should be many to follow."" Virginia Giuffre, who has also accused Epstein, Maxwell, and other associates of sexual misconduct, also said Wednesday that other people in their orbit must face justice. ""I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served,"" she said. ""Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be."" Groff's name came up several times in Maxwell's trial. One woman, who testified under the pseudonym ""Kate"" and said Epstein sexually abused her for years, said that Groff was one of Epstein's office assistants who booked flights for her to travel to his residences in New York, Palm Beach, and the US Virgin Islands. Larry Visoski and David Rodgers, two of Epstein's longtime private jet pilots, both said Groff was a secretary who worked for Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, and who scheduled flights for Epstein. According to her attorneys, Groff's job included ""making appointments for Epstein as directed by him, taking his messages, and setting up high-level meetings with CEOs, business executives, scientists, politicians, celebrities, charitable organizations, and universities."" In a 2005 interview with the New York Times, Groff described herself as an extension of Epstein's brain. ""It comes down to the bond,"" she told the Times. ""I know what he is thinking and I know when I need to be fast. It's a nice roll we are on."" In the same article, Epstein described Groff as so valuable that, when she became pregnant in 2004, he paid for a full-time nanny and brought her a Mercedes-Benz so that she could keep working for him. ""There is no way that I could lose Lesley to motherhood,"" Epstein told the Times. Civil lawsuits filed against Groff, all of which have since been dropped, depict her as one of Epstein's enablers. One lawsuit, filed in October by an anonymous ""Jane Doe,"" alleged Groff ""facilitated Epstein's trafficking and sexual abuse of Jane, including by purchasing plane tickets, sending money, making appointments, and sending various communications."" The suit says Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York, France, the US Virgin Islands, and Florida between 2017 and 2019, up until Epstein was arrested. Groff also paid Jane cash after sexual encounters, the lawsuit alleges. Jane and Groff jointly agreed to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit with respect to Groff on Wednesday night, shortly after the verdict against Maxwell. The lawsuit is still pending with respect to allegations it made against Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, the executors of Epstein's estate, who have both denied any wrongdoing. An attorney for Jane didn't immediately respond Thursday to Insider's request for comment. Bachner and Whitcomb said they were ""not surprised"" the case was dropped. ""Our hearts truly break for any person victimized by Epstein but the truth is — Lesley had no knowledge of and no participation in any of the illegal conduct alleged in the lawsuit,"" the attorneys said in a statement. At least two other accusers, Sarah Ransome and Jennifer Araoz, previously brought civil lawsuits against Groff. Both women dropped their litigation once they accepted money from the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program, which was established by Epstein's estate after his death to pay compensation to his victims. But as Insider previously reported, the program required claimants to abandon civil claims against the estate and Epstein's former employees, including Groff and Maxwell. Groff denied wrongdoing in Ransome and Araoz's lawsuits as well. Araoz's lawsuit had accused Groff of scheduling ""massages"" with Epstein, who sexually abused Araoz on those encounters. ""Participation in the Victims' Compensation Program requires permanent discontinuance of all legal actions against former employees of Jeffrey Epstein, including Ms. Groff,"" Araoz's attorney, Eric Lerner, told the New York Daily News at the time. ""My client maintains the truth and veracity of all of the allegations in her pleadings.""

12/31/2021,"Physicians around the country facing the latest surge of Covid-19 cases, driven by the highly contagious omicron variant, have a straightforward message based on what they're seeing in their emergency rooms: Vaccinations and boosters are having a positive effect. “The general trend that I’m seeing is, if you’re boosted and you get Covid, you really just at worst end up with bad cold symptoms. It’s not like before where you were coughing, couldn’t say sentences and were short of breath,” said Dr. Matthew Bai, an emergency medicine physician at Mount Sinai Queens in New York City. “There are obviously exceptions like if you start out with a very weakened immune system, your immune response won’t be as strong with a booster. But in your average person, a booster’s definitely going to make a difference is what I’m seeing,” he said. Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of critical care services and the Covid-19 unit at Houston’s United Memorial Medical Center, said of the roughly 50 patients admitted to the hospital’s Covid unit in the last four weeks, 100 percent of them were unvaccinated. He said patients who needed to be admitted typically have “shortness of breath, high fevers, being dehydrated like crazy.” He said those who are unvaccinated also “have more illness. What I mean by more illness is more pneumonia, not just a little bit of pneumonia, you have a lot of pneumonia.” “The people that are coming in unvaccinated have a much larger burden of illness in the lungs than those who are vaccinated,” he said. Meanwhile, those who had received the booster shot were “almost back to normal” within several days, he said. Those who had not received the booster have tended to “still feel sick after a week, a week and a half or so,” he added. Patients who have received the booster shot may still have symptoms such as a sore throat, a lot of fatigue and muscle pain, said Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Those who are vaccinated but have not got the booster “looked worse, they looked like they felt pretty darn bad. But, again, they didn’t need to be hospitalized,” he said. ""I’m not seeing people who have got two doses and a booster and are coming in profoundly short of breath,"" he said. ""It’s just not happening."" Those who are vaccinated but have not got a booster have shown symptoms such as more coughing, more fever and more fatigue than those who had received a booster, he said. Meanwhile, Spencer said almost every patient he has seen who needed to be admitted was unvaccinated. “We’ve known that there are multiple presentations of this disease, that hasn’t changed. What has changed is that we know that those who are vaccinated are significantly less likely to end up seeing me in the hospital and needing to be admitted. That’s for certain,” he said. The new omicron variant continues to spread rapidly in the United States, making up about 58 percent of all new Covid cases for the week ending Dec. 25, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early evidence suggests that for most people, at least for those who are up to date on their Covid vaccines, omicron appears less likely to cause severe illness. A small study from the CDC published Tuesday suggested people who had Covid and are later reinfected with omicron may experience fewer symptoms than they did during their initial bout with the virus. And last week, reports out of the United Kingdom found that people who were infected with omicron in November and December were about two-thirds less likely to be hospitalized, compared with the delta variant. Physicians still stressed the importance of getting the vaccine and getting a booster, even if omicron appears less likely to lead to severe illness than delta. “Especially for those that are above 50-55, anyone with underlying medical conditions, we know that it can decrease the likelihood of you needing to be hospitalized with severe Covid,” Spencer said. For those who are younger or without underlying medical conditions, he said, “if you can prevent infections in younger folks, you can hopefully prevent infections in older folks, their grandparents, their parents or people that they see and mingle with, especially around the holidays.” “So, I think from an infection prevention and control standpoint, getting a booster dose in younger folks, in addition to the benefit in terms of severe disease, is quite important,” he said.",Health/NBC News,Front-line workers describe symptoms they've observed in latest Covid wave,https://news.yahoo.com/front-line-physicians-describe-vaccination-105910656.html

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. Forgetting where you put something or a failing to recall a person’s name can happen to anyone. However it becomes much more distressing when frequent memory loss begins to affect our daily lives and in some cases, can eventually cause us to lose our independence. While impaired memory could be the result of infection, depression or anxiety or other medical conditions, it may also be due to dementia.  Impaired memory loss may be due to dementia, which impacts more than half a million Canadians and is expected to nearly double by 2030, according to the Alzheimer Society of Canada.  Dementia is not a disease, but a general term used to refer to disorders that cause progressive loss of cognitive functioning, which means it affects your way of thinking, remembering and reasoning. Many people who are diagnosed with dementia can also experience changes in their mood and personality. More than 500,000 Canadians live with dementia or Alzheimer's disease (a form of dementia). As our population ages, experts project the number of people living with some from of dementia to be as high as 930,000 by 2030.  Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that primarily or secondarily affect the brain. Although they are often used interchangeably, Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. According to the World Health Organization saying it contributes to 60-70% of dementia cases. Many people use the terms ""dementia"" and ""Alzheimer's"" interchangeably, but in reality Alzheimers is the cause and dementia is the effect. Stroke, head injuries and even Parkinson’s disease are also causes of dementia. According to experts, the most common symptom of dementia is short-term memory loss. This includes forgetting something that happened or was said within the last 10-15 minutes, repeating oneself and asking the same questions. Dr. Andrew Frank, a cognitive neurologist at the Bruyere Memory Program at Ottawa’s Elisabeth Bruyere Hospital, lists other symptoms as deterioration in language, words and judgement. The odd forgetfulness of a word or name that comes back to you later is normal, especially as we age or if we are stressed or sleep deprived. It’s when the memories are not coming back at all that's a signal of a much deeper problem. “One of the rules of thumb is that if you’re realizing your own memory problem, that’s a good sign because you’re remembering you’re forgetting,” Frank explains in an interview with Yahoo Canada. “It’s more serious if you are not realizing that you’re forgetting, meaning you’re forgetting that you’re forgetting and that can be a sign of something more serious like dementia.” If you notice a change in a family member's ability to recall information, repeating themselves, becoming confused, struggling with their vocabulary or completing tasks that would otherwise seem easy (like shopping or driving to a familiar location), consider accompanying them to an appointment with their family doctor as soon as possible. A doctor can perform memory tests and others to measure blood pressure and check levels of various chemicals, hormones and vitamins in the body. The family physician can refer the patient to a memory clinic as well, where more testing can be done to determine if the diagnosis is dementia. When it comes to dementia there are some risks that we can and can’t control. Factors that we can’t control that increase our risk of developing dementia are age (one in 20 Canadians over 65 have Alzheimer’s disease), genetics and sex; women have a greater chance of developing dementia than men.  The good news is that there are things we can control that can help minimize our risk of developing dementia. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet are both recommended. Making sure you’re physically active everyday is important and Frank insists exercising your brain is equally as crucial through hobbies and puzzles.  Eliminating smoking and excessive alcohol consumption while adhering to a wholesome diet like the Mediterranean diet can help keep your body and mind in shape. “Another strategy is to watch out for high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes and to treat those because any factors that prevent heart attack and stroke will also prevent or delay dementia,” Franks says. While there is no cure for dementia, early detection can be beneficial with putting systems in place before these symptoms worsen. If someone is diagnosed at an earlier stage, they can begin memory treatments and take medications that can help manage the condition. Doctors also suggest putting home care and day programs in place as additional supports. ""Someone who has not been diagnosed may have a crisis of memory loss where they might be missing their medications or not eating due to forgetfulness which would then lead to a sudden health crisis and hospitalization,” Frank says.

12/31/2021,"Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell said Pence's minimization of January 6 was a ""disgrace."" ""We did everything possible to prevent him from being hanged,"" he said. Pence recently said that ""one tragic day in January"" was being used to demean Trump supporters. Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell in an interview with NPR called former Vice President Mike Pence's recent minimization of the January 6 Capitol attack a ""disgrace"" and ""pathetic."" Gonell, who helped defend the US Capitol against a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump as a joint session of Congress met to count the country's electoral votes, spoke about the troubles he'd dealt with in the year since the attack. That includes ongoing therapy for his mental health, injuries that prevent him from raising his left arm, and emotional trauma. Gonell, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, criticized the recent remarks by the former vice president, whom he helped defend that day. Speaking recently with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Pence referred to the assault on the Capitol as ""one tragic day in January,"" a description that the former vice president has used more than once. ""I'm not going to allow the Democrats or the national media to use one tragic day in January to demean the intentions of 74 million people who stood with us in our cause,"" Pence said. ""And I'm not going to allow the Democrats to use one tragic day in January to distract attention from their failed agenda and the failed policies of the Biden administration. We're going to focus on the future."" That's despite the fact that several rioters were heard chanting ""hang Mike Pence"" as they stormed the Capitol. Trump later defended those calls in a March interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl, saying they were ""common sense."" He added: ""Well, the people were very angry."" When he was asked about Pence's comments about January 6, Gonell criticized the former vice president. ""That one day in January almost cost my life,"" Gonell told NPR. ""And we did everything possible to prevent him from being hanged and killed in front of his daughter and his wife. And now he's telling us that that one day in January doesn't mean anything. It's pathetic. It's a disgrace."" Gonell added: ""He swore an oath to the country, not to Donald Trump."" Without naming anyone, the officer also criticized members of Congress that voted against certifying the 2020 presidential-election results, as well as those who downplayed the attack. ""We risked our lives to give them enough time to get to safety. And allegedly, some of them were in communication with some of the rioters and with some of the coordinators or in the know of what would happen,"" Gonell told NPR. ""And it makes you question their motives and their loyalty for the country, as we were battling the mob in a brutal battle where I could have lost my life and my dear fellow officers, as well."" He added: ""They're telling us, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad.' It was that bad when they were running for their lives. It was that bad when we were struggling to hold them off so they could have a chance to escape to safety."" Gonell testified in July before the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot, describing the ""horrific and devastating"" violence he experienced at the west entrance to the Capitol, which he called a ""medieval battleground.""

12/31/2021,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A 2009 settlement agreement between the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, which bears directly on Giuffre's civil lawsuit accusing Britain's Prince Andrew of sexual abuse, will be made public early next week. In a joint order on Wednesday, U.S. District Judges Lewis Kaplan and Loretta Preska in Manhattan ordered the agreement's release on or about Jan. 3, 2022, finding no reason to keep it under seal. Kaplan oversees Giuffre's lawsuit accusing https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/prince-andrew-is-sued-by-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-2021-08-09 Andrew of forcing her to have sex more than two decades ago when she was under 18 at the London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and abusing her at two of Epstein's homes. Andrew has denied Giuffre's claims. Preska oversees Giuffre's lawsuit accusing Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz of defaming her when he denied her claim that he was among the men Epstein compelled her to have sex with. The prince's lawyer, Andrew Brettler, has contended https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-seeks-dismissal-accuser-giuffres-lawsuit-2021-10-29 that the 2009 settlement with Epstein released the Duke of York from liability from Giuffre's lawsuit because it covered ""royalty,"" and Epstein insisted it cover anyone Giuffre might sue. Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, countered that the settlement applied ""at most"" to people involved in underlying litigation in Florida, where Epstein had a home, and that Prince Andrew should not use it as a ""get out of jail free card."" Andrew has not been charged with crimes. Giuffre's civil lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
