2/9/2022,"The SHIB-storm might be over. On Tuesday, the price of the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency coin, which trades as SHIB, shot up 12%, putting SHIB’s weekly gains at 52%. Before the recent rise, SHIB’s price had fallen 75% from its all-time high of $0.00008616 per coin reached in October. But SHIB is now trading at $0.00003277 per coin, making the meme coin the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world with a market valuation of $17.9 billion. SHIB’s rebound mirrors a broader recovery in crypto markets in the past week. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are also up 13% and 17%, respectively. ""Bitcoin and Ethereum both bouncing off the lows have again given investors confidence in other coins such as Shiba Inu, which have also bounced off weeks of downtrend,” Ishan Arora, a partner at crypto hedge fund Tykhe Block Ventures, told the Economic Times. But SHIB holders point to some new projects within the coin's community as reasons why the coin is gaining momentum. On Feb. 5, Unification, a Singapore-based blockchain solutions provider that has worked with companies like Amazon and Google, announced that it has been working with the Shiba Inu community to develop Shibarium. Shibarium is a layer 2 blockchain, which means it is built on top of Ethereum's blockchain but will exclusively support trading and other transactions in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Shibarium will enable ""rapid low-cost transactions optimized for gaming,"" Unification wrote in a blog post on Feb. 5. Unification says it plans to begin public tests for the network ""very soon,"" which may have prompted investors to buy in, Gritt Trakulhoon, an investment analyst at Titan Global Capital Management USA, tells Bloomberg. On Feb. 3, Shytoshi Kusama, the coin’s top influencer, announced that Shiba Inu coin is officially partnering with Welly’s, a burger restaurant with one physical outlet in Naples, Italy, that describes itself as “the first and only SHIB themed restaurant powered by the community.” As part of the deal, Welly's says SHIB will handle payments for Welly’s, integrate NFTs and Shiba Inu’s blockchain into Welly’s business, and guide Welly’s business strategy. https://twitter.com/wellyfriends/status/1490848088830865411 But some critics are not convinced that Shiba Inu's surge will continue, and they think the meme coin remains a risky bet with little underlying value.

2/9/2022,"After a particularly strong 2021, the three major stock market indexes have gotten off to a rocky start in 2022. While the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 5.92% and 3.43% this year, respectively, the Nasdaq Composite Index has dropped more than 10% in 2022. The recent volatility may have some investors reevaluating their strategies and considering how they can better time the market to capitalize on periods of growth and avoid inevitable downturns. This concept, known as market timing, sounds great in theory, but is virtually impossible to put into practice, according to one expert. Bob French, a chartered financial analyst (CFA) and director of investment analysis for Retirement Research, found that market timing strategies are hypersensitive and can easily underperform compared to buy-and-hold tactics. Mistiming your exit or reentry into the market by even one month can drastically alter an investor’s long-term outcomes. A financial advisor can help you develop an investing strategy tailored to your goals, time horizon and risk profile. Find a trusted advisor today. “Unless you can predict the future (or are substantially better at extrapolating trends than pretty much anyone else), there’s no way to tell how the markets will move in the short to medium term,” French wrote in a recent piece for Retirement Researcher. “As you can imagine, this makes it incredibly difficult to successfully time the markets.” Benefits of Market Timing To illustrate the potential benefits of being able to perfectly time the market, French calculated the hypothetical growth of just $1 invested in the S&P 500 in 1926. Had the money simply been left to grow over the next 90 year, the $1 would have been worth $5,799.53 in 2016. But had an investor been able to perfectly time the market during those 90 years and avoid all market downturns, that $1 would have grown to an eye-popping $356 billion by 2016. Yes, billion with a B. This “perfect timing strategy” involves staying invested in the S&P 500 during months when the index produces a positive return. Otherwise, the investor holds his money in one-month Treasury Bills. Of course, accurately predicting every market drop over a decades-long period is virtually impossible. But even if the investor was able to avoid the worst 5% of months during the 90-year stretch, his $1 would have grown to $7.5 million by 2016. In fact, by only missing the worst month during that time (September 1931), the hypothetical investor’s $1 would be worth 42% more than a buy-and-hold investor who rode all of the market’s ups and downs. Why You Can’t Time Markets Successfully timing the market would theoretically produce astronomical returns. But the problem remains: even minor miscalculations can upend an investor’s long-term plan. Mistiming the market can mean forgoing the best months for growth. While a buy-and-hold investor would have nearly $5,800 in 2016 for every dollar invested in the S&P 500 nine decades earlier, an investor who missed out on the best month during that timespan in an attempt to time the market would have 30% less. The gap between the two strategies gets significantly larger when you miss out on multiple growth months. A hypothetical investor who exited the market and missed the best 5% of months between 1926 and 2016 would have only $2,937 for every dollar invested in the S&P 500 – nearly half as much as the buy-and-hold investor. And if timing the market means missing out on the best 10% of months, an investor would actually lose money. His $1 investment in 1926 would only be worth $0.31 in 2016. Meanwhile, timing the market doesn’t just mean exiting at the right moment. It also requires reentering at the optimal time. In other words, you have to be right twice. If our hypothetical investor mistimed either his exit or reentry by just one month, he would still have a large sum by 2016. However, his return would be a mere fraction of what the perfect timing strategy would produce. “In the best of these examples, we only captured 0.022% of the perfect timing strategy. In other words, these strategies are hypersensitive to any errors,” French wrote. “Even when you are almost perfect, you lose nearly all of the benefit. To hammer this home one more time, no one can actually be this good. Timing the market is pure chance, which I am not willing to bet my portfolio on.” Bottom Line Timing the market to remain invested in the stock markets only during periods of growth is virtually impossible to achieve. While this strategy would hypothetically produce astronomical returns, minor miscalculations like mistiming your exit by just one month can significantly reduce the potential benefits. Bob French of Retirement Researcher writes that you’re better off building a portfolio based on your risk tolerance, and remaining disciplined throughout different market cycles. Tips for New Investors A financial advisor can be a valuable asset, especially for a new investor. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors in your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. There’s a saying in investing: it’s about time in the market, not timing the market. Rather than trying to anticipate when stocks will go up and down, methodically investing over a long period of time is typically a safer and more effective way to build wealth. A person who begins contributing just $300 per month to her 401(k) (generating an average annual return of 7%) would have nearly $1 million by the time they are 62.

2/9/2022,"The stock markets have started off 2022 with increased volatility, and that’s opened up opportunities for investors – especially for investors willing to shoulder some additional risk. The sharp decline in January lowered prices, while the rapid swings we’ve seen in recent trading sessions makes it possible to take advantage of the lowered entry point. A market situation like this should naturally bring investors’ attention to the penny stocks. These low-cost equities, typically priced below $5 per share, are perfectly placed to bring the high-powered returns when markets move back to a bullish trend. The low price point makes the initial buy-in affordable, while also permitting sky-high upside potentials; these are stocks that could double, or triple, or more in the coming year. However, given the nature of these investments, Wall Street analysts recommend doing some due diligence before pulling the trigger, noting that not all penny stocks are bound for greatness. Taking this into account, we used TipRanks’ database to identify two penny stocks that have earned a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community. Not to mention each offers up massive upside potential and could climb to $10, or even more. Viracta Therapeutics (VIRX) We’ll start with Viracta, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company working on new treatments for cancers related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. The EBV is part of the herpes family, and it’s estimated that some 90% of the global population carries it. EBV is the cause of infectious mono, and is also linked to several cancers – nasopharyngeal and gastric malignancies, as well as some lymphomas. As many as a quarter-million cancer diagnoses annually are linked to EBV infection. Looking at Viracta’s story, it’s important to note that the company has been public for just about one year. It’s current incarnation as a NASDAQ-listed firm was finalized in February of last year, when it merged with Sunesis Pharmaceuticals. The merger closed on February 24, and the combined company started out with $120 million cash – giving it a runway for operations into 2024. Currently, the company’s leading drug candidate is nanatinostat, which is being evaluated in clinical trials as a combination therapy with valganciclovir. The combo, called nana-val, is currently under investigation in two research tracks, as a treatment for relapsed/refractory EBV+ lymphomas and solid tumors. The lymphoma track is more advanced, at the late clinical stage. In December, the company released final data from a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of nana-val for EBV+ lymphomas. The trial showed that nana-val was well tolerated across dosages and demonstrated promising therapeutic activity across lymphoma subtypes. Patients showed a 10.4 month median response duration. This study was followed up in January with the first dosing of patients in a Phase 1b/2 trials of nana-val against EBV+ solid tumors, including recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nana-val alone and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. The Phase 2 part of the study will enroll up to 60 patients. Preliminary data is expected in 2H22. Trading for $2.36 per share, several members of the Street believe that Viracta's price tag and pipeline make it a must-watch name. In a review of Viracta for RBC, analyst Kennen MacKay writes: “VIRX is an overlooked oncology company that is trading near cash levels despite a lead asset entering a registrational clinical trial in EBV+ lymphomas (NAVAL-1) & impressive ph1/2 clinical data. VIRX’s nanatinostat & valganciclovir (Nana-val) drug combination is a first-of-its-kind approach to targeting EBV+ tumors which we see having the potential to transform the field of viral-oncology & care for patients with EBV+ tumors (~1% of all cancers)... We consider Nana-val an underappreciated asset with the potential to achieve blockbuster status in EBV+ malignancies (we model risk-unadjusted 2040 global sales of $1.26+Bn) and upside from expansion potential into other EBV+ and other latent virus-driven cancers as well as EBV-driven nonmalignant diseases."" ""We see high likelihood of strategic M&A interest if validation continues. We view VIRX’s biomarker-driven oral small molecule approach potentially disrupting in lymphoma being crowded by biologics as well as in solid tumors where Nana-val could solo or complement (solid tumor ph2 w/ Keytruda),"" MacKay added. All of the above makes it clear why MacKay is now standing with the bulls. The analyst rates VIRX an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while his $10 price target implies an upside of 312% for the year ahead. (To watch MacKay’s track record, click here) There are only 3 recent reviews on record for Viracta’s shares – evidence that the stock is, as MacKay says, overlooked – but they are unanimously positive, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $21 average price target is more aggressive than MacKay's and indicates upside potential of ~782%. (See VIRX stock analysis on TipRanks) Pear Therapeutics (PEAR) The next penny stock we’re looking at is an interesting one. Pear Therapeutics is a clinical- and commercial-stage company, working on the development, testing, and application of prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) systems. These are software systems designed to improve patient outcomes, and can be applied to a variety of disease conditions. Pear has three PDTs in commercial use, and another 14 in the development pipeline undergoing clinical trials at various stages. Pear’s PDTs have applications in a range of medical specialties, but especially in psychiatry and neurology. The company’s three commercial products are reSET, reSET-O, and Somryst; they are used in the treatment of opioid abuse and chronic insomnia. The PDTs come with both patient- and clinician-facing applications, for use on mobile and desktop devices. The patient and clinician apps provide information for both based on patient reporting, clinician evaluations, and input test results. reSET is a 90-day program using the PDT to provide and manage cognitive behavioral therapy for substance abuse disorder. reSET-O, an 84 day PDT, is designed to target opioid abuse particularly. Both programs allow patients and clinicians together to track medication use, compliance rewards, and drug-use testing results, to tailor treatment to the patient’s particular conditions and abilities. Somryst is a PDT treatment for chronic insomnia, designed for use with adults ages 22 and up. The program uses neurobehavioral intervention, including sleep restriction and consolidation. These programs form the background to Pear’s recent entry to the public markets. The company started trading on the NASDAQ on December 6, after completing a SPAC transaction with Thimble Point Acquisition Corporation. The business combination brought $175 million in new capital to Pear, for use in further development of PDT products. Since entering the public markets. Pear is the first company in its particular bio-therapeutic space, and Credit Suisse analyst Judah Frommer sees that as a key point, writing: “We believe that Pear, as a category creator and market leader in digital therapeutics, has the opportunity to win in what could be a multi-billion dollar total addressable market in the U.S. alone with its three FDA-authorized PDT products and a broad pipeline of product candidates. Pear possesses horizontal scalable infrastructure and we believe could eventually serve as a natural consolidator in the space. We believe Pear is well positioned to accelerate its growth by increasing adoption and coverage rates for its already-approved products, and growing the space, in general.” To this end, Frommer rates PEAR an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and gives the stock a bullish $11 price target, indicating confidence in a 152% one-year upside. (To watch Frommer’s track record, click here) Overall, this penny stock has picked up 6 analyst reviews during its short time on the public market, and those break down 5 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. PEAR is selling for $4.35 and the analysts price targets average out to $11.40, for a 162% upside potential.
