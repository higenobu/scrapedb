5/6/2022,"A week before election day 2020, the US secretary of defense was so worried that Donald Trump would seek to involve the military in the election in an attempt to hold on to power, he told the general commanding the US national guard to notify him of any communication from anyone at all at the White House. “Without being too explicit,” Mark Esper writes in a new memoir, “my message was clear: the US military was not going to get involved in the election, no matter who directed it. I would intercede.” Such an intercession, Esper writes, would involve trying to persuade Trump not to use the military to hold on to power, then if necessary Esper would resign, appeal to Republicans in Congress and hold a press conference to appeal to the American people directly. Esper thought Trump might order actions such as seizing ballot boxes in key states. Ultimately, Trump did not attempt to use the military to influence the election, which he lost to Joe Biden. He did seek to overturn the result by other means. Esper was fired by Trump on 9 November 2020, six days after the election. He details the extraordinary steps he felt compelled to take before that in a new book, A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Defense Secretary in Extraordinary Times, which will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. Esper devotes considerable space to his work with Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to stymie Trump’s attempts to use the military for political purposes, either in military strikes against Iran or in Syria – or even Mexico – or at home, by invoking the Insurrection Act against protesters for racial justice. Trump’s request that such protesters be shot in the legs, and Esper’s account of his resistance to it, has been reported elsewhere. The protests died down but Esper says the two most senior Pentagon figures remained concerned Trump could seek to use the military domestically, to tilt power his way. Esper describes a meeting at the Pentagon with Milley and the national guard chief, Gen Daniel Hokanson, on 30 October, “the last Friday before the election”. The “ostensible purpose of the meeting”, Esper says, given it was visible to anyone who could see his calendar, was an update on national guard military police units placed on alert to placate Trump during the protests for racial justice. But with regard to the election, Esper says, “this was a serious moment”. He says he told Gen Hokanson: “If at any point in the coming days – before, during or after the election – you get a call from anyone at the White House, take it, acknowledge the message, and call me immediately. The same rule applies if you hear of any TAGS [national guard state adjutant generals] or governors getting a similar call.” Esper says he also asked Hokanson “to figure out a discreet way to get this last part out, which he said he would”. Esper writes that as the only civilian between the president and the military, he was concerned the White House might “try to circumvent me to do something inappropriate” and “wanted to be ready for anything”. “The whole point of my game plan – the reason that I had taken so much crap over the last several months – was to be in this position, at this moment, to act. The essence of democracy was free and fair elections, followed by the peaceful transition of power.” Milley, he writes, told him he and the other joint chiefs would “resign if pressed to break their oath” and involve the military in the election. Esper says he did not want to allow the generals “to be put in such a compromising position, especially if a presidential order was legal but grossly wrong or inappropriate. “… If such an order came from the White House, my immediate recourse would be to demand a meeting with the president. I would want to hear and understand the directive straight from him, to offer alternative solutions if such were possible, and to voice my opposition face-to-face if he was unyielding. If I was unsuccessful I would be forced to resign on the spot in protest. But that wouldn’t be the end of the line for me.” Esper writes that he would have called senior Republicans on Capitol Hill to ask them to intercede with Trump, then staged a press conference “where I informed the country about all that had transpired and continued to unfold. “I would present my best case and make an appeal to the American people, their elected leaders in Congress, and the institutions of government to intervene. The point would be to buy time and put pressure on the president to stand down.” As Esper writes, election day, 3 November, “came and went without any incident involving the armed forces. Thank God.” He says he was relieved that though the contest was not called until the following weekend, Biden’s lead was clear. Esper also says he “never imagined” what came next: Trump’s attempt to overturn the election through lies about electoral fraud and coordination with Republicans in Congress and other rightwing groups and advisers, culminating on 6 January 2021 in the storming of the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. The attack on the Capitol has been linked to seven deaths and has led to more than 800 charges. But it failed to stop certification of Biden’s win. Having been fired after the election, Esper watched the attack on TV.",Arts/Books,"I warned national guard of possible coup, Trump defense secretary says",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/06/trump-defense-secretary-mark-esper-book
5/6/2022,"“How does it feel to cut into a living body?” It’s an odd question to ask a doctor at your husband’s funeral, but Cora Seaborne (Claire Danes) is an unusual woman. She’s also an aspiring naturalist, so when she reads the intriguing newspaper headline “Sea Dragon Sighted in Essex”, she spies a way of exploiting her newfound freedom and escaping her stifling London life. In Essex, she gets more than she bargained for, thanks to the wildness of the area in the late-19th century and her tentative chemistry with Tom Hiddleston’s vicar Will Ransome. Adapted from Sarah Perry’s novel and directed by Clio Barnard, it’s a darkly sensual gothic musing on faith, rationality and temptation.Apple TV+, from Friday 13 May “You really have no idea who you are any more,” says Julie Harmon, the 14th (but sadly not the last) person to discover that they are the biological child of rogue fertility doctor Donald Cline. In a genuinely sickening story, Cline used his own sperm to inseminate dozens of women, seemingly intent on assembling an army of unknowing offspring. It’s a distinctively American tale of overt religiosity and implied violence – Cline turned up at a meeting with wronged patients toting a Bible quote and a gun – and while the film lacks dynamism, the story is easily jaw-dropping enough to hold your attention.Netflix, from Wednesday 11 May A spin-off (absolutely not a reboot, as the creators have been keen to stress) from How I Met Your Mother, this glossy comedy offers a female-driven perspective from the same fictional New York. Once again, it’s very much an idealised version of modern urban life – Friends with dating apps, essentially. Hilary Duff is Sophie, the young woman looking for love, while Kim Cattrall plays the older, future version. It’s never as funny or irreverent as it should be, but fans of the original will enjoy watching the two fictional universes inch closer.Disney+, from Wednesday 11 May The 1986 killing of French-Algerian student Malik Oussekine was one of the inspirations for the film La Haine, and the story is told in full here. Malik was a 22-year-old aspiring priest who made the fatal decision to attend a political protest in Paris and paid for it with his life after he was savagely beaten to death by the police. Over four episodes, this series explores Malik’s family life, the killing itself and his family’s lengthy battle for justice as the French establishment closed ranks. Sayyid El Alami and Hiam Abbass, also known as Marcia in Succession, star. PHDisney+, from Wednesday 11 May More dead-eyed, late-capitalist high-jinks in the second season of the hyperactive Asian-American reality series which makes Selling Sunset look like The Ascent of Man. As ever, it’s full of semi-manufactured conflict as newcomer Dorothy is viewed with suspicion by the original cast, wedding plans fall apart and lunch dates turn sour. However, there’ll always be a bigger diamond to buy, another gratuitous holiday to take and a few more unearned millions to squander. Very quickly, you’ll become as jaded by excess as the cast themselves.Netflix, from Friday 13 Ma Another twist on the legal maverick formula, brought to us by the king of soapy thrillers, David E Kelley. Based on the novels of Michael Connelly, it follows the exploits of scrappy LA attorney Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) who works out of the back seat of his car after the death of his former law partner and the disintegration of his marriage. Despite this suboptimal set-up, Haller finds himself tackling the biggest case of his career when a murder leads him into terrifyingly deep water. It lacks a certain plausibility, but it’s pacy fun and Haller is easy to root for.Netflix, from Friday 13 May A second series for the show in which athletes explore their defining moments and ponder what makes them tick. These deep dives into sporting lives are slanted towards American sports – don’t expect many cricketers or rugby players. This season’s most intriguing offerings concern Marcus Rashford – a rare non-American whose form on the field has inconveniently dropped off, and Bubba Wallace (pictured) whose motorsports brilliance has a fascinating sociopolitical subtext – he’s the first African American to win a Nascar race since 1963.Apple TV+, from Friday 13 May",Arts/Television & radio,The Essex Serpent to How I Met Your Father: seven best shows to stream,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/the-essex-serpent-to-how-i-met-your-father-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week
5/6/2022,"Republicans were largely dismissive when, in 2019, a small group of extreme anti-abortion activists called on the party to reconsider its “decades-old” view that laws restricting abortion in the US ought to exempt victims of rape and incest. It simply went too far, the party’s House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, argued at the time, to support absolute abortion bans that did not offer protection to women and girls who had been raped or were the victims of incest. But there has been a sea change in Republican thinking since then. At least 11 US states – including Alabama, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas – have passed legislation that bans abortion without any such exceptions. Where Republicans once believed that absolute bans were unpalatable and “toxic” with voters, the party’s legislators have now adopted the language once promoted by the most extreme anti-abortion activists in the country who say any such exceptions are “prejudice against children conceived in rape and incest”. “It is our view that the value of human life is not determined by the circumstances of one’s conceptions at birth,” said one letter by proponents of absolute bans. “A child conceived in rape is still a child.” While most of the laws have been blocked by US courts for now, the expected reversal of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal in the US, would almost immediately, or as soon as practical, put the bans into effect. It means that in many states, restrictions on reproductive rights will be more extreme than they were before Roe was passed nearly 50 years ago. “Something has changed, at least in Arkansas, and I perceive nationwide,” said Jim Hendren, a retiring state senator from Arkansas who left the Republican party after the January 6 insurrection and is now an Independent. While Hendren said he was proud of his long history as a “pro-life” legislator, he said Arkansas had – until now – also always passed legislation with rape and incest exceptions. “The fact is, it’s a different ethical dilemma when you’re talking about a 10-year-old girl who is a rape victim being responsible for the actions of a criminal, versus someone who is responsible for their own actions,” Hendren said. After years of “closing every other loophole”, Hendren added, “suddenly the discussion changed”. “You get to a place where there is nothing else to do. And there is no other mechanism for these [anti-abortion] organizations that have survived and thrived by working on this issue than to continue to push into this new area,” he said. Hendren, who noted that Arkansas had one of the worst infant mortality rates in the US, ultimately voted “present” on the bill. While he drafted an amendment that would have included a rape and incest exception in the legislation, he did not put the amendment forward for a vote. It would not have had enough support, Hendren said, because even Republican legislators who quietly supported him and “agonised” over their vote were fearful that supporting the amendment would mean they would be labeled “pro-choice” by Republican primary challengers. Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law who specialises in the history of reproductive rights, said it was difficult to judge what the exact impact of absolute abortion bans would be because so many sexual assaults and cases of incest are unreported. It was possible, she said, that the US could begin to see minors being forced to carry pregnancies to term, as has been the case in Ecuador and Argentina. Republican “indifference” to rape and incest exceptions was “something new”, Ziegler said, and could reflect how groups that support such absolute bans no longer feel they need to “tread carefully”. At the centre of the new movement is an advocacy group called Students for Life of America (SFLA), which has called itself one of the world’s leading grassroots “pro-life advocacy groups”. Among other legislative victories, SFLA has recently taken credit for thwarting “backdoor efforts” to weaken the Arkansas legislation. On its website, the group emphasises its work across college campuses and includes pictures of dozens of young-looking staff members who lead the group’s outreach efforts. But tax records show SFLA is far from grassroots: it has become a financial powerhouse in the anti-abortion movement thanks to the support of wealthy donors. Records show that the group transformed from an organisation with a budget of about $20,000 in 2004 to $12m in 2019. It is co-chaired by Leonard Leo, the conservative lawyer who served for years at the helm of the Federalist Society and was the legal adviser to President Donald Trump, where he had extraordinary influence selecting the conservative judges – including Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh – who now serve as justices on the supreme court. Leo is described in some tax records as SFLA’s principal officer, which legally means he has the “ultimate responsibility for implementing the decisions of the organisation’s governing body, or for supervising the management, administration, or operation of the organisation”. Richard Crum, who is listed as a “financial services executive” on the group’s website and – according to LinkedIn – appears to be a top executive at CapitalOne bank, is another co-chair. Crum did not respond to a request for comment. Other board members include the former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist and president of Creative Response Concepts, whose clients have included Leo’s Federalist Society. While SFLA does not list its donors in its own tax records, tax filings by other groups who have donated to the organisation show that donors include: the Apollos Charitable Foundation, a Texas-based group run by the Hetland family, who previously owned a Houston-based insurer called American Financial & Automotive Services; the Prince Foundation, the Christian charity in Michigan headed by Elsa Prince, the mother of the Blackwater founder Erik Prince and his sister, former education secretary Betsy DeVos; and Gerard Health Foundation, which was founded by Raymond Ruddy, a millionaire businessman and donor to conservative causes like abstinence-only education policies. Ruddy also serves on SFLA’s board. On its website, the group said it relied on an unnamed “angel investor” for helping it to “grow rapidly” and become the voice of the “pro-life generation”. The group’s longtime executive director, Kristan Hawkins, did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about Leo or other board members’ role in the organisation. Hawkins, who has said that in her “ideal world” the pill and IUDs would be “illegal”, recently praised the Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, for signing a “life at conception” bill which she said was “sponsored” by SFLA and would make all abortion illegal, except in cases where a mother’s life was in immediate danger. If it survives legal challenges – which it could if Roe is completely overturned – the absolute ban would take effect on 1 August and would make performing an abortion a felony, punishable by 10 years in prison. A separate bill signed by Stitt this week makes all abortions illegal after six weeks and takes effect immediately. Oklahoma had become a destination for women in Texas seeking abortions who were prohibited from receiving the procedure following that state’s near ban on abortion.

5/6/2022,"Liam Neeson is making a bid to becoming the greatest interviewee in the world. Every other celebrity understands and adheres to the rules of the game. Their job is to promote a project, to better increase its revenue. An interviewer’s job is to politely disregard all that and ask more personal questions, to better increase the revenue of their publication. It’s an age-old push and pull, and everyone understands their place. Everyone, that is, except Neeson. Because his interview tactic is different. Neeson likes to sit back, answer questions about his newest film and then, just as everyone is getting ready to pack up for the day, blurt out the single maddest thing that comes into his head. The most infamous instance of this happened in 2019 when Neeson derailed an interview with the Independent by suddenly revealing that he had once spent a week patrolling his neighbourhood with a cosh, in the hope that he would encounter a “black bastard” who he could kill to avenge the rape of his friend. In that instance, his costar Tom Bateman managed to respond in the only reasonable way to such a bizarre confession, by mumbling “Holy shit”. Neeson’s revelation dented his career for a moment – at the very least the red carpet premiere of the film he was promoting was cancelled – but he remains a phenomenal actor, critically acclaimed and commercially successful, so he kept making films unbidden. However, in February, an appearance on Australia’s Sunrise TV show caused a minor stir when – again, without any prompting – Neeson reminisced about filming in the country, telling his interviewer Nelson Aspen: “I loved Melbourne, I loved our Australian crew … I made a couple of pals and fell in love once there, but she was taken.” Now, obviously the big question here is who did he fall in love with? Immediately after the interview, a bewildered Aspen joked: “We have just got to track down this woman who captivated his heart. I don’t know who she was, but I’m intrigued.” Of course he wants to know. We all do. Who is this woman? Was the love reciprocated? Was it consummated? If it was, how on earth does one react to being cuckolded by Darkman? Whatever the case, the admission must bug Neeson a little, because now he has claimed that the whole thing was simply an elaborate gag. “It was bollocks,” Neeson told the Daily Mail this week. “I said: ‘I fell in love, but she was taken.’ That’s a joke.” Unless I am enormously mistaken, the joke seems to be that Neeson said he fell in love with a woman who was taken, and he also starred in a film called Taken. Which seems to not only reach the furthest imaginable orbit point of what constitutes a joke, but must also make life for him incredibly impractical. Because now a precedent has been set. Any time that Neeson says the name of any of his films as part of a sentence, the expectation is that he must be making a joke. Should his car ever be stolen, he will no longer be allowed to phone the police and say, “This is Liam Neeson, my car’s been taken,” for fear that it will be greeted with howls of knowing laughter from the entire police department. I have to admit at this point that I don’t actually know if Neeson was joking, or just clumsily trying to course-correct. I’ve watched the interview so many times at this point that I’ve lost all frame of reference. There is a pause before he says the word “taken”, but is it a pause designed to set up a punchline, or just a normal space between words? I think his eyebrows might raise a little bit while he says it, but maybe he just had an itchy head. There is only one way to find out. From now on, we will have to carefully watch every interview that Neeson ever does. If he never drops the title of any of his other films into an otherwise unrelated sentence, then we have every reason to smell a rat. But if he does this sort of thing regularly – if he says, “I fell in love, but I was the third person,” or, “I fell in love, but she ate breakfast on Pluto,” or, “I fell in love, but she was the dark knight rises” – then we can all rest easy in the knowledge that we are in the presence of a comedy genius.",Arts/Film,Does Liam Neeson not understand the rules of the game?

5/6/2022,"The end of a federal right to abortion in the US would have profound and detrimental impacts on medical education, the freedom to practice medicine and patients’ ability to seek medical advice without fear of prosecution, doctors and legal experts said. The warnings come as a leaked supreme court draft opinion and accompanying reporting from Politico show a majority of justices voted to overturn Roe v Wade, a landmark decision that has protected the federal right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. If the court’s opinion does not change substantially from the leaked draft, at least 26 states would be certain or likely to ban abortion. Until the court issues a final decision, expected in June, Roe prevents states hostile to abortion from banning the procedure before a fetus can survive outside the womb. “If this decision ends up being similar to what [was leaked], this is going to substantially affect abortion care, obstetrics care and healthcare more generally,” said Dr Nisha Verma, a Darney-Landy fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Such a decision would represent a seismic shift in the American healthcare landscape, with devastating consequences for medical care, education and the doctor-patient relationship. “It really starts with doctors, because overturning Roe will have a severe chilling effect,” said Lindsay Lewis, co-author of a report by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that studied the potential criminal effects of ending Roe, and a board member of the same organization. Abortion restrictions are now more likely to contain extremely narrow exemptions to save the lives of pregnant people, severe criminal penalties for providers and to lack exemptions for rape and incest. That puts doctors in the position of trying to interpret legislation that is often extremely narrow. In one recent example, an Oklahoma abortion ban makes performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In addition, medical exemptions for the procedure are exceedingly narrow. An abortion can be legally performed only in the event the medical emergency “cannot be remedied by the delivery of the child”. “Medical emergency” is strictly defined as when a threat to a person’s life “by a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself”. Functionally, these restrictions on medical exemptions have made new abortion bans much stricter than even some that existed before Roe was decided, when some states allowed women to seek clearance for an abortion from hospitals boards on the basis of psychological crises. “For basically the past decade, or a little over the past decade, these exceptions have simply become so narrow as to be functionally unusable,” said Elizabeth Nash, an expert on state abortion restrictions at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization. “There are very few people who meet these definitions.” In another example, should Roe fall, doctors who perform an abortion against state law in Alabama could be face up to 99 years in prison. “This has the potential to turn the doctor-patient relationship on its head,” said Lewis. Doctors may not feel comfortable advising women they could go to another state to seek abortions, while women may be uncomfortable being open about speaking about her considerations. What’s more, tough-on-crime laws passed in the nearly 50 years since Roe was decided mean some zealous prosecutors could charge doctors, and a host of other people, with aiding and abetting, conspiracy or accomplice crimes related to the end of a pregnancy. Abortion bans would also have a dramatic impact on medical education, in particular on residents in obstetrics and gynecology who are required to learn routine abortion care as part of training. “Largely because of the politicization of obstetric and abortion care, the public sees these as two very different and separate things,” when in fact, “pregnancy management and pregnancy termination are very interconnected,” said Dr Kavita Vinekar, assistant professor at the University of California Los Angeles school of medicine and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “A lot of the skills we use in obstetrics are directly related to the training we receive in abortion care.” A study co-authored by Vinekar found that nearly half (44%) of obstetrics and gynecology residents, or about 2,600 residents, will attend programs in states that could outlaw abortion training. Already, some programs have pioneered efforts to help residents from Texas, which banned abortion at six weeks in 2021 September, to travel to states where it is legal. But it is not simple or easy. “I’m trying to think of ways to help, so there are not huge training and education deficits in our workforce, but I am also very nervous about it,” said Dr Jody Steinauer, a co-author of the study and director of the Ryan residency and training program at the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. Additionally, Steinauer said she worries that workforce shortages will threaten pregnant people in states where abortion is banned, because few doctors will want to practice under the threat of prosecution, unable to provide safe, evidence-based care. “Just the emotional distress factor would be enough to make people not want to practice in these states,” Steinauer said. Existing abortion restrictions, even as Roe stands, means pregnant people may seek abortion care far from where they live. Verma has seen patients come to Georgia from Alabama and Tennessee, which have more restrictions. However, the threat of prosecution may pose a threat. “In too many of these cases,” a person who was prosecuted “has come to the attention of law enforcement by someone from whom they’ve sought medical care,” said Jill Adams, executive director of If/When/How, a reproductive rights legal group. Although anti-abortion lawmakers often argue they exempt women from punitive statutes, laws that confer rights on fetuses have already resulted in prosecutions. Those criminal sanctions are likely to expand should Roe fall. That was probably the case for Lizelle Herrera, a Texas woman who was charged with murder for a “self-induced abortion”. Charges were later dropped – abortion is legal because Roe remains the law of the land – but historians warn the case is a forewarning of things to come. There is no requirement for healthcare providers to report pregnant people to law enforcement for self-managed abortions, which are legal. “In a time when we’re trying to end mass incarceration, we will see far more women, far more people of color, far more poor people – these are the people we see getting abortions – being charged with crimes and going to jail simply for exercising what once was their right to determine what to do with their own bodies when it comes to pregnancy,” said Lewis.",News/World news,"‘A severe chilling effect’: abortion bans will inhibit doctors’ advice to patients, experts fear",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/abortion-bans-patient-doctor-medical-advice
5/6/2022,"Hello, and happy local election results day from your caffeine-addled, sugared-up, banana-stuffed correspondent at the count in Silksworth Sports Centre in Sunderland, where Labour had a pretty average night – but fears of losing control of an iconic council to the Conservatives did not materialise, and only the Liberal Democrats picked up any seats. As we send this email, it’s that same sort of messy picture across the country: disappointment but not catastrophe for the Conservatives, some Labour successes coming with plenty of big asterisks attached, and the Liberal Democrats and the Greens the only parties to really be able to point to unambiguous success. Shortly before 7am, the Tories had lost 100 seats. Labour had gained 57, the Lib Dems 46, and the Greens 22. It’s tricky to draw hard and fast conclusions when there’s so much yet to come, but one way to see the mood so far is as anti-Tory – but not quite pro-Labour. The story’s moving quickly, and there’s plenty more of it to come today – so I won’t be offended if you want to check in on Andy Sparrow’s indispensable live blog, or take a look at the latest results here. If you want to catch up on what we’ve learned so far, that’s coming up after the rest of the headlines. Ukraine | Russia has unleashed heavy artillery barrages against multiple Ukrainian positions in the south and east of the country, with conflicting claims over whether Russian forces were attempting to storm the last Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Economy | Interest rates have once again been raised by the Bank of England to 1% – a 13-year high – to curb inflation. Inflation in the UK hit 7% in March, the highest level in three decades. Monarchy | The Queen is to miss the royal garden party season in her platinum jubilee year, Buckingham Palace said. The 96-year-old monarch has been experiencing mobility issues in recent months. Coronavirus | Ministers have tried to “explain away” disproportionality in death rates during the pandemic, the head of the Covid-19 public inquiry has been told in a leaked letter from black, Asian and minority ethnic leaders. Baby P | The Parole Board rejected an appeal by justice secretary Dominic Raab against the release from prison of Tracey Connelly, the mother of Baby P, who died after months of abuse. Raab claimed the decision proved the Parole Board needs a “fundamental overhaul”. Sunderland seems like a constituency that gets at something bigger: to win the next election, Labour needs to regain strength in the “red wall” – but even as it tries to make progress in areas like this, where it has suffered shocking losses in recent years, it is still worrying about losing ground. In the end, Labour held on to overall control comfortably – and the only seat it lost was to the Lib Dems, who took another off the Tories. But the scenes of jubilation as the results came suggested that nobody thought it was a sure thing. After the result, a councillor told me: “Look, we’ve won, and that’s great, but anyone who says there weren’t nerves is having a laugh.” Sunderland is a tiny part of the national picture – and even when you zoom out you find huge swathes of the map, including all of Scotland and Wales and the Stormont election in Northern Ireland, yet to be filled in. But there are some provisional takeaways: The results don’t suggest that Labour is on course for a majority in Westminster Probably the hardest part of the results to interpret so far is what’s happened in the fabled “red wall”, the seats in Brexit-supporting, mostly northern areas where Labour’s vote collapsed in the last general election. “It’s not clearcut,” said Rowena Mason, the Guardian’s deputy political editor, who drew the night shift. “You see Labour doing well in this new unitary authority in Cumberland – but then you see them fail to take back control of somewhere like Hartlepool, or Bolton. “There’s not the sort of clear story of Labour progress so far that you would need to win a general election. You can’t see them as a homogenous block – there are local issues in play, and differences between urban and rural areas.” James Johnson, a former Downing Street pollster, argued that Labour’s performance was not a failure to win back the “red wall” – because its performance was in seats that last came up in 2018, before the collapse in Labour support in those places. That means that an apparently static performance could be better than it looks. But it still appears to be a long way from where the party needs to be confident of winning a Westminster majority. Labour has made real progress in London If the picture elsewhere in England was complicated, the story in London was simple: it was a good night for Labour. Most dramatically, they took control of Wandsworth council after 44 years of Tory control – and Westminster, a genuine surprise. They took Barnet. The Conservatives hung on to Hillingdon, but lost four seats. And there were reports that of their 11 councillors in Richmond, they lost all but one. (Mind you, that’s all Lib Dems – Labour don’t have a seat there either.) Boris Johnson was once feted as the Tory who could win over London’s 9 million voters; now he is toxic in most of the capital, which elects one in nine British MPs. Defeated Tories are very angry with Boris Johnson Maybe the most uncomfortable part of the night for the prime minister is the number of disappointed local Conservative figures who blame him squarely for their losses. In Sunderland, Conservative group leader Antony Mullen seemed pretty angry as he spoke. “We’ve come close in a number of seats, and were it not for the national picture – Partygate – I think we would have won them,” he told me. “I can only put it down to that. I think a lot of Conservative voters were staying at home.” He repeated a call for Johnson to resign. Among a number of other examples, in the new council area of Cumberland, where Labour took the council despite all three MPs in the area being Conservative, local Tory leader John Mallinson called for Johnson to be replaced and said he could understand why voters “no longer have the confidence that their prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth”. Mallinson’s interview felt like one which will be replayed on news bulletins all day. And we’re likely to see Tory MPs loyal to Johnson asked if they’re really telling bruised local candidates that they don’t understand why they’ve lost. But will they act? “I think this result so far leaves it in the balance,” said Rowena. “A lot of them have been looking for an excuse ... On the other hand they may feel that more fines over Partygate would strengthen their case.” Liberal Democrats, Greens, and independents had a good night Seven years after their post-coalition local election meltdown, the Lib Dems seem to be finally making progress, taking Hull council from Labour, denying the Tories overall control in West Oxfordshire, and taking nearly 50 seats overall so far. The Greens have more than doubled their starting tally in the seats being contested already. Meanwhile, at 3.30am, John Curtice said that “independent candidates in key wards have done remarkably well”, taking 26% of the vote where they have stood. The smaller parties have been particularly influential in the south so far, where they account for all of what Sky News calculates is a 26% loss in average share for the Conservatives. All of that chimes with the sense on the ground in Sunderland that there is a huge amount to play for before any general election – and that the local elections may end up looking like a contest between protest and inertia. The question now is whether anybody can break that holding pattern. “I’m pig-sick of Labour here and I’m pig-sick of the Tories in London,” said Simon, a 62-year-old on his way to the polls in Sunderland’s Silksworth ward last night. “I don’t know why I’m bothering to vote at all.” Football | Mixed success for the British team’s in Europe last night, as Rangers defeated RB Leipzig 3-1 to qualify for the Europa League final, where they will face Frankfurt who enjoyed a comfortable night against 10-man West Ham, to win 1-0.

5/6/2022,"The World Surf League says its controversial new mid-season cut, which prompted high drama during an emotionally charged week at the Margaret River Pro, made for compelling viewing and remains an integral part of the WSL’s efforts to increase engagement and viewership of the sport. The brutal new Champions Tour rule, which sees the men’s field cut from 36 to 24 and the women’s from 24 to 12 at the halfway point of the season, resulted in the high-profile relegations of Sally Fitzgibbons and Owen Wright to the second tier Challenger Series. The pair, both veterans at the elite level who represented Australia at the Tokyo Olympics, will now have to work their way back to the top echelon of professional surfing, although in Wright’s case, he may opt for retirement instead. Fitzgibbons, who is coming to terms with dropping off the Champions Tour for the first time in 14 years, was among several surfers to break down in tears following the round of 16 at the event in Western Australia. But WSL CEO Erik Logan said the heightened drama had the desired effect. “The redesign has been met by the industry and fans with genuine excitement and we are already seeing significant increases in engagement and viewership,” Logan told Guardian Australia. “In redesigning the tours and competition framework, we focused on optimising the competition structures to create a dynamic, compelling and long-term sustainable format to compliment the incredible talents of the world’s best surfers. “The mid-season cut is a cornerstone of the new framework and allows us to ensure that post-cut events can run in one optimal swell cycle, create a dynamic season-long narrative and drive fan engagement – all of which allow us to drive more revenue so we can continue to invest in the platform of the world’s best surfing.” The move has been met with criticism in some quarters. Kolohe Andino, who made the cut and will continue on the main tour, said earlier this week “no one really likes” the new rule and that “it just seems like it’s a TV show a little bit, like drama all the time”. But opinions among athletes appear to be split, with a pragmatic Stephanie Gilmore, who also survived despite having been in danger of being cut at Margaret River, acknowledging that changes are sometimes needed to keep a sport relevant in a crowded media landscape. “The sport is growing at alarming rates but at the same time I don’t think the viewership is where it should be,” Gilmore told AAP. “The cut coming at the middle of the year like this, it really keeps the viewership up for an event like Margaret River, which maybe didn’t have great viewership in the past. It was the middle of season. It wasn’t as exciting. No one fell off. It was sort of like that. It’s just, I guess, business at that point.” Logan said the WSL is open to feedback and that it would continue to work with its athletes in an effort to improve the future of professional surfing.",Sport/Sport,"Brutal mid-season cut has increased interest in competition, says World Surf League",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/brutal-mid-season-cut-has-increased-interest-in-competition-says-world-surf-league
5/6/2022,"Scott Morrison has rejected claims that his rhetoric about red lines in Solomon Islands has backfired, while saying he still does not know the final cost of scrapping the French submarine contract. The prime minister, making a defence industry funding announcement in Western Australia on Friday, also defended the scrapping of an armed drones program that the government had previously praised and would have delivered capability soon. The continued pressure on the cost of defence projects comes as Morrison sought to ride out an intervention in the political debate from his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull, who observed from New York that disgruntled Liberals were abandoning the party for teal independents. Morrison was in the marginal Labor-held WA seat of Cowan to promise to train an extra 1,500 Australians for jobs in the defence manufacturing and technology industry, with a $108.5m expansion of an existing pilot program. While the Coalition is seeking to project a tough-on-national-security message, Morrison continued to face questions over China’s security deal with Solomon Islands and the resulting rift with his counterpart, Manasseh Sogavare. Nearly two weeks ago, Morrison said Australia and the US shared the same “red line” when it came to opposing a Chinese military base in Solomon Islands, without specifying what action might be triggered if that line was crossed. Sogavare told parliament this week that Solomon Islands was being treated like kindergarten children and he deplored how countries concerned about the deal had implied a “warning of military intervention” if their national and strategic interests were undermined. Asked on Friday whether his rhetoric about a red line had put Australia’s national security more at risk, Morrison said: “No, I don’t believe it has.” The prime minister said he had always been “very clear” about Australia’s national security interests and about the “very high levels of support” that Australia had provided to both the people and the government of Solomon Islands. “When it comes to dealing with the coercion that we see from the Chinese government - whether here in our region, in the south-west Pacific, or anywhere else across the Indo-Pacific, there is no government, there is no prime minister, that has been more forward-leaning in standing up to that coercion in face of the world,” Morrison said. Morrison said that the cancellation of the French conventional submarines program last September was one of the most difficult decisions he had had to make as it would carry “pretty serious ramifications”. But the prime minister was unable to say what the likely total cost of that cancellation, noting the negotiations with France’s Naval Group had not yet concluded. “I’m not going to pre-empt any such commercial negotiation. That would be foolish. That would be reckless.” Defence officials told Senate estimates on 1 April that Naval Group had indicated how much it was seeking “without prejudice”, but it remained subject to negotiation. Asked about Turnbull’s intervention and division in the Liberal Party, Morrison told reporters in Perth he “[doesn’t] share his view”. He warned electing independents would cause “chaos” - but declined two opportunities to say if he would resign in the event of a hung parliament. Although Morrison stressed that he “always treated former prime ministers of both political persuasions with the utmost of dignity and respect”, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, took a more aggressive tack against Turnbull. “Mr Turnbull’s approach is that because if he doesn’t get every present under the tree, he’s going to create a form of chaos that makes this nation where we stand, weaker,” Joyce told Sky News. “It’s not about Mr Turnbull just tossing out his former allegiance to the party that made him the PM of Australia, it’s the fact that … he’s inherently going to inspire a process that makes our nation weaker.” Morrison was also pressed on the quiet scrapping of a $1.3bn armed drones program to partly offset the cost of the March budget’s cybersecurity package dubbed Redspice. Labor has promised, if elected, to urgently review the Coalition’s “bewildering” decision to scrap the armed drones program, but Morrison said there were “always difficult choices to be made in defence”. Earlier on Friday, Anthony Albanese toughed out an increasingly aggressive press conference seeking to re-litigate the fairness of questions asking him to recite the six points of Labor’s national disability insurance scheme policy. “People are entitled to ask questions,” he said, after arguing on Thursday evening the media was too focused on “soundbites”. Albanese brushed off interjections, telling reporters “I’m in charge” and “you had your opportunity and now it is my turn to answer” as they peppered him with questions about his recovery from Covid and the NDIS. “Let me tell you what the NDIS is about. It is not about gotcha questions. “What leadership is about is determining when there is a problem, identifying it, and then coming up with solutions. “We did that in government. We created the NDIS. We are doing that from opposition under Bill Shorten who … is coming up with solutions to stop the cuts and to put people back at the centre of the NDIS.” Albanese forcefully rejected the suggestion the answer didn’t rule out cuts, rounding on the media for pressing him on that point. “This is an example of what is putting people off politics. You cannot have a clearer answer than that.” Albanese described holding a royal commission into covid as a “very important” idea but refused to give a commitment on timing, noting the pandemic is “still having an impact”, with 50 dead on just one day he had been in isolation. Later, Morrison noted government officials had attended hearings of the Covid Senate committee over its two years of operation. “My focus is on continuing to manage Australia’s response to the pandemic,” he said. “And there’ll be a time to address those issues once the pandemic has concluded.”",News/World news,Scott Morrison denies Solomon Islands ‘red lines’ rhetoric puts Australia more at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/scott-morrison-denies-solomon-islands-red-lines-rhetoric-puts-australia-more-at-risk
