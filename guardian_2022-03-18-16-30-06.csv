3/18/2022,"In the light of current events, it’s hard to watch this lyrical, emotionally rich adaptation of Min Jin Lee’s novel about four generations of a Korean family without thinking about how the sweep of big history interacts, often tragically, with individual lives. But Pachinko would have been an exceptional piece of work regardless of context. The story follows Sunja (played by Yuh-Jung Youn, Yu-na Jeon and Minha Kim) – a girl born into a Korea struggling under Japanese occupation, who experiences huge upheaval. While the scope of the narrative is wide, redemption is always to be found in the intimacies of human kindness.Apple TV+, from Friday 25 March This wildly popular Regency drama ticks a remarkable number of boxes: period nostalgia underpinned by modern raunch; a panracial, pansexual outlook; and, of course, the delightfully meta touch provided by the running commentary of gossip columnist Lady Whistledown (Julie Andrews). As we rejoin London’s high society, the search for a new “diamond” is on and the Queen (Golda Rosheuvel) is concerned: “Apathy is a blight the monarchy simply cannot endure.” Wise words and, with the dashing Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) looking for love, a worry the royal is unlikely to have to endure for long.Netflix, from Friday 25 March It’s a long way from Mary Berry, but in the ecosystem of food-related television this gloriously pointless show occupies a distinct niche. On the basis of a clip that went viral a couple of years ago, it’s clear that seeing cakes almost identical to everyday objects is an itch many of us needed to scratch. Mikey Day presents this fleshed-out version of that video as bakers (happily, all aware of the mind-boggling absurdity of their endeavours) compete to make the non-cakiest cakes possible. And why not? Expect to see bowling pins, trainers and rubber ducks.Netflix, out now Nowadays, if your favourite show is cancelled, don’t despair. If enough people care, fans have a good chance of exerting sufficient pressure to reverse the decision. It has been proved with this seaside period drama based on an unfinished Jane Austen manuscript: months of campaigning has ensured that the show’s Midsummer Ball cliffhanger will now be resolved. There’s even a nod to the circumstances around the return, as Anne Reid’s Lady Denham says to heroine Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams): “I rather thought we’d seen the last of you.” Not a bit of it.BritBox, from Monday 21 March Some real sex education on Netflix. This series explores female desire, attempting to connect sexual pleasure to autonomy, attainment and fulfilment in other areas of life. Comedian Michelle Buteau presents engagingly, discussing issues surrounding self-esteem, sex positivity, masturbation and “the orgasm gap” (think the gender wage gap only a fair bit sexier). The tone can feel a little forced at times, lurching between pseudo-scientific discourse and a slightly twee coyness, but the subject matter is long overdue for serious discussion.Netflix, from Tuesday 22 March “Girls that look like me,” says Lizzo, “don’t get representation.” Well, now they do as this cheering new series sees the rap icon looking for dancers to join her on her world tour. On the face of it, this is just a simple reality show contest. But, eventually, something more uplifting and even profound begins to emerge as the contenders move into the Big Grrrls House and begin to ponder the serious business of, as one dancer puts it, “learning to love yourself in a world that doesn’t love you back”.Amazon Prime Video, from Friday 25 March Olivia Rodrigo has achieved a lot for a 19-year-old. So much, in fact, that she’s already releasing slightly wistful films looking back at her recent past. In this documentary, she recalls the writing and recording of her monumentally successful 2021 debut album, Sour, and ponders the specific emotions surrounding it. Rodrigo feels like a very new kind of pop star – her career is both minutely commercially planned (the Disney hook-up goes back to her early teens) and creatively autonomous. This film captures a key phase in that process.Disney+, from Friday 25 March",Arts/Television & radio,Pachinko to Bridgerton: the seven best shows to stream this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/18/pachinko-to-bridgerton-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week
3/18/2022,"It’s happening again: elderly people suddenly getting poorer. Since the dawn of time, to be old was to be poor. Workhouses were abandoned not out of revulsion at their practices, but because virtually everyone in them became too old and sick to work. William Beveridge’s state pension was universal partly because many old people were too poor to be worth means-testing. An under-heralded success of the Brown and Blair years was to lift so many older people out of poverty that by 2010, for the first time ever, pensioners were less likely to be poor than the rest of the population. Some still fell below the threshold, but the number was too small to tilt the statistics. Still, there’s no gratitude in politics, so it didn’t stop them voting Tory in ever greater numbers with each year of ageing. In 2019, 64% of over-65s voted Tory, compared with just 19% of under 24s. Age only became the strongest predictor of voting after 1980, when those two-thirds of older people turned less generous and redistribution-minded than older cohorts before them. Mindful of that, the Tories showered pensioners with higher benefits while chopping support for the rest, especially children. A triple lock guaranteed the pension rose every year by whichever was highest – inflation, 2.5% or average wages. But no longer. The chancellor abolished the lock this year, assuming inflation was a temporary blip. The Centre for Ageing Better’s annual report, published on 17 March, finds that there were 200,000 more poor pensioners in 2021. That means nearly one in five now falls below the official poverty threshold. The trend for working longer has gone into reverse: many older people lost their jobs during the pandemic, with their incomes plunging when they didn’t find new work. Now add the shocking finding that life expectancy has gone into reverse, along with years of healthy life. Shocking too is the steep rise of 92,000 more pensioners trapped in private renting, most likely to be “non-decent” homes, as home ownership among older people falls. Sally West, Age UK’s policy manager, is appalled that some elderly people in need of money are selling their homes and renting instead: “a bad mistake”, she says. But here’s the statistical tyranny of averages. Elderly people are most likely to be very rich too, as inequality between pensioners rises higher than among other generations. Since the 2008 crash, two-thirds of all the extra wealth created has gone to the over-65s, according to Prof Bobby Duffy, author of Generations. Insane property booms vastly enriched those who bought long ago, and over-50s, just a third of the population, do half of all consuming. While they’re cruising, young families are sinking. Duffy shows inequality is greatest within generations, not between them, with wealth sealed by inheritance. The political question is how to persuade wealthy older generations to vote for the interests of young people, rather than only their own. Maybe the government doesn’t much mind more old people joining the ranks of the poor, if they reckon they belong to the third of pensioners who don’t vote Tory. Here’s the government’s disgraceful dereliction. Pension credit, devised by Labour to stop old-age poverty, is a minimum income guarantee: that currently stands at a meagre £177.10 for a single person, but it takes them just over the poverty line. But a third don’t claim it, because they don’t know they’re owed it. Nor do they know of other benefits that come with it – help with rent, council tax, a free TV licence and an extra payment if they are carers. Ministers like to pretend it’s because they’re “proud”, but this is a scandal: every single one of those 1.3 million pensioners missing their credit could easily be found by the Department for Work and Pensions, as it already sends them their basic pension. The DWP knows who those people are and where they live. DWP data is linked to HMRC, so the department could identify those too poor to pay any tax as a first step. It could knock on every door – or commission local Age UK groups and others to check every pensioner gets what they are owed. But why would it do that? No doubt, next week’s budget will deliver a few modest mitigations for the great cost of living crisis, but if this chancellor bothered about the crisis happening in low-income households, he would never have cut the £20 a week uplift to universal credit. The 50 charities, Gordon Brown and more than 50 local council leaders writing to him this week all point to huge income losses for 9 million low-income families due to only raising benefits by 3.1%, not the real 7% inflation rate. There is no need to pit one generation against another when it comes to poverty. Polling shows young people are remarkably generous in wanting to protect older people, according to Duffy. That’s far more than the other way round. The big question is how to lever some of the unearned wealth out of my lucky generation of home owners with old-fashioned work pensions, and redistribute it to whoever needs it, of whatever age. Maybe this news of growing pensioner poverty might make Tory-voting oldies more willing to shell out for the destitute of their own generation than they have been for the nation’s young. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion, Pensioner poverty is at a new high – so why are older people still voting Tory? | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/18/pensioner-poverty-tory-crisis-wealth-rich-pensioners
3/18/2022,"Sacked P&O workers have spoken of their devastation after they unexpectedly lost their jobs on Thursday, warning that the redundancies will wreak major damage on a local community in which many people’s livelihoods depend on the shipping company. Employees were angry that P&O had delivered the message in an online meeting, and dismayed that handcuff-trained security guards were employed to take crew members off ships. They said they had watched former colleagues, who had woken up this morning expecting to complete a normal shift, carry their bags off ships in floods of tears. Furious ex-staff held a demonstration close to the ports around lunchtime, but had dispersed by early afternoon amid concerns about the impact on their severance offer. One former employee said many of his ex-colleagues were worried about how they will pay their mortgages, especially since in many households in Dover “both breadwinners” work for P&O. One 46-year-old P&O crew member, who has worked on the decks for 30 years, said he was worried about how he would support his family with two young children. “The news still hasn’t really sunk in. There aren’t many opportunities in this area,” he said. “There was no ‘thank you for your service’. There were grown men in tears worrying what to do about their mortgages. We’ve been treated abysmally. This was planned for ages, it’s not off the hoof,” he added. The three former P&O employees who spoke to the Guardian, who between them had given the company 100 years of service, asked not to be named due to P&O’s policy against speaking to the media. Commiserating over beers in the RMT office, they were visibly distraught, but were comforted by messages of support on social media and from MPs debating the issue in parliament. They said that the terms and conditions for the new agency jobs are so poor that they did not plan to re-apply for roles as they would not be able to support their families. The workers also worried about the impact on safety of the crews’ rapid replacement since the new staff members have less training and experience than those they have replaced. The new workers will be employed by an agency, and the RMT understands that employees will be paid less, with a possibility that European employees could receive below minimum wage on the Calais to Dover crossing since this operates under international maritime law, as Irish Ferries has done. They are not expected to receive sick pay or holiday. RMT’s national secretary, Darren Procter, said he understood that P&O ferries would not operate for around a week while the new crew are trained on the ship. He added that the new crew members have signed non-disclosure agreements. The union plans to fight the redundancies by putting pressure on ministers, including to persuade them to remove freeport status from DP World, which owns P&O, and to detain the vessels while the dispute is resolved. An initial meeting on Thursday evening did not result in any concrete action, but the shipping minister, Robert Courts, has pledged to consider next steps, he said. The RMT also plans to continue hosting demonstrations across the UK, with one demo planned in Dover for noon on Friday. “We’re not going to stand by and watch this happen,” Procter said. He said the union was currently exploring whether P&O’s approach, which he described as “fire and rehire”, had breached employment law. He added it was the first time he had seen this approach in the maritime industry. “This is aggression on a different scale. These guys brought in jabs during the pandemic, and this is how they treat the staff. We’re a maritime nation, seafaring is the foundation of what we do. P&O is one of the most iconic companies in the UK,” he said.",News/Business,‘There were grown men in tears’: P&O crews stunned by sackings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/there-were-grown-men-in-tears-po-crews-stunned-by-sackings
3/18/2022,"It’s given the world ABBA, Celine Dion, the Finnish heavy metal band Lordi, a made-for-Netflix tribute musical, and inspiration for untold generations of fashion school runway shows. But with Eurovision Song Contest finally coming to America, it’s fair to ask whether its reception in the US will mirror such transatlantic successes as The Office, Rosalía and pizza, or suffer the ignominious fates of Piers Morgan, Robbie Williams and the modern welfare state. The American Song Contest (we’re as confused as you about why it’s not called Amerivision) promises to be “the biggest live music event America has ever seen”, according to NBC, which begins airing the show on 21 March. It will substitute the US’s 50-odd states, districts and territories for Europe’s 50-odd countries and, we imagine, open up new frontiers for ways Americans can resent each other. In the old-country version, each participating nation sends an artist to perform an original song, in an event televised before hundreds of millions. Viewers in each country then weigh in as a bloc to determine a winner. But as any Eurovision fan knows, it’s not just about the music – it’s about politics and geography, with Scandinavian nations typically voting for each other and everyone voting against the UK. (After Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Eurovision initially argued that the contest was a “non-political cultural event” before bowing to public pressure and banning Russia from the 2022 contest.) While the precise rules for ASC have yet to be announced, the show is sure to foster new alliances and rivalries. Will everyone hate California because it already rules the entertainment industry? Will the supposedly nice people of the midwest band together or stab each other in the back? Could a kitschy earworm save America from civil war – or be the last straw? Will Americans just ignore politics and vote for the best song? Here’s our guide to the musical traditions and regional rivalries that we can look forward to: Represented by: Ni/Co (pop duo). Musical heroes: Wilson Pickett, Martha Reeves, Emmylou Harris, Nat King Cole, Hank Williams Sr, the guy who comes from Alabama with a banjo on his knee. Potential alliances: With its wide-ranging musical history, Alabama could go in many directions. Ni/Co sings pop, but the state might tie itself to Tennessee, where Nashville is the home of country music; it could also look to Michigan, in honor of Detroit and Motown. Given local politics – not to mention geography – Tennessee seems more likely. Sworn enemies: Florida, thanks to a passionate football rivalry between the University of Alabama’s Crimson Tide and the University of Florida’s Gators. Represented by: Jewel (folk/pop). Musical heroes: Hobo Jim, the state’s official balladeer; Jewel. Known for: Alaska Native folk music; Jewel’s trademark blend of confessional ballads, catchy pop beats and sudden shifts into frog voice; Sarah Palin rapping Baby Got Back. Potential alliances: Hawaii, in a show of non-contiguous solidarity. Sworn enemies: Hawaii, in a show of non-contiguous rivalry. Represented by: Tenelle (pop/reggae). Musical heroes: Tenelle, Napoleon Tuiteleleapaga. Potential alliances: Though people from American Samoa are US nationals, they can’t vote in US elections. They could team up with similarly disfranchised Americans in the other four permanently inhabited US territories. Represented by: Las Marias (mariachi/norteñas). Musical heroes: Alice Cooper, Jordin Sparks, Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Nicks, Jimmy Eat World. Known for: Rock that’s sometimes pretty loud but not offensively so. Potential alliances: Arizonans might feel a kinship with Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming, where residents are equally familiar with extremely dry conditions. Sworn enemies: California. When the state next door boasts the world’s fifth-biggest economy, has markedly different politics, and gets way more attention than you do, you’re going to hate it. Represented by: Kelsey Lamb (country/pop). Musical heroes: Johnny Cash, Al Green, Glen Campbell. Known for: Ex-governors who “rock”, including saxophonist Bill Clinton and bassist Mike Huckabee – they play music, so they must be human! Potential alliances: Arkansas is the birthplace of Walmart, so it might find a kindred spirit in Washington state, birthplace of such culture-destroying corporations as Amazon and Starbucks. Sworn enemies: Kansas, which has basically the same name but pronounces it completely differently. Represented by: Sweet Taboo (pop/hip-hop/Latin/R&B). Musical heroes: All of them, including “Weird Al” Yankovic. Known for: Every song you like. Potential alliances: New York, a fellow cultural powerhouse that believes itself to be its own country. Sworn enemies: Florida, which is California for conservatives. Represented by: Riker Lynch (rock/pop). Musical heroes: Judy Collins, the Lumineers, John Denver, Earth, Wind and Fire. Known for: Folk, jam bands, bluegrass, jam bands that play folkie bluegrass. Potential alliances: California. People from Denver are essentially the same as people from the Bay Area: they work in tech, they think they’re laid back, and they performatively enjoy the outdoors. All dating profiles are required to include at least one photo in which the subject is dangling from a giant rock. Sworn enemies: Appalachian states. You call those mountains? Represented by: Michael Bolton (soft rock). Musical heroes: Michael Bolton, the Carpenters, John Mayer. Known for: The dulcet tones of adult contemporary. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: Will New England be the Scandinavia of the American Song Contest? The parallels are there: both are loosely affiliated groups of jurisdictions with lots of white progressives, peppered with rightwing crazies. It remains to be seen whether these states will lift each other up or tear each other down. Represented by: Nitro Nitra (soul/rock). Musical heroes: The Bad to the Bone guy. Known for: Joe Biden. Potential alliances: Delaware is one of five states without sales tax, along with Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. Alliances have been founded on shakier grounds. Sworn enemies: Despite being so small it’s barely visible, Delaware has a north-south divide that mirrors the country’s – with northern liberals, southern conservatives, different dialects and clashing ways of life. Delaware might vote against itself. Represented by: Ale Zabala (Latin pop). Musical heroes: Ray Charles, Pitbull, Tom Petty, Limp Bizkit, Ariana Grande, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Known for: A broad range of music, from pop to Latin to southern rock. Potential alliances: New York, whose residents typically fly south for the winter in a yearly migration pattern. Sworn enemies: California, which is Florida for liberals. Represented by: Stela Cole (pop). Musical heroes: Outkast, Little Richard, Gucci Mane, TLC, James Brown, Otis Redding, REM. Known for: Hip-hop in Atlanta, college rock in Athens, soul on the midnight train. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: If recent history is any guide, the question for Georgia is not whom it will align with but whether its electoral infrastructure will survive at all. Will a few low-profile music officials be willing to stick their necks out when the runner-up calls, demanding they find a few thousand more votes? Represented by: Jason J (alternative/reggae). Musical heroes: Pia Mia, JD Crutch. Potential alliances: Guam could join an alliance of US territories, where residents are US nationals or citizens but can’t vote in US elections. Sworn enemies: Pia Mia, Guam’s biggest pop star, has an on-again/off-again BFFship with Kylie Jenner of California. Perhaps the contest will settle things once and for all. Represented by: Bronson Varde (reggae/“Jawaiian”). Musical heroes: Israel Kamakawiwoʻole, Jack Johnson, Nicole Scherzinger, Bruno Mars. Potential alliances: Fellow island jurisdictions from Puerto Rico to Guam. Sworn enemies: Rhode Island. How dare it call itself an island. Represented by: Andrew Sheppard (rock). Musical heroes: Josh Ritter, Built to Spill, Paul Revere and the Raiders. Known for: Folk, rock, folk-rock. Potential alliances: Could the potato state team up with the tomato state? See New Jersey. Sworn enemies: California. Idahoans hate Californians. Represented by: Justin Jesso (pop). Musical heroes: Miles Davis, Muddy Waters, Herbie Hancock, Wilco, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West. Known for: Blues. Potential alliances: Louisiana. Though you wouldn’t know it from listening to Justin Jesso, New Orleans is considered the birthplace of jazz, and Chicago, of course, has a rich jazz history of its own – it may have been the first place the term was used in print to describe music. Sworn enemies: Illinois is apparently its own worst enemy: a 2014 survey found half the population wanted out for work- and weather-related reasons. Represented by: UG skywalkin (hip-hop). Musical heroes: Cole Porter, Babyface, Axl Rose, the Jacksons. Potential alliances: Indiana, “the crossroads of America”, has a thing for cars. (It got its nickname thanks to a key early highway intersection; it’s also, of course, home to the Indianapolis 500 race.) Perhaps it will unite with another Great Lakes state, Michigan, where so many of those cars come from. Sworn enemies: Anyone who detests Mike Pence. Represented by: Alisabeth Von Presley (pop/rock). Musical heroes: The Everly Brothers, Glenn Miller, Patty Larkin, Slipknot. Known for: Easy listening, plus Slipknot. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: If your state can produce both the Everly Brothers and the band behind People=Shit, your leanings are unpredictable. Represented by: Broderick Jones (pop/R&B). Musical heroes: Melissa Etheridge, Martina McBride, Kansas, Dorothy Gale. Potential alliances: The physical center of the contiguous US is in Kansas, which could foster an egalitarian spirit, meaning the state votes purely on musical merit. Sworn enemies: But that won’t happen. Kansas and Missouri despise each other, with a seething college football rivalry between the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri. You’d probably hate your neighbor, too, if you had to share your biggest city with them. Represented by: Jordan Smith (pop/contemporary Christian/gospel). Musical heroes: Loretta Lynn, Bill Monroe, Chris Stapleton. Known for: Country and bluegrass. Potential alliances: Despite having produced Mitch McConnell, Kentucky has been dubbed “the kindest state”, so presumably it’ll vote for everyone. Sworn enemies: Like Kansas and Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee have a bitter feud that plays out on the college football field. Don’t expect any votes for Tennessee from its northern neighbor. Represented by: Brittany Pfantz (rock/gospel/swamp pop). Musical heroes: Louis Armstrong, Lucinda Williams, Frank Ocean, Britney Spears, Leadbelly, Dr John, Fats Domino. Known for: Jazz. Potential alliances: See Illinois. Sworn enemies: Given its thriving music scene, Louisiana might see the similarly lauded California, New York, Tennessee and Michigan as threats to be squashed. Represented by: King Kyote (rock/folk). Musical heroes: Patty Griffin, Ray LaMontagne. Known for: Rock lobsters. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: See Connecticut. Represented by: Sisqó (R&B/hip hop soul/pop). Musical heroes: Billie Holiday, Tori Amos, Toni Braxton, David Byrne, Cass Elliot, Frank Zappa. Potential alliances: Maryland could swoop in to support lonely Washington DC, which has no state of its own. Unlike much of the US, Maryland residents support statehood for the city. Sworn enemies: Expect less friendly treatment for another neighbor, Virginia, the other state surrounding the nation’s capital. It’s the state Marylanders hate most, according to a totally unscientific but nonetheless fascinating Instagram investigation. Represented by: Jared Lee (pop). Musical heroes: Aerosmith, Pixies, Donna Summer, James Taylor. Potential alliances: As home to Boston, the de facto capital of New England, Massachusetts could see plenty of interstate support. Sworn enemies: As home to Boston, city of Red Sox and Patriots fans, Massachusetts could see plenty of interstate vitriol. Represented by: Ada LeAnn (acoustic pop). Musical heroes: Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, the Supremes, the Temptations, Madonna, Eminem, Lizzo. Known for: Motown. Potential alliances: See Indiana. Sworn enemies: Michigan has a good case to make for itself as America’s popular music capital, so it might seek to sabotage fellow contenders such as California, New York, Tennessee and Louisiana. See also: Ohio. Represented by: Yam Haus (dance/pop/rock). Musical heroes: Prince, Bob Dylan. Known for: Rock, pop. Potential alliances: As a state once governed by a professional wrestler, Jesse “the Body” Ventura, Minnesota might find a natural ally in California, once run by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sworn enemies: If the “Minnesota nice” stereotype is accurate, the state will praise all its competitors and then stab them in the back. Represented by: Keyoné Starr (soul/pop). Musical heroes: Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley, Howlin’ Wolf, BB King, Bo Diddley. Known for: Giving birth to the blues. Potential alliances: The blues connection makes Illinois an obvious ally, while the state could bond with Missouri over rock’n’roll. Sworn enemies: Darth Vader himself, James Earl Jones, was born here, so it’s only natural for Mississippians to vote against California, birthplace of Luke and Leia. Represented by: Brett Seper (rock/power pop). Musical heroes: Chuck Berry, Scott Joplin, Charlie Parker, Sheryl Crow, Nelly. Potential alliances: Rock’n’roll roots could link Missouri to Mississippi. Sworn enemies: See Kansas. Represented by: Jonah Prill (country). Musical heroes: David Lynch (he does music, too!) Also, the bassist from Pearl Jam. Known for: Film-making and bass-playing in Pearl Jam. Potential alliances: Could join Idaho and Delaware in an alliance of states still seeking to make their mark on the music world. Sworn enemies: California, for hogging a disproportionate share of stardom. Represented by: Jocelyn (folk/rock/pop). Musical heroes: Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes. Known for: Sad indie stuff. Potential alliances: The American Song Contest doesn’t have much to offer the indie kids – they’ll have to spend a melancholy night alone. But would they have it any other way? Sworn enemies: Nebraska is the birthplace of Kool-Aid, so if it doesn’t hate Florida, birthplace of Gatorade, it should. Represented by: The Crystal Method (electronic). Musical heroes: Wayne Newton, the Killers, Jenny Lewis, Ne-Yo, Imagine Dragons, Panic! At the Disco. Known for: Lounge lizards and nostalgia acts. Potential alliances: As home to the UFO mysteries of Area 51, Nevada could team up with New Mexico, home to Roswell, where aliens definitely showed up in 1947. Sworn enemies: California, in another case of neighborly jealousy. Represented by: MARi (pop). Musical heroes: Mandy Moore, Adam Sandler. Known for: Actors who sing. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: See Connecticut. Represented by: Brooke Alexx (pop). Musical heroes: Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Lauryn Hill, Bon Jovi, Dionne Warwick. Known for: “They’re not booing – they’re saying Bruuuuuce.” Potential alliances: Could the tomato state team up with the potato state? See Idaho. Sworn enemies: According to Matt Shirley’s state-hatred study, New Jersey is the only state that “hates everyone”. Perhaps it will abstain from voting altogether. Represented by: Khalisol (soul/hip-hop). Musical heroes: Demi Lovato, the Shins. Known for: New Mexico music is its own genre, influenced by Pueblo, Hispanos and country music. Potential alliances: The real-life Smokey Bear is from New Mexico, so it may feel some solidarity with fellow wildfire-affected states across the American west. Sworn enemies: Microsoft was founded in New Mexico, and Jeff Bezos was born there. Both ended up in Washington state. New Mexicans might be angry about the loss – on the other hand, they could be grateful for the good riddance. Represented by: ENISA (pop/soul). Musical heroes: Everyone not from California. Known for: The ability to make it anywhere, given success locally. Potential alliances: Could team up with California to create an unstoppable popular music juggernaut. Sworn enemies: It’s not clear that New Yorkers are aware that other states exist at all. Represented by: John Morgan (country). Musical heroes: Nina Simone, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, J Cole, Ben Folds. Potential alliances: As the birthplace of flight, North Carolina is singlehandedly responsible for globalization. It should really vote for everyone. Sworn enemies: North Carolina is also the birthplace of Pepsi, so expect a vote against Georgia, birthplace of Coke. Represented by: Chloe Fredericks (country). Musical heroes: Wiz Khalifa, Peggy Lee, Bobby Vee, Lawrence Welk. Known for: There’s a whole book about its metal scene. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: As in New England, the question here is whether the Dakotas will build each other up or tear each other down. A longtime public servant told South Dakota Public Broadcasting: “Everybody knows North Dakota and South Dakota are like brothers – you may fight a lot,” he said, but ultimately, “you get along and love each other.” Represented by: Sabyu (island reggae/jazz/soul). Musical heroes: KC and Daniel DeLeon Guerrero, Flora Baza Quan. Potential alliances: The islands could team up with their neighbor Guam; both have a strong history of CHamoru folk music, which has influenced Sabyu’s creative output. Represented by: Macy Gray (R&B/soul). Musical heroes: John Legend, Chrissy Hynde, Dean Martin, Tracy Chapman, the Isley Brothers, Devo. Potential alliances: As home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Ohio should really stand for unity in popular music, choosing acts based on their merits, not interstate squabbles … Sworn enemies: … but Ohio has a major feud with Michigan, dating back to a mostly bloodless 19th-century war over the boundary between the jurisdictions. These days, the states vent their anger on the college football field. Represented by: AleXa (K-pop). Musical heroes: Woody Guthrie, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, Merle Haggard, the Flaming Lips, Hanson. Oddest series of music-related decisions: The Flaming Lips’ Do You Realize?? was named the state’s official rock song in 2009 following a survey of 21,000 people. The decision had to be finalized via executive order from the Democratic governor, after a lawmaker in the Republican-controlled legislature complained about a hammer-and-sickle T-shirt worn by a band member. The governor’s Republican successor did not renew the executive order, so it’s no longer the official state rock song. Potential alliances: In addition to producing an array of country music stars, Oklahoma itself is the state most like a country song – based on rates of pickup truck sales, divorces, cowboys, and alcohol consumption, according to an investigation by a real estate site. So Tennessee, home of Nashville, is a good bet, even if AleXa herself is no country performer. Sworn enemies: Oklahoma is among the most college football-obsessed states, and the University of Oklahoma and University of Texas have a serious rivalry that could spill over into the Song Contest. Represented by: courtship. (indie pop). Musical heroes: Sleater-Kinney, the Decemberists, the Dandy Warhols. Known for: The dream of the 90s remaining alive. Potential alliances: Pacific north-west solidarity could create an alliance between Oregon and Washington state. Sworn enemies: Oregonians are no fans of California for a wide range of reasons, generally related to the idea that they are coming north and ruining everything for the locals. The animosity is so powerful that to downvote a post on Oregon’s Reddit page, users click an outline of California. Represented by: Bri Steves (rap). Musical heroes: Taylor Swift, the Roots, Will Smith, Christina Aguilera, Boyz II Men, Meek Mill. Potential alliances and sworn enemies: Philadelphia, where fans are known for throwing snowballs at Santa Claus and routinely booing their own players, rivals Boston for terrible sports fans. The city particularly hates the NFL’s Giants and Cowboys, which could prompt votes against New York and Texas. This prickly attitude could also be bad news for neighboring New Jersey – unless Philadelphians allow their love for going “down the shore” to supersede complaints about New Jersey drivers. Represented by: Christian Pagán (pop). Musical heroes: Ricky Martin, Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny, José Feliciano, Tito Matos. Potential alliances: More people of Puerto Rican descent live on the mainland than on the island, forging strong ties to New York and Florida. Represented by: Hueston (pop). Musical heroes: Deer Tick. Potential alliances: Rhode Island’s state beverage is coffee milk, which is like chocolate milk but with coffee syrup.

Potential alliances: South Carolina played a role in the development of barbecue in the US, and it could team up with states such as Missouri and Texas to form a BBQ alliance. Sworn enemies: In another food-based distinction, Georgia is famous for its peaches, but South Carolina likes to rib its neighbor over the fact that it actually produces more of them.

3/18/2022,"The American rightwing media’s trumpeting of a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian biological facilities that masked a clandestine bioweapons programme has now rocketed from a fringe QAnon channel directly to Fox News and Donald Trump Jr. The Russian propaganda machine is so engaged in sowing disinformation about their invasion of Ukraine that they are even ordering Russian TV to broadcast one of the bioweapon theory’s largest boosters: Tucker Carlson. The conspiracy theory began in seeming obscurity. In the hours after Russia launched its aerial bombardment of Ukraine, the Twitter account of a longtime follower of the QAnon conspiracy movement remarked that some 30 biolabs were dotted across Ukraine. “China and Russia indirectly (and correctly) blamed the US for the [COVID-19] outbreak,” the user, who goes by the username @WarClandestine, tweeted. “And are fearful that the US/allies have more viruses (bioweapons) to let out.” The invasion, he posited, was truly about destroying those facilities and the viruses they contained. In effect, this theory was just a remix of an allegation that Moscow has made for years: accusing the United States of running a secret bioweapons program, often in eastern Europe. A close adviser to President Vladimir Putin alleged last year that Washington “deliberately caused” the coronavirus pandemic and pointed his finger at US-funded laboratories near Russian and Chinese borders. In January, the Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva wrote a sensationalist piece accusing the US of conducting biological experiments on Ukrainian and Georgian soldiers. Gaytandzhieva has previously published overt Russian disinformation, and her reporting was picked up by pro-Russian channels. Gaytandzhieva was even awarded a journalism prize last month by a pro-Russian Latvian politician to “encourage her for new research”, according to a press release. Around the same time, John Mark Dougan – an American in Moscow, on the lam from wiretapping and extortion charges in Florida – began posting a similar theory, citing a Ukrainian whistleblower. “Washington and its funded laboratories are playing a very dangerous game with these viruses,” he warned in a December 2021 video. This disinformation laid the groundwork for the QAnon-linked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian biolabs in late February. In less than 24 hours, far-right US conspiracy site Infowars, which played a particularly acute role in promoting Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, ran a story based on the allegation. The headline read: Russian Strikes Targeting US-Run Bio-Labs in Ukraine? From there, the theory percolated through an array of QAnon and conspiracy theory websites, podcasts and video channels. The very core of the story is true: the Department of Defense funds biological research and laboratories in Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe and the Caucasus, in order to surveil emerging infectious diseases and to keep secure facilities that housed a Soviet bioweapons program. But Washington insists that it does not fund biological weapons research anywhere, much less in Ukraine – a claim backed up by a bevy of international organisations and non-proliferation advocates. Despite that, the claim made its way to Tucker Carlson Tonight, which boasts more than 3 million viewers a night on Fox News. On his show, Carlson insisted that the United States was “funding the creation of deadly pathogens” and played clips of spokespeople for the Russian and Chinese regimes, accusing Washington of operating a bioweapons programme in Europe. Carlson pursued the story on three different episodes of his show over the past week. On 10 March, he brought on writer Glenn Greenwald. “When the government comes out and emphatically denies that they have biological weapons,” Greenwald said. “We know they’re not telling the truth.” These claims have led to an active feedback loop with Russian state propaganda. Tass, the Russian news agency seen as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin, has recently accused “Ukrainian radicals” of planning to use “toxic chemicals” against Russian forces or even Ukrainian civilians. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has said publicly that these labs are “deadly threats” to the Russian state. These claims have been promoted widely by an array of Russian social media channels, television stations and commentators. The interplay between American reporting on these biolabs and the Russian response is no accident. Mother Jones obtained a missive from the department of information and telecommunications support, instructing Russian media to, per a translation, “use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson”. Specifically, the department called on its mouthpieces in Russian media to highlight “activities of military biological laboratories with American participation on the territory of Ukraine carried global threats to Russia and Europe”. All told, the propaganda effort might be an effort to cover up something much more sinister in its own backyard. In a 2021 report, the US state department took the extraordinary step of accusing Moscow of continuing its Soviet-era bioweapons program. While Russia submits annual reports to the United Nations stating it has no active bioweapons program, Washington said it assesses that “the Russian Federation has revised plans and funding to its national chemical and biological facilities.” But the effort continues, even when contradictory. On Thursday, state propaganda outlet Sputnik published new documents which, they claim, show “components of biological weapons were being created in Ukraine with direct US involvement and financing”. The US documents themselves, however, clearly contradict that. The Pentagon’s funding will “help to detect, prevent, and predict disease emergence in the region”, reads a 2019 request for funding, reportedly released from the Russian defense ministry.",News/Media,How ‘Ukrainian bioweapons labs’ myth went from QAnon fringe to Fox News,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/18/ukrainian-bioweapons-labs-qanon-fox-news
3/18/2022,"Nestled beneath waterfall country in the south western tip of the Brecon Beacons national park, the town of Glynneath is perfectly positioned to exploit the visitors drawn to the beauty of the landscape. It is as Jacob Rees-Mogg said in the House of Commons, our green and pleasant land. But a powerful group of Tory MPs pushing back against the need to pivot away from fossil fuels to meet the UK’s net zero targets believe it should play host not to a future involving clean air, renewable energy and sympathetic tourism but to the revival of the coal industry. As energy prices soar, and Russia’s war in Ukraine forces many countries to review their energy supplies, politicians in the net zero scrutiny group are embarked upon a battle with the party and the wider public over the climate crisis. They call for cuts to green taxes, a return to fracking and an increase in fossil fuel extraction; despite evidence that the scrapping of climate policies over the last decade has raised UK energy bills by £2.5bn. The latest focal point is a colliery which sits at the western edge of Glynneath, off the A465. Rees Mogg’s rallying call to continue to dig for anthracite – hard coal – at the Aberpergwm colliery was granted when the Coal Authority, which sits within the UK government, agreed to extend the licence to its owners EnergyBuild Mining Ltd to allow it to extract up to 40m tonnes of coal over the next 18 years. Most of it will be used at Port Talbot steelworks, which has been identified by the Welsh government as an area it must address to cut carbon emissions. The Welsh government says it was powerless to intervene because the conditional licence to the company preceded new devolution powers that came into force in 2018. The licence was granted just weeks after Boris Johnson hosted the Cop26 climate conference and called on other countries to “consign coal to history”. Local activist Dai Richards says the area is in need of regeneration: “The focus, I believe, should be on creating jobs for tourism and driving the focus for the area towards this growing industry.” “We probably have the best collection of accessible waterfalls in the UK on our doorstep, we are on the edge of the Brecon Beacons which is rising in popularity as a holiday destination. There is a new zipline just opened a couple of miles away … It’s a tourism revolution bypassing Glynneath because politicians and civil servants alike are too small minded to see beyond the rape of the land and the pollution of the world for greed and profit.” Aside from local pollution concerns, the impact of the new Aberpergwm scheme on the UK’s commitment to net zero could be devastating. If burned, it is estimated the coal could emit more than 100m tonnes of CO2 over the mine’s lifetime. But there is some strong support for the extension of the mine from those living around it. Local councillors – all of whom are on the mine’s liaison committee with the community – are swayed more by what they say is the need to save jobs. The colliery employs 160 people, including 16 apprentices, and the company promises it is diversifying the uses of the anthracite. Del Morgan, Plaid Cymru councillor for the town council, said he had to protect jobs in his community. “What I am being told by the company is there are opportunities for the mine to evolve fairly rapidly from the old way to use the anthracite in clean industries. They are doing so already. There are 160 jobs there, and if you take the licence away and close the mine they will go. This is needed.” Most of the coal will be destined for Port Talbot steelworks, which produces 15% of Wales’s carbon emissions. Another 20% will go to domestic heating. Whatever the uses of the coal in future, the extraction itself would produce up to 1.17m tonnes of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, according to research by Global Energy Monitor. For some, the tradeoff of the climate in favour of jobs is not one worth making. Alyn Evans spent decades working at Aberpergwm, which was closed in 1985 by the National Coal Board, and reopened in 2011, before closing again and reopening in 2018. “This claim that there will be local jobs is one of the main reasons I am fighting against this mine,” said Evans, who is now in his seventies. “I would say there are probably about less than 10 local people working in the underground jobs. “There are no local miners any more, they are all dead or too old. No one wants to work the shifts now, it is a myth that this mine will provide large numbers of local jobs.“ Instead, he said, the reality was that Glynneath would be subjected once more to pollution, the coalmine at the bottom of the town would remain an “eyesore” and an obstacle to developing tourism, while the wider environment would be subjected to more climate-heating greenhouse gases. “For every cubic metre of anthracite coalmined, 42 cubic metres of methane is released, probably the most toxic gas in the atmosphere, and they have been given a licence to extract 40m tonnes of it. This is not the future we should be going for,” he said. Another local resident, Emma Eynon, said as a traditional mining community it was right to celebrate “our proud history”, but that what was needed now was investment in a new future. “The communities in my local area have been suffering for many years with a lack of investment by the Welsh government,” said Eynon. “Our communities are desperate for real investment and support … we want to move forward with tourism, small business growth and local regeneration plans which will mean real jobs with real futures.” Energybuild has said the Aberpergwm project would sustain 160 jobs and dozens more in the supply chain. It has promised to gradually move away from supplying steelworks at Port Talbot and said it aims to have a greater share of its coal destined for other end uses such as water filtration, which at present accounts for about 15% of its market. The firm says it is the only producer of anthracite for filter media in Europe. The granting of the licence now faces a legal challenge by campaign group Coal Action Network, which successfully fought against opencast mines in the north-east of England. Coal Action Network said other mining companies would be watching the Aberpergwm project closely, warning it could spark a disastrous new wave of coal mining applications. A decision is expected soon on plans for the first new deep coalmine in the UK for 30 years in Cumbria. Isobel Tarr, of Coal Action Network, said: “This is a time to be investing in alternative technologies for producing steel and it is well past the time to be investing in something better for these communities who have a vision for post-coal. The Welsh government must listen if it is to commit to leaving coal in the past.” Energybuild was contacted by the Guardian but did not provide a comment. A Welsh government spokesperson said: “We have been clear that we do not support the extraction of fossil fuels and are focused on the climate emergency. We do not have the powers to make a decision in the case of Aberpergwm. This licence pre-dates our powers on coal licensing. “The fundamental issue is having a Coal Authority whose duty is to maintain a coal mining industry in the UK. We have been calling for the UK government to change this duty in the Coal Industry Act to reflect the climate emergency.”",News/Environment,‘Not the future we should be going for’: the reopening of Wales’s Aberpergwm coalmine,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/18/not-the-future-we-should-be-going-for-the-reopening-of-waless-aberpergwm-coalmine
3/18/2022,"Putting a large concrete block used to protect coastlines against erosion at the top of a cliff rather than at the foot of it is odd, the artist Ryan Gander cheerfully admits. Calling it art may also get some people’s backs up too. But that’s fine. “I love Korean and Japanese food and I detest pizza,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have pizzerias.” On Friday Gander’s new work will be unveiled to the public, the first in an ambitious new sculpture trail planned for the Yorkshire coast. Positioned on Scarborough Castle headland, with its incredible coastal views, the work is in the form of a dolos, the concrete structures used as a defence against coastal erosion. Gander said he loved the shapes. “They are giant, concrete, brutalist-looking geometric forms that tessellate well together on the back of a lorry so they can be moved and they get placed on a beach in stacks,” he said. “What I love about them is they are so War of the Worlds, so alien. Dolos don’t seem of this world, there’s something extra terrestrial about them.” The work is called We are only human (Incomplete sculpture for Scarborough to be finished by snow). As the name suggests, the work is unfinished and only will be when snow falls on it. But that may not happen so often because of climate change. After the birth of his third child Gander said he became interested in how his son might well be someone who, in 20 years time, would brag that he remembered seeing real snow in the garden. “He might be of the generation to say, ‘oh I made a snowman!’ Which is kind of terrifying. If you take away the snow you’re left with an unfinished sculpture that can only be finished by nature, said Gander. “Because of human interference with nature, we can’t finish the sculpture. It’s like back to front … payback time.” Gander’s sculpture will be followed 10 days later by the unveiling of three benches for people to sit on along the Esk estuary, near Whitby harbour. The benches, the work of Juneau Projects, are there for people to enjoy the views and contemplate the wildlife. The sculpture trail project, titled Wild Eye, aims to encourage people to engage with wildlife and marine life along the Yorkshire coast. Gander’s dolos is cast in ultra-low carbon concrete which incorporates limestone formed from the shells and skeletons of prehistoric sea creatures. People can sit on it and they will hear audio clips from different voices connected to the project, including specialists from Yorkshire Wildlife Trust and English Heritage. Public sculpture on Britain’s coast is nothing new and it is often divisive; none more so, perhaps, than Maggi Hambling’s 4-metre high Scallop on the beach at Aldeburgh still seen as either a beauty or a blot on the coastal landscape. Gander said he had no problem with controversy. “The best art is the stuff that when you are on the bus on the way home you are still thinking about. That might be ugly, beautiful, compromising … you might hate the artist. Politically it might not be in tune with what you believe. That doesn’t matter. It just matters whether it bothers you.” He said he was less interested in how art looked and more in how it made you feel and think. “If people want to complain about art then they should complain about the conceptual nature of it, not what it looks like. It’s like if you go past someone’s house and you don’t like the curtains, you don’t knock on the door and tell them to change them.”",Arts/Art and design,Ryan Gander’s dolos opens a sculpture trail for the Yorkshire coast,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/18/ryan-gander-dolos-opens-a-sculpture-trail-for-the-yorkshire-coast
3/18/2022,"The activists who took “climate action” against sports utility vehicles by flattening their tyres in the last two weeks have been receiving solidarity and calls for information from around the world. Tyre Extinguishers provides instructions on how to deflate SUV tyres, offers guidance on who to target and collates reports of actions across the country. They have gauged the campaign’s reach by angry emails from SUV owners. The group registered a website and started a Twitter account in July 2021. The first reports of actions came at the beginning of March. But in just the past week, activists have “disarmed” SUVs in Chiswick, Maida Vale, Wood Green and Muswell Hill in London, Brighton and Hove and Manchester. Acting autonomously and, usually, under the cover of darkness, the activists have used lentils to deflate tyres by placing one inside the tyre valve, holding it open and slowly bleeding air until the tyre is flat. The group calculates they’ve deflated the tyres on at least a thousand vehicles in two weeks. The response from the public has been much more welcoming than they expected. “We are getting loads of emails from SUV drivers in parts of the country where nobody has actually told us they are doing the action, so there’s probably a lot going on we don’t know about,” the group told the Guardian in an email. “For example, the Tyre Extinguishers apparently struck somewhere in northern Colorado last weekend and we only found out about that through an SUV driver who found our website via the flyer, not through anyone who took the action.” They’ve also received messages from activists in Italy, France and Germany asking for the leaflet to be translated into their languages. SUVs were the second largest contributor to the increase in global carbon emissions from 2010 to 2018. Each year, SUVs belch out 700 megatonnes of CO2, about the entire output of the UK and Netherlands combined. If all SUV drivers banded together to form their own country, it would rank as the seventh largest emitter in the world. The lentil tactic has been around for a while. In an article in the Conversation, Graeme Hayes and Oscar Berglund, two academics who study protest movements, trace reports of the “mung bean trick” for deflating tyres at least as far back as 2008. It is hard to estimate the numbers involved in the latest campaign, the Tyre Extinguishers said, adding: “Of course, that’s part of the strength of the action. Not even those of us at the centre of this know the numbers of people involved, or even who they are.” They said actions had all gone smoothly so far, with no arrests or near misses yet reported. “If anything, it’s easier than we thought it would be to do this and not get caught. Which is good news for anyone reading this and considering taking the action.” ",News/Environment, Tyre Extinguishers – deflating SUV tyres as a form of climate action,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/18/tyre-extinguishers-deflating-suv-tyres-as-a-form-of-climate-action
3/18/2022,"A Northern Territory judge found constable Zachary Rolfe lied about a violent arrest that left a man unconscious and gave evidence that “lacked credibility” and parts of which were “pure fabrication” in a criminal case before he was involved in the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker. In November 2019, Rolfe shot Walker three times during an attempted arrest in the remote community of Yuendumu. He was found not guilty of murder and two alternative charges earlier this month after he argued that he had acted to protect his safety and that of his colleague after Walker had stabbed him with scissors. In an unrelated matter in 2018, Indigenous man Malcolm Ryder was charged with hindering Rolfe in executing his duties as a police officer and unlawfully assaulting Rolfe following an incident at Ryder’s house in Alice Springs. At Ryder’s trial in the Alice Springs local court, the court heard Rolfe and five other officers had attended Ryder’s house after a report of a disturbance and sought to arrest his step-son Bentley Poulson. Ryder was alleged to have interfered in this attempt by attacking police. Poulson was not charged with any offence. But in May 2019, Judge Greg Borchers found Ryder not guilty, and strongly criticised Rolfe’s evidence in an Alice Springs local court decision that can now be reported after the lifting of a suppression order made during Rolfe’s trial in the Walker matter. Borchers said in his decision that Rolfe and another constable “blandly stated” in their statutory declarations that Poulson had been arrested “but that’s not what happened”. Instead, Borchers said Poulson had been found hiding by Rolfe, and was then punched by another officer while Rolfe and other colleagues tried to arrest him. “This was a violent arrest on a man lying on the floor trying to hide. He was punched and had two police officers place their knees into his back.” Rolfe was not one of those officers. According to Borchers’ decision, Ryder said in his evidence that after police entered the house and told him to leave they had found Poulson inside. “I heard Bentley screaming while I was outside; a crying type of noise. I went inside because I wanted to tell the police not to get rough,” Ryder said. Borchers said Ryder agreed he was angry when he ran back into the house. Borchers found that the interactions Ryder and Poulson’s mother, Rebecca Hayes, had with Rolfe and two colleagues prior to this had been “less than civil” as each officer had been “rude” to them. “They had reason to believe from what they’d heard and what they’d seen that Bentley Poulson was being roughly dealt with,” Borchers said. “When they entered their home and arrived at the back bedroom there were five police officers in that room and Bentley Poulson had already been handcuffed and was under control.” Borchers found that Ryder and Hayes were in the rear bedroom, where Poulson had been arrested, for four seconds. During that time they were sprayed with OC spray by one of Rolfe’s colleagues. Two of the officers in the room said Ryder and Hayes were aggressive and shouting loudly when they entered the room. According to evidence referred to by Borchers, one officer said he saw a phone being thrown at police, and another believed a phone was about to be thrown at him. Borchers said that in Rolfe’s statutory declaration he referred to seeing Ryder holding a phone in his right hand, raise both hands in a fighting stance, and throw a number of punches at a colleague before Ryder was sprayed with OC spray. Rolfe said the spray seemed to have no effect on Ryder and he kept trying to strike the officer. Rolfe gave similar evidence in court, but said that Ryder had left the room as soon as the spray was deployed, though he did not appear affected by it. Another officer gave similar evidence to Rolfe, Borchers found. Ryder agreed in his evidence that his action in entering the bedroom quickly and yelling “hey” was aggressive and that he was holding his phone when he entered the bedroom. Borchers said he could “not accept” the evidence of Rolfe or another officer that they had seen Ryder throwing punches, given two other officers had not seen them, and they were not captured on body-worn video. “Constable Rolfe and [the other officer’s] evidence is wrong and is a pure fabrication,” Borchers found. He also found that Ryder did not throw his phone at police, and that police had been warned he and Hayes were coming. “The mere entry into a bedroom in their own home and calling out ‘Hey’ does not within those first four second[s] constitute a hindrance of police,” Borchers said. Borchers said that after Ryder left the bedroom there was a 27-second period which was not captured on body-worn camera footage. When Ryder is seen again, he is being handcuffed while facedown on the lounge room floor. Ryder said that after leaving the bedroom he could not see from the OC spray. He said he was grabbed by the collar at the back of his neck by a police officer and was then pushed roughly to the ground, before he was punched to the left eyebrow. He said he then turned away and the police officer then grabbed his hair and pushed his head into the floor. “He didn’t remember anything after that as he was rendered unconscious,” Borchers said. “His next memory was being decontaminated by having water poured over his face; being taken to hospital by ambulance and having three stitches applied to the cut above his left eye and 13 stitches applied to the cut above his right eye.” Rolfe said that once Ryder left the bedroom he threw his mobile phone at him and another officer, and then punched him in the face, causing “immediate pain” to his forehead. He said he and another officer then tackled Ryder to the floor and attempted to gain control of him, but Ryder then scratched his right forearm and attempted to scratch his face. “I was fearful that he was going to gouge my eyes and in order to defend myself I struck him once on the left side of the face with my closed right fist,” Rolfe said. “This gained subject compliance and Ryder stopped fighting.” He said he and a colleague then arrested Ryder. In court, Rolfe said Ryder had swung punches wildly at him, as he had done in the bedroom. No other witnesses supported this, Borchers said. Borchers said only Rolfe gave evidence it was he and another officer that tackled Ryder and brought him to ground, as the other officer said this did not happen. He said Rolfe was also the only person to give evidence that Ryder tried to scratch him, and that another officer had only seen Ryder’s arm raised. He noted Ryder had said he had his arms up to his head because of the OC spray. “I find that Constable Rolfe’s evidence lacks credibility. He lied. He has lied in a statutory declaration about what happened in the bedroom,” Borchers said. “Nobody can say how Malcolm Ryder was knocked out but him.” Borchers said Rolfe had surmised that Ryder may have hit his head while being tackled to the ground. He said if that was the case it is likely he was unconscious when Rolfe punched him. However, it was more likely he said Ryder was punched first to the left eyebrow by Rolfe’s right fist and then he received the injury to his right eyebrow when his head was pushed into the floor. He said that “how the injuries occurred and in what sequence of events is more likely than not to be in the manner consistent with Malcolm Ryder’s evidence”.

3/18/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Joe Biden will warn Chinese president Xi Jinping he faces “costs” if he helps Russia’s war effort when the pair speak for the first time since Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. The US president will use the call scheduled at 1pm today to pile pressure on China to distance itself from its ally, and argue that it is not in Chinese interests to back a loser. It comes as Biden described the Russian president as a “murderous dictator, a pure thug” as his administration joined the UK, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway in accusing Russia of war crimes in Ukraine. It follows outrage over the Russian bombing of a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol where women and children were sheltering. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another defiant late-night address in which he appealed to young Russians not to be “tricked” into risking their lives by signing up to bolster Moscow’s faltering invasion. Some military analysts think that Russian forces are now so bogged down and facing such resistance that they won’t be able to conquer Ukraine, although others point to successes for Putin in the south. US experts fear the Russian president could resort to using tactical nuclear weapons to break the stalemate, while US intelligence has seen signs of poor Russian troop morale. If you want more background on the war, here’s a podcast on whether war was inevitable, and there’s also what we know so far on day 23. Blasts have been heard in Lviv this morning and you can follow updates with the blog. As the journalist who staged a TV protest quits her job and pressure increases on the media in Russia, staff at the independent outlet Dozhd TV have fled to Istanbul and are wondering what to do next. And Arnold Schwarzenegger says the Russian people are being fed misinformation and called on Putin to stop the war. P&O outrage – Ministers and trade unions have condemned P&O Ferries’ mass sacking of 800 British seafarers and replacement with agency crew as shameful and “completely unacceptable”, amid furious calls for action against the company’s Dubai owners. P&O Ferries’ services could be suspended for up to 10 days, disrupting its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes, as politicians on both sides called on the government to stop a “scandalous betrayal”. Passengers were left stranded by the sudden cancellations, with one saying the sackings made them “ashamed to be British”. Many workers learned the news of their redundancy via a pre-recorded video message and have spoken of their devastation. “There were grown men in tears,” one said. Lawyers have mapped out the legal implications and said the workers could make unfair dismissal claims. Covid concerns – Ministers failed to allow parliament enough opportunity to scrutinise the sweeping laws passed to tackle the Covid pandemic, according to MPs. The 329-page Coronavirus Act of 2020 included a wide range of emergency powers, but MPs were given only three days to debate it. It comes as rising numbers of people entering hospital with Covid are leading to other patients becoming infected, staff absences, delayed operations and long waits in emergency departments, experts have warned. In Hong Kong, the big question is why death rates are so high. Donation doubts – A senior Conservative backbencher, Bernard Jenkin, said a “change in attitude” was required to improve transparency around attempts to curry favour with politicians as concerns grow about the lack of checks on wealthy Russians donating money to the party. He also expressed disbelief at Boris Johnson nominating the son of a former KGB officer, Evgeny Lebedev, for a peerage. Burglary spree – A 12-year-old boy has denied carrying out a 10-month burglary spree at prestigious hotels in London, a court heard. The boy is charged with 14 counts of burglary, and his 13-year-old brother is accused of being involved in three. The targets included Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair, the Four Seasons in Park Lane and the Corinthia hotel in Whitehall, as well as the BBC Television Centre complex in White City. The pair, accompanied by their mother, pleaded not guilty. Grand day out – Visitor numbers at Britain’s museums, galleries, zoos, castles and country houses increased by 25% last year, but are still down 57% on pre-pandemic levels. The most-visited attraction was Windsor Great Park, which drew 5.4m visitors – the first time the list was not topped by a London attraction. In second place was the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, which saw a 61% increase in visitors to 1.9m. Chester Zoo was in third place, while other outdoor sites in the top 20 included RHS Garden Wisley, Jeskyns community woodland in Kent and Longleat in Wiltshire. Across the country, journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk has been chronicling how people in Ukraine are just carrying on – and how that in itself is a form of resistance Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 Groomed to be a 60s pop star, the folk singer Vashti Bunyan instead headed for the Hebrides in a horse-drawn cart and then withdrew from music for 30 years. In a memoir to be published this month, she recalls those fraught, naive but incomparable years. Ben Stokes reflected on one of the most memorable hundreds of his career at the close of day two of the second Test in Barbados, with the all-rounder putting West Indies to the sword in fine style after a year of personal difficulties. The Ukrainian Andriy Yarmolenko was the hero as West Ham beat Sevilla after extra time to reach the Europa League quarter-finals. In the Premier League, Alex Iwobi scored in the 99th minute to fire Everton to a crucial 1-0 home win over Newcastle despite finishing the game with 10 men after Allan’s red card. Liam Farrell scored two tries as Wigan beat Castleford 33-22 in the Super League at the DW Stadium. Rafael Nadal quelled the challenge of a typically combustible Nick Kyrgios to reach the BNP Paribas Open semi-finals, as the Hollywood actor Ben Stiller was dragged into the drama in Indian Wells. George Russell has insisted there is no rivalry with his teammate Lewis Hamilton, as he prepares for his first race as a full-time driver with his new team, Mercedes. Brittney Griner’s detention in Russia for the possession of vape cartridges containing hashish oil has been extended until 19 May, according to the Russian state news agency, Tass. And before Friday’s deadline for offers to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, we look at the known runners and riders. The pound has risen a bit today after the Bank of England responded to the likelihood that the war in Ukraine will push inflation higher this year by raising interest rates back to the pre-pandemic level of 0.75%. The boss of John Lewis thinks inflation – currently 5.5% – could hit double figures. Sterling is buying $1.316 and €1.186. The Guardian leads with “Nations unite to condemn Putin over ‘war crimes’”, whereas the Times goes with the military line – “Ukraine takes fight to Putin” – and the Telegraph has “Russians target Patel and Wallace with fake video calls”. The Mirror likes the story of Britons helping Ukrainian refugees – “Band of mothers”. The Mail leads with “Mutiny on the P&O Ferries” – ditto the Metro – and the FT has “P&O halts ferry crossings and sacks 800 sailors via Zoom call”. “Betrayal” says the Express, while the Sun says “Up ship creek”. The Yorkshire Post splash is “Unions to act over sacking of ferry staff” and the Daily Record says “Pushed out”. The i leads with “Part-human, part-monkey embryo is created by scientists”.

3/18/2022,"Bullfighting across Europe is being kept alive by millions of euros paid out by the EU, claim campaigners, despite attempts by MEPs to ban the subsidies. The funding goes to farms that breed bulls for fighting through the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP), a long-running system of subsidy support to the sector. Spain’s Unión de Criadores de Toros de Lidia, which represents the interests of 347 breeders, has estimated that a ban on the subsidy payout would mean an economic hit of around €200m (£170m) a year for the sector across Europe. In 2015, in a move welcomed by animal rights campaigners who described bullfighting as a “cruel practice”, MEPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of blocking agricultural funds “for the financing of lethal bullfighting activities”. More than six years later, however, there has been little change, with the ban set aside over concerns that it would modify the legal provisions of the CAP.Joe Moran at animal advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals said: “While we agree with the MEPs entirely in their moral outrage and what they’re trying to do, the legal avenues to do this are pretty difficult. In fact, I would say they’re impossible.”To remove the funds altogether would require animal welfare to be an official competence of the EU, coupled with a law that would ban the raising of bulls for this purpose or prohibit bullfighting altogether, added Moran. An EU official said that while there were no funds specifically designated for breeding bulls for fighting, “it is not excluded”, and bull breeders could still receive public funds from agricultural funding.Since 2003, EU farm subsidies have mostly been allocated on the amount of land farmed, rather than output or the final destination of products. Green MEPs tabled a 2020 amendment to the CAP calling for funds to be barred for cattle whose final destination was “the sale for activities related to bullfighting”, but it was dropped as the European Commission, Council of the EU and parliament finalised the policy. Portuguese MEP Francisco Guerreiro described the funds as “an oxygen balloon that is continually helping this industry to stay afloat”, as the number of festivals involving bulls has declined. Europe’s bullfighting industry racked up reported losses of more than €150m (£125m) during the Covid pandemic as events such as Pamplona’s San Fermín festival were cancelled and bulls sent straight to slaughter. The pandemic hit as the sector was struggling to recover from Spain’s economic crisis, which saw cash-strapped municipalities halt festivals involving bulls. In 2007 – a year before the financial crash – 3,651 events featuring bulls were held across Spain. A decade later, the number of events had plunged to 1,553. Breeder associations in Spain, France and Portugal continue to defend the estimated 1,000 farms breeding bulls for bullfighting across the EU. Antonio Bañuelos, president of Spain’s Unión de Criadores de Toros, said: “It’s discriminatory to create this concept that the fate of these cattle can be tied to receiving funds or not.” Many of the farms produce a variety of products while also raising bulls, meaning any ban would erode their right to access funding on par with other EU farmers, he said. The industry has also lobbied MEPs claiming that the fighting bulls, raised in extensive areas, have less impact on the environment than pigs or sheep. An association of Spanish veterinarians opposed to bullfighting has said the public suffering inflicted on bulls was unjustifiable. It told MEPs that instruments ranging from barbed darts to an 80cm sword were used on bulls during bullfights that lasted approximately 15 minutes, causing “deep wounds, significant bleeding, intense suffering and painful death”. Bañuelos claimed that the death of a fighting bull is “quicker and entails less suffering” than many animals raised commercially. “There are thousands of animals that die every day in very painful circumstances. But the focus is on bullfighting because it is the most exposed when it comes to publicity and it is an easy target,” he said.
