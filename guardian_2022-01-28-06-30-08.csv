1/28/2022,"The Treasury is becoming increasingly alarmed that Boris Johnson may be preparing to scrap the national insurance rise in a desperate attempt to placate rightwing Tory MPs as he fights to save his job. The Guardian understands Rishi Sunak has privately stressed to MPs that the tax rise must go ahead as planned – with one frontbencher who has met him in recent days speculating the chancellor’s position could become untenable if Johnson seeks to overrule him.  Treasury aides claim the embattled prime minister has not yet raised the prospect of cancelling or delaying the £12bn tax rise, with Johnson saying “there’s been no discussion at any level”. Yet speaking in Wales on Thursday, the prime minister again refused to commit to pressing ahead with the 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions (NICs), which will be badged a “health and social care levy”. Johnson said it was “absolutely vital” to find the money, saying: “We have to fund the Covid backlogs, we have to fix social care. Every penny will go to that end.” But when asked to confirm explicitly that the increase would go ahead as planned, he declined to do so. One person with knowledge of the thinking in No 10 said there were no firm plans yet to change course on NICs – but predicted that Johnson would do so if he faced a vote of no confidence. They said: “He’s shown enough leg now to make people stick with him on the right. Whether he actually does it or not will depend on whether he thinks he needs to do it to win the vote.” Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC on Thursday that there would be “no U-turn” on the rise. The business secretary said: “We’re totally committed to funding the NHS, clearing the backlog of the NHS, and also funding social care and the way to do that is through this tax rise.” Healthcare bosses have urged Johnson to ensure the resources get to the NHS. “Without this extra funding the public will face longer waits for treatment and hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people won’t get the care and support they need from social care services,” said Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation. “But it is for the government to decide how best to fund this extra investment.” Mel Stride, the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, added his voice to those calling for the NICs rise to be postponed, saying “the stars have aligned” in favour of a delay. But Treasury sources played down the idea that stronger-than-expected tax receipts have handed Sunak a windfall, which he could use to cancel or at least delay the increase. With interest rates rising, they point instead to the increasing cost of funding government borrowing. The prime minister is under concerted pressure from Conservative rightwingers, including former Europe minister David Frost, and leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, to cancel the tax increase, which was set in legislation in the autumn. A government source said: “Ultimately, it’s obviously a decision for the PM.” Johnson needs the support of backbenchers to stave off the threat of a leadership challenge in the coming days. As well as cancelling the tax increase, others have been demanding that he water down the government’s net-zero policies. Ryan Shorthouse, chief executive of Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, called on the government to widen the base of the health and social care levy – including rental income and pensions, for example – so that it could be set at a lower rate. But he warned of the risk of the prime minister making decisions in the heat of the current leadership crisis. “He’s weakened: he’s completely now beholden to a lot of his backbenchers and what they’re pushing for,” he said. Meanwhile, there is frustration in Whitehall that plans to tackle the cost-of-living crisis appear to have stalled, as the prime minister focuses on saving his premiership. One government source suggested a planned meeting between Johnson and Sunak on the issue had been pulled this week, as the prime minister held a string of meetings with wavering colleagues in a bid to dissuade them from demanding a vote of no confidence in his leadership. A spokesperson for Johnson denied the meeting had been cancelled, saying: “Definitely not. They’ve been meeting every week.” But officials from across Whitehall report that decisions requiring No 10 signoff are being held up. Sunak wrung the commitment to the increase from Johnson as the quid pro quo for the prime minister’s costly plan to tackle NHS waiting lists and cap the lifetime costs of social care. MPs who have seen the chancellor in recent days say he has been categorical on the necessity for the rise to take place on time in April. One frontbencher said it was clear that the only person who might take a different course would be the prime minister. Sunak has forced through a number of spending cuts in recent months, including the abandonment of the UK’s aid target of 0.7% of national income, and the reversal of the £20-a-week uplift in universal credit. Widely seen as a potential successor to the prime minister, the chancellor has been less effusive in his public backing for Johnson than leadership rival Liz Truss. Johnson was in Wales on Thursday, as his inner circle continued to wait for the investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray into alleged lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. When it is published – now expected on Monday – a group of Tory MPs are expected to submit letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, calling for a vote of no confidence. If Johnson lost such a vote, which could be held within days, his premiership would be over.",Lifestyle/Money,Treasury unease over fears of No 10 U-turn on national insurance hike,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/27/treasury-unease-over-fears-of-no-10-u-turn-on-national-insurance-hike
1/28/2022,"Ron Johnson, the US senator for hot takes, famed for such hits as “[the Capitol riot] seemed like a peaceful protest to me” and “mouthwash has been proven to kill the coronavirus”, is at it again. On Wednesday, Johnson, the senior Republican senator from Wisconsin, told local news station WKBT: “People decide to have families and become parents. That’s something they need to consider when they make that choice.” He continued: “I’ve never really felt it was society’s responsibility to take care of other people’s children.”  Notably, Johnson also believes it is his right to decide for a family whether or not they should have a child. He is vociferously anti-abortion, and last February co-sponsored a bill making it a criminal offense to perform or attempt an abortion after 20 weeks. When backing that bill, Johnson argued that society has an obligation to protect life – “especially the life of the most vulnerable among us – the unborn.” Unintended pregnancies, it should be noted, are thought to cost the public billions every year. But when it comes to being a compassionate society in caring for those children, Ronson’s stance more closely resembles that of a deadbeat parent: happy to have the child but not to pay for it. He has argued that state subsidies like child tax credits are tantamount to social engineering. (The tax credits he vehemently opposed were received by 1.15 million families in Wisconsin and lifted 46,000 of them out of poverty, according to the Wisconsin Examiner). Outside of banning abortion, things Johnson does not consider social engineering include: trying to overturn an election; deporting thousands of migrant children by ending the Daca program; using his platform as a senator to invite fringe theorists to air unproved claims about coronavirus and vaccines. Johnson tasted his own boot in October, when arguing against vaccine mandates. On the Senate floor, he declared: “[Some people] have chosen not to get the vaccine. You may not agree with that, but it’s not your body. It’s not your right to impose on someone else” – indicating that he might be pro-choice after all, just not when it doesn’t suit him. In his latest interview, Johnson argued that rather than funding childcare, the US should force parents into work, so they can get “good jobs” to provide for their families. He does not explain how parents are supposed to do these jobs while looking after their children, considering that the lowest paid workers in Wisconsin make little more than $18,000 per year, while average childcare costs in the state come up to $12,567 (the average Wisconsinite can’t afford childcare, either – not just the lowest paid). Johnson, meanwhile, is a multi-millionaire, and appears to have made much of his money by selling off his wife’s brother’s plastics manufacturing company – a company set up using family money. Johnson has, in the past, aired his views about tax – arguing for a flat structure and no credits except business expenses. “I’m not a real fan of any types of credits, quite honestly, although that’s the system we’ve got. I just want to make sure it’s administrated fairly,” Johnson said. But he doesn’t seem to be a fan of paying his own taxes. In 2017, Ron Johnson, whose net worth is thought to be somewhere between $16.5m and $78.1m, paid $2,105 in tax – around 30 times less than he paid in previous years. When asked how that figured, and whether Johnson would let the public be the judge of whether he’d paid fairly, Johnson’s press secretary replied: “The senator will not be providing media with his tax returns.”",News/US news,"Childcare spending not your responsibility, senator?

1/28/2022,"Is this the future of tennis? “It has to be,” said Nick Kyrgios. When Kyrgios says something there is usually no turning back. Actually, sometimes there is, because we know he is prone to the odd backflip, or flip-out, or flippancy in general. But Kyrgios really did not even need to say this to make it true; he and Thanasi Kokkinakis had already ensured the sport has changed irrevocably. Without warning. Without even a pleasant, tennis-like announcement.  That was on Thursday afternoon at Rod Laver Arena, where this improvisation of a doubles partnership had just finished another jam session. They had riffed off each other and the crowd – even those plebs with ground passes were allowed in – and come up with something catchier than yet another set of superiorly ranked battle-of-the-band rivals. Half an hour later, in a press conference to mark their progression to a grand slam final at the first time of asking, Kyrgios described said opponents as “advanced”. Except that he used air quotes so we knew what he really meant was more like “they told us this doubles caper was hard”. Kyrgios has long revelled in a bit of lawn-club brattiness. Now he has a partner-in-crime who tells the punters to “drink piss and come here”. “Here” is Kia Arena, which is week two’s John Cain equivalent and promises double the fun. A hotbed of either passionate supporters or yahooing yobos, depending on who you ask. In some ways this “the rowdier, the better” (credit: Kokkinakis) mentality must be a bit of a headache for Tennis Australia. After the Novak Djokovic and Peng Shuai headaches, it is a nice one to have. And the governing body has made it work. Even Rod Laver himself joined the mob to watch them play on Thursday. “I think we’re unpredictable and I think that’s why they enjoy it,” said Kokkinakis, the more predictable of the pair. The looser unit, Kyrgios, had it well thought out all along. “My goal is to only bring new fans that may not be following tennis to watch tennis,” he said. “If they flick on a match and they have Thanasi and I playing in an entertaining doubles match, [and] they know nothing about tennis, if they watch that match just then they probably would tune in next time. That’s what I’m about. That’s what I want to bring. I think that’s how the sport is going to survive.” The establishment might argue the sport is just fine as it is, without the bravado of players hijacking the game’s morality for their own enjoyment. But if the rest of us are also enjoying ourselves, does the why even matter? Do we have to turn it over in our cultured hands in search of some acceptably high-brow meaning? This type of tennis is a little less traditional, it is also quite fun, and these two things do not have to be mutually exclusive. “I think people have just got to be open,” Kokkinakis said. “You’re always trying to develop a sport and grow a sport. Of course, you got to keep it within the boundaries. If people are so narrow-minded they can’t see this is bringing a lot of fans and a lot of eyes, I think that is their problem.” A Netflix crew has been following the Special Ks behind the scenes around Melbourne Park for a Formula One Drive To Survive-style series. Initially it was only following Kyrgios around, because even Netflix did not predict this storyline. No algorithm or formula could have manufactured such loose units – and they are just the spectators. The Special Ks have taken tradition and turned it into entertainment for the masses, to boozy afternoons in the sun and very untennis-like behaviour. One cannot help but wonder how this would all go down at Wimbledon. We did get a peek back in 2013 when Kyrgios and Kokkinakis teamed up to win the boys doubles title. “We got in trouble for wearing Wimbledon headbands,” Kyrgios recalled. “That’s right,” said Kokkinakis, “we had pink headbands on.” A purist’s nightmare, if ever there was one. But the reality is these two players are so likeable together because they are also friends. They met as kids at a cup event in Canberra. Kokkinakis, an NBA fan, spotted Kyrgios wearing Michael Jordan gear. While on the road for tournaments in Europe they stayed up until 3am playing Counter-Strike and “talking rubbish to each other”. This past week has been a lesson on their similarities and differences, and what makes them charming. “Sometimes [when he] loses his temper I’m there to calm him down,” Kokkinakis said, with Kyrgios sat next to him. “I think it helps both of us, for sure. I think it’s just having somebody he can kind of talk to, relay his feelings when he’s on court.” Kyrgios: “Aw.” Kokkinakis: “No worries. I try to be a steady head out there for him. Also don’t want to take away that energy and that fire because I think that’s what makes Nick, Nick.” Kyrgios: “That’s the cutest answer I’ve ever heard.” Kokkinakis: “I’ve got you.” The Special Ks are a new-age bromance, and there is nothing wrong with this future of tennis.",Sport/Sport,"‘The rowdier, the better’: Special Ks give tennis a glimpse of an alternate future | Emma Kemp",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/the-rowdier-the-better-special-ks-give-tennis-a-glimpse-of-an-alternate-future

1/28/2022,"Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader whose arrest in January 2021 inspired the country’s biggest protests in years, is a man accustomed to cameras. Tall, handsome, sandy-haired, with an expressively hangdog face, he’s a pro at seeming both disarming and indomitable while being filmed, which is often – in news anchor style for his popular weekly Youtube series investigating Kremlin corruption; at rallies where he leads crowds in a “Putin! Thief!” call and response; on the plane from Germany back home to Moscow, surrounded by media as he prepares to confront the government that tried to poison him in 2020. Besieged by smartphone cameras, Navalny offers calm statements while storing his luggage in overhead bins. “As usual”, he says, “our government can be characterized as afraid.”  Navalny, a 98-minute documentary from Canadian director Daniel Roher, details in cogent, stressful, riveting fashion just how scared the Kremlin is of Navalny, arguably the biggest threat to Vladimir Putin’s power at home. The bulk of the film, produced by CNN Films and HBO Max with a surprise Sundance premiere this week, is embedded with Navalny and his close team in their Black Forest hideout during the second half of 2020, as they unravel the assassination plot against him and prepare to go public with explosive findings. Those findings are indeed shocking, in both the effort put forth by a team of Kremlin and the sheer stupidity with which they went about capping a years-long plot to kill Navalny. (I am obligated to write that the Russian government denies involvement.) Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian investigative journalist from the group Bellingcat, and Maria Pevchikh, the head investigator for Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, uncover a plot pulled straight from the movies (there’s even symbolic pinned photos on a map webbed with red yarn, which Roher films tenderly): doughy, dopey agents who followed Navalny for three years and poisoned him on a filming trip to Siberia with the nerve agent novichok, a poison which essentially shuts down the body and then dissipates, making death appear to be from natural causes. (novichok gained notoriety in 2018, when two Russian intelligence officers poisoned former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in exile in Salisbury, England; both survived, and the incident caused an international firestorm.) Some allege that novichok is Putin’s preferred assassination method, equivalent to “leaving his signature on the crime scene”, says Navalny’s chief of staff in a sit-down interview. The brazenness of the plot is so galling it’s almost brilliant – “even reasonable people are like what? Come on, poison?” Navalny tells Roher in his one interview before he returns to Russia. (Navalny had been kept in a Russian hospital against his wife, Yulia’s wishes immediately following the poisoning, then transferred to a hospital in Germany, where he recuperated for months). The film features several one-on-ones with Navalny’s inner circle, including Grozev, Pevchikh, Yulia (steely, undaunted, enjoys chess), and his 19-year-old, American-accented daughter Daria, a university student in California. These sit-downs provide some personal color to the more procedural scenes of a celebrity dissident at work, but don’t include anything we can’t infer from observing the war room, so to speak. The comparison to a Hollywood plot is apt; one scene in which Navalny prank calls his would-be assassins and tricks one to reveal the details of the plot – how they laced his blue underwear with poison, how they cleaned up evidence – left my jaw on the floor. This is not new information. The revelations here, including the prank call, have been well-publicized by global media and by Navalny himself since December 2020 (a natural handler of social media, Navalny is very cognizant of his views and likes on YouTube and even TikTok, one of the more intriguing characteristics Roher manages to capture). Depending on your awareness of international politics – mine is admittedly low – you may already know the whole story. If you do, I would imagine Navalny offers swift and damning synthesis while skirting some thornier context – Navalny’s political history as a Russian nationalist, for example, which merits a question from Roher but left me with many more. If you’re coming in with a blank slate, then Navalny is a feast of evermore unbelievable details and a window into a movement against a state of increasingly boldfaced, demeaning lies. It’s a story that ends in midseason – following his celebrated return to Russia in January 2021, Navalny was arrested and remains in a penal colony 60 miles east of Moscow. But given the scenes of jubilance that greeted his survival and return, and the confidence with which Navalny speaks to Roher here, the film offers hope for a brighter, freer future in Russia amid the ongoing shock of state cruelty.
