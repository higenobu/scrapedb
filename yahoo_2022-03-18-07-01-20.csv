3/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. has processed funds that were earmarked for interest payments due on dollar bonds issued by the Russian government and sent the money on to Citigroup Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

JPMorgan sent the money to Citigroup after it sought and received the required approvals from U.S. authorities on Wednesday, one of the people said. Representatives for JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. While European bondholders of Russia’s sovereign debt have received no sign of the funds, the move spurred optimism that the bonds may be settled, sending prices higher across maturities. The implied probability of a default by Russia within the year inched lower to 57%, down from 59%, according to credit default swap pricing. Last week it was as high as 80%. “This seems to take a technical default off the table for now,” Kaan Nazli, a money manager at Neuberger Berman in The Hague, Netherlands. “However, there is still some uncertainty over corporate debt as only a number of companies have been given leeway.” Citigroup is the payment agent for about four dozen bonds tied to Russian companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some of those companies -- including MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC and Gazprom PJSC -- have successfully made coupon payments in recent days. But, in other cases, coupon payments may not have gone through. Citigroup this week blocked a $19.25 million interest payment sent by EuroChem Group AG, a Russian fertilizer maker, according to a person familiar with the matter. The steel and mining company Severstal warned this week that Citigroup may refrain from processing a $12.6 million interest payment due on its dollar bonds. The drama has thrust a spotlight on banks’ back offices. The Russian Finance Ministry said it had sent the order for a $117 million interest payment on March 14 to a correspondent bank that it didn’t identify, adding that it would issue a separate comment about whether the paying agent, Citibank’s London branch, has received the payment. The ministry has said it would first try to make the payments in dollars and then use rubles if that fails. As a correspondent bank, New York-based JPMorgan processes and clears payments and other transactions for financial institutions. In its role as payment agent, Citigroup, also based in New York, collects coupon payments from bond issuers and distributes those funds to investors.

3/18/2022,"By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) -Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so. Restaurant Brands International Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the franchisee, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company. It was not immediately clear how to reach Kolobov for comment. Shear's long letter highlights the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators. On March 8, Starbucks Corp and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia. Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees. Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions. Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement. There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No."" (Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York; Additional reporting by Praveen Paramasivam in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath, Leslie Adler and Jonathan Oatis)",Business/Reuters•3 hours ago,Burger King says Russia franchisee 'refused' to shutter restaurants,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/burger-king-says-russia-franchisee-191333676.html
3/18/2022,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Thursday, March 17, 2022 The Federal Reserve finally took the plunge and raised rates. As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell led the Federal Open Market Committee to raise its benchmark interest rate target by 25 basis points. The Fed famously operates according to two mandates (actually it has three by law): price stability and maximum employment. How the Fed achieves these goals is up to Powell & Co. but if past is prologue, there could be trouble brewing as the Fed amps up its hawkishness. In the modern era, the Fed has developed a bewildering array of tools: interest-rate targeting, forward guidance, interest on excess reserves, repo facilities, quantitative easing, and quantitative tightening, to name a few. Not to mention any number of emergency facilities to be conjured up and deployed with the Treasury in troubled times. This wasn’t always the case. When inflation was skyrocketing just over four decades ago, Paul Volcker was elected Fed chairman in 1979 with a mandate to crush high prices. The consumer price index (CPI) reached a high of 14.8% in 1980, before his inflation-fighting efforts took effect. Prior to Volcker, the Fed targeted short-term interest rates to manipulate the money supply to juice or put the brakes on the economy. Without wading too far in the weeds, the Volcker-era Fed targeted the actual money supply. This and other changes persisted mostly into the end of the 1980s — even after Alan Greenspan became chair in 1987. But Greenspan pivoted and developed his own style in the 1990s, returning to interest rate targeting and instituting ""insurance"" cuts to get ahead of various crises — including the 1998 bailout of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In fact, the Fed had raised rates a year before the beleaguered LTCM became a systemic risk. This made the 1997 single-rate hike the shortest rate-hiking cycle — if you can even call it a cycle — in the modern era. Its short duration is probably why the 38.5% stock market rally over the following year was by far the best among four other tightening cycles (see chart below). The other post-rate hike periods averaged gains of 5.9%, with the year following the 1994 increase barely eking out a 0.1% return. The bias toward easing earned Greenspan the nickname ""Easy Al."" After Greenspan popped the late 1990s tech bubble, he would eventually lower rates to 1% in 2003 and keep them there for a year. All this set the stage for the Fed to help fuel a housing bubble — this time concomitant with a huge run-up in commodities prices. WTI crude oil (CL=F) rallied relentlessly, topping out at $150 per barrel. (Sound familiar?) Ben Bernanke picked up where Greenspan left off, leading the Fed to raise rates a quarter percent 17 times at consecutive Fed meetings. In late 2007, as central banks around the world worked to reduce leverage in the bloated financial sector, cracks in the financial system turned into gaping holes. Bear Stearns nearly folded in March 2008 and was sold to JPMorgan for a song. At the time, many thought the worst was over. In the spring and summer of 2008, the Fed began winding down its balance sheet from all the emergency lending programs it had instituted — selling and letting roll off $300 billion in Treasury bills. Markets even started pricing in about 140 basis points worth of rate hikes into the end of 2008. (Sound familiar?) The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 put those hawkish notions to rest — perhaps an important lesson to remember, as the Fed is now forecasting six more rate hikes this year. Powell even said Wednesday at the presser that balance sheet runoff (quantitative tightening) could come as early as the next Fed meeting in May. ""Do we see balance sheet roll-off? And how aggressive is the Fed going to be with this? ... we're used to the central banks coming in and suppressing volatility, but that's not going to be the case for the foreseeable future,"" said John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, on Yahoo Finance Live, expressing concern that the Fed may not be paying attention to the recent volatility in stocks and bonds. ""We need to buckle up and understand that enhanced volatility in risk assets and interest rates are going to be here as we're unwinding unprecedented monetary stimulus [amid] a number of exogenous factors like ongoing war and rampant inflation.""

3/18/2022,"Alibaba (BABA)'s ADRs could rip higher after a massive relief rally spurred by an ease of regulatory risks, which one equity manager called ""a sea change."" ""I think you're going to see China stocks rip for the next 8 or 12 months into the China National Congress [elections],"" Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you look at some of them in particular, we're focused on Alibaba, I think the returns are going to be spectacular.' On Wednesday, e-commerce giant Alibaba and its peers soared more than 30% after China's top financial body said it would ensure stability in capital markets and support stock listings overseas. ""The only two things holding these companies back were ... the tech crackdown over the summer, in earnest, and then the delisting risk,"" said Hayes. ""The businesses were growing despite the regulatory crackdowns, despite the zero-COVID shutdowns."" China's National Congress elections are coming up this fall, a reason why Hayes believes Chinese stocks will go higher from here. ""Both in China and the United States, the number one job of a politician is to get reelected. They figured that out, they want the transition to go smoothly. They're juicing the economy,"" said Hayes. Alibaba's American depository shares had been pounded prior to Wednesday's rally. They touched a multi-year intraday low of $73.28 earlier this week. China's recent lockdowns, regulatory risks, and U.S. disclosure requirements, which pose a threat to the delisting of Chinese firms, have all contributed to investors' recent flee from Alibaba and its peers. ""We did get forced selling and a final capitulation yesterday [Tuesday] on those delisting fears over the last couple of days, but both of those fears were largely taken off the table last night, when they decided to actively introduce policies to benefit the markets,"" said Hayes. On Thursday ADRs of Alibaba, JD.com (JD), Pinduoduo (PDD), and Baidu (BIDU) were all trading lower as investors took profits off the table. Over the last two days though, they're each up more than 20%. Ines is a stock market reporter for Yahoo Finance.
