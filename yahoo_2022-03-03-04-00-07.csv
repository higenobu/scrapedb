3/3/2022,"Ford is splitting into two auto businesses: one for electric cars and one for combustion ones. The electric unit will be called Ford Model e, a name the company barred Tesla from using years ago. Elon Musk wanted to call Tesla's third mass-produced car, the Model 3, the Model E. Ford announced a major restructuring on Wednesday, saying it will create two auto businesses: one focused on traditional combustion engines and another dedicated to the company's burgeoning electric-vehicle efforts. The name Ford chose for the latter should ring a bell for Elon Musk. The gasoline division will be called Ford Blue, while its EV counterpart will be known as Ford Model e, a name the Detroit automaker stopped Tesla from using nearly a decade ago. After the release of Tesla's Model S and Model X, Musk planned to name the company's third major vehicle the Model E. (It spells ""sex,"" get it?) ""A friend asked me at a party, 'What are you going to name the third-generation car?' Well, we have the S and the X, so we might as well make it the E,"" Musk told CNN Money in 2014. But Ford called up Musk threatening to sue if Tesla pursued the Model E trademark, he told the outlet. Tesla and Ford entered a contract in 2010 that prohibited Tesla from using the Model E name, and the companies resolved the dispute amicably, a Ford spokesperson told CNN Money. —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017 Ford has sued to keep companies from using the Model E name, arguing it sounds too similar to the Model T. Ford sold cars including the Model A, B, C, F, and K, but never a Model E. In 2000, Ford sued a car-leasing startup called Model E. Tesla kept with the suggestive theme anyway, coming out with the Model 3 sedan instead, and later the Model Y SUV. Ford says that splitting into two units will help boost profits and streamline operations. The company says reorganization will allow engineers, designers, and other Ford employees to focus on either EV or gasoline efforts, rather than splitting their time between the two, the company said. Ford said the new structure will help it nearly double profit margins by 2026, the same year it plans to produce more than 2 million electric cars. Shares of Ford surged roughly 7% on the news Wednesday morning.

3/3/2022,"By Jason Hovet and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's comments that Moscow's nuclear deterrent is on high alert have unleashed a wave of anxiety in Central Europe, with people rushing to buy iodine which they believe may protect them from radiation. From Poland to Bulgaria, people living in the former Soviet-era satellite states have also jammed passport offices, topped up their fuel tanks and prepared to leave at a moment's notice. Others enquired about joining the military. ""In the past six days Bulgarian pharmacies have sold as much [iodine] as they sell for a year,"" said Nikolay Kostov, chair of the Pharmacies Union. ""Some pharmacies are already out of stock. We have ordered new quantities but I am afraid they will not last very long."" ""It's been a bit mad,"" said Miroslava Stenkova, a representative of Dr. Max pharmacies in the Czech Republic, where some stores had run out of iodine after demand soared. Iodine - taken as pills or syrup - is considered a way of protecting the body against conditions such as thyroid cancer in case of radioactive exposure. In 2011, Japanese authorities recommended that people around the site of the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant take iodine. Officials in the region have recognised the demand but cautioned iodine is not necessary in the current situation and would not help in case of nuclear war. Dana Drabova, head of the Czech State office for Nuclear Safety, wrote on Twitter: ""You ask a lot about iodine tablets... as radiation protection when (God forbid) nuclear weapons are used, they are basically useless."" News last week that Russian forces had gained control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant where an accident in 1986 contaminated a huge swathe of Ukraine and sent a radioactive cloud across Europe, unnerved people in a region where many remember being given iodine in the aftermath of that disaster. Radiation levels at Chernobyl have increased but are still low enough not to pose a hazard to the public despite the movement of Russia's military vehicles there, the U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA said on Wednesday. In Poland, the number of pharmacies selling iodine more than doubled, according to gdziepolek.pl, a Polish website that helps patients find the nearest pharmacy with a drug they are seeking. ""Internal data on our website shows that interest in iodine increased around 50 times since last Thursday,"" said Bartlomiej Owczarek, the website's co-founder. RUSH TO RENEW PASSPORTS Since the start of the fighting last Thursday, hundreds of thousands of refugees have crossed into the European Union, mainly entering through borders in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to flee what Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and capture ""neo-Nazis"" he falsely says are running the country of 44 million people. Last Sunday Putin ordered his military command to put Russia's deterrence forces - which include nuclear arms - on high alert, citing what he called aggressive statements by NATO leaders and Western economic sanctions against Moscow. Washington and its NATO allies have rejected Ukraine's request to impose a no-fly zone over the country, arguing this would lead to direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. Against this backdrop, some central Europeans have prepared to leave, clogging passport offices to ensure they had valid travel documents. Slovakia's interior minister called on citizens not to flood police with applications while long lines formed outside some passport offices in Warsaw. ""I have a son who lives outside the EU and I am supposed to go visit him and I was afraid that later I would not be able to get a passport,"" said Maria, a pensioner standing in line who declined to give her full name. ""All these people are not standing in this line on a whim, but because they want a safety net."" In the Czech Republic - where Russian soldiers helped Communists crush the 1968 Prague Spring protests for reforms - authorities scrapped a regular monthly testing of emergency sirens on Wednesday to avoid alarming people. Some young central Europeans considered joining the military. Poland's defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak said more than 2,200 have declared their interest in joining the Polish Armed Forces, more than five times the number the previous week. At a recruiting station in Prague, an officer said interest had jumped and one student said he was there due to Ukraine. ""The situation in Ukraine only convinced me it is probably the best decision I can take for my country,"" said Marek Jetmar, a 27-year-old psychology student.

3/3/2022,"Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., heckled President Biden during Tuesday’s State of the Union, just before he recalled his late son Beau Biden’s brain cancer. Biden was in the middle of calling on Congress to pass legislation to help Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans suffering from exposure to toxic burn pits that were used to incinerate waste, with troops often using jet fuel as an accelerant. “When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best-trained warriors were never the same: Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness,” Biden said. “A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.” “You put them there!” Boebert yelled, according to reporters in the House Chamber. ""Thirteen of them,"" she added in a reference to the 13 U.S. service members who died last year in a bomb attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. Biden briefly paused before continuing his speech. “I know. One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden,” the president said. “I don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near in Iraq, and earlier than that, in Kosovo, was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops, but I am committed to finding out everything we can.” Beau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46. Last year, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation that would streamline the Veteran Administration’s review process to recognize toxic exposure as a cost of war. The bill, the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, passed out of committee last summer, but has yet to receive a full vote in the House. On Monday, the Biden administration released a statement calling on Congress to pass the legislation. Boebert’s tenure in Congress has been heavily focused on opposing Biden. By the end of her first month in office, the Colorado Republican, who previously embraced the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory, had introduced four bills opposing executive orders issued by Biden regarding a range of issues, from mask mandates, to U.S. reentry into the Paris climate agreement and funding for the World Health Organization. In June 2021, she introduced a bill to censure Biden “for his dereliction of duty at our Southern border.” Last September, Boebert introduced articles of impeachment against Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over the Biden administration’s handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. “Joe Biden willfully abandoned his duty as president of the United States and violated his constitutional oath to ‘take care that the laws be faithfully executed, by failing to ensure the national security of the United States and its citizens,” Boebert said at the time.

 Retired Gen. David Petraeus believes Russia President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is not a war he can win due to inadequate troop numbers and fierce Ukrainian resistance. ""I don't think that this is a war, ultimately, that Russia and Vladimir Putin can win,"" Petraeus said Wednesday in an interview with CNN. ""They can take a city perhaps, but they cannot hold it."" Petraeus, a commander in U.S. insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Russia doesn't ""have the numbers"" and beyond that, ""everyone in the entire country hates them and most of the adults are willing to take action against them, whether it's to take up weapons or to be human shields."" In addition, ""you have a president who is providing Churchillian leadership, the people [are] undaunted and Ukrainian forces continue to exploit their home-field advantage."" Ukraine has defied expectations and continued to hold its capital and most of its major cities a little under a week after the Kremlin launched an incursion into the country. Russian troops have been slow to move on Kyiv as they struggle with logistical problems such as lack of food and gas, reports of low morale, and intense resistance from Ukrainian forces, according to the Pentagon. But Petraeus warned that as Putin grows more frustrated with his forces halting progress, it will lead Russian troops ""to do more of what we have seen in the last 48 hours"" and step up the severity of their attacks using more devastating weapons targeting government facilities and infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. ""They'll starve the population of Kyiv if they have to but that population I don't think is going to crack,"" he said. Though Ukraine has held its ground, the conflict has still been devastating for the population, with more than 2,000 civilians killed since Thursday, with the invasion began, according to the country's emergency service. And nearly 900,000 Ukrainians have fled the country, according to figures from the United Nations.",World/The Hill,Gen.
