School officials told the outlet that investigators identified five students involved in the incident. —Marilyn Parker (@MarilynParkerTV) May 5, 2022 The outlet spoke to a student who said the incident was part of a senior prank. In addition, students shared photos of the shark on social media, primarily on Snapchat. The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office confirmed to WJXT that it's believed to be a school prank, given that the school's mascot is a shark. The St. Johns County School District handed over surveillance footage of the shark being lifted into the rafters to authorities, WJXT reported, adding that the video would not be released. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission confirmed to the outlet it was investigating the incident. Representatives for The St. Johns County School District, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The St. John's County Sheriff's Office said the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is leading the investigation. On Friday, animal advocacy group One Protest launched a change.org petition seeking criminal charges against the five students, according to WJXT. The petition has garnered 1,489 of the requested 2,500 signatures as of Saturday. ""As an animal advocacy organization, we are accustomed to seeing and hearing about execrable crimes carried out upon wildlife. This case is particularly egregious,"" the petition's statement reads. ""We are dealing with high school seniors who have a blatant disregard for life and find killing, mutilating, and displaying the body of an animal as 'funny' or a 'prank.'"" The statement also called for the students to be punished. ""We must uphold the laws put in place to protect wildlife and hold those who break the law accountable for their actions,"" the statement said. Following the incident, a student called the act ""gruesome."" ""It's kind of gruesome. I'll be honest. That's a pretty big shark too,"" Julian Chandlee told WJXT. ""It's in the main courtyard. There are some steps that go up to the main hall, and that's right over the steps, so it's in a pretty major spot.""

5/8/2022,"Just over six years ago, a soon to be mother of two died in the operating room only 17 minutes after delivering the second child born to her and her husband, Charles Johnson IV. According to the CDC, Black women die at rates three times higher than that of white mothers during childbirth, and Johnson is unwilling to let his wife become a statistic without due justice. He is suing Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for what he says is the culture of racism within the institution that led to her death. “There’s no doubt in my mind that my wife would be here today and be here Sunday celebrating Mother’s Day with her boys if she was a Caucasian woman,’’ Johnson said outside of the hospital during a news conference. “The reality is that on April 12, 2016, when we walked into Cedars-Sinai hospital for what we expected to be the happiest day of our lives, the greatest risk factor that Kira Dixon Johnson faced was racism.’’ Read more &#39;You Got McDonald&#39;s Money?&#39; and Other Phrases We Remember From Childhood &lt;i&gt;Black in the Day&lt;/i&gt;: Barrettes, Blue Magic and Other Ways We Laid Our Hair Cheat Sheet: What is Critical Race Theory? Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce After a scheduled cesarean section, Dixon Johsnon showed signs that she was bleeding internally. Despite her husband’s pleas, she would not be readmitted into the operating room until it was too late. She ended up dying from internal bleeding with nearly 90% of the blood later found in her stomach. “This is sloppy. It was butchery,’’ said Attorney Nicholas Rowley. “It shocked everybody that we deposed, all the health care providers, even the head of (obstetrics) here, the head of labor and delivery, looked at it and said ‘No, I’ve never seen one done that fast.’’’ The hospital however is fighting the malpractice lawsuit. According to NPR, a statement was released by Cedars-Sinai that in part read that it was founded on principles of diversity and health care for all and it rejected “any mischaracterization of our culture and values.’’ “We are actively working to eradicate unconscious bias in health care and advance equity in health care more broadly,’’ the statement continued. “We commend Mr. Johnson for the attention he has brought to the important issue of racial disparities in maternal outcomes.’’ Charles Johnson is now dedicated to advocating for women of color during childbirth. He has testified before Congress as well as the state Capitol in Sacramento in support of several bills that would require medical professionals to acknowledge implicit bias at work. Johnson is also supporting a more recent bill that would lift the cap on medical malpractice awards. Angelique Washington, a Black surgical technologist, said that “patient safety was out the door’’ when Kira Johnson was brought into the operating room. After 30 years in the industry, Washington stated that she’s witnessed Black women get treated poorly time and time again, but has always been too afraid to speak up. “When I see my Black ... patients come in, I say an extra prayer,’’ Washington said. “I say a silent prayer that all goes well. Because you do have racism very much so in the operating room.’’ Johnson and his legal team will have a hard fight ahead of them in proving patterns of discrimination to win their case. But it’s a battle Johnson refuses to retreat from until he receives justice for his wife, a Black woman and mother that should be here celebrating like all others.",U.S./The Root,Husband Sues California Hospital For The 'Culture of Racism' That Led To The Death Of His Wife During Labor,https://news.yahoo.com/husband-sues-california-hospital-culture-175000399.html
5/8/2022,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from the home of North Dakota’s longest-serving state senator after he had traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. According to a police report obtained by The Associated Press, a Grand Forks police detective and two Homeland Security special agents searched Ray Holmberg’s condominium on Nov. 17. The Forum of Fargo first reported about the search on Friday. “I’m not talking to anybody,” Holmberg, 79, told the AP by phone, referring questions to his attorney, Mark Friese. Friese, a prominent North Dakota defense attorney, said he hasn’t seen the search warrant and has had difficulty getting information from state and federal authorities on why his client is being investigated. Holmberg, a Republican who rose to become one of the state’s most powerful lawmakers in a career that spanned 46 years, announced last month that he would resign June 1. His term was scheduled to end on Nov. 30 and he already had announced in March that it would be his last, citing stress and “a weakened ability to concentrate on the matters at hand and effectively recall events.” The police report did not give a reason for the issuance of a search warrant. It came about three months after Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. Prosecutors allege Morgan-Derosier possessed several thousand images and videos depicting sexually abused children. He also is accused of taking two children under the age of 10 from Minnesota to his Grand Forks home, with the intent of sexually abusing them. The state charges against Morgan-Derosier have been superseded by federal charges that include possession and distribution of child pornography and travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. The police report said Holmberg was present during the search of his home, which came five days after a special session of the Legislature adjourned in Bismarck. Holmberg played key roles in legislative redistricting and appropriating federal coronavirus aid. In addition to seizing CDRs and DVDRs in a nightstand drawer in a bedroom in Holmberg’s condo, “multiple other items were seized by officers and placed into evidence,” the report said. The report did not identify the additional items. The newspaper reported that the two federal agents and the Grand Forks police detective who searched Holmberg’s home also investigated Morgan-Derosier.",U.S./Associated Press,North Dakota legislator's home searched after inmate texts,https://news.yahoo.com/north-dakota-legislators-home-searched-154845400.html
