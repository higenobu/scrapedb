3/31/2022,"With the U.S. public showing a vast disapproval of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of his invasion of Ukraine, former President Donald Trump has sought to explain his glowing appraisal of the Russian leader's moves leading up to the war. On Wednesday, Trump released a statement in which he parsed the semantics of using the word ""genius"" when referring to Putin's military strategy. ""The Fake News is also saying I called Putin a 'genius,' when actually, and to be precise, I called his build-up on the Ukraine border before the war started genius because I assumed he would easily be able to negotiate a great deal with Russia,"" Trump said in the written statement. Trump, who seems likely to run for president again in 2024, did not explain why he had praised Putin for seeking to leverage the threat of military conflict to undermine Western interests. While conceding that he had misread Putin's intentions, Trump also placed blame with President Biden's administration for how the war started. ""Unfortunately, and tragically, Putin went too far, acting on the WEAK Foreign Policy of the Biden Administration. The Fake News said I called him a genius during the war. No, I was describing the great negotiating posture he had prior to the unfortunate decision to enter Ukraine and fight. There was nothing 'genius' about that!"" Trump's attempt to clarify his ""genius"" comment is another signal of how strong the political winds have shifted on Russia and Ukraine. In the days before the war, prominent voices like Fox News host Tucker Carlson questioned why the U.S. should side with Kyiv. Trump, who has long praised Putin, continued to do so. On Feb. 22, just before the Russian invasion, Trump called Putin's strategy ""genius"" and ""savvy."" ""I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful,"" Trump said on ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show."" ""He used the word 'independent,' and 'We're gonna go out and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace.' You gotta say that's pretty savvy."" But as the devastation unfolded, the American public and politicians of both major U.S. parties have been uniform in their opposition to the attack. According to a Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday, 92% of Americans said they have little or no confidence in Putin's handling of world affairs. Just 6% expressed confidence in him. Trump, who sharply criticized NATO during his presidency as ""obsolete,"" is now attempting to take credit for strengthening the military alliance amid the Ukraine conflict. Trump's praise of Putin was not an isolated incident, either. As recently as last weekend, for instance, Trump reiterated his view that the Russian autocrat is ""smart."" ""The smartest one gets to the top,"" Trump told a crowd of supporters at a campaign rally in Georgia. ""That didn't work so well recently in our country. But they ask me, 'Is Putin smart?' Yes, Putin was smart. And I actually thought he was going to be negotiating. I said, 'That's a hell of a way to negotiate, put 200,000 soldiers on the border.'"" The affinity between Trump and Putin is apparently mutual. On Russian state television Tuesday, a host called for regime change in the U.S., before Biden's term officially ends, ""to again help our partner Trump to become President."" John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, believes that Putin views Trump as useful toward his goal of weakening the NATO alliance. ""In a second Trump term, I think he may well have withdrawn from NATO,"" Bolton told the Washington Post in early March. ""And I think Putin was waiting for that."" As Sen. Mitt Romney stated Tuesday, were Trump to win a second White House turn in 2024, NATO ""would rethink whether they can count on the United States,"" and there's little doubt that such an outcome would please Putin. Seen in this light, the debate over the words Trump has used to describe the Russian president may have an impact on how he fares should he run in 2024. And although Trump denies calling Putin a genius, he has frequently boasted about an identical compliment he says Putin gave him. Back when he campaigned for president in 2016, Trump often said Putin had praised him. ""Putin was very nice to me, he said Donald Trump is a genius,"" Trump said then.

3/31/2022,"Black Americans are using digital-only banks as their primary financial institution more than any other ethnic group in the U.S., a new analysis from business research firm Morning Consult found. Morning Consult drew its analysis from a series of surveys between July 2021 and January 2022. The firm found that 14 percent of Black people said a digital bank was their primary banker compared to 8 percent of white people and 13 percent for Hispanics. Black people also outpace other ethnicities in having credit union accounts, the surveys found.

Charlotte Principato, a Morning Consult financial services analyst who authored the study, said the surveys mean traditional brick-and-mortar banks will need to step up their online features if they want to attract or keep Black customers. Principato also said more Black people are adopting digital banks because those institutions are doing exactly what consumers are desiring.

“Many digital-only banks have the expressed goal of reaching traditionally underserved populations, so it’s not surprising that they have been successful in serving and gaining primacy in the wallets of Black consumers,” Principato wrote in her analysis.

Digital-only banks are financial institutions that exist only online, do not have physical branches and offer the same services as institutions such as Chase, Wells Fargo or Bank of America. Both the number and popularity of digital banks — including Ally, OneUnited and Varo — have exploded in the past decade.

Black Americans like how digital banks integrate other financial apps that they use often — like Venmo and Zelle, said Kevin Cohee, One United’s CEO. The mobile apps from digital-only banks offer more functionality and new features are added more frequently than the apps from traditional banks, Cohee said.

“If you’re not using digital banking, then you’re not banking,” Cohee told Finurah.

Economic research over decades has shown that Black Americans have a scorned relationship with banks. Banks have denied would-be Black homeowners home loans and approved credit cards with higher interest rates when compared to other ethnicities. Because of these trends, thousands of Black Americans have left formal banking altogether.

A majority of unbanked and underbanked Americans are Black, according to Federal Reserve data from 2019.
