5/9/2022,"An animal advocacy organisation is calling for criminal charges to be brought against five students who hung a gutted shark from rafters at a Florida high school as a “prank”. The shark was discovered at Ponte Vedra High School near Jacksonville at 8am on Thursday morning. The animal had been hoisted above a staircase in a courtyard. St John’s County School District officials cut down and removed the shark, and identified five senior students who they say hung the shark as part of a “prank”, WJXT reported. The school has turned surveillance footage over to the St Johns County Sheriff’s Office. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is leading the investigation and told First Coast News it had learned the shark was caught on Tuesday night, gutted, and stored in a freezer prior to being hung at around 9pm on Wednesday. OneProtest, an animal advocacy group, launched an online petition calling for the students to face criminal charges which had gathered nearly 3,000 signatures by Sunday morning. “We are dealing with high school seniors who have a blatant disregard for life and find killing, mutilating, and displaying the body of an animal as ‘funny’ or a ‘prank’ this kind of mentality and behaviour deserves to be punished,” the petition stated. OneProtest executive director Adam Suglaski told WJXT the potential charges the students might face depended on whether the shark was an endangered species. “Regardless of what species of shark it is, it’s still, like, it’s kind of upsetting to see that animal just being, you know, used as a prank,” Mr Suglaski told the news site. University of North Florida professor of biology Jim Gelsleichter told WJXT it could be a sandbar shark, which are banned from recreational and commercial harvest in Florida. Possible charges include trespassing, wildlife violations and criminal mischief, a local lawyer told the news outlet. The school district and Florida wildlife commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Images of the shark were shared widely across social media, with one student describing the act as “gruesome”.

Source: Samoilenko during a briefing from Azovstal Samoilenko's Quote: One could run away like a coward, think only of one's own life, but not think about one's own duty, the oath that one took upon oneself. This is exactly what happened to the commander of the Marines of the 36th Brigade. He simply refused to carry out the order that was issued to him. And he tried to flee the city with a small group of working tanks, armoured combat vehicles, [and] ammunition… ... here (from Mariupol - ed.) it is impossible to break through, but if you think only about your own life, you will grab every opportunity to prolong this life. It's a big shame."" Details: Samoilenko noted that the Azov Regiment is now more than 100 kilometres from the original positions. Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov regiment, also spoke about this in an interview with Ukrayinska Pravda. Prokopenko's Quote: ""Then, unexpectedly, [​​Volodymyr Baraniuk], the commander of the 36th Brigade decided, without warning anyone, to simply make a breakthrough in an unknown direction and thereby lost many people. Also, many people were left to their fate, and they were simply captured. If this had not happened, with this brigade we would have been able to keep the defence on the right bank for a long time, but the flank was exposed, and after the completion of the clearing of the Ilyich plant, the enemy threw all their forces in our direction - this allowed them to attack us from the flank and rear.""

5/9/2022,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Berlin criminal investigators and prosecutors were on Saturday studying a device found and destroyed at a residential building housing Russian news agency staff in the city's Steglitz district, Berlin authorities said. The device was found on Friday and investigators were looking into how dangerous it had been and who it was aimed at, a Berlin police spokesman said in response to an enquiry in the morning. A statement issued jointly by the police and the city state's prosecutor in the afternoon said the possible motivation behind placing the device was now subject of investigation by the department of state security at Berlin's state criminal police office and the prosecutor's office. It identified the building as being in Lepsius street in the south-western district of Berlin. Russia's embassy in Berlin said a bottle had been thrown through a window of the apartment block on Friday evening, and that an improvised bomb had been found in the subsequent search, which it said German sappers had identified and deactivated. The Russian state-run RIA news agency said it had journalists living in the block. Russia's foreign ministry demanded on Saturday that authorities in Germany and other European Union and NATO states take steps to protect Russian journalists and their families abroad. ""We see this as a direct consequence of the harassment of Russia media and their employees unleashed in the West,"" its statement said. ""The politicised decision to disconnect Russian media from the airwaves in the European Union was the precursor to their physical intimidation, right up to their elimination."" Video footage broadcast by RIA on Friday evening showed a cordoned-off street and a person in a protective suit, which the agency said was one of the sappers working to defuse the bomb. Various Russian broadcasters have been banned in Western countries after being accused of spreading propaganda in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm the country and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. State-controlled Russian outlets RT and Sputnik were banned throughout the European Union on March 2. ""Systematic information manipulation and disinformation by the Kremlin is applied as an operational tool in its assault on Ukraine,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at the time.

5/9/2022,"By Nichola Groom (Reuters) - California energy officials on Friday issued a sober forecast for the state's electrical grid, saying it lacks sufficient capacity to keep the lights on this summer and beyond if heatwaves, wildfires or other extreme events take their toll. The update from leaders from three state agencies and the office of Governor Gavin Newsom comes in response to a string of challenges with the ambitious transition away from fossil fuels, including rolling blackouts during a summer heat wave in 2020. California has among the most aggressive climate change policies in the world, including a goal of producing all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045. In an online briefing with reporters, the officials forecast a potential shortfall of 1,700 megawatts this year, a number that could go as high as 5,000 MW if the grid is taxed by multiple challenges that reduce available power while sending demand soaring, state officials said during an online briefing with reporters. Supply gaps along those lines could leave between 1 million and 4 million people without power. Outages will only happen under extreme conditions, officials cautioned, and will depend in part on the success of conservation measures. In 2025, the state will still have a capacity shortfall of about 1,800 MW, according to officials from the California Energy Commission, Public Utilities Commission, California Independent System Operator and Newsom's office. They also projected annual electricity rate increases of between 4% and 9% between now and 2025. California's electricity planning has been challenged as devastating wildfires have cut off transmission lines and extreme heat events and drought have hampered hydropower supplies. Officials said traditional electricity demand forecasting does not account for such extreme events prompted by a changing climate. At the same time, many solar farms and energy storage projects the state has commissioned over the last two years were delayed due to supply chain challenges during the pandemic and a recent federal trade probe into solar imports. ""We are in a place now where we have to factor in a new landscape in terms of the challenge in front of us with bringing the projects that we need online,"" Karen Douglas, an adviser to Newsom, said during the briefing. The announcement, which came a week after Newsom said the state was open to keeping its remaining nuclear power plant running to maintain reliability, appeared to lay the groundwork for an effort to keep older facilities -- some of which are powered by natural gas -- online. ""We need to make sure that the we have sufficient new resources in place and operational before we let some of these retirements go,"" said Mark Rothleder, chief operating officer at the California ISO grid operator. ""Otherwise we are putting ourselves potentially at risk of having insufficient capacity.""

5/9/2022,"By Rupam Jain MUMBAI (Reuters) - Sitting in an office lined with books overlooking a giant prayer hall, Mohammed Ashfaq Kazi, the main preacher at the largest mosque in Mumbai, checked a decibel meter attached to the loudspeakers before he gave the call to worship. ""The volume of our azaan (call to prayer) has become a political issue, but I don't want it to take a communal turn,"" said Kazi, one of the most influential Islamic scholars in the sprawling metropolis on India's western coast. As he spoke he pointed to loudspeakers attached to the minarets of the ornate, sand-coloured Juma Masjid in Mumbai's old trading quarters. Kazi and three other senior clerics from Maharashtra where Mumbai is located said more than 900 mosques in the west of the state had agreed to turn the volume down on calls to prayer following complaints from a local Hindu politician. Raj Thackeray, leader of a regional Hindu party, demanded in April that mosques and others places of worship kept within allowed noise limits. If they did not, he said his followers would chant Hindu prayers outside mosques in protest. Thackeray, whose party has just one seat in the state's 288-member assembly, said he was merely insisting that court rulings on noise levels be enforced. ""If religion is a private matter then why are Muslims allowed to use loudspeakers all 365 days (of the year)?"" Thackeray told reporters in Mumbai, India's financial hub and capital of Maharashtra. ""My dear Hindu brothers, sisters and mothers come together; be one in bringing down these loudspeakers,"" he said. Leaders of India's 200 million Muslims see the move, which coincided with the holy festival of Eid, as another attempt by hardline Hindus to undermine their rights to free worship and religious expression, with the tacit agreement of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In recent weeks, a senior BJP leader began pushing for swapping marriage and inheritance laws based on religion with a uniform civil code, taking aim at rules that allow Muslim men, for example, to have four wives. The BJP did not respond to a request for comment on Thackeray's initiative. It denies targeting minorities, and says it wants progressive change that benefits all Indians. POLICE STEP IN At the Juma Masjid, Kazi said he complied with Thackeray's demands in order to reduce the risk of violence between Muslims and Hindus. Bloody clashes have erupted sporadically across India since independence, most recently in 2020 when dozens of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in Delhi following protests against a citizenship law that Muslims said discriminated against them. While hardline Hindu leaders were seeking to undermine Islam, Kazi said, ""we (Muslims) have to maintain calm and serenity."" The state took Thackeray's initiative seriously. Senior police officials met religious leaders including Kazi earlier this month to ensure microphones were turned down, as they feared clashes in Maharashtra, home to more than 10 million Muslims and 70 million Hindus. On Saturday, police filed a criminal case against two men in Mumbai for using loudspeakers to recite the early morning azaan and warned workers of Thackeray's party from gathering around mosques. ""Under no circumstances will we allow anyone to create communal tension in the state and the court's order must be respected,"" said V.N. Patil, a senior Mumbai police official. A senior official for Thackeray's party said the initiative was not designed to single out Muslims but aimed to reduce ""noise pollution"" created by all places of worship. ""Our party does not appease the minority community,"" said Kirtikumar Shinde, adding that police had issued warnings to 20,000 party workers this month. The issue of calls to prayer extends beyond Maharashtra. BJP politicians in three states asked local police to remove or limit the use of loudspeakers in places of worship. The deputy chief minister of country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, said over 60,000 unauthorised loudspeakers had been removed from mosques and temples.
