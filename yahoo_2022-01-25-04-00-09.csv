1/25/2022,"Jon Stewart once told Jeff Bezos that his vision for the economy was a ""recipe for revolution."" Stewart said during a recent podcast episode that former President Barack Obama agreed. In recent years, Amazon employees have gone on strike, filed lawsuits, and attempted to unionize. Jeff Bezos' vision for the future has made him one of the world's richest people, but comedian Jon Stewart sees it as a ""recipe for revolution"" — and he once told Bezos as much. In an episode of the podcast ""The Problem With Jon Stewart"" published this month, Stewart described meeting Bezos at a dinner at the White House with former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, billionaire Mark Cuban, and an unnamed guest whom Stewart described as the ""inventor of the Oculus"" virtual reality headset. As Stewart tells it, Bezos discussed what he sees as the economy of the future, one that relies on service workers to perform tasks. Stewart said he disagreed, that people want to feel proud of their work, and feel like they're contributing to society and not just ""running errands for people that have more than you,"" Stewart said he told Bezos. ""I think he views everybody as like a part of a fulfillment center,"" Stewart said. ""And so I said, 'I think that's a recipe for revolution.' And then, like, kind of a hush falls over. And then you hear Obama from across the couch go, 'I agree with Jon.'"" While Stewart's jab at Bezos occurred at least five years ago, criticism of the Amazon founder and his company's business model has ramped up in recent years as employees have increasingly spoken out about grueling working conditions and an intense focus on meeting lofty goals, all in the name of Amazon's ""customer obsessed"" company culture. During the pandemic, Amazon's share price — and, by extension, Bezos' net worth — reached new highs as consumers turned to the e-commerce giant more than ever before. But that success appears to have led to situations not unlike what Stewart warned about: As the company's own warehouse workers fell ill by the tens of thousands, employees went on strike, filed lawsuits, protested outside Bezos' home, and, at one Alabama fulfillment center, even attempted to unionize.

1/25/2022,"Southern California conservation workers recently encountered what might be described as the king of kingsnakes. The enormous kingsnake, spotted last month by members of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, measured an estimated 7 feet. The average California kingsnake measures about half that size. The MRCA explained via Facebook that Alberto Silva was inspecting a restoration site near Liberty Canyon in Agoura Hills – the crew had been planting oak trees – when he saw the snake slithering toward a busy road. “Fearing this long native snake may not be able to avoid vehicles, Alberto quickly rushed into action using a large branch to safely lift and gently move the snake back to a planted area,” the MRCA stated. Dash Stolarz, an MRCA spokeswoman, told FTW Outdoors that the crew was “astonished” by the size of the kingsnake. She added that the crew also spotted a “more averaged-sized kingsnake” in the same area north of the Ventura Freeway. ALSO ON FTW OUTDOORS: Video shows man fighting a black bear he thought was a dog California kingsnakes rarely exceed 4 feet in length. Although larger specimens have been documented, a 7-foot kingsnake is considered extraordinary. The snakes are endemic to the western U.S. and northern Mexico. They’re known for their striking appearance – a typical kingsnake is black with white or cream-colored rings, but color patterns vary. Kingsnakes are nonvenomous constrictors that prey on rodents, frogs, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous rattlesnakes. Liberty Canyon is the site of the future Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, which will connect the Simi Hills to the Santa Monica Mountains via a 210-foot vegetated overpass that will span the Ventura Freeway. The bridge, expected to be completed by the end of 2023, will become the largest urban wildlife crossing of its kind and benefit mountain lions and other critters. Apparently, that includes abnormally massive snakes. In describing the recent kingsnake encounter, the MRCA began its Facebook post by jokingly stating, “We’re going to need a bigger wildlife crossing.” –Image showing Alberto Silva with the kingsnake is courtesy of the Mountain Recreation Conservation Authority",U.S./FTW Outdoors,‘Astonishingly’ huge kingsnake encountered by conservation crew,https://news.yahoo.com/astonishingly-huge-kingsnake-encountered-conservation-170023381.html
1/25/2022,"A Dutch tourist was arrested Sunday at the site of the Auschwitz death camp for making a Nazi salute while posing for a photo, police said. The 29-year-old woman from the Netherlands made the gesture in front of the gate that says ""Work Sets You Free"" as her 30-year-old husband took a photo. Authorities did not release the woman's name. Police told the Polish News Agency the security on the site of the now memorial and museum saw the salute and contacted police. Police detained the woman, and her husband was taken in for questioning. The woman pleaded guilty and was charged an undisclosed fine. The Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial confirmed the incident on Twitter. ""The Memorial Security detained a 29 y/o Dutch woman today while making the Nazi salute at the gate of the former Auschwitz I camp. Police was called,"" the tweet said. ""The woman accepted the fine imposed by the prosecutor. She explained her behavior as a 'stupid joke.'""

The woman accepted the fine imposed by the prosecutor. She explained her behavior as a 'stupid joke'. https://t.co/UF6bk3QTdK — Auschwitz Memorial (@AuschwitzMuseum) January 23, 2022 Throughout Europe, making a Nazi salute, as well as supporting the fascist group vocally or in written form, is illegal and can result in prison time. In Poland, where Auschwitz is located, promoting Nazi propaganda can result in up to two years in prison. In 2013, the Polish outlet reported two students from Turkey made the gesture at the same gate, which resulted in them being sentenced to six months in prison, along with a fine and suspension. On Jan. 13, police detained three men for vandalizing a wall of a Jewish cemetery with a Nazi symbol. The gate where the woman took the photo was known as the ""Gate of Death."" The camp, established in 1940, was the largest concentration camp of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. At least 1.1 million men, women and children died at the camp, most of whom were Jewish, by gas chambers and slave labor. Follow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.
