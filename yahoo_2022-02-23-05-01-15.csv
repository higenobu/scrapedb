2/23/2022,"By Andrey Ostroukh and Alexander Marrow MOSCOW (Reuters) -The rouble rebounded from a near two-year low and shares in major Russian banks leapt on Tuesday after Britain announced the first but relatively modest sanctions after Moscow recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent. The rouble on Monday suffered its biggest one-day drop since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic after President Vladimir Putin recognised the two regions as independent, but it regained some ground in volatile trade as the first round of penalties proved to be less harmful than feared. Britain imposed sanctions on five Russian banks and three billionaires but stopped short of targeting major lenders, such as state-controlled Sberbank and VTB. Shares in Russia's largest lender Sberbank jumped 7.9% on the day as of 1517 GMT, while shares in No.2 bank VTB were up 4.7%. Other possible sanctions could target major financial institutions, block Russia's access to electronics supplies, or curb the operations of its energy firms. The rouble rebounded to 79.13 to the dollar, up 0.8%, after earlier falling to 80.97, a level last seen on March 23, 2020. That resurgence came as Russia said it would only recognise the regions' independence within the boundaries that the Moscow-backed separatists currently control, and as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy played down the prospect of a large-scale conflict with Russia. ""There was a headline that just hit that they (Russia) are recognising the borders where they have authority, so markets are rallying on that,"" said Peter Kisler, emerging market fund manager at Trium Capital. ""We are not in the clear - but that gives a path to de-escalation."" The Russian central bank said it was ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability, and analysts said currency market interventions to limit rouble losses were one of the options on the table. Against the euro, the rouble was 0.5% stronger at 89.75, having earlier hit 91.4475, its weakest level since April 2021. RUSSIA SELL-OFF Russian markets plunged on Western fears that Putin's moves - to recognise the independence of the two regions collectively known as the Donbass and send in forces to ""keep the peace"" - might presage a major war. ""It was nothing but a disaster yesterday – news that the conflict with Ukraine in Donbass could be turning hot triggered a massive sell-off in all types of assets,"" BCS Global Markets said in a note. The sell-off also hit Russia's neighbours. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, hit an all-time low of 29.1198 to the dollar, while Kazakhstan's tenge slipped to 438.08 against the greenback from levels around 427 seen on Monday. On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia was heading towards ""pariah status"" and that the world must now brace for the next stage of Putin's plan, saying the Kremlin was laying the ground for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian OFZ bonds fell further, with yields on 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to prices, hitting their highest since early 2016. ""The market situation is really tense. Non-residents are likely to cut their positions (in OFZs) ... and buy foreign currency instead. Rouble positions will depend on sanctions,"" said Georgiy Vaschenko, head of trading on the Russian stock market at the Freedom Finance brokerage. OFZ bonds used to be popular among foreign investors due to their relatively high yields, but non-residents have cut exposure to Russia in recent months. Russian stock indexes have lost around a quarter of their value in just five days but tried to recover on Tuesday. The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 2.1% to 1,233.9 points after hitting 1,075.98, its lowest since November 2020. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 2.1% higher at 3,099.2 points.

2/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street strategists, bullish before Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine’s border, are mostly sticking to their view that stock markets can weather Europe’s brewing security crisis. For now at least. Most Read from Bloomberg Porsches, Lamborghinis Lost at Sea May Cost VW $155 Million U.S. Condemns Russian Move at UN, Reassures Kyiv: Ukraine Update EU’s Borrell Urges Sanctions Against ‘Oligarchs’: Ukraine Update U.S. Stocks Decline on Ukraine Shock; Oil Gains: Markets Wrap Why Donetsk and Luhansk Matter to Putin and the West After a week of volatility, they say loose financial conditions and growing corporate profits will anchor large-cap indexes amid deteriorating relations between Moscow and Western powers. Corporate balance sheets, meanwhile, will prove broadly resilient to higher energy prices and disrupted supplies. In this view, the Federal Reserve, not geopolitics, remains the principal threat, while outsize hedging activity gives portfolio managers some firepower to ride through the crisis. U.S. officials said additional American sanctions against Russia are coming after President Joe Biden issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. investment, trade, and financing to separatist regions of Ukraine. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 fell Tuesday, while the Stoxx 600 Index pared losses to trade flat. Easing expectations on the pace of Fed rate hikes may buoy risk sentiment, according to Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co. Traders are now pricing in six 25-basis-point hikes for the full year down from earlier expectations for seven increases in 2022. Here are five strategists on why stock markets are likely to weather the geopolitical storm. ‘Oversold’ Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V Research Yearend S&P 500 target: 5,040 “Financial conditions have tightened but remain historically easy, earnings growth continues to offset multiple contraction, and just about every major market is oversold.” “We remain long thematic baskets like pricing power, companies that benefit from higher real rates and improving supply chains. An escalation in Russia/Ukraine could lead to a much quicker tightening of financial conditions and limit the increase in bond yields.” ‘Short-Term Disruptions’ Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Yearend S&P 500 target: 4,715 “We think geopolitical stress surrounding Russia and Ukraine will add volatility and some near term down-side to risk markets including equities. We believe Fed action will be much more influential longer-term. Geopolitical may cause some short term disruptions but changes in monetary policy will be longer lasting and more pervasive.” ‘Accurate’ Discount John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Yearend S&P target: 5,330 target “Consider the market’s dip and recovery in previous escalation of hostilities from as far back as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Gulf War, the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Notwithstanding initial volatility we recall that the U.S. market has in the distant and recent past considered how a geopolitical situation might affect corporate revenue and earnings and arrived at a discount that in hindsight has proven to be remarkably accurate.” “Markets are resilient in our view for a number of reasons. Fourth-quarter earnings season has surprised nicely to the upside across key sectors which suggest growth is not the problem but rather that supply chain disruptions remain prevalent.” Recovery Potential Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research Yearend S&P 500 target: 5,000 “Historically, crisis events have triggered pullbacks, but the market has typically recovered the losses within a few months. Looking at 54 crisis events since 1907, the Dow Industrials have fallen an average of 7.1% during the crisis period, but gained an average of 9.7% in the six months after the crisis ended.” “Russia-Ukraine risks spiking already high energy prices, meaning the earnings slowdown could be steeper than consensus estimates. Big picture, this does not alter our U.S. stock market outlook for a weak first-half with the potential for a second-half recovery.” Low Earnings Risk Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Russia-Ukraine tension is a low earnings risk for U.S. corporates. While the path remains unclear with potentially elevated market volatility in the short-term, tightening monetary policy, in our view, still remains the key risk for equities. We’d caution against making hasty changes to global asset allocations right now.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord Elon Musk’s Boring Company Plots Texas Tunnels ‘Zero-Click’ Hacks Are Growing in Popularity.
