12/14/2021,"Ilike to think of myself as a generous person with pockets of tightness, rather than a tight person with a blind spot in pubs. One of these pockets is around grocery delivery services. You know: you need a green pepper, a gale is blowing outside, so you get some poor kid on a bike to go to the supermarket for you and, by some miracle of modern capitalism, your pepper is only 30p more expensive than it would be normally, as long as you also order ice-cream. It’s not the money that bugs me, just the underlying Marxist truism – that if some of us refuse to do any of our own menial tasks, others will end up doing all menial tasks for everyone. Plus, we live next door to a supermarket and I’m not even exaggerating, except by a small amount.  Mr Z, on the other hand, loves a grocery service. To give him his right of reply, he would argue that I outsource more menial tasks than he does, to which I would reply … no, wait, I can’t give myself a right to reply to his imaginary reply. Anyway, we have this argument at least twice a day, so it was only a matter of time before we would have it in a cab and I would want to bring the driver into it. “My husband,” I intoned with a certain amount of seriousness, “really likes Gorillas, while I disapprove.” “You disapprove of gorillas?” he asked, baffled. I paused to disambiguate, as they say on Wikipedia. “This is like that penguin in Japan,” the driver observed, once he had got to the bottom of our beef. “He goes to the fish shop every day and they give him a fish. He has a backpack.” We broke off to find the penguin on the internet. By the time we had watched as Lala, a 10-year-old king penguin, went shopping on his own, we had arrived at our destination. There was a question mark over who the driver had been agreeing with. According to me, me: if a penguin can go to the shop on his own, a human can buy its own stupid green pepper. According to Mr Z, him. Or rather, how can you argue about a thing like this when a miracle penguin exists? Genius diplomacy by the driver, in other words: five stars.

12/14/2021,"A woman accused of helping to topple the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston told police it was “an abhorrent offence” to the population of Bristol, a court has heard. Rhian Graham was one of four people to go on trial at Bristol crown court accused of criminal damage of the 125-year-old bronze statue, which was pulled from its plinth during Black Lives Matter protests last year, and thrown in the River Avon.  The jury heard that Graham said in a police interview: “I accept that I helped cause the damage to the statue. “But whether it is criminal or not I think, is up for debate, because of all the context around the statue, and the fact that people have campaigned to take it down and it is just an abhorrent offence to a lot of the population of Bristol.” Opening for the prosecution, however, William Hughes QC told the jury of six men and six women that the fact that Colston was a slave trader was “wholly irrelevant” to the case before them. Graham, 30, was accused alongside Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, and “others unknown” of helping to tie ropes around the statue’s neck that were used to pull it to the ground. Jake Skuse, 33, was accused of helping to roll it to Bristol harbour, where it was thrown into the River Avon. Hughes said that at 2pm on 7 June last year a peaceful march had begun in the city as part of the worldwide Black Lives Matter demonstrations after the murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a police officer in Minnesota. While the bulk of the 10,000-strong crowd proceeded on a route agreed by organisers, a “small number of individuals” gathered around the statue of Colston in the city centre, which became their “focus of attention”, Hughes said. “Using ropes brought to the scene, the statue was pulled down from its plinth by members of this small group, who included the first three defendants,” he argued. “After being daubed with paint, spat on and being struck with implements, the statue was then rolled through the centre and thrown into the harbour at Pero’s bridge. “The fourth defendant – Mr Skuse, the crown say – was involved in this later activity of rolling the statue from its original place to where it was thrown into the water.” There were cheers and applause from the public gallery when video played to the jury showed the moment Colston was felled, prompting a warning from the judge, Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol. Hughes said the video clearly showed the defendants taking part in the actions that damaged the statue. Hughes told the court: “The prosecution accept and make clear Edward Colston himself was and remains a divisive figure among the people of Bristol and beyond. It is common ground that he was a slaver and gained much of his fortune from the slave trade. “In later life, it appears Colston was also something of a philanthropist. This prosecution is not about justification of him or his vilification; the prosecution’s position is that it is wholly irrelevant to the issues you have to decide in this case – the defence position is the contrary – that it is relevant.” All four defendants were interviewed by police in the weeks after the protest. Skuse and Ponsford answered no comment to all questions, while Graham and Willoughby admitted the role they played but argued it was justified. Hughes said that when the statue was pulled out of the River Avon four days later it was estimated that the cost of repairing it would be about £3,750, and that a further £350 worth of damage was caused to the railings by Pero’s bridge. Bristol city council have since chosen not to repair the damage to the statue, and it now lies, still broken and daubed with paint, in a museum in the city. Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage.

12/14/2021,"Your starter for 10 … Sajid Javid audibly bristled. Ever since the photo of Boris Johnson hosting the Downing Street quiz night appeared at the weekend, cabinet ministers have become even more tetchy about being asked questions. So the health secretary was on the defensive throughout the morning media round and made little attempt to disguise the fact he was appearing under duress. His return to cabinet has not been nearly as much fun as he had hoped. But with the Omicron variant spreading at breakneck speed, the Saj had little choice but to turn up to explain why the government had yet again been caught on the hop. How come, said Justin Webb on Radio 4’s Today programme, the government hadn’t accelerated its booster programme last week – or the week before – given the Omicron threat?  And, come to think of it, why had Johnson installed such a hopeless deadbeat as Maggie Throup as vaccines minister? Someone charisma-free who could be relied on to take an age to do next to nothing. Wasn’t that a sign the government had rather taken its eye off the ball in regard to Covid? Even though the possibility of a new variant appearing – as it had in the form of the Delta variant last year – was always on the cards, Boris had acted as if the worst of the pandemic was over. Javid sighed heavily. Typical BBC to put a negative spin on the superb efforts of the government. It’s now become axiomatic in Boris circles that the BBC should be condemned for failing to do the jobs the prime minister had been unable to do himself. It was the magic of Christmas, Javid said, for the government to be caught out twice in the same way by the coronavirus. An Xmas miracle that would have taken anyone by surprise. Apart from all those doctors and epidemiologists who had widely predicted it. Try to concentrate on the upside, the Saj continued. Everyone over 18 was going to be offered a booster jab by the end of the year. And as he was effectively offering them the jab now, this was one promise the government could claim to have delivered more than two weeks ahead of schedule. So how about some applause for that? But if nit-pickers, such as Webb, were going to insist the target meant actual jabs in arms then he would promise that as well. Even though that meant administering well north of a million vaccines a day when our previous best for a week had been under 600,000 a day back in May. Now it was Webb’s turn to be taken by surprise. Surely this meant the NHS would struggle to cope with its ordinary caseload and that more people would die of non-Covid conditions? “People who feel they have cancer will be treated,” the Saj said gnomically. No one had a clue what he meant. You’ve either got cancer or you haven’t, and you almost always need specific tests to determine whether a specific symptom is cancer or not, and Javid had done little to reassure anyone they would get the treatment they need. As so often, it felt as if the health secretary was winging it. “Let’s talk about Boris Johnson,” said Webb. “Why bother?” snapped Javid. Er … because he’s the prime minister and he’s up to his neck in trouble over the exponential spread of Downing Street parties. “What are his qualities?” Webb persisted. Other than that he’s a liar and raging narcissist. The Saj paused. Trying to dig up just one positive thing to say. “Er … I think people who watched the prime minister’s TV address will have seen someone focused on the nation’s challenges.” Or not. Most will have seen a wreck of a human in his late 50s with the haircut of a 10-year-old who had wandered into a skunk farm with a pair of secateurs by mistake. Someone who was too scared to do a press conference in case he was asked any difficult questions. “The prime minister works every minute of every day,” Javid concluded. Though obviously not including the times when he’s hosting parties – it’s a wonder any work was done in Downing Street last Christmas – or having babies. Come to think of it, if this is Boris working 24/7 we might be better off with him taking more time off. Johnson did briefly appear in person around lunchtime to do a news clip from the vaccination centre. Apart from talking up what a brilliant job he had done on Omicron – it was a mystery why we had run out of lateral flow tests – his main contribution was to say that he hadn’t broken any Covid rules last Xmas. No, it was just everyone else in Downing Street who had and he didn’t give a toss what happened to them. Loyalty was for wimps. Besides, he couldn’t possibly be held accountable for what went on in his place of work. Or indeed his flat. How could he possibly have known that most of his staff were pissed when he was busy thinking up trick questions, such as “Have you had assurance you have not knowingly broken the lockdown rules?” It was left to Javid to make a second public appearance – this time in the Commons – to give a statement on everything the prime minister had already announced over the past 24 hours. Though not before the Speaker called out Johnson for not having the grace or guts to make the statement in person. When it comes to quizzes, it turns out that these days Boris is much happier setting the questions than asking them. In reply, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, took issue with some of the details of Javid’s statement on the availability of tests, but said Labour would never play politics with public health and would thus be supporting the booster programme. His only slightly fanciful moment came when he asked the prime minister to be straight with the country. Boris has never been straight with anyone, so why change the habit of a lifetime? Streeting then got a grip and said it was up to everyone else to show leadership in the absence of any from Johnson. Javid had to actively restrain himself from agreeing. The health secretary has nearly had enough of cleaning up Boris’s shitshows. What followed was all quite reasonable and amicable. A measure perhaps of how much Omicron has spooked MPs on all sides of the house. Even Mark Harper, who seldom resists the chance to preen his defiance to any measure that might save lives, sounded conciliatory. The one awkward moment came for Javid came when Andrea Leadsom wondered what he might say to her constituent who was now more scared of government intrusion into civil liberty than Covid. The Saj was non-committal. Though he could have said: “See if she feels the same way when she or a relative are on life support.”  A Farewell to Calm by John Crace is published by Guardian Faber, price £9.99.

12/14/2021,"A former pastry chef at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant has claimed she was left with crippling repetitive strain injury from placing sweets into bags using tweezers and hand-making chocolate playing cards and about 550 whisky wine gums a day, court documents show. Sharon Anderson, 30, who worked at the three Michelin-starred restaurant in Bray, Berks, between 2014 and 2015, claims she is now plagued by constant wrist pain, and is suing for £200,000 damages.  Her work included putting 400 sweets a day into small bags using tweezers, racing against time to make chocolate playing cards before the chocolate set too hard, and administering hundreds of tiny fingertip pinches to mushroom logs, court documents state. Last week her lawyers told a high court judge that the “fast, arduous and repetitive” tasks meant she was effectively working on a factory floor as she made the concoctions dreamt up for the celebrity chef’s kitchen. “She was essentially on what was effectively a production line,” her barrister, Joel Kendall, said. The company denies liability, claiming the work she did was routine for a pastry chef in a “fine dining restaurant” and that she was given sufficient breaks. Lawyers acting on behalf of the restaurant claim there was a stark lack of medical evidence provided by Anderson. Anderson, of County Donegal, Ireland, claims her injury was caused by being made to perform work that was “too fast, arduous and repetitive for her.” In court documents, she states that her role included wrapping and packing about 400 individual sweets into cellophane bags from 7-11am, before she switched to creating chocolate playing cards from 11.30am to around 4pm. The chocolate playing cards were made in moulds of metal and plastic, while each mould could create 12 cards and weighed over a kilogram. The completed mould weighed about 2kg, it is claimed, and Anderson aimed to produce around 180 cards a day. “The process had to be carried out under time pressure as it had to be completed before the chocolate set in each mould,” her lawyers claim in court papers. Anderson went with the restaurant when it moved to Melbourne, Australia, in January 2015, while the Bray premises were renovated. From February 2015, her work followed a similar pattern to life in Bray, she claims, although she was under pressure to handle even more moulds, due to wastage caused by cards melting faster in the warmer climate. Her kitchen shift then switched to making whisky wine gums between 4pm and 6pm, she says, and she would produce around 550 by hand. She now suffers “significant wrist pain” even after carrying out normal manual tasks, court documents state. The injury means she has recurring problems with daily tasks such as heavy lifting, driving and – crucially – cooking, her lawyers said. They claim the restaurant failed to allow sufficient rest periods or support, and “required her to work under time pressure throughout the day”. After a brief court hearing, Judge Victoria McCloud adjourned the dispute, directing a case management conference for May 2022 ahead of a trial of her compensation claim.",Lifestyle/Food,Ex-Fat Duck pastry chef sues for £200k over RSI claims,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/13/ex-fat-duck-pastry-chef-sues-for-200k-over-rsi-claims
12/14/2021,"Organisers of the Paris 2024 Olympics have unveiled a spectacular and audacious plan for the biggest opening ceremony in history, with a 6km parade of athletes in boats along the River Seine watched by more than 600,000 people. The athletes, who will be in more than 160 boats, will pass by Paris’s most iconic monuments, bridges and cultural institutions, including Notre Dame, the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. Along the length of the Seine, the emblematic river in the heart of the city, dozens of artistic performances are expected to take place, including BMX stunt riders leaping high over bridges. The ceremony will then conclude with a final show at the Place du Trocadéro, which faces the Eiffel Tower. Not only will the opening ceremony be bigger than ever before but, for the first time, most of it will be free to spectators.  Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, told the Guardian that it would be the most “audacious and accessible” opening ceremony in the Games’ history. “It’s not the easiest way to deliver the Games, but it is our duty to be really ambitious,” he added. “It is the launch of the Olympics. It has to send a strong message that those Games will be unique. “One billion people will watch the ceremony. We want them to feel the best of France. It will be a unique combination of a sport and cultural moment, with the entire city turned into a vast Olympic stadium.”No director has yet been confirmed for the ceremony. However, in announcing the proposals in Paris on Monday evening, Estanguet promised that the ceremony would be a “true moment of marvellous madness”.“The Seine represents the track, and the quays the spectators’ stands,” he added. “We want to ensure that we will showcase the best of sport, the best of culture, and offer a good show with music. The potential is unlimited. And over 600,000 people will have access – about 10 times more people than if it was staged in a traditional stadium. It will be a spectacular show.”The organisers’ plan is part of a wider policy to reimagine the Games, and take it to new audiences, with sports like breaking. Competitions will also be staged in the heart of the city, including beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, and equestrian sports at the Chateau de Versaille. Mass participation cycling and running events will also be staged on the Olympic courses during Paris 2024.Estanguet said that he had the 10,000 participants at the Paris 2024 Games in mind when coming up with such innovative opening ceremony proposals. “I’ve been an Olympic athlete and it’s been magical,” he said. “But it’s also right to say that many athletes don’t participate in the opening ceremony because of the constraints of standing for hours and also getting back quite late to the village. “But with the boat parade they will have the choice to go back to the village if they want to go to bed early, or to stay for the second part of the ceremony in a mini stadium by the Trocadero in the face of the Eiffel Tower. Another part of our thinking is that we wanted to use the existing landmarks of Paris, not build them within the stadium.”Estanguet, a former canoeist and the only French athlete to have won a gold medal at three Olympic Games, also confirmed that organisers were working on announcing plans for the mascot and torch relay. “To be honest with you, I’m very comfortable with the way this project is going,” he said. “We have set and maintained the right level of ambition. We are still on budget. We are still on time. We will have difficulties to face over the coming years, because that always happens. But touch wood: so far, so good.”",Sport/Sport,Paris 2024 Olympic organisers reveal audacious plans for opening ceremony,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/paris-2024-olympic-organisers-reveal-audacious-plans-for-opening-ceremony
12/14/2021,"Real Madrid have emerged as favourites to sign Antonio Rüdiger after positive talks with the Chelsea defender about joining on a free next summer. Rüdiger is yet to make progress with Chelsea over renewing his contract and the possibility of his leaving is a worry for Thomas Tuchel, who is dealing with uncertainty surrounding four defenders. César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Thiago Silva are also out of contract at the end of the season, although Silva is expected to agree a one-year extension soon.  Tuchel has said that he does not want to lose Rüdiger, who played a key role in Chelsea winning the Champions League last season. The 28-year-old, who can start negotiating a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from 1 January, turned down Chelsea’s opening offer of £140,000 a week and is believed to want closer to £200,000 a week. The Germany international, who earns about £90,000 a week, has been in outstanding form this season and believes he should be on a similar level to the club’s top earners. There has been no breakdown in Rüdiger’s relationship with Chelsea, with both parties understood to view the situation as amicable, but the club’s hierarchy remains reluctant to return with an improved offer. That has opened the door for Madrid, who are leading the race to sign the centre-back. Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are interested in Rüdiger, but talks with Madrid are understood to have progressed at an encouraging pace. Rüdiger is one of the biggest personalities in Chelsea’s dressing room and underlined his importance by winning two penalties in last Saturday’s 3-2 win over Leeds. His attractiveness to Madrid is obvious; the La Liga leaders would not have to pay a fee for one of the best defenders in the world and are willing to meet his demands. Chelsea have been left frustrated by Christensen changing his mind after twice reaching an agreement over a new deal. However there is confidence the centre-back will eventually commit himself to Chelsea. There is even more optimism over Silva. The Brazilian has impressed since joining on a free from PSG in 2020 and wants to stay for another season. The 37-year-old remains in good shape and hopes to play at the World Cup in Qatar. Tuchel values Silva’s leadership and he has similar respect for Azpilicueta, who joined Chelsea from Marseille in 2012. Azpilicueta has been a hugely reliable figure and the expectation remains that the club captain will commit to another year, although there is strong interest in the 32-year-old Spain right-back from Atlético Madrid and Barcelona. Atlético could need to replace Kieran Trippier, who wants to return to England, and Barcelona’s financial position means they are on the hunt for free transfers. Azpilicueta is happy at Chelsea despite often sitting on the bench this season, but he could decide that this is a good time to return to Spain.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid hold talks with Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger over summer move,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/13/real-madrid-hold-talks-with-chelseas-antonio-rudiger-over-summer-move
12/14/2021,"A friend and carer of Steve Bronski, the co-founder of 1980s pop trio Bronski Beat, has revealed that he died in a fire at his flat in central London last week. News of Bronski’s death emerged on Thursday when fellow band member Jimmy Somerville announced on Twitter that he was “sad to hear Steve has died”, describing him as “talented and a very melodic man”.  The cause of his death has not been officially confirmed and Somerville’s agent said he did not have any more information about it. But Josephine Samuel, who had cared for Bronski after a stroke, said he lived in a flat in Berwick Street that was the scene of a fatal fire on Tuesday. Samuel told the Guardian that she had visited Bronski at the address the day before the fire and has since returned to lay tributes to him. She said: “Because he had suffered a stroke, it was difficult for him to get up. He died from smoke inhalation.” Cards, flowers and photographs of Bronski and other members of the band have been laid at the entrance to the flat. They include a card left by Samuel and one card addressed to her that said: “Dear Josephine, My sincere condolences on your loss. Steve started the beat and it will never stop. Bronski Beat for ever. With very best wishes and deepest sympathy, a Small Town Boy. xx” Samuel, a 51-year-old gospel singer, said: “I remember him as gentle, quiet and kind, and a talented musician. I was mentioned in some of the songs he wrote but never released. “I cared for him all through his difficult time – about three years ago he suffered a stroke. I counselled him through depression. He treated me like a sister and I treated him as an older brother. We were very close.” Samuel, who had known Bronski for 16 years, added: “I came to visit him the day before he died. His death is like a nightmare to me, because I’ve been by his side for years. We are waiting to register the death before his body is taken to Scotland for burial.” On Tuesday a man was rescued from a first floor flat at the scene by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus. He died later in hospital, according to a spokesperson for London fire brigade, but she would not confirm his identity. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said that as the fire was deemed “non-suspicious”, the force could not confirm who died in the blaze. An office worker who works in a neighbouring building said he called the fire brigade when he saw smoke coming from the flat. He said: “Fire engines and ambulances came very quickly and we were moved to the end of the road.”",Arts/Music,Steve Bronski carer says musician died in Soho flat fire,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/13/tributes-left-for-steve-bronski-outside-his-soho-flat
12/14/2021,"Few people played tennis as beautifully as Manuel Santana. And few have played a greater role in popularising their sport in a major nation. It is not an exaggeration to say that millions of people play tennis in Spain today because Santana, who has died aged 83, won Wimbledon in 1966. It was not just that a Spaniard won Wimbledon, although he was the first to do so, but that he was the son of a groundskeeper at a tennis club in Madrid. He was a ball boy. He came from the working classes who, in the days of the dictator Francisco Franco, were not supposed to play rich men’s sports.  And tennis in Spain, right up to the 1960s, was a sport reserved for those who could afford to belong to a country club. More so than in most European nations, you had to be almost connected to the aristocracy to wield a racket. The immensity of Santana’s achievement was enhanced by the fact that he ended up being the frequent squash partner of the former king, Juan Carlos. And, for that, the beguiling, delightful Manolo could thank his charm as much as his talent. The moment Franco reacted to the national outpouring of happiness for their new humble hero by clutching Santana to his chest when he returned from Wimbledon, the class wall that separated the game from the masses came down. Santana had been honoured by Franco before because Wimbledon was not the first of Santana’s grand slam triumphs. He had won the French title in 1961 and 1964, and the US in 1965. But Wimbledon stood head and shoulders above every other tennis tournament in public awareness at that time, and his victory over Dennis Ralston in the final flipped a switch with sports fans in Spain. Tennis was suddenly a sport everyone wanted to play. The children who used to grab 10 minutes to hit leftover balls with dilapidated rackets were given proper opportunities to play. Almost immediately the next generation started to come through, led by the talented Manuel Orantes, a Catalan from a poor family, and soon after that José Higueras, a ballboy at the upper-crust Real Club de Barcelona, who eventually settled in California because he still found it difficult to mingle with the members when he became No 1 in Spain. “We owe everything to Manolo,” said Higueras, referring to Santana: “He opened the door.” Born in Madrid, to Mercedes (nee Martínez) and Braulio Santana, an electrician, Manolo (Manuel) left school when he was 10, and began working as a ballboy at Club Tenis de Velázquez. At the age of 13, he won the club’s ball boys’ tournament. After Braulio died when Manolo was 16, he was supported by Gloria Giron and her family. “By then I was beginning to play a little but I could only continue to do so because a family who were members of the club helped my mother with expenses, not just for my tennis but for my education,” he explained. His natural ability, highlighted by exquisite touch, quickly became obvious and by the time he played at Roland Garros, reaching the quarter-finals in 1960, he was developing a first serve of considerable power and a forehand that was becoming one of the game’s great strokes. The following year he announced his arrival at the top of the game in tremendous style, beating Roy Emerson and Rod Laver on the way to the final, where the reigning champion, Nicola Pietrangeli awaited him. “Nicola had been my idol growing up,” said Santana. “To play him in the final of the French and then to beat him in five sets was very emotional for me. I wanted to jump the net but I was scared so I climbed under the net as I had always done as a ball boy and there was Nicola with his arms wide open. I fell on his shoulder crying.” For this reporter it remains one of the great sights of sport – the new champion being consoled in the arms of the champion he had just defeated. They would remain lifelong friends. After winning Roland Garros for a second time in 1964, Santana made a brave, career-changing decision. “Tennis in those days was dominated by the Anglo-Saxon world and their preferred surface – grass,” Santana recounted when we spoke in Madrid several years ago. “Three of the grand slams were played on grass in those days and I knew I had to win on the surface to be taken seriously. So, in 1965, I decided not to play in Paris so that I could tune my game to the faster courts.” At Forest Hills that year, he claimed the US title by beating Cliff Drysdale in the final and was carried to the clubhouse on the shoulders of his cheering supporters. At Wimbledon, Emerson, the champion for two years and hot favourite to win again in 1966, crashed into the umpire’s chair after chasing a shot hurt his shoulder. The Australian struggled on but could not serve and was beaten by the left-handed Owen Davidson, a great doubles player with a modest singles record. Nevertheless, Davidson nearly made the most of his own good fortune by taking Santana to 7-5 in the fifth in the semi-final. For the Spaniard, the final proved easier. He beat Ralston, the American Davis Cup star, 6-4, 11-9, 6-4. Meanwhile, Santana had been busy becoming one of the most successful Davis Cup players of all time. With 92 singles and doubles victories in 46 ties, he cemented a position at No 3 behindPietrangeli (120 wins) and Ilie Nastase of Romania (109) as the player with the most wins in the history of the competition. Largely as a result of his efforts, frequently supported by Juan Gisbert, Orantes and the Arilla brothers, Spain reached the Davis Cup Challenge Round twice, in Sydney in 1965 and Brisbane in 1967. But on grass Australia were virtually invincible in those days and the likes of Emerson, Laver and John Newcombe ensured easy victories. Retiring from the game in 1970 without the fortune now accrued by top stars, Santana, who spoke excellent English, was hired as a public relations officer by Philip Morris in Madrid and worked for the company for many years. He became Davis Cup captain for a spell in the late 90s, but had been replaced by the time Spain finally won the cup against Australia in Barcelona in 2000. Later, he established himself with his third wife, Otti Glanzelius, a Swede, as owner of the Manolo Santana Racquet Club in Marbella after several years as director of tennis at the nearby Puente Romano hotel. After testing the water by running a Europe v Latin America team match in Madrid in the 70s, Santana assumed the role of tournament director of the ATP Masters Series event in Madrid (2002) and the WTA Championships at the same venue (2006-08). He was latterly diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Santana’s first three marriages ended in divorce. In 1962 he married Maria Fernanda González-Dopeso, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. He also had a daughter with his second wife, Mila Ximenez, a journalist, and another from a relationship with Bárbara Oltra. In 2013 he married his fourth wife, Claudia Rodríguez.

12/14/2021,"Sergio Agüero is due to announce his retirement from football on Wednesday because of a heart condition, six months after Manchester City’s record scorer joined Barcelona as a free agent. The 33-year-old experienced chest problems and breathing difficulties during the first half of Barcelona’s 1-1 draw with Alavés on 30 October. Agüero fell to the turf at the Camp Nou clutching his chest and was treated for several minutes before being able to walk off. He was admitted to hospital for cardiological tests, the club later stating that he would be out for three months and would undertake a “diagnostic and therapeutic process”.  Agüero, though, is unable to resume a glittering 18-year-career that began for the Argentinian at Independiente, when he became his country’s youngest top-flight debutant. After three years the striker moved to Atlético Madrid in 2006, before signing for City in summer 2011. His first season at the club ended in a career highlight when his 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers snatched top spot from Manchester United and gave City a first title since 1968. A decade at the club ended with him on a record 260 goals in 390 appearances, with 184 goals scored in the Premier League, a record for one team. His final City appearance ended in the heartbreak of a Champions League final defeat by Chelsea, with another low point being the 2014 World Cup final loss to Germany. In five matches for Barcelona Agüero scored once. He got 41 goals in 101 games for Argentina.

12/14/2021,"The budget airline Ryanair has divided opinion on social media with a barb aimed at the UK government’s latest travel restrictions and Covid-prevention measures. In a widely shared tweet, Ryanair posted a chart that mocked the government’s own Covid alert graphics, comparing the rising Covid alert status as a result of the threat of the Omicron variant to rising levels of partying among government figures.  The Ryanair partying levels start at “small gathering with wine and cheese”, a reference to the hospitality offering at the alleged Downing St party on 18 December last year, and rise to a second level of the prime minister hosting a pub quiz – pictures of which appeared to emerge over the weekend. The UK Covid Alert Level has been increased from Level 3 to Level 4 pic.twitter.com/7TTpwIDz98 The graphic suggests that higher levels of partying could include Michael Gove in charge of refreshments, Boris Johnson topless, and Jacob Rees-Mogg crying in a corner asking for nanny. Gove is reputed to be no stranger to a party, having been spotted dancing in a nightclub in Aberdeen in a fashion described as “merry” in September. Inevitably, there were those who considered it an ill-judged move, although it seems unlikely that a tweet like this would not have been signed off by senior management, rather than being an off-the-cuff response. Looks like a vacancy will soon be opening up in the @Ryanair marketing department There were also those gently poking fun at people who had been sanctimonious about the airline’s joke tweet. ""We'll be coming through the cabin with a complimentary selection of light satire and ironic counterpoint. If you are allergic to this sort of thing please stay in your seat, keep your mask on and stare out the window at a stratosphere nearly as cold as your icy, icy soul."" However, for a corporation to pointedly criticise the government’s pandemic response in this way is a risky reputational business, fraught with potential backlash. On one level this is unprofessional. On another it’s showing what a shocking state our government is in when companies can openly mock them. They must be confident that most of the public will be in agreement with them. Time for change Ryanair’s own behaviour during the pandemic has also come in for criticism on social media. It has been a vocal critic of travel restrictions, but has also been accused of running “ghost flights” to destinations that have imposed restrictive travel measures in order to avoid having to pay out refunds. A viral tweet from a few days previously gained a new lease of life in the wake of Ryanair’s social media attack on the government. Ryanair are flying empty planes back and forth to Austria cos they don't want to refund their customers. Meanwhile I'm washing a tin of beans so it can go out for recycling like a fucking idiot The airline is no stranger to publicity stunts. It has previously suggested selling standing-only tickets and charging passengers to use in-flight toilets in order to keep fares artificially low. Still, the Ryanair tweet didn’t quite conjure up quite as graphic a picture of the Downing Street parties as some did after Johnson’s TV address on Sunday.

12/14/2021,"Colombian police were responsible for the deaths of 11 protesters during anti-police protests that swept the capital in September 2020, according to a report published on Monday after an independent investigation backed by the mayor of Bogotá’s office and the United Nations. “It was a police massacre,” wrote Carlos Negret, a former ombudsman of the South American country who led the investigation, in the scathing and lengthy report published on Monday. “A decisive political and operational leadership, based on rights, was needed at national and local levels to avoid this happening.”  Protests swept Bogotá and the suburb of Soacha in September last year, after footage went viral that showed police officers pinning down and tasering a father of two who had been detained for breaking Covid restrictions. “Please, no more!,” he can be heard begging in the clip. He died shortly later from injuries sustained in custody. The incident was compared to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, footage of which also went viral and triggered widespread protests. Ordoñez’s death prompted protests which were met by a violent response by police officers who used “less-lethal” rounds, billy clubs and teargas while protesters set dozens of police kiosks ablaze across the city. Alongside 14 protesters killed – 11 of whom were killed by police – hundreds of demonstrators and officers were injured. Most of the deaths occurred in poorer neighbourhoods of the city, leading investigators to conclude in Monday’s report that “there exists a criminalization of poverty by the state forces, which unleashed authoritarian and illegal actions against residents of certain social sectors.” “The most representative and generalized practice during these days of protest was the illicit use of force on the part of members of the national police,” the report found. “This investigation concludes that the national police openly abandoned the principles of proportionality.” The investigation was carried out at the request of Bogotá’s mayor, Claudia López, and was supported by the UN development program. “Who should assume political responsibility?” asked López in a response included in the report. “Me, to begin with, but also the police and president [Iván Duque].” At the time of the protests, López called on Duque to calm the police, who answer to the defense ministry. The president had painted protesters as “urban terrorists”, borrowing talking points from the country’s decades-long civil war against leftist insurgents. Alejandro Lanz, co-director of Temblores, a local police violence watchdog, said the report showed systemic failures in the justice system which have allowed responsible police officers to escape prosecution and punishment. “The most worrying thing is that the vast majority of police officers involved in the massacre still patrol the streets of our city,” said Lanz. “It’s surprising that only four police officers have been charged, and only one of them has been deprived of their liberty, and that is just under house arrest.” “It’s extremely alarming to see the difference in how the attorney generals’ office and the justice system behaves in cases when the police are the presumed perpetrators, and when it is people that have participated in protests,” Lanz went on to say. Protests in Colombia continue to be met by police violence. In April this year, the police response to nationwide anti-poverty demonstrations was similarly brutal, with at least 20 people killed by police officers in the ensuing months of unrest, according to Human Rights Watch. “The response of the state was characterised by an excessive and disproportionate use of force, in many cases, including lethal force,” Inter American Commission on Human Rights president Antonia Urrejola said during a press conference in July.",News/Global development,"‘A police massacre’: Colombian officers killed 11 during protests against police violence, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/13/police-massacre-deaths-11-protesters-2020-report
12/14/2021,"There were some people on the pitch. Some Pokémon too and some bunnies and some bears. Lots and lots of bears. Lots of goals, too. At half-time in Real Betis’s final home game of 2021, on the night when they sang and danced and hugged and finished the year in a position higher than they have finished any season since 1935, a party breaking out in Heliopolis, it started raining cuddly toys. An annual tradition now, fans had been asked to bring theirs to the ground – no bigger than 35cm please, and no batteries included – and throw them from the stands, flying through the air onto the grass below. Or into blankets waiting to catch them, as if all those stuffed minions and their mates were leaping from a burning building. Everywhere, it was raining cats and dogs, and sheep and dinosaurs. On the night when Betis presented Alba, an eight-year-old who overcame leukaemia, as their “star signing”, 52,158 people were in the stands at the Benito Villamarín, the place packed and over 19,000 cuddlies were on the pitch, literally sack-fulls of the things, gathered up and given to kids for Christmas. Which they had to do fast: there was still half a game to play, and that turned out pretty special too. “Pfff,” Marc Bartra said. “A great night when it all came together, from a football and fan point of view, one of the best I’ve experienced here.”  One that ended with the Benito Villamarín belting out the club’s anthem. “Here we are to sing you a song,” it begins, “… and even if you were last, you’d be champions in our eyes.” Betis are not last. They’re not champions either, and they’re not going to be, but they’re a lot closer than anyone expected. One up at half-time, they had struggled. Their goal was another gift, Real Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro leaving his goal and almost the pitch for a ball he didn’t need to chase way out near the touchline and allowing Alex Moreno to roll into an open goal from 20 yards, like a golfer sinking a long putt. La Real striker Cristián Portu alone had five chances, not unjustly insisting afterwards “we were much better than them in the first half”. And even Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini admitted he “didn’t like” the opening 45 minutes. But in the second, they had let loose, Juanmi, Nabil Fekir and Moreno scoring three more and now the place was bouncing, arms around shoulders all around the stadium as they sang. “Spectacular,” Fekir called it afterwards. “We’re very lucky to have fans like this and we try to do all we can to thank them.” Oh, they had done that, all right. It was not just that they had won 4-0, that the second half was “brilliant” in their manager’s words; it was that he said the whole year had been and he wasn’t wrong. It was that Betis, invariably fun to watch, had just defeated the team that had led the league for a month, many suggesting they could actually be contenders; that in one night they had scored almost a quarter of the goals Real Sociedad had conceded all season. And that by the end of weekend in which attention had been on the capital, where there was a derby and you couldn’t help wondering if Madrid had wrapped up the title, it was Seville that had two teams in the top three – the only clubs still within single digits of the league leaders. For Sevilla to be second is not so unusual; for Betis to be third is. They have only ever finished higher once in their history and that was when Patrick O’Connell led them to the title, 86 years ago. Only twice more have they ever finished this high and if it may not be realistic to stay there, the crisis at Barcelona means that fourth place and Champions League qualification might just be plausible. The cushion currently stands at four points, nine above Barcelona – who they beat at the Camp Nou last week. “And it’s not chance,” Bartra says. An absolutely emphatic 4-0 win for Real Betis! 🟢⚪This classy effort from Nabil Fekir was just one of a number of excellent goals from the home side 👏 pic.twitter.com/OhhgC7GUDM Betis don’t tend to do things quietly – this is a big, loud, laughing kind of place – but this time they have. Which does tend to be Pellegrini’s way, not least because he thought it had to be. Volcanic as a player, he took a conscious decision to be calm as a coach, aware too that the attention had to be the players’. “A man who never takes to the stage,” in the words of Jorge Valdano, who signed him – and then was forced to sack him after just one season – as coach of Real Madrid. “If you give Pellegrini time he makes good teams,” said the Bernabéu’s former sporting director a little pointedly on Sunday night and at Betis he certainly has. Pellegrini took over after a difficult 2019-20 season in which they sacked coach Rubí with eight games to go and eventually finished 15th. He had a difficult start but then, although they drew too often – seven of their last 10 last season – took them on a run in which they lost just one of the 26 games they played since the turn of the year and finished sixth. This season, combining domestic football and the Europa League, where they tend to rotate, they have lost four in the league: to Villarreal, Madrid, Atlético and Sevilla, which may say something about their level or even their limitations but certainly says something about their consistency. Sunday night was their fourth win in a row, local paper Estadio Deportivo calling them a “Champions League cyclone”, the Diario De Sevilla claiming that they were living in a “state of nirvana”, a team that “delights”. They could say that again, and so they did, spewing out a cascade of eulogies for a team they called: “a delicious generator of football”. Betis’s own website took a different approach. “We could make this match report more beautiful with loads of superlative adjectives, but there’s no point,” it read. “You have to experience it for yourself, live Betis.” It’s not bad advice. Always watch Betis. The fourth goal in particular was gorgeous. Only Madrid have taken more shots or scored more goals. No one is as enjoyable to watch as Fekir, a player so outrageously talented, so good, so silly at times that he makes his team mates laugh. Sunday night’s goal was typically superb, consistency now added to his quality. Sergio Canales, once that teenage revelation, may be better than ever at 30 having come through terrible injuries. Juanmi certainly is, fast becoming a cult hero. “Oh, Juan Miguel, we all want a goal from Juan Miguel,” they sing to the tune of Ay Mamá Inés and most weeks they get one as well. At least they do these days: seemingly half way out in the summer, he’s just one behind his best season total. A lot of that is down to the manager: “He knows me well. He’s a coach with very clear ideas, a very recognisable style that he is laying down at Betis,” he says. “There are lots of players who have had low moments “It’s a footballing conviction, an idea that the players carry out without doubting,” Pellegrini said on Sunday night. Bartra explains: “I’ve had some great coaches and Manuel is definitely one of them. He has three or four very clear ideas. He tells every player exactly what they need, no more and no less. It’s simple, nothing out of this world, but he’s very intelligent in how he tells you. We believe in what we’re doing and you can see that. When you’re about to go out, everyone knows exactly what they have to do. The ball has to be ours, everyone has a space, but with [some] freedom, the offensive movements are worked through. We’re very compact, in a 4-2-3-1 where the positioning is very important but there is some freedom within that and all of us defend: it can’t be just four. Solidarity is the word I would use. The idea doesn’t change and there is stability not, which is important.” “He is very even tempered: when you win you’re not the best in the world and when you lose you’re not the worst,” Bartra adds. “And honestly, there’s no euphoria inside. We know how bad things can get, how fast they can get worse.” For now, though, they just keep getting better. “What I take with me is the win and the way the fans enjoyed it. It’s been a brilliant year in every sense,” Pellegrini said at the end, embracing Moreno, scorer of two goals, when the whistle went. There were tears in the full-back’s eyes on Sunday night when at last he stopped running up the left wing and looked up at the fans still there and still singing, sacks of cuddly toys lined up around the pitch. “I’m super-emotional,” he said. “This was one of the happiest days I’ve had. I just hope there are many more ahead.” Real Madrid 2-0 Atlético, Real Betis 4-0 Real Sociedad, Osasuna 2-2 Barcelona, Villarreal 2-0 Rayo Vallecano, A Bilbao 0-1 Sevilla, Valencia 2-1 Elche, Alavés 1-1 Getafe, Espanyol 4-3 Levante, Mallorca 0-0 Celta Vigo Monday Cádiz v Granada   ",Sport/Football,Raining goals and cuddly toys: Real Betis get the party started | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/13/raining-goals-and-cuddly-toys-real-betis-get-the-party-started
12/14/2021,"The new Omicron variant is coming at us like an express train. If cases double every two and a bit days – three times in a week – that means eight times as much infection after one week, 64 after two, 512 times after three … It now seems Omicron is highly efficient at evading two doses of vaccine. What we don’t know yet is how likely it is to cause serious disease and death. Given that hospitalisations lag after infections and deaths after hospitalisations, it is simply too early to tell. However, even if Omicron were only a half or a quarter as serious as Delta in terms of hospitalisations, that would still lead to enough admissions to overwhelm a fragile NHS. This is an NHS already depleted by 10 years of austerity, with staff burnt out by two years of dealing with Covid and, since “freedom day” on 19 July, dealing with consistently high levels of Covid admissions. To do nothing right now and stand by as cases spike would be akin to playing Russian roulette. While you just might get lucky and cases might not translate into hospitalisations, and a creaking NHS might stay standing, there are plenty of chances that this will not be the case, and it really isn’t a good idea to play such a lethal game with public health.  When it comes to what precisely we should do to slow down Omicron, it is important to avoid serious confusion. Omicron must be slowed down to buy time to vaccinate people. As well as making people safer, we should also be acting fast to make environments safer by, for instance, ensuring that all classrooms, workplaces and leisure spaces are properly ventilated. But vaccination is not the means of achieving the slowdown right now. That is because the rollout takes time, and after we get boosters it takes a couple of weeks for the benefits to kick in. So there are other things we must do to achieve an immediate effect. First, we must be clear in communicating that there is a direct relationship between the number of contacts we have and the spread of infection. This makes things very simple. You want less infection? You need to have fewer contacts. You can try to do it by persuasion. You can do it by legislation. That is a difficult debate. But there is no question that it needs to be done. Because if we want Christmas, we must meet up less before Christmas. When we are in contact with each other, we need to make that contact safer. That means distancing, mask-wearing, ventilating or (preferably) meeting up outdoors. It also means testing to make sure we don’t meet others if we are infected. Doing a lateral flow test before going into any public venue or meeting up in private is not a perfect solution. These tests are not a green light to say “abandon all caution”. But they are an important additional protection. If we do test positive, or if we have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, we must isolate. That should be the most basic rule of all. It is the only way to take infected people out of circulation and break the chain of transmission. For these various things to be happen, we need a government that has the competence to communicate these messages clearly and consistently. We need it to have the moral courage to institute policies and to tell us unwelcome truths we might not like to hear. Putting on a Santa hat and telling everyone to party like there’s no tomorrow might be what the public wants the prime minister to do, but it is the mark of good leadership to tell the public instead, “I’m very sorry, but don’t party or else there will be no tomorrow.” We also need a government that has the moral authority to ask us to act responsibly because it takes its own responsibilities seriously. If our leaders ask us to get tested and to self-isolate, they need to ensure that we can afford to find out we are infected and to isolate ourselves. They have never done that. Support for self-isolation has always been hard to get. It has been too little. It has been too narrow. It is now more important than ever to set that right. But right now, clarity, competence, moral courage and moral authority are hardly the first things that come to mind when describing our present prime minister and his government. Our politicians have created a sense of “them and us”. Still worse, their actions have created a perception of contempt for the poor public who have been obeying the rules. When a government comes to be seen as a toxic other, trust and influence are squandered. The public mood becomes one that says, “They have no right to tell us what to do.” So it all seems pretty bleak. Just as we need an urgent national response to a new crisis, we lack the leadership to coordinate it. But there is a silver lining, and we see it more clearly if we look back to the effects of the Dominic Cummings fiasco. That, too, replaced any sense of unity between public and government with a division between “them” and “us”. That, too, led to a catastrophic loss of trust in Westminster politics specifically. That, too, undermined adherence to the rules – or at least gave those already inclined to break the rules an excuse to do so. At the same time, though, many people – especially those most angry at Cummings – adhered more in order to show that they weren’t like the government, to show that they followed the rules and cared for their community. This explains an otherwise puzzling fact. Despite the fact that after the Cummings revelations trust in the government in London plummeted while trust in the devolved administrations stayed largely constant, levels of adherence to Covid measures around the UK did not change. The reason for this is simple. The government is just one of many sources people listen to around Covid. They also listen to scientists and medics and to each other. Indeed, our own data shows that trust in scientists is more important than trust in government, and this is reflected in the fact that, by and large, people are “following the science” more than the government – becoming cautious and supporting the introduction of Covid measures as cases rise. Equally, a wealth of data shows that the norms of one’s peers and of the groups one identifies with are a critical determinant of attitudes and behaviours around Covid. Throughout this pandemic, there has been a question mark over the public’s ability to put up with the measures necessary to control Covid – as if the public are the weakest link and are holding back the ability of government to protect us. Time and again the evidence points to the opposite: that a resilient public are being let down by their government. Right now, we remain largely resilient. We continue to adhere despite clear anger at our prime minister’s behaviour. But this can only constitute partial consolation. In the midst of the greatest challenge of our generation, our government – by its own actions – has compromised its own ability to play a part in keeping the public safe. That is the true cost of Downing Street’s Christmas parties. And it is we, the people, who are paying that cost.
