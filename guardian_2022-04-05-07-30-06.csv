4/5/2022,"Bryson DeChambeau has always done things his own way, but even he is taking it a little far at this year’s Masters. In February he suffered a hairline fracture of a bone in his left hand when he fell over playing table tennis against Sergio García on a marble floor during a tournament in Jeddah. His doctors and his coaches told him he should take the next four months off to recover, but here he is, two months later, teeing up at Augusta National despite their advice. “It was a huge risk,” he said, “it was probably not one that my doctors recommended, but I decided to do so because I wanted to give this tournament a run.” He says his game is at about 80% of where he would like it to be. It’s not just his hand, he has a hip injury, too, a partial tear in the cartilage. He already had problems with both hand and hip before the fall because of the extreme speed and strength training regimen which, for a brief period, turned him into one of the most dominant players on the tour. His world ranking has dropped back to No 14 now, and he says himself that his build-up to this year’s tournament feels very different to how it did in November 2020, when he came here off the back of his six-shot victory in the US Open at Winged Foot. Tiger Woods said the way DeChambeau was playing back then was “unprecedented” and “historic”. “Coming here in the fall for that Masters, a lot of eyes were on me, and it was a different expectation level and definitely uncomfortable for me because I had never experienced that,” DeChambeau said. But this year, “coming off an injury, not being really fully ready, or not having won recently or whatnot, it’s kind of been nice going into this year’s Masters just peacefully going about my business.” He admits it helps, too, that Woods is now taking up all the attention with his own comeback. Woods’ gallery is so big that DeChambeau says the atmosphere surrounding everyone else almost feels relaxing in comparison. “It’s very, very exciting to have him back. Creates a lot of hype and whatnot. From the driving range, we could hear the loud roar when he came out of the clubhouse up to that first tee, and that was pretty special to hear that. I couldn’t be more happy for him, and proud of him, too. “Coming back off that injury, we’ve had some conversations, and man, I don’t know how he’s done it. It’s very impressive.” He has tried to get in touch with Phil Mickelson too, who’s going through a low of his own after the recent scandal about his comments on doing business with the Saudi regime. “I’ve tried to reach out, but he’s gone dark. There’s no contact.” There are a couple of lessons there, about the vicissitudes of life in the game, ups and downs which, at 28, DeChambeau is starting to experience. “The past few weeks have been very, very difficult on me, not playing well and not hitting it anywhere near where I should be. Yelling ‘fore’ off the tee every time is just not fun. It’s very difficult on your mental psyche as well. But it’s one of those things that everybody has a tough stretch in their career, and especially with coming off an injury. “It’s a learning experience. Every time, like I’ve always said, your worst failures are your best teachers.” Even at 80% of his best, DeChambeau’s game ought to be well suited to the course; Jordan Spieth said it was “tailor-made” for him from tee to green. But his results here have been a little underwhelming since he finished 21st on his debut in 2016, when he was the low amateur. It’s still his best finish. Given that he’s carrying two injuries, has been forced to swing one-handed in practice for most of the last few weeks, and has only just been to able to begin hitting anything like the number balls he would usually do on the range, it would be a hell of an achievement if he does better than 21st this week.",Sport/Sport,Injured Bryson DeChambeau enjoying lower profile before 2022 Masters,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/injured-bryson-dechambeau-enjoying-lower-profile-before-2022-masters
4/5/2022,"Priti Patel’s nationality and borders bill has been ripped apart for a second time by the House of Lords as the government suffered at least 10 defeats over controversial proposals to tighten immigration rules. Peers supported proposals to ensure that the bill complied with the 1951 Refugee Convention and challenged the government’s plan to redefine refugees into two classes based on how they arrived in the UK. They also voted to allow asylum seekers to work if their case had not been resolved within six months; to require formal returns agreement with third states to ensure safe returns; and to allow unaccompanied child asylum seekers in Europe to join a family member legally in the UK. The defeats, following similar rejections in the upper chamber earlier in the year, mean that ministers could be forced to make concessions if they are to ease the bill through the second chamber amid an increasingly tight legislative logjam. The government is expected to prorogue parliament later this month, but still has a number of major bills to take through both houses. The usual convention is that the Lords is expected to give way if MPs make it plain they do not back amendments from peers. But the lack of remaining time means a miscalculation by the government could force concessions or force the bill to fall. Peers defeated the government in demanding extra safeguards over a measure that would allow people to be stripped of their British citizenship without warning. In another government defeat, peers backed by 163 votes to 138 removing a broad provision making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission, limiting it to only those who breach a deportation order. In yet another blow to the Conservative administration, a demand for unaccompanied child asylum seekers in Europe to be allowed to join a family member legally in the UK was backed by 181 votes to 144. The Conservatives’ Lord Cormack, who was an MP for 40 years, said the bill was “largely unnecessary … narrow, mean minded and at times approaches the vindictive” and is “in danger of breaching international law but also international humanity”. A motion put forward by Labour’s Lady Chakrabarti received support from several senior Conservative peers, She argued that the UK courts should have a role in ensuring that the bill is compliant with the UN 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees. “As a public and constitutional lawyer, I take the primacy of the other place very seriously. This is neither a money nor manifesto matter. It gives effect to the government’s own stated policy of Refugee Convention compliance in times when this could not be more important. No reasonable government should object,” she said. Crossbench peer former lord chief justice Lord Judge and crossbencher former supreme court justice Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood both supported her amendment. Brown said: “Several of these provisions flagrantly breach our obligations as interpreted by the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees].” Tory frontbencher Lady Williams of Trafford defended the move to create a criminal offence for unauthorised entry to the UK. “There is a need to seek prosecutions where there are aggravating circumstances and where prosecutors agree that this is in the public interest,” she said.",News/World news,Priti Patel’s immigration bill suffers multiple defeats in Lords ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/priti-patels-immigration-bill-suffers-at-least-10-defeats-in-lords
4/5/2022,"Fresh questions have been raised over Prince Andrew’s Dragons’ Den-style scheme after it emerged that concerns were raised over a contest winner who since been linked to more than £1m of payments received by the royal. Selman Turk, a Turkish businessman, received an award in November 2019 from the Duke of York at a Pitch@Palace event during which 40 entrepreneurs gave rapid-fire pitches in a room full of potential investors. Turk won the “People’s Choice” award for his business Heyman AI, a digital bank aimed at millennials, which later went bust. His victory was decided by a public vote online and an audience vote on the night. The Guardian has learned that the day after the event, concerns were raised with Amanda Thirsk, then a senior member of the royal household, who said she would look into suggestions that entrepreneurs could game the system. In an exchange with Thirsk, seen by this newspaper, she was told Heyman AI’s win “did not feel right or make sense”, adding “it would be [a] shame if people were gaming the system”. Thirsk replied: “I also think your point is right that a campaign to ‘game’ the position is not quite in keeping … we will certainly look at this again for next time.” A number of participants have told the Guardian they found Turk’s Pitch@Palace win unusual as he “won it by miles” and his pitch was “crap”, with some suspecting he may have used bots – autonomous internet programs – to boost his vote. In his live pitch, available to watch online, Turk forgets his words and before he can finish, he is cut off by the trumpets of the duke’s grenadiers. Turk, Pitch@Palace representatives and Thirsk have been approached for comment. It has since been alleged in court documents that Turk instructed a Turkish millionaire, 77-year-old Nebahat Isbilen, to pay Andrew £750,000 nine days after the Pitch@Palace event, and the duke is also said to have received payments of up to £350,000 from a company linked to Turk. Details of the payments, which the duke has declined to comment on, emerged last week for the first time in a case Isbilen launched against Turk in the high court, alleging he defrauded her to the tune of £40m. Turk denies the allegations. Since the legal proceedings against Turk emerged, it has been reported that the businessman first met Andrew between May and June 2019 at Windsor Castle – about six months before the Pitch@Palace event. A source familiar with the event said they believed Turk received as many as 10,000 votes, whereas some other participants polled closer to the hundreds. One of the 2019 participants told the Guardian: “There was a group of us on the day that felt the People’s Choice award hadn’t felt right during that competition. “Because their pitch was crap … Their whole concept was bizarre in that they were pitching for something when they didn’t have a licence. There was a group of us who felt it didn’t [seem] right that they had won the People’s Choice because they won it by miles. “A few of us made the assumption, rightly or wrongly, that we thought … bots [must have been used] to do this because the way the awards worked was you were actively told to go on your network and get people to vote for you.” Another 2019 participant told the Guardian: “Our initial surprise at Heyman AI winning that particular award makes more sense now. “We watched all the pitches and Heyman AI didn’t stand out. Further, there seemed to be some more impactful companies that the typical member of the public would be drawn to, that is, those actually helping people as opposed to a new banking app. “I think our thoughts were that they had mobilised more friends and family/social media followers. It was very much an innocent ‘I wonder how they did that?’ as opposed to assuming anything malevolent. We weren’t expecting to win, but at least we thought it was set up as a fair contest.” It was reported that Turk met Andrew in London on at least two occasions after the Pitch@Palace event, including at a dinner with potential investors at Turk’s apartment in South Kensington on 5 December 2019, and in February 2020 at Frogmore House, the royal residence in Windsor Great Park. Turk has admitted in his defence statement, provided to the court and seen by the Guardian, that he held meetings with Andrew at his flat in September 2019 – two months before the Pitch@Palace event. But he claims he did not instruct Isbilen to pay Andrew £750,000 and she did so on her own initiative. Lawyers for Isbilen have been asked to confirm whether or not it is her case that she knew Andrew.",News/UK news,New questions raised over Prince Andrew’s award to Selman Turk,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/new-questions-raised-over-prince-andrews-award-to-selman-turk
4/5/2022,"Was this the night Arsenal’s wheels came off? Mikel Arteta will hope this was an isolated off day in a largely excellent season but his players did not turn up here and were thoroughly beaten by energetic, highly-motivated opponents who outdid them in every department. That would normally be problematic enough at this stage in the race for a Champions League spot but the angst did not end there; the sight of Tottenham unexpectedly occupying fourth place presents a headache but they departed with added concerns that may skew the next few weeks against them. Chief among them was an injury to Thomas Partey, who limped off shortly after Wilfried Zaha had scored an excellent Crystal Palace side’s third goal from the penalty spot. Partey had, like almost all of his teammates, put in a crushingly disappointing display and had conceded a number of cheap fouls; Arsenal’s squad is so thin, though, that it was impossible to miss the worry in Arteta’s voice when he said the midfielder had aggravated an old injury. “A big concern” was how the manager put it, and it was the best way to capture the entire evening. Equally worrying will be the fact Kieran Tierney, who did not appear at all because of the knee injury, will see a specialist tomorrow and risks missing the rest of the season. While nobody in an Arsenal shirt can escape blame for a woefully inadequate performance, the drop off in standard between Tierney and his deputy was glaring. Nuno Tavares endured a torrid first 45 minutes and was replaced by Arteta at half-time, the explanation that it was purely a tactical decision not sounding entirely convincing. It was, at least, 10 minutes longer than Tavares lasted when he was hauled off at Nottingham Forest in his previous start; the 22-year-old may need an arm round the shoulder if he is to fill in effectively over the remainder. Palace had started at a ferocious tempo, Conor Gallagher setting it by tearing towards the returning Aaron Ramsdale within two minutes, and had clearly been under instruction not to let a normally fast-starting sidethe away side settle. But Arsenal’s errors were not all forced: when Ramsdale and White, such reliable distributors from the back, both fed aimless balls all the way through to Vicente Guaita in the opening stages it was clear things were not right. Patrick Vieira, whose team had largely bested Arsenal during a 2-2 draw at the Emirates in the autumn, had primed his players to capitalise and they did so with glee. Jean-Philippe Mateta’s opener came with an element of luck but it was as much as Palace deserved. When Gallagher swung a free-kick over from deep on the left, Joachim Anderson was facing away from the ball as he challenged a weak Tavares at the far post. It struck him on the back of the head and, while he had undoubtedly intended to get some purchase, he could hardly have expected it to zip across the six-yard box and perfectly into Mateta’s path. The centre-forward could not miss and Ramsdale had no hope of stopping his header at point-blank range. Rather than drop deep in the manner that restrained Manchester City three weeks previously, Palace kept going. The second goal was wonderfully created from their point of view but, from Arsenal’s, a precis of all that was wrong. Alexandre Lacazette lost a 50/50 challenge far too easily and, when the ball was worked back to Andersen, worse would follow. A flat, raking 40-yard pass from halfway was wonderfully executed but a sliding Gabriel Magalhaes made a complete hash of his interception while Tavares, mystifyingly perched a yard behind his defensive colleagues, looked on. It left Jordan Ayew in the clear; he beat Ramsdale confidently to his right and Palace, who simply seemed hungrier, had a level of reward they might not have imagined. Arteta deployed Gabriel Martinelli in Tavares’ place and, around the hour mark, Arsenal perked up slightly. Martin Ødegaard should have pulled a goal back but dragged wide and then, running back into his own box, clipped Wilfried Zaha for a penalty award nobody could dispute. Zaha, who was passed fit and proved a thorn in Arsenal’s side yet again, did the rest and a couple of late saves from Guaita preserved Palace’s hugely merited clean sheet. Almost five years ago to the week, Palace defeated Arsenal by the same scoreline and contributed heavily to the end of their long sequence of top-four finishes under Arsene Wenger. The fear for Arteta will be that grievous damage has now been done to their hopes of a return and a quirk of the Premier League’s scheduling means a fixture announcement made shortly before kick-off has even more resonance now. Arsenal will visit Tottenham on 12 May, three games from the end of the season; it would be as well to circle that in the calendar and, before then, Arteta faces a daunting task to regain the initiative.",Sport/Football,"Mateta, Ayew and Zaha on target as Palace dent Arsenal’s top four hopes",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
4/5/2022,"The government is expected to announce that, after months of wrangling, it will privatise Channel 4, four decades after it aired its first programme; a staple for the broadcaster – Countdown. Here’s the station’s journey from launch by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government to Monday’s announcement about its privatisation. Channel 4 airs for the first time in November, two years after an act of parliament paved the way for its launch. The channel was to be publicly owned but commercially funded through advertising. Richard Whiteley, who hosted Countdown until 2005, was the first presenter to appear on screen. The long-running soap Brookside was also broadcast on its launch date. Margaret Thatcher rejects the idea of privatising the channel, fearing it would reduce quality. Cabinet members in John Major’s government pass an indicative vote to look at its privatisation, but its then chairman, Sir Michael Bishop, persuades Major to drop the idea. A revised “public service” duty for Channel 4 is emphasised in the Communications Act. It says that it should provide a “broad range of high quality and diverse programming”, including appealing “to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society”. Months after winning a parliamentary majority in the general election, David Cameron tells the Commons that he is open to the idea of “private investment” in the broadcaster. In response to speculation about the government potentially privatising the channel, a House of Lords committee finds that the drawbacks of privatisation outweigh any potential benefits. Its report says that news, current affairs and film would be at risk. “We are concerned that … a private owner may seek to dilute C4C’s public service remit in future, in order to maximise profit,” the report added. Channel 4 is cleared of bias by Ofcom after replacing Boris Johnson with a melting block of ice during a general election leadership debate on climate change. During the election a campaign source tells the Guardian that the party will review its licence, amid accusations of bias from Conservatives. The Conservative media minister John Whittingdale tells a party conference fringe event that the government is considering “whether there is still a need for a second publicly owned public service broadcaster”. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, says that Channel 4 could be sold before 2024 to provide a “sustainable future” for the broadcaster. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport launches a consultation on the future of Channel 4, with the government supporting its privatisation. It says that this is because of the broadcasting landscape having “changed beyond recognition” since 1982. A report finds that up to 60 TV production companies could go out of business if Channel 4 is privatised. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, seems unaware of how the broadcaster is funded during a select committee appearance, saying it is “in receipt of public money”, despite it relying on advertising and commercial revenue. Senior Conservative MPs, including the former culture secretary Karen Bradley, call for ministers to halt plans to privatise the station, saying it would harm the government’s levelling up plans and be contrary to Thatcher’s founding vision. The broadcaster’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, emails staff saying that she has been informed that the government will announce the proposal to privatise Channel 4.",News/Media,Channel 4: the 40-year countdown to privatisation,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/channel-4-the-40-year-countdown-to-privatisation
4/5/2022,"Those seeking a quiet life, tired of the price and pace of Kyiv, once came to live on Vokzal’na Street in the small town of Bucha, 17 miles north-west of Ukraine’s capital. It was known as “little Switzerland”, so comfortable was the living. Today, Vokzal’na is burned out, its broken homes and the churned-up military hardware littering the muddy quagmire of what was the road make up some of the defining images of the devastation wrought by Vladimir Putin’s war. It is barely conceivable that anyone could have survived what was thrown at Vokzal’na from both sides during what was clearly a vicious battle on the road to Kyiv. There is not a brick unscathed nor a patch of mud that will not have been mixed with blood. But, now that the Russians have gone, Vokzal’na’s residents are emerging from their cellars, tired, tearful and angry. Serhiy Savenko, 43, who lives with his mother, Larisa, 72, at No 35, had counted the Russian armoured vehicles as they had rolled past at 9.10am on 27 February, heading south towards the neighbouring town of Irpin and on towards the capital. “There was 70 of the armoured vehicles, like tanks, and Russian soldiers walked alongside,” he said. “It took about 40 minutes for them to pass our house. I watched and counted. And then the Ukrainians launched their shells at the Russians.” The first took out Savenko’s shed in his large garden at the back. It was the first of many. The horribly exposed armoured vehicles tried to turn around, in panic, as the next more accurate wave of shells rained down upon them. Thirty minutes of devastation ensued. Russian bodies were strewn across the road, hot metal flew through the air, smashing every window, enveloping the trees in fire, and turning the burning vehicles white hot. Across Savenko’s 30-metre hedge alone, nine devastated armoured vehicles were left burnt out, filling the air with the acrid smell of burning oil and metal. Those Russians that could escape did. But an hour after the Ukrainian assault, the Russians came back to retrieve their dead – and to entrench themselves in Vokzal’na’s gardens and what was left of its buildings, establishing points from which to send their artillery fire at the Ukrainian defenders. It would be a long and cruel occupation. “We were in our cellar the whole time,” Savenko said. “The Russians set up their weapons and a fire in the front garden. One came down to the cellar and saw us. He said to be quiet. He said he was a nice guy but his colleagues would get us on our knees and shoot us. They took our phones and said, no fires, as if we could make some sort of signal.” Standing outside her home at No 31, gripping a note, with tears streaming down her face, Zinaida, 62, had been in her cellar since 5 March. On Sunday, the Ukrainian army found the body of her son-in-law just around the corner. She was just about tell her daughter and 16-year-old grandson who had been evacuated and until now only knew that he was missing. There isn’t any internet connection in Bucha, typical of all the towns that Russia has targeted in its special military operation. “My daughter asked him to leave their basement to pick some things up from a neighbour’s house. Here is her note, he had it with him: cigarettes on the shelf near the sofa, pills, groceries, slippers, a blanket. He left the house on 4 March. He walked just 20 metres from the house and the Russians killed him. No warning, no reason. He was such a good father, his son loved him so much. He is disabled. How can I tell them?” On the same side of the road at No 27, a new-build block of apartments, Ivan, 55, and Helen, 50, who did not want to give their surnames, were cleaning up the glass, shell fragments and unexploded armaments outside on the communal porch. It was something they had done throughout the ordeal. They had only moved in three months earlier. Of the eight families that had lived here, they were the only ones to stay having nowhere else to go. “We tidied all the time, swept up. We don’t have a basement anyway. We wanted to show we were not scared, I don’t know,” said Ivan. “But you see that high apartment block over there? Well there was a sniper and he was angry that we weren’t scared and cowering. So he fired shots over our head.” On the floor of his neighbour’s apartment, among the glass, and metal, was blood, as there was on the kitchen table, still wet. It was the blood of Russian soldiers who had been hiding inside, evidenced by the discarded food wrappings. Across the road at No 32 there is nothing left other than the remnants of some walls. Next door, a frame of what was a garage. Volodymr Matsyk, 62, and his wife, Lydmyla, and their two sons, Artem, 33, and Bodgan, 20, stayed underground in the cellar as their world above was blown away. They have been evacuated. But neighbour, Dymytro Zamogylny, 56, said an injured Russian soldier who had been taken there to receive medical assistance had not been so fortunate. “A bomb landed right on the house killing him,” he said. At No 23, Oleksandr Loza, 87, had been found laid out on the ground in his pyjamas, unable to move, after the initial fighting of 27 February. He has since been evacuated. The nextdoor neighbours’ handsome green roof at No 25 was caved in by a direct hit. Its owners, cowering in the cellar, Oleksandr, 66, and Galayno, 65, who had been the chief carers to their elderly friend next door, miraculously escaped with their lives. Bucha is a blackened, hollowed out mess. Bodies of civilians continue to be discovered. On Monday, officials took away five bodies of men seemingly tied up and shot by the Russians in the basement of a summer residence for children. It was also claimed that human remains found near the town were Olga Sukhenk, the mayor of Motyzhyn, and her husband and son. Visiting the town on Monday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke on national television about what he had seen. “These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide,” he said, wearing body armour and surrounded by military personnel. “We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women and murdered children.” Around the corner from Vokzal’na Street, close to where 21 civilians were found scattered across one of Bucha’s main roads on Saturday, Sergiy Zebenko, 57, and his wife, Helen, 49, showed the grave of their cousin, Dmytro Bernastsky, 59, in their garden. “We found his body on 31 March just 150 metres from us and buried him here,” said Helen. “But we don’t even know when he was killed, maybe 10 days earlier when he was coming to see us. He had three bullets in his left leg, one to his heart and one to his lung. He was by the supermarket. We want to rebury him. He was a pilot in the Ukrainian air force. We want to bury him in his uniform, it needs to happen. Why did they do this to us?”",News/World news,‘Why did they do this to us?’: Bucha’s survivors come out of hiding,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/why-did-they-do-this-to-us-buchas-survivors-come-out-of-hiding
