1/14/2022,"Sydney festival board member Benjamin Law has resigned following the festival’s refusal to terminate a $20,000 sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy. In a statement issued by the festival on Friday afternoon, author and screenwriter Law said:  “Today’s decision to leave the board is mine alone. I am only comfortable departing now because I have every confidence in the remaining board directors for the process ahead, and I remain an ardent fan and supporter of Olivia Ansell’s vision of a reactivated and dynamic Sydney.” Law is expected to release a full statement at 9am Saturday. The festival’s announcement of Law’s departure was signed off by the board’s chairperson, David Kirk, who acknowledged that the festival had “faced unprecedented challenges this year”, specifically from Covid-19 and the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement. “This has put significantly increased pressure on all members of the board, the staff, and most importantly artists,” Kirk’s statement said. Dozens of artists have pulled out of the 2022 Sydney festival over the $20,000 Israeli embassy sponsorship of the Sydney Dance Company production of Decadance, a work devised by Tel Aviv choreographer Ohad Naharin. On Thursday, Kirk admitted in an interview with the Guardian that the board had been unaware of the sponsorship deal, brokered by festival management in July last year, until the festival program was published in late November with the Israeli embassy logo. “It was just a miss,” he told the Guardian, adding he regretted the distress to artists that the sponsorship decision had caused. Kirk ruled out the suggestion either himself or festival director Olivia Ansell should resign over the issue, which subjected many artists to pressure on social media either because they had decided to join the boycott, or because they had decided to continue with their scheduled performances. Kirk said normal processes had been followed, but those processes would be reviewed independently in the wake of the controversy. On Friday Kirk thanked Law for his service, describing him as “an insightful and much valued member” of the board since joining in 2020. “As we’ve worked through the complexities of this year’s festival, he’s been a considered and constant voice as we collectively arrived at our position,” Kirk said.",Arts/Culture,Benjamin Law resigns from Sydney festival board over Israeli embassy sponsorship,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/14/benjamin-law-resigns-from-sydney-festival-board-over-israeli-embassy-sponsorship
1/14/2022,"Labor has accused the Morrison government of dragging out the Novak Djokovic visa saga to distract from its Omicron woes, as uncertainty over the tennis star’s ability to play the Australian Open enters its second week. With no decision yet announced by immigration minister Alex Hawke, the independent senator Jacqui Lambie also accused the government on Friday of an “absolute shambles” in its handling of the Djokovic visa issue.  Djokovic’s lawyers are prepared to challenge a visa cancellation, which has made the Australian government hesitant to pull the trigger until it is certain it won’t be reversed by a court. A lengthy legal battle could drag the saga into the next week, when the men’s tennis world No 1 is due to begin his Australian Open title defence. Djokovic arrived in Australia on the evening of 5 January. He believed that a visa granted on 18 November and an exemption approved by Tennis Australia’s chief medical officer and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. Djokovic’s visa was cancelled on the basis that a recent Covid infection by itself was not sufficient for an exemption from Australia’s strict vaccination requirements. Although the visa was restored by the federal circuit court on Monday, Hawke began to consider cancelling it again under a separate personal power. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday refused to comment directly on the case but confirmed he expected authorities to enforce the requirement that non-citizen non-residents be vaccinated, in a signal interpreted as meaning a fresh cancellation was imminent. On Friday Lambie questioned why the saga “keeps dripping out of the tap” and why the minister “hasn’t done anything about this”. “So maybe it’s about time to stop this debacle, finish it once and for all … and make up your mind, Alex Hawke. Where are you, missing in action? Make a decision,” she told Channel Nine’s Today. Lambie said if the government couldn’t make a decision about Djokovic she questioned how they could run the country. “This is an absolute shambles. Let alone what it’s making us look like in the face of the rest of the world. It’s absolutely a shocker.” At a press conference in Maryborough in Queensland, Labor’s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers accused the government of “using this Novak Djokovic saga as a distraction from the shortages in our supermarkets, the shortages in our chemists, the shortages of workers”. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it should “never have come to this” because Djokovic should not have been granted a visa if not eligible for an exemption. “Novak Djokovic and his participation in the Australian Open has been the number one sports story in the world for months. “Everyone knows he’s the number one player in the world. He’s won the Australian Open nine times, shooting for 10, shooting for his 21st grand slam to be the greatest champion of all time.” Albanese noted it had been 60 days since the visa was granted and said the government had “never answered the question of how is it that that visa was granted in the first place if he wasn’t eligible because he wasn’t fully vaccinated”. On Thursday Morrison explained that having a visa is different to satisfying the requirements for entry to Australia, warning those should not be “conflated”. Morrison said non-citizen non-resident arrivals would need to show they were double vaccinated or “acceptable proof that they can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons”. The first counsellor at the Serbian embassy, Ivana Isidorovic, revealed on Friday that Djokovic has a diplomatic passport, telling the Herald Sun it should ensure “adequate treatment” of the 34-year-old tennis star. “Djokovic, as our most recognisable representative in the world, is the holder of a diplomatic passport, which should, in diplomatic theory and consular practice, guarantee him adequate treatment when crossing borders,” she reportedly said. However, Djokovic’s passport is unlikely to have any bearing on the vaccination requirement or visa cancellation, and was not a feature of his federal circuit court case.",Sport/Sport,"Morrison government dragging out Djokovic visa saga ‘as a distraction’, Labor says",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/morrison-government-dragging-out-djokovic-visa-saga-as-a-distraction-labor-says
1/14/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning.  Boris Johnson’s government faces more damaging allegations about lockdown-era parties in Downing Street after reports that staff held two leaving dos featuring alcohol, and one with loud music, on the evening before Prince Philip’s funeral in April last year. Social contact was banned at the time and the Queen’s solitary mourning for her late husband became one of the defining pictures of the period. According to the Daily Telegraph, witnesses said a combined total of about 30 people took part in what appeared to be social events in different parts of Downing Street, before both gatherings combined in the garden. In echoes of the infamous “bring our own booze” email invite to a party in May 2020, one staff member was allegedly sent to the shops with a suitcase to fill up with wine. Johnson was not at the alleged event in April, but was forced to apologise to MPs this week for attending the May 2020 gathering. He is facing calls to resign, including from some of his own MPs. Andrew Bridgen became the fifth Tory MP to say he had lost confidence in his leader, while Labour deputy Angela Rayner said the “buck stops” with Johnson. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross has already said Johnson should quit, leading to Johnson being effectively barred from the Scottish Tory conference in March. The prime minister says he will abide by the findings of an investigation into the alleged parties by civil servant Sue Gray. Whitehall sources said last night that her inquiry might well uncover Downing Street’s “farcical culture” of drinking and impromptu socialising, which goes on with little oversight by ministers. Royal removal – The Queen has sought to distance the monarchy from the Duke of York by stripping him of his military affiliations and royal patronages as the fallout from his sexual assault case continues. Buckingham Palace also said he would no longer use the HRH royal style in any official capacity as he prepares to fight a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre after a US judge rejected his attempt to have the case against him dismissed. He strongly denies the claims. One observer said the prince had been “thrown under the royal bus”. Here’s how the papers have covered the story. China warning – An unprecedented security warning from MI5 has been circulated to MPs and peers accusing a lawyer, Christine Lee, of seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party. It is the first time that MI5 has issued an “interference alert” relating to China and concerns a high-profile Anglo-Chinese lawyer who received an award from Theresa May and who has donated £584,177 to the former shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner. Lee, who has a law firm in Birmingham, has allegedly “knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist party”. Gardiner said he had been “liaising with our security services for a number of years about Christine Lee”. China has denied the allegations. The MI5 alert is being seen as a clear warning to China’s allies in the UK. Meta case – The tech giant Meta is being sued for £2.3bn in a class action lawsuit that claims 44 million Facebook users in the UK had their data exploited after signing up to the social network. The case argues that Meta has broken the 1998 Competition Act by setting an “unfair price” for Facebook’s UK users when they are given access to the service. The lawsuit argues that the price for joining Facebook, which does not charge its users, is handing over personal data that generates most of the company’s income. A Meta spokesperson said people “choose our services because we deliver value”. School choice ‘illusion’ – Parents in England feel more “cynical, fatalistic and disempowered” about school choice than their peers in other parts of the UK, according to new research. Families in England can name up to six state schools for their children to attend, but although children in Scotland are generally assigned to local state schools, people north of the border were were still more likely to be satisfied with the outcome, the study found. Some English parents said choice was “an illusion”. Tech hub – Google has announced a £871m deal to buy the London development Central Saint Giles, calling the move a show of confidence in the return to more office working. The US tech firm currently rents space in the brightly coloured development designed by the architect Renzo Piano, which is at the eastern end of Oxford Street. Google is currently building a new headquarters in King’s Cross, and the new deal will expand its workforce capacity in the capital to 10,000 people. The Duke of York’s attempts to get a civil case over allegations of sexual assault thrown out have failed.

England’s bid to salvage some pride and win their first match of the Ashes series received a boost when Joe Root won the toss and opted to bowl first on a green pitch in the fifth Test. Australia slumped to 12-3 but are fighting back. Mikel Arteta hailed Arsenal’s “spirit, fight and brotherhood” after they held Liverpool in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg despite playing with 10 men for well over an hour. The UK government has been urged to cut English cricket’s funding unless the England and Wales Cricket Board can prove it is serious about tackling the “deep-seated racism” that exists across the whole sport. Lewis Hamilton faces a two-month wait to discover the outcome of the FIA’s inquiry into the conclusion of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which denied him a record eighth world title. European rugby fixtures can go ahead as planned this weekend after the French government relaxed its rules on travellers entering the country from the UK. Geva Mentor has warned England’s Roses not to read too much into Australia’s lack of international action or their new-look squad before the start of the Netball Quad Series this weekend. And Team GB chiefs have set their sights on their greatest ever Winter Olympics medal haul in Beijing next month – and reiterated their support for British athletes who want to protest against human rights abuses in China. The global surge in demand for energy could spark another three years of market volatility and record power plant pollution unless countries make major changes to how they generate electricity, the world’s energy watchdog has warned. Half the increase in demand last year came from China. There are more jitters today on the markets about likely US rate rises. The Nikkei is down 1.5% and the Kospi index slumped 1.45% in South Korea, where the central bank announced back-to-back hikes today for the first time since 2007. The FTSE100 looks like shedding 0.5% at the opening while the pound is on $1.373 and €1.195. The defenestration of Prince Andrew is the lead in most of the papers today.

The Mail’s headline is “Driven out” and the Express says “Queen casts Andrew adrift … for sake of the monarchy”. The Sun’s splash head is “Throne out”, as is the Metro’s, and the main head in the i is “Prince Andrew cast out by the Queen”. The Mirror splashes on the latest revelations about parties at No 10 – “No 10 ‘parties on eve of Philip’s funeral’”.

1/14/2022,"From Afghanistan to Ethiopia, about 235 million people worldwide needed assistance in 2021. But while some crises received global attention, others are lesser known. Humanitarian organisation Care International has published its annual report of the 10 countries that had the least attention in online articles in five languages around the world in 2021, despite each having at least 1 million people affected by conflict or climate disasters.  The findings, from a collaboration between the charity and international media monitoring service Meltwater, highlighted how the accelerating climate crisis is fuelling many of the world’s emergencies, said Laurie Lee, CEO of Care International UK. “There is deep injustice at the heart of it. The world’s poorest are bearing the brunt of climate change – poverty, migration, hunger, gender inequality and ever more scarce resources – despite having done the least to cause it,” he said. “Add Covid-19 into the mix and we see decades of progress towards tackling inequality, poverty, conflict and hunger disappearing before our eyes.” The number of people in need of humanitarian aid is expected to rise to 274 million this year, or one in 28 people, and more than 84 million people have been uprooted. Lee highlighted the impact of the UK’s 2021 foreign aid budget cuts, saying that it “resulted in over £166m less in humanitarian aid reaching the 10 countries mentioned in this report compared to 2019.” First on the list, Zambia has 1.2 million malnourished people and about 60% of the 18.4 million population living below the international poverty line of $1.90 (£1.40) a day. Women produce 60% of the country’s food supply, but families headed by women faced higher poverty rates than those headed by men. Food insecurity in Zambia has primarily been blamed on prolonged drought, but rising corn prices and flooding have contributed. Currently in the news amid renewed tension between Russia and the west, in Ukraine, 3.4 million people were in need of assistance in 2021, after years of conflict. “While a comprehensive political solution for the conflict is still not in sight, people in eastern Ukraine are daily forced to put their lives on the line. Along the 420-km ‘contact line’ that separates Ukrainian government-controlled territory from that of the separatists, the situation is particularly dangerous,” the report said. Malawi is facing a food insecurity crisis, with 17% of the population severely malnourished. Droughts, floods and landslides have been predicted to worsen over the coming years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 severely affected harvests and left tens of thousands displaced. “The climate crisis is hitting people here earlier and much harder than the people of the global north,” said Chikondi Chabvuta, advocacy lead for Care International in Malawi. “We are already seeing real-life consequences with delayed rainfall, heavy and destructive rainfall, unpredictable rainfall patterns, infertile soil, destroyed harvests.” In Central African Republic (CAR), where civil war has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, half of the population face food insecurity. A ceasefire agreement struck in October 2021 is fragile and more than 700,000 people have been internally displaced – more than half children. CAR is ranked second to last globally on the Human Development Index. “On average, a child attends school for just under four years, and girls for only three,” the report said. About 30% of children are in work. Poverty, violence and the climate crisis are leading problems in Guatemala, which is on the migratory route to Mexico and the US. Two-thirds of the population live on less than $2 a day and 38% of the population face food insecurity. Camps sheltering those sent back by Mexico are overcrowded, meaning many live on the streets, the report said. Guatemala is considered one of the world’s most dangerous countries, with 3,500 murders in 2020 alone. “Although about 3.3 million people in the country rely on humanitarian aid, the frequent occurrence of violence is in many cases a barrier to accessing urgently needed assistance,” said the report. Nearly 5 million people live under the control of armed groups, and 6.7 million people are dependent on humanitarian aid. Food insecurity has been blamed on an economic recession caused by the pandemic. It has particularly affected indigenous communities, those uprooted internally and 1.8 million Venezuelan refugees, mainly in northern Colombia. Ranked as the country gaining the least attention in 2020, Burundi was seventh in 2021 when 2.3 million of the 12.6 million population were in need of humanitarian assistance. The country secured only 27% of the $195m pledged in aid. Extreme weather, hunger and political unrest were among the challenges faced by Burundians. In a country where 90% of people rely on small-scale agriculture, only a third of land is suitable for cultivation, due to drought, floods and landslides. The report also highlighted structural discrimination against women – 20% of those in Burundi’s decision-making bodies are female, while 60% of the agricultural workforce are women. Niger is deeply vulnerable to climate disasters. Persistent droughts and recurring floods have had catastrophic consequences: nearly 3 million people rely on humanitarian aid. About 1.8 million children need food assistance and almost half of all children under five are malnourished. Militias in eastern and northern Niger have caused 313,000 people to be displaced as of last September. “Providing emergency relief is often hindered by the fact that infrastructure is destroyed, operation areas are marked by violence and rural areas are difficult to access,” the report said. Zimbabwe has acute food insecurity with increasingly extreme climate conditions and economic mismanagement causing 6.6 million people to need humanitarian aid. More than a third of the population (5.7 million) lack sufficient food. “The harvests in many rural areas are not sufficient to secure basic food supplies and other needs. In these regions, households must rely on local markets when supplies are depleted – but the prices there are unaffordable for many,” the report said. Poverty and violence have exacerbated the humanitarian situation in Honduras, prompting many to leave for the US. About 70% of the population live in poverty, according to a 2020 study. There have been problems with farming due to drought, hurricanes and floods. The country has 937,000 displaced people, the highest number in Latin America. “In Honduras, people therefore often talk about poverty being female, as it is mostly women who stay behind with the children,” the report said.",News/Global development,World’s poorest bear brunt of climate crisis: 10 underreported emergencies,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/14/worlds-poorest-bear-brunt-of-climate-crisis-10-underreported-emergencies
1/14/2022,"Filmed in a breath-holding single take in a small performance space, Into the Night tells the real-life tale of a doomed lifeboat rescue mission off the Cornish coast in 1981. Combining clever camerawork, projected visuals, live music and heartfelt performances, this feels like an entirely new dramatic genre from the aptly named Original Theatre Company – one that combines the fallibility and intimacy of theatre with the scope and technical wizardry of film. Frazer Flintham’s script is based on a book by local resident Michael Sagar-Fenton, and hums with harrowing detail. The crew had no pagers – so it was down to the village landlady to pick up the phone and send the lifeboat volunteers out to sea. They had no GPS signal, either, so when the stranded ship’s radio fails, it’s up to a single man and his binoculars to send the rescuers in the right direction.  As the camera jumps from the twinkling Christmas lights inland to the flickering switchboard of the HM Coastguard control, the red rescue helicopter or the rain-soaked cabin of a nearby tugboat, we get a sense of an ever-expanding network of rescuers heroically pulling together. Often, we’re shown the mere suggestion of a scene – a sign that says “The Sea” or a lifejacket quickly being snatched – and are then left to fearfully fill in the gaps ourselves. Covid factors mean this final product is a recording of the dress rehearsal. That’s no bad thing. Every missed cue (and there aren’t many in director Alastair Whatley’s immaculately conceived production) only makes the actors feel that little bit more human, and the awful loss this small community experienced just that little bit more real.

1/14/2022,"Charity bosses and poverty campaigners have written to Boris Johnson demanding home insulation and heat pumps for people on low incomes, and a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to fund emergency support on energy bills for vulnerable people. AgeUK, Save the Children and Tearfund are among 25 charities calling for urgent help for struggling households. Soaring energy prices, amid a gas supply crunch across Europe, mean poor households are facing £600 more on bills, forcing many to choose between eating and heating.  The worst impact will be seen when the energy price cap is redrawn in April, and the government has promised help for those most affected. But some of the measures mooted – such as scrapping energy efficiency programmes that are paid for through bills – would be counterproductive, the charities warned. Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at the charity Save the Children, said: “The cost of living crisis, fuelled by soaring energy prices, is totally unsustainable and is hitting the lowest income families the hardest. Parents we work with tell us that they’re struggling to meet basic needs, leaving them having to make impossible choices between heating their homes and buying clothes for their children. And children are paying the price. Children deserve a fair and green future, and need a concrete plan from the UK government that tackles both the cost of living and climate crises.” Ministers are believed to be considering scrapping or changing the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) levy, which funds energy efficiency improvements such as insulation for poor households, with the £1bn cost shared out through additions to all UK household energy bills. But the charities warned this would penalise poor households most, reducing access to the home insulation vital to ending fuel poverty, and called instead for ECO and other levies that fund renewable and low-carbon energy, currently added to household bills, to be met through general taxation. William Baker, of the charity Solutions to Tackle Energy Poverty, another signatory to the letter seen by the Guardian, said: “ECO is central to the government’s legal duty to abolish fuel poverty by 2030. Scrapping the programme would show the government does not take its statutory responsibilities seriously. It would condemn many fuel-poor households to unaffordable fuel bills, ill health and, in the worst cases, death as a result of living in dangerously cold, unhealthy homes.” The Conservative manifesto at the 2019 general election included a promise of more than £9bn for home insulation, but little has been spent. The disastrous green homes grant collapsed last spring with only about 47,000 households benefiting, of which only about 15,000 were low-income households, instead of the 600,000 homes promised. Some rightwing commentators have sought to blame high energy prices on the target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions, and the push for renewable energy. Economic analysts reject this, pointing out that reducing reliance on fossil fuels is the way to avoid the impact of gas price volatility, while tackling the climate crisis. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living, which is why we are taking action worth more than £4.2bn and supporting vulnerable households through initiatives such as the £500m Household Support Fund and Warm Home Discount.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Fund home insulation and heat pumps for people on low incomes, PM urged",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/14/fund-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-for-people-on-low-incomes-pm-urged
1/14/2022,"Humanity needs hokum and never more so than when things are – I think a majority would agree – so relentlessly grim. Bring us preposterous set-ups! Bring us ridiculous plots, to whose holes we must turn generously blind eyes! Bring us escalating nonsense, melodrama, unrealism and all the high-energy, low-stakes rest of it! Take us out of ourselves for an hour or a chapter or a reel at a time. For hokum to succeed, however, it needs to take itself seriously – no nods, winks to camera or cynical sneers in the script. Makers need to play it straight, so that viewers can take it how they will.  On all these bases, Netflix’s new horror series Archive 81 delivers. Its dual narrative has film archivist and museum creator Dan Turner (Mamoudou Athie) recruited, in the present, by an enigmatic businessman called Virgil Davenport (Martin Donovan, who I hope is enjoying his character’s top hokum name) to restore a set of fire-damaged tapes. They are the remainder of an oral history project undertaken by grad student Melody Pendras (Dina Shihabi) in 1994. Her story unfolds for us via “found footage” and flashback. She is recording the life stories of the inhabitants of the Visser apartment building, which was built on the site of a mansion that burned down in 1920 and – did Melody but know it! – is about to burn down again, leaving 13 people missing. She is aided in her quest by young teenager Jess (an astonishingly good performance from Ariana Neal, in a show full of them), who was born in the building and I just bet knows more than she initially lets on. To do his restoration work and earn a bumper $100,000 for the job, Dan must stay alone in an isolated compound in the Catskills once used by Virgil’s DNA testing company – one of many pies in which he has more than the customary number of fingers. There is no wifi and barely any mobile phone reception – just enough to get through occasionally to his best friend, Mark, and ask him to Google people’s names as Melody mentions them on the tapes. There is a landline but it appears to be bugged. Dan quickly comes to suspect he is being surveilled as well. But Dan once had a nervous breakdown, after most of his family were killed in a house fire, so he is probably imagining things, right? Over the eight hour-long episodes of the series, Archive 81 ladles out generous portions – if perhaps sometimes at too stately a pace – of conspiracy theories, jump scares, corridor stalkings, things that go bump in the night, resurrected figures from the past, hallucinations (OR ARE THEY?), coded counsel from longtime tenants, haunting music whose terrifying strains drift into Melody’s room at night and put her in a state of nervous collapse, cultish goings on, mysterious smiles from inhabitants of the sixth floor, salutary warnings from fearful dwellers on the first-to-fifth and a gathering promise that – as long as you don’t look too closely at anything or for too long – more or less all will be revealed in a more or less satisfactory way. As with most series of this nature, it’s better watched over time rather than binged all at once, when the leaps of faith required to get past various illogicalities and inconsistencies can become too exhausting. It’s one of those programmes where you are best advised to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",Arts/Television & radio,Archive 81 review – the horror series humanity needs right now,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/14/archive-81-review-netflix-horror

1/14/2022,"We think of industry and traffic as the main sources of air pollution and overlook farming and food production. A new study from the Chinese University of Hong Kong examined the impacts from changing diets and increased meat production in China since the 1980s. Initially, the changes in agricultural production meant more food and better quality food. Undernourishment was reduced and people benefited from fresher fruit and vegetables, and improved animal products. However, continued increases in meat consumption, more processed food and less whole grains have offset these initial gains.  In addition to the direct dietary impacts on health, the quadrupling of China’s meat production between 1980 and 2010 has created an air pollution downside, due to the ammonia from animal waste and the fertilisers used to grow animal feed crops. The air pollution from the agricultural changes was estimated to have caused 90,000 extra deaths in 2010 – 66,000 from the rising demand for meat. People in poorer agricultural areas suffered the greatest effects even though they consumed the least meat. China is not alone is having air pollution problems from farming. Delhi’s persistently poor air pollution is made worse each year by farmers burning crop waste. In western Europe spring is often the most polluted time of year due in part to the ammonia from farm fertiliser and manure. Simply reducing meat consumption is one answer. Another is to decrease production. For example, the Dutch government has announced a €25bn (£21bn) programme to buy out cattle farmers. In his book English Pastoral, James Rebanks describes older mixed-farming methods where animal waste was used on the fields and crops were rotated, reducing the need for artificial fertiliser. A 2018 report by the UK Air Quality Expert Group highlighted that ammonia emissions could be reduced by about 40-60% by better management of manure. This includes covering manure stores, redesigning animal housings and tools to place manure directly on the ground or injecting it in soil rather than splash spreading. Planting trees around animal housings could help by capturing the ammonia and stopping its spread. Up to 40% of the ammonia from chicken farming can be trapped when chickens are kept under tree cover. A global methane pact was agreed at Cop26, which will increase pressure to reduce air pollutants from agriculture, and especially livestock farming. A growing number of national and local climate assemblies have brought together members of the public to learn, debate and prioritise solutions to the climate emergency.

1/14/2022,"An Indiana group whose anti-abortion campaign was endorsed in a signed advertisement by Amy Coney Barrett before she became a supreme court justice, keeps a published list of abortion providers and their place of work on its website, in what some experts say is an invitation to harass and intimidate the doctors and their staff. In one case, court records show, a doctor whose name was published by the group, which is called Right to Life Michiana, was warned by the FBI of a kidnapping threat that had been made online against her daughter.  The threat prompted the doctor to temporarily stop providing abortion services at the Whole Woman’s Health Care clinic in South Bend, which is also named on the Michiana group’s website. The doctor said in the court document that the clinic regularly attracts large gatherings of protesters, who she feared could identify her. Barrett signed a two-page advertisement in 2006, while she was working as a professor at Notre Dame, that stated that those who signed “oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death”. The second page of the ad called Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion, “barbaric”. The advertisement, which was published in the South Bend Tribune and signed by hundreds of people, was sponsored by a group called St Joseph County Right to Life, which merged with another anti-abortion group in 2020 and is now called Right to Life Michiana. The supreme court is expected to rule this year on challenges to Roe v Wade that many court experts expect will gut the rights of women in the US to obtain legal abortions. In arguments before the court, Barrett – who has said her personal views do not affect her legal judgement – argued that passage of safe haven laws, which allow parents to relinquish their newborns at hospitals or other designated centers without the threat of legal consequences, had in effect given women options outside of abortion for those who did not want to become parents. During her 2020 confirmation hearing, Barrett said she had signed the advertisement as a private citizen, while she was making her way out of church, and had not recalled signing it until it became public following a report in the Guardian. “It was consistent with the views of my church,” she said, in response to senators’ questions about the statement. She later added: “I do see as distinct my personal, moral, religious views and my task of applying the law as a judge.” An examination by the Guardian of Right to Life Michiana, which publishes the same advertisement denouncing Roe v Wade as “barbaric” every year, reveals that the group does more than publish statements in newspapers: it urges supporters to “take action” against what it calls a “local abortion threat”. In one section of the website, which is titled Local Abortion Threat: The Abortionist, the group lists the names and educational background of six doctors that it claims performs abortions at the Whole Women’s Health Clinic in South Bend. Among them is a doctor – who the Guardian is declining to name – who testified in 2021, in a case involving abortion restrictions in Indiana, that she started traveling to South Bend once a month – beginning in 2020 – in order to perform first trimester abortions at the South Bend clinic. She stopped making the trip – a 2.5 hour car trip each way from her home – after she was alerted by Planned Parenthood, who had been alerted by the FBI, that a kidnapping threat had been made against her daughter online. “I felt it would be best for me to limit my travel and exposure during that time,” the doctor said in testimony. “I was concerned that there may be people who would be able to identify me during that travel, as well as it’s a very small clinic without any privacy for the people who are driving in and out, and so therefore, people could directly see me.” Jackie Appleman, the executive director of Right to Life Michiana, said in response to questions from the Guardian that the information on its website was “publicly available information”. “Right to Life Michiana does not condone or encourage harm, threats or harassment towards anyone, including abortion doctors, abortion business employees and escorts. We encourage pro-choice groups to also accept our nonviolent approach when it comes to the unborn,” she said. The group has also previously stated that it supports the criminalization of doctors who perform abortions and the criminalization of procedures that routinely occur in the in vitro fertilization process, including the discarding of frozen embryos or selective reduction of embryos. The publication of doctors’ names – and in some other cases, their home addresses – is a well known tactic used by anti-abortion groups. The practice gained attention in the 1990s and early 2000s because of a legal battle over a website called the Nuremberg Files, which was supported by radical abortion opponents and published the names, photos, home addresses, and licence plate numbers of abortion providers. In some cases, spouses and children were also identified. Doctors who had been murdered had a line crossed through their names. One of the most high-profile cases of violence against abortion providers surrounded the case of George Tiller, who was one of the few doctors who performed late-term abortions when he was killed while attending church in 2009. Sharon Lau, the midwest advocacy director for Whole Woman’s Health Alliance, and serves as its security specialist, said Michiana Right to Life regularly protested at the group’s South Bend clinic, approaching patients and blocking its driveway. Asked about the naming of doctors on the Michiana website, Lau said: “It is clearly something that is threatening, so we take it seriously and we know that these types of things have consequences. The language is saying, ‘these people are a threat’. Which spurs people to action. We saw that with Dr Tiller.” WWHA has been frustrated in part, she said, by what appeared to be a reluctance by local prosecutor to charge protesters who it said were violating trespassing rules. “The law is not enforced. We know that if you enforce the fairly minor crimes, it can prevent escalation, so we’ve tried to impress that on them,” Lau said. Melissa Fowler, said anti-abortion protesters have been emboldened by the recent passage of abortion bans in Texas and Mississippi, and that the group had documented an increase in aggressiveness, including protesters taking advantage of “open carry” laws to stand near health clinics with visible weapons. Mira Shah, a doctor who travels in order to performs abortions in underserved communities, including in South Bend, who is listed on the Michiana website, said such groups aimed to instill fear in medical professionals and try to get them to stop doing their work. “It can honestly be scary,” Dr Shah said. “I am really careful and do what I need to do to stay safe. We’re trying to care for our patients and do the best we can do.” Amy Coney Barrett’s chambers at the supreme court was forwarded questions by the Guardian but did not respond to a request for comment.",News/World news,Group whose anti-abortion ad Amy Barrett signed accused of promoting harassment of doctors,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/anti-abortion-group-indiana-amy-coney-barrett
1/14/2022,"An official investigation into police handling of loyalist paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland that resulted in 19 murders has identified “collusive behaviours” and “significant concerns” about officers’ conduct. The long-delayed report by the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the killings included an investigation into the circumstances around the 1993 Greysteel pub massacre, which left eight people dead and 19 injured.  All the attacks were carried out by the Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters in the north-west of the island of Ireland between 1989 and 1993. In her damning report, ombudsman Marie Anderson found some of these lives could have been saved were it not for shortcomings within Northern Ireland’s police force at the time, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), in relation to use of intelligence and use of informants. While she said that there was no evidence that the RUC had prior knowledge of the attacks, the names of a number of people targeted in the attacks were discovered in loyalist “intelligence caches” between November 1989 and February 1992. The police failed to warn a number of people their lives were at risk and in some cases did no assessment of the risk. That, she said, was a “contravention of RUC Force Orders”. Of the 11 attacks investigated, seven involved the targeting of individuals whose names had appeared in the caches. “The lists included the names of six of the 19 people murdered by the UDA/UFF during this period and that of Patrick McErlain, who survived an attack in August 1992,” said a statement accompanying the report, published on Friday. Anderson found that while there was no evidence that the RUC had prior knowledge of the attacks, families’ concerns about “collusive behaviours” were “legitimate”. Eight people died as a result of the UDA in Greysteel on the eve of Halloween and 19 were injured. Four loyalists were later convicted of the murders, which had been carried out in revenge for the nine Protestants killed in the Shankill bombing the week before. The Greysteel victims were both Catholic and Protestant. The youngest was 19-year-old Karen Thompson, who died along with her boyfriend, Steven Mullan, while the oldest was 81-year-old James Moore. Anderson stated that the investigations following the attacks she investigated had been “prompt and thorough” and the majority of intelligence gathered by the RUC special branch was shared with murder investigation teams in a timely manner. However, she criticised “intelligence and surveillance failings” at the RUC which allowed for the arming of the north-west UDA/UFF with military assault rifles. “I am of the view that police were aware of the growing threat posed by the North West UDA/UFF from 1989 onwards. This increased threat, however, was not initially accompanied by a policing response proportionate to the increased risk to members of the republican and nationalist communities,” she said. She also criticised the RUC’s continued use of informants despite possessing intelligence that they were involved in serious criminality including murder. “I am of the view that this illustrated a practice on the part of some RUC special branch officers to recruit, and continue to use, informants suspected of involvement in serious criminality, including murder, contrary to applicable RUC policy at the time.” Her report comes as the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, edges closer to publishing a bill designed to give amnesty to police, army members and others involved in killings in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. The ombudsman’s investigation found that a number of lives could have been saved were it not for the RUC’s failure to act on intelligence. She also said police had failed to deal appropriately with members of the security forces suspected of having passed sensitive information to loyalist paramilitaries. Some were investigated properly but instead of facing criminal investigations “they were dismissed or repositioned”. “I am of the view that allegations of RUC officers passing information of use to terrorists was a serious matter that should have been investigated robustly and consistently,” she said.",News/UK news,"‘Significant concerns’ over RUC handling of loyalist activity, finds ombudsman",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/northern-ireland-ruc-police-loyalist-killings-collusive-behaviours-report
1/14/2022,"Three decades of school choice in England has left parents feeling more “cynical, fatalistic and disempowered” than their peers in other parts of the UK, according to new research. A study comparing parents in England, where families can name up to six state schools for their children to attend, with those in Scotland, where children are generally assigned to local state schools, found Scottish families were still more likely to be satisfied with the outcome.  While 75% of parents in England said they had enough choice of schools, 76% of those in Scotland said the same, despite their lack of explicit choices within the admissions process. Parents in England were more likely to express frustration and disempowerment, with several calling the current school choice policies an “illusion”, in surveys and interviews conducted for the research published in the Journal of Social Policy. Aveek Bhattacharya, the chief economist at the Social Market Foundation and the author of the paper, said: “This research adds to the growing evidence that school choice policies have failed to bring the benefits they were supposed to. “For all the emphasis that policymakers in England have put on increasing choice, parents south of the border are no happier with their lot than their Scottish counterparts. Indeed, many are disenchanted and dismayed. “These findings show that parents offered a range of options for their children’s school are no happier than parents who have less choice about education.” The findings come ahead of the deadline for primary school admissions in England on 15 January, which sees hundreds of thousands of families apply through local authorities for state school places starting in September. In London, Manchester, Birmingham and some other areas, families can rank up to six school preferences, while in most parts of England families have up to three choices. Local authorities then act as clearing houses, using an algorithm to match applicants to schools on the basis of parental preference, admissions criteria and the availability of places. But in Scotland, children are assigned a place at the nearest school unless their parents or carers decide to opt out and apply to a different one. As a result, children in Scotland are twice as likely to attend their local school than those in England. But with school choice enshrined in legislation in England since 1988, Bhattacharya said the government may find it is unable to meet the expectations it has raised. “It is unclear whether in England the genie can be put back in the bottle, as parents may resent choice being taken away from them, now it has been granted. Having raised expectations, policymakers might only be able to limit the frustration. “They can do this by minimising unsuccessful applications, for example by creating more places at the most popular schools, and reducing the uncertainty of the process, for example by guaranteeing children a place at their nearest school,” he said. Previous research has found that 35% of families in England name just one school in the admissions process, while 27% name the maximum number permitted. The earlier research also found that there were wide differences in the use of choice based on family ethnicity: 41% of white British households named only one choice of school, compared with 17% of Asian households and 12% of Black households.",News/Education,"Parents in England feel ‘disempowered’ by school choice, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/14/parents-in-england-feel-disempowered-by-school-choice-study-finds
1/14/2022,"The suggestion that a British Chinese solicitor has been allegedly working on behalf of China to influence UK politics adds further evidence of the bilateral relationship mutating from a “golden era” to an “ice age”. The latest development will clearly not help improve ties and, along with previous incidents, make the “China v the west” narrative increasingly look like an early cold war plot: suspected influence operations and – although not apparently the case here – alleged espionage as well as expulsion of personnel.  On Thursday, the British political establishment was warned that Christine Lee, a solicitor, may have been seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians for a number of years. The memo alleged Lee, who, according to Companies House filings, is also a British national, “has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China”. The memo further accused that the facilitation was “done covertly to mask the origins of the payments”. Lee has not responded to the allegations. The Guardian has contacted her law firm. The Chinese embassy in London said that Beijing’s non-interference foreign policy means that it has “no need” to buy influence. “We firmly oppose the trick of smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK,” it added. Modern states are not strangers to spycraft and influence operations. They may happen among allies, too, both through on-the-ground and cyberspace operations, as Edward Snowden’s NSA revelations showed nearly a decade ago. But Thursday’s reporting came after repeated warnings from Britain’s top security officials about Beijing amid deteriorating diplomatic ties. Under David Cameron, the British-Chinese relationship was touted as a “golden era”. In his speech in Beijing in September 2015, the then chancellor, George Osborne vowed to make Britain China’s “best partner in the west”. The claim was made despite criticisms from his own party about China’s human rights record and the situation in Hong Kong. In the years since, a consensus has formed among strategic communities from London to Washington: that China is seeking to change the postwar world order led by liberal democracies. The diplomatic relationship between the UK and China, in particular, has deteriorated further, particularly since the start of the Covid pandemic. There have been bilateral sanctions in place because of China’s actions in the Xinjiang region and in Britain’s former colony of Hong Kong. “Bilateral relations between the UK and China are not in great shape, but today’s announcement might not make it worse, either, as it wouldn’t be in Beijing’s interest to see this happening,” said Dr Andrew Chubb, a China researcher at Lancaster University. “[But] it sends a clear message that London is scrutinising Beijing’s friends and allies in Britain for potential crossovers into interference.” In his last public address, the head of MI6, Richard Moore, said a rising China had become Secret Intelligence Service’s “single greatest priority” for the first time in the agency’s history. China accused Moore of “peddling fake news and false intelligence”. Security services in Britain have been pivoting to China in recent years as threats from Islamist terrorism recede. Last year, the British press reported three journalists were asked to leave the UK for allegedly working as spies for China. The alleged departure was low-key and was not revealed until months later. China denied the report. As diplomatic relations sour, China’s modus operandi both inside its own territory and around the world are now under heavy scrutiny. For example, although it is dismissed by some seasoned China researchers for lack of substantial evidence, Moore insisted last month that Beijing was using a “debt trap” to exert control over smaller states. Thursday’s announcement may come as no surprise to those who have been following Lee’s successful – and sometimes controversial – legal career in the UK. In 2017, she was accused of using money to influence British politics and through projects such as the British Chinese Project , which she founded in 2006. Politicians – across the Labour and Conservative divide – were implicated by the claims. The irony is that, until recently, Lee was one of the few visible faces of the small but growing British Chinese community in the UK. With the British Chinese Project, which has been suspended since the Covid pandemic started, she was rewarded for including more British-Chinese people in the UK political system. “You should feel very proud of the difference that the British Chinese Project is making in promoting engagement, understanding, and cooperation between the Chinese and British communities in the UK,” Theresa May, then prime minister, said in a personal letter to Lee when awarding her the 2019 Points of Light award. Lee’s award has now been rescinded. The prestigious award was first established by President George HW Bush in 1990, with the UK initiative launched in the cabinet room at No 10 in April 2014. The award committee says the honour highlights “an enormous array of innovative and inspirational volunteering across the length and breadth of Britain”. “The wellbeing of the British Chinese community in the UK will always be of great importance to me and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to assist in any small way with our integration into UK society,” Lee responded to May after the award.",News/UK news,MI5 warning on lawyer ‘sends a clear message to China’s allies in UK’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/mi5-warning-on-lawyer-sends-a-clear-message-to-chinas-allies-in-uk
1/14/2022,"The global surge in demand for energy could spark another three years of market volatility and record power plant pollution unless countries make major changes to how they generate electricity, the world’s energy watchdog has warned. The International Energy Agency recorded the steepest ever increase in electricity demand last year, which triggered blackouts in major economies and led to historic energy price highs and record emissions.  The IEA’s annual electricity report said this could continue for another three years, with serious consequences for consumers and economies unless there is a faster structural change to the way electricity is produced. “Sharp spikes in electricity prices in recent times have been causing hardship for many households and businesses around the world and risk becoming a driver of social and political tensions,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. The IEA found that the world’s demand for electricity surged by 6% last year, following the global economic rebound from the 2020 pandemic recession, the steepest increase since 2010 when economies began to bounce back from the global financial crisis. The total increase in electricity demand was over 1,500 terawatt-hours, the largest on record. About half of the growth in electricity demand took place in China alone, where it rose by an estimated 10% compared with 2020. China and India both suffered from power cuts in the second half of the year because coal supplies failed to keep pace with the demand on their power plants, leading to an economic slowdown in Asia. In the UK, electricity market prices have reached record highs in recent months, in large part because the power grid continues to rely on gas-burning power plants for almost half of its electricity. The cost of running of these sites has rocketed following a global gas supply crunch which has triggered record high market prices across Europe. The rising cost of keeping the lights on has left the UK facing a national energy crisis as household bills have rocketed, energy suppliers have collapsed and factories have been forced to shut. The global strain on electricity systems has also led to record emissions from power generation as economies turn to cheaper coal power plants to keep a lid on soaring costs. “Policymakers should be taking action now to soften the impacts on the most vulnerable and to address the underlying causes,” Birol said. “Higher investment in low-carbon energy technologies including renewables, energy efficiency and nuclear power – alongside an expansion of robust and smart electricity grids – can help us get out of today’s difficulties.” The IEA’s report found that renewable energy sources grew by 6% in 2021, but that increase was unable to keep pace with the surge in demand as economies reopened following the sudden Covid-19 lockdowns that had choked economic growth. In order to meet the rebound in demand for power, coal-fired plants generated 9% more electricity last year, or more than half of the global increase in power demand, to reach an all-time peak as gas became more expensive. Electricity generated by gas power plants grew by 2% last year, according to the IEA, while nuclear generation increased by 3.5%. The return to dirtier sources of electricity caused the world’s total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power generation to climb by 7% to a new all-time high after having declined the two previous years, the IEA said. Birol warned that emissions from electricity would need to decline by 55% by 2030 if the world hopes to limit the rise in global heating by becoming “net zero carbon” by 2050. “But in the absence of major policy action from governments, those emissions are set to remain around the same level for the next three years,” he said. “Not only does this highlight how far off track we currently are from a pathway to net zero emissions by 2050, but it also underscores the massive changes needed for the electricity sector to fulfil its critical role in decarbonising the broader energy system.”",News/Business,Global surge in electricity use could bring three more years of price rises,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/global-surge-in-electricity-use-could-bring-three-more-years-of-price-rises
