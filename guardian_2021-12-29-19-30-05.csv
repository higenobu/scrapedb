12/29/2021,"London’s benchmark stock index has finally returned to the level it stood at in February 2020 before the Covid-19 crisis sent global markets into one of the biggest panics ever seen. The FTSE 100 gained more than 1% on Wednesday morning after a two-day Christmas break, moving 50 points beyond the mark it was at just before the pandemic crash 22 months ago. It hit a high of 7,457.14 points.  The landmark came amid growing evidence that the Omicron coronavirus variant of concern may cause less severe symptoms – although record daily UK case numbers mean Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced new restrictions on Boxing Day. The FTSE 100 closed on Friday 21 February 2020 at 7,403.92. When it opened again on Monday 24 February it slumped, the first day of an unfolding market panic that had few precedents. The severity of the coronavirus outbreak was already clear by then in China but investors – not to mention politicians – had not yet appreciated the depth of the changes that it would wreak on the global economy. The World Health Organization that day said the outbreak was not yet a “pandemic”. Yet Italy had just reported its seventh death from Covid-19, and lockdowns were in place in its northern regions, a sign of the wave of infections that was about to sweep through Europe and the rest of the world’s richest economies. China had already announced its first lockdown a month earlier, on 23 January. From that day until its low three weeks later, the FTSE lost more than a third of its value, or 2,500 points. It was the biggest quarterly contraction in London-listed share values since the aftermath of Black Monday in October 1987. It was also the fastest fall into a bear market – 20% below the previous high – ever seen on Wall Street. Yet from that low point markets surged back, thanks to a combination of extraordinary monetary stimulus from central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England combined with a huge bout of government spending. US markets recovered much faster than those in the UK thanks to the abundance of giant New York-listed technology companies, whose dominance was cemented by people across the world working from home during pandemic lockdowns. By contrast, the UK’s FTSE 100 is dominated by old-economy stalwarts such as oil and gas companies, miners and banks. The technology sector represents only 1% of the FTSE 100 by market value, compared with 40% of the S&P 500, according to Refinitiv’s categorisation, which excludes other big tech-dependent gainers such as the electric carmaker Tesla. The Wall Street benchmark hit a record closing high on Tuesday – its 69th of the year – but the FTSE 100 remains well short of its record, hit in May 2018, of 7,903.50 points. It is also short of the 2020 high of 7,689.67. The London Stock Exchange reopened on Wednesday for two full trading days, with a half-day also scheduled on New Year’s Eve. Trading volumes during this period are usually extremely thin as investors take holiday.",News/Business,FTSE 100 returns to pre-pandemic level as investors’ Omicron fears ease,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/29/ftse-100-returns-to-pre-pandemic-level-as-investors-omicron-fears-ease
12/29/2021,"From a tiny railway bridge for dormice in the UK to elk, deer and bears benefitting from a slew of new animal crossings in Colorado, wildlife bridges are having a moment. As the human footprint on the planet continues to expand, a growing number of roads and railways include provisions for wildlife to pass through fragmented landscapes. In January, we reported on Sweden’s plans to build a series of “renoducts” to help reindeer traverse the country’s main roads. The Swedish Transport Administration has since completed an ecoduct over the E6 in Skåne in southern Sweden, the third in the county. In southern California, work is due to begin on the largest wildlife bridge in the world in 2022, to connect isolated mountain lion populations north of Los Angeles that are becoming dangerously inbred. Joe Biden has earmarked $350m (£260m) of his $1.2tn infrastructure package for wildlife bridges to lessen the multibillion annual cost of collisions.  “Ten years ago, wildlife bridges were experimental. We didn’t know whether they would work or not. Now they’ve shown they get huge reductions in collisions. In some cases, 85% to 99% reductions,” says Rob Ament, a road ecology expert at Montana State University. “You can design them for many species. Even out in the plains, we’re getting moose crossings in North Dakota.” Wildlife bridges are found on every continent: there is an elephant underpass near Mount Kenya; the Netherlands has a network of ecoducts that may help the country’s first wolf pack in more than 140 years gain a foothold across the densely populated country; suspended water pipes are helping Java’s endangered lorises; and a bison bridge may help the animals cross the Mississippi. Here are five projects from around the world helping animals make their way: The 129km (80-mile) stretch of road between Naples and Fort Lauderdale bisects the Everglades, an enormous wetland that is home to thousands of alligators, deer and the endangered Florida panther. It used to be notorious for high-speed collisions with wildlife until the road was upgraded to a four-lane motorway and crossings were installed. Today, dozens of underpasses and fencing help wildlife navigate the road. A camera trapping exercise found panthers, black bears, skunks, deer, bats, birds and even fish use the crossings, and hope is growing the state’s wildlife bridge network could be extended north to connect potential habitats for the Florida panther. “Fencing is critical along Alligator Alley. It is a 10ft-high chain link fence with three-strand barbed wire on top. That’s to keep the wildlife off the roadway and on the crossing,” says Brent Setchell, a design engineer at Florida Department of Transportation, who identifies potential crossing sites by monitoring road collisions with panthers and bears. “The fascinating thing is we just started monitoring the crossings four or five years ago. We found an abundance of wildlife.” Stretching through the Victorian Alps in south-east Australia, the Great Alpine Road posed an existential threat to a colony of critically endangered mountain pygmy possums. Even though there are only about 150 of the marsupials on Mount Little Higginbotham, testing revealed genetic differences between sub-groups separated by the road, which are also threatened by fire, disappearing food sources and invasive species. Conservationists decided to build a “tunnel of love” between the isolated groups to improve mixing and strengthen their chances of survival. Over the last two summers, 30 possums have been identified using the tunnel of love, often in spring when they wake up from hibernation. The tiny marsupials can cross the nearly 15-metre tunnel in just 15 seconds – sometimes too fast for remote sensing cameras to capture them. India’s first dedicated wildlife underpasses were a hard-fought victory for environmental campaigners. The nine crossings in the Pench tiger reserve were a court-ordered mitigation measure on the country’s longest road, the 4,112km National Highway 44, which runs down the middle of the country. Collisions with big cats still happen on the multi-lane motorway, but environmentalists say the underpasses have highlighted the need for more wildlife crossings on India’s road network. A 2019 camera trapping exercise found at least 18 species use the crossings, including tigers, wild dogs, sloth bears, civets and leopards. “According to our calculation, some 55,000km of roads pass through India’s forests and protected areas, many of them through wildlife corridors,” Milind Pariwakam, a road ecologist with Wildlife Conservation Trust Mumbai, told the Hindu. More infrastructure projects now have wildlife passes, including the 1,380km Delhi-Mumbai expressway currently under construction, which includes India’s first animal bridges. Nearly 700 Asian elephants roam Bhutan’s forest on the eastern edge of the Himalayas. The small Buddhist country sandwiched between China and India is known for its dramatic landscapes and environmental leadership, as one of the few carbon negative countries in the world. On the 183km east-west motorway, Bhutan’s first elephant underpasses were constructed to help the threatened animals move through the landscape.Monitoring from 2015 to 2017 found that 70 groups of elephants were recorded near the passes, with three-quarters passing through the structures. Wildlife passes are not always bridges or underpasses. In Costa Rica, canopy bridges are used to help sloths, monkeys and other wildlife cross roads to combat collisions, dog attacks and electrocutions on power lines. The rope bridges, which cost about $200 (£150), are installed by the Sloth Conservation Foundation in areas where rainforest has been interrupted by human development on the country’s Caribbean coast. Crossing roads is often deadly for the slow-moving creatures and the canopy bridges also help combat inbreeding. “People look at them and think that they’re so poorly equipped to survive because you see them crossing roads and trying to move around and they look so awkward and useless,” Rebecca Cliffe, head of the Sloth Conservation Foundation, told Bloomberg earlier this year. “But if you put them in a well-connected rainforest, then they are masters of survival.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Animal crossings: the ecoducts helping wildlife navigate busy roads across the world,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/29/wildlife-bridges-saving-creatures-big-and-small-aoe
12/29/2021,"A fear of catching Covid-19 is not a protected belief under the Equality Act, a judge has ruled, after a woman claimed she was discriminated against by her employer when she refused to go into work during the pandemic. A tribunal held in Manchester this month heard that the claimant refused to return to her workplace in July 2020 because she had a “genuine fear” of contracting coronavirus and passing it on to her partner, who was at high risk of becoming seriously unwell.  Neither the woman nor her employer were named in the judgment. In a statement given to the tribunal, the worker said her employer had refused to pay her and she had suffered financial detriment as a result. She said: “I claim this was discrimination on the grounds of this belief in regard to coronavirus and the danger from it to public health. This was at the time of the start of the second wave of Covid-19 and the huge increase in cases of the virus throughout the country.” Asked what her belief was, she told the tribunal: “A fear of catching Covid-19 and a need to protect myself and others.” In his ruling, the employment judge Mark Leach said he accepted the woman had a genuine fear but he did not believe it met the criteria for a “philosophical belief” that would be protected under section 10 of the Equality Act 2010. He said: “I do not find that the claimant’s fear amounts to a belief. Rather, it is a reaction to a threat of physical harm and the need to take steps to avoid or reduce that threat. Most (if not all) people instinctively react to perceived or real threats of physical harm in one way or another. “It can also be described as a widely held opinion based on the present state of information available that taking certain steps – for example, attending a crowded place during the height of the current pandemic – would increase the risk of contracting Covid-19 and may therefore be dangerous. “Few people may argue against that. However, a fear of physical harm and views about how best to reduce or avoid a risk of physical harm is not a belief for the purposes of section 10.” Leach added: “Fears about the harm being caused by Covid-19 are weighty and substantial. They are certainly not minor or trivial. They are about also aspects of human life and behaviour.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK worker who stayed home over fear of Covid fails in discrimination claim,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/29/uk-worker-who-stayed-home-over-fear-of-covid-fails-in-discrimination-claim
12/29/2021,"After a brief wait to the faint whirr of moving machinery parts, the tiny cardboard box that drops into the plastic-covered tray is reassuringly warm. Inside is a perfectly passable burger in a chewy white bun, topped with a blob of ketchup and diced fried onions. No human interaction occurred in the making of this transaction. The Guardian’s alfresco lunch came courtesy of one of dozens of vending machines in Sagamihara, an unglamorous town near Tokyo.  Nostalgia has preserved the 90 or so jidō hanbaiki here, but after decades of steady decline in their number nationally, the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a vending machine revival in Japan as retailers pin their hopes on “untact” sales to customers still nervous about buying food, drink and other items in the traditional way. As the lunchtime trade picks up, truck drivers join young couples, customers at a nearby tyre garage and curious tourists as they edge along the row of machines on a chilly day in early winter. They are spoiled for choice. The ageing machines – whose contents are impeccably fresh – offer a multiple-course meal, perhaps beginning with tempura soba noodles or curry and rice, with an ice-cream for dessert and a cup of hot matcha tea to finish. Despite their declining numbers, it is practically impossible to walk down a street in any Japanese town or city and not spy the telltale light emitting from a vending machine in the distance. According to the Japan Vending System Manufacturers Association, the number peaked at 5.6m in 2000, or one for every 23 people. That had fallen to just over 4m by last year, but the country still has the largest number of vending machines per capita in the world. More than half of Japan’s ubiquitous machines sell food or drink, but their eclectic stock extends to items that appear slightly out of place behind a pane of glass: anime and manga merchandise, figurines, underpants, toothbrushes, skincare products, umbrellas and, since the start of the pandemic, masks and Covid-19 test kits. Kenmin Foods is one of a growing number of firms turning to non-contact customer service to make up for sales lost during the pandemic. The rice-noodle maker installed a vending machine in front of its headquarters in Kobe in September and pulled in ¥23m (£153,000), three times its initial target, according to the Yomiuri newspaper. A seafood seller in Hokkaido, meanwhile, has started fillets of fresh salmon and mackerel after many of its regular clients closed due to the pandemic. In the central city of Nagoya, three companies have joined forces to sell food – including bread and instant noodles - nearing its expiry date from vending machines at up to 50% off its normal price. Maruyama Seimen now sells its frozen noodles and dumplings via vending machines in 30 locations and plans to expand that to 100 by April 2023. At the peak of the pandemic in Japan the machines were being emptied of more than 10,000 packs a month, the Nikkei business newspaper reported, while traditional sales slumped by a fifth. “The convenience of vending machines is being re-evaluated because of the pandemic,” Prof Hidehiko Nishikawa, a marketing expert at Hosei University, told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. “Efforts to increase added value, such as giving points through apps for vending machines, are important to draw in customers.” In Sagamihara, two women pull down their masks and eat just-dispensed bowls of steaming udon in the back of their people carrier, while a couple feed coins into a machine selling sweet snacks.

12/29/2021,"Iplanned to be in Lagos this Christmas. The season is called Detty December (as in “dirty”), and it’s a whirlwind of weddings, parties and concerts that go on till the early hours of the morning. The dress code is “slay queen” – dress to slay – and there’s only one rule: enjoyment. I booked my flight months in advance to avoid the price hikes that happen close to Christmas. I readied my outfits. I packed my sunscreen. And then, as of 7 December, the UK government put Nigeria on the red list. I was scheduled to fly the day before. I sought counsel. My bolder friends encouraged me to travel because the rules might change before my return flight. My more cautious friends advised that I should only risk it if, in the event that the travel ban was not lifted, I was ready to pay £2,120 for hotel quarantine. I was not ready to pay £2,120. I postponed my trip.  So far, so pandemic. We’ve all had to cancel flights, weddings, graduations and birthday parties in the last two years. The cancellation was not the shock. It was my calm response to the shelving of a long-awaited holiday that surprised me. The Chibundu of 2019 would have gone on a rant that started with my family and progressed to social media, where it would eventually burn out in a very long Twitter thread: 30 tweets minimum. I would have started with Boris Johnson, worked my way through the cabinet and finished with a diatribe against Covid itself. I would have railed against the double standards that turned African travellers into international pariahs when the Omicron variant was present in other countries around the world. Then I would have locked myself in my room for a week, sat in darkened silence and mourned my lost Detty December. Instead, I exchanged my ticket for a travel voucher and made new plans for Christmas. It was the pandemic. The pandemic had made me more comfortable with uncertainty. I was willing to accept that things might not go according to plan, and that was all right, because as long as I was alive and in good health then I could make new plans. One of the side effects of a virus sweeping across the world and locking us down and separating me from my family in Nigeria was that I was growing this strange, wonderful emotional muscle called resilience. Even though it has atrophied somewhat through my years of living in England, I grew up with resilience. My childhood was spent in 90s Nigeria, which meant military-rule Nigeria, which meant coups, dictatorships, fuel scarcity, labour strikes, social unrest and much more. You could wake up one morning and the president had changed. And how did my parents cope with all this uncertainty? They planned for the future but they lived in the present. They realised that tomorrow was not guaranteed so they did not spend their days fretting about what might happen. They had enough foresight to make plans but they had enough flexibility to change them. They moved through life with a certain ease and grace that I in my 20s and 30s, living in a country with more political stability and economic opportunity, struggled to replicate. There’s nothing wrong with planning. There is something harmful with believing that because you have planned something then it must be so. That is a prerogative that was formerly only attributed to the divine but is now the hubris of the western world. Those in Washington, London and Paris see western dominance, economic growth and excessive consumption stretching into the future for ever. I look at my discarded plans from 2020, and I approach the future with more humility and flexibility. I look at the uncertainty of Brexit Britain, in particular the petrol shortage of the summer and the queues that lasted for hours. All this reminded me of petrol scarcities in Lagos. It reminded me that the fact I lived in relative ease and prosperity was not because I was better than anyone. It wasn’t because I was smarter or a better planner. It was simply time and chance. In the old days, people used to say: “There but for the grace of God go I.” It could be you who is living in a country at war, forced to flee with nothing but the clothes on your back. It could be you crossing the Channel in a rubber dinghy, hoping that the coastguard won’t let you drown if you capsize. All of us, in the last two years, have faced enough uncertainty to show compassion to those fleeing instability. But will we learn? Will we learn? In the end, Christmas in England was fine. There was no Burna Boy concert or Tems concerts. There were no red-carpet weddings or beach parties. I didn’t get to see my family in Nigeria but I saw my family in England: three nieces, two sisters, two brother-in-laws, one nephew, one cousin and one very special boyfriend. There was jollof rice and chicken; and even though somebody was too lazy to fry the plantain, we made do without. It wasn’t my first plan. But I made a new plan, and life went on.

12/29/2021,"In March 2020, Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns disrupted one of the most routine aspects of pediatric medicine – getting young kids vaccinated against preventable diseases, from measles to whooping cough to influenza. Now, nearly two years into the pandemic, the number of shots going into young arms has rebounded.  But an emerging body of evidence is also beginning to show lingering effects of the pandemic, as Black families in particular struggle to get kids caught up on routine vaccinations, just as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 threatens to once again disrupt daily life. “We might have a cohort of children who are forever behind” on vaccinations, said Dr Brian P Jenssen, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. A recent comment piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics by Jenssen and fellow CHOP pediatrician Dr Alexander Fiks warned of a growing gap between the most and least disadvantaged children. “If we don’t address this we’re going to be setting ourselves up for the next pandemic, period.” Health authorities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend 15 vaccinations for infants from birth to 15 months. These shots cover a range of preventable diseases from measles to polio. Then, from 15 months to 18 years old, health authorities recommend another 15 vaccinations, including boosters. Covid-19 vaccines have been recommended for all children older than five, but have not yet been added to this formal vaccine schedule. Federal vaccine purchasing programs have helped improve disparities in vaccination rates between white and Black children in recent years, because they removed cost barriers for many vaccines. Nevertheless, disparities have persisted, and adults also experience disparities in vaccination rates based on race and ethnicity. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, federal scientists found childhood immunizations plummeted, in part because many of the places children get vaccinated went into lockdown with the rest of the country. School-based clinics, health departments and pediatricians’ offices closed for months. America’s health system is fragmented and largely private, but glimpses of the scale of decline came from federal vaccine ordering programs, local programs in New York City and Michigan and then a CDC report that assessed 10 vaccination programs. In just one example, a CDC study out of Michigan found from March to May 2020, when stay-at-home orders were in place, the share of five-month-old babies up-to-date on vaccines dropped from an average of roughly two-thirds to less than half. Those rates began to recover when stay-at-home orders were lifted, in the summer of 2020. Between June and September 2020, the rates of vaccination “approach pre-pandemic baseline levels,” more CDC research found. However, they “did not increase to the level that would have been necessary to catch up children who did not receive routine vaccinations on time”. Now, a growing body of research suggests the kids least likely to have caught up on vaccinations are those who were least likely to have been up-to-date before the pandemic. In other words, the pandemic did not just temporarily slow childhood vaccinations, but worsened disparities between groups. CDC researchers found children on Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled, were less likely to be caught up on vaccines. In another recent study, in JAMA Pediatrics, Black families were less likely than Hispanic or Asian families to have kids up-to-date on vaccines. The JAMA study compared the rates of children who are up-to-date on vaccinations in 2019 to fall 2020 across more than 1.4 million children in a private health system that spans six states. Although the proportion of Black children in the study was lower than in the general population, these families still appeared to struggle to get catch up. Here, researchers looked across a range of ages from infants to adolescents. They found 18-month-old children were the most likely to be affected. At 18 months, Asian children were the most likely to be up-to-date on vaccines, with 76% up-to-date, versus 41% among Black infants. Terrence Shirley, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi, said he was “not really surprised” to learn low-income and Black and brown children have fallen further behind. “Think about where a lot of the underserved, underprivileged individuals will access care, or try to access care – those institutions that actually went into lockdown,” said Shirley. School-based clinics, a vital pipeline for vaccinating many children, were among the first to shut down and often stayed closed for months. Reopening clinics then proved challenging, as nurses who once staffed them moved on to contract work, which paid better as hospitals overwhelmed with Covid increased nurse wages. Many low-income families lost work during the pandemic, may have lost access to transportation, or lack the internet needed to make an appointment. Even now, public health resources remain focused on the fight against Covid-19, especially as the Omicron variant threatens to create a new wave of cases and hospitalizations nationally. “We focused so much of the resources, the financial resources, on combatting Covid,” said Shirley. “We have to re-tool”. To some extent, difficulty distributing routine childhood vaccines is a global phenomenon. Lagging measles programs have caused particular concern for global health authorities. In November, the World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC released a joint statement to call on governments to strengthen measles inoculation programs after more than 22 million infants missed measles doses. Noting how resources had been devoted to battle Covid-19, Dr Kate O’Brien, the director of WHO’s department of immunization, vaccines and biologicals said, “Routine immunization must be protected and strengthened. Otherwise, we risk trading one deadly disease for another.” Shirley also noted that some conservative states, such as Mississippi, have made policy decisions that exacerbate inequality. A dozen conservative-led US states refuse to expand Medicaid, even though the federal government would pay at least 90% of the program. “All of these social determinants of health are driven by the political determinants of health,” said Shirley. “Unless and until we’re willing to address the politics … we’re going to be behind the eight ball for years to come”.",News/Society,Children still lagging in routine immunisations after gap caused by pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic

12/29/2021,"Calls for a reduction in England’s Covid self-isolation period from seven days to five in order to ease NHS staff shortages have been dismissed by a government minister. Chloe Smith, the minister for disabled people, health and work, said the previous period of 10 days had only recently been cut by three. That came after a senior NHS official warned that staff absences due to Covid over the winter months – exacerbated by underlying shortages – was likely to pose the NHS a bigger problem than the number of Omicron-related patients being hospitalised.  “There are no current plans in England to change that period,” Smith told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. “Of course, we have actually only recently taken it down from 10 to seven, and we want to look at that – we want to make sure that that is working as we believe it ought to. “We think the current period, therefore, is the right one, so we haven’t any plans to change that further.” On Tuesday, US health authorities halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid to five days. A leading immunologist suggested the UK could follow a similar path if rapid testing capacity and quality could support it. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and the government’s life sciences adviser, said illness associated with Omicron was proving less severe than with previous variants. “My view is that lateral flow tests are quite a good way of marking who is infectious and who isn’t and, as you know, we’ve dropped from 10 days to seven days if you have sequential lateral flow tests. That is a much better way to measure and quantitate whether we are allowing people to go back into the community who are infectious,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. Asked if he thought that should lead to a further cut to the self-isolation period in England, he said: “If it was supported by lateral flow data, yes.” Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told Today that a decrease in the self-isolation period would help ease the staffing crisis. But he acknowledged that ministers needed to carefully balance that against the risk of increasing transmission. Boris Johnson, who has ruled out any additional restrictions in England before the new year, has been accused of going missing in action this week. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association’s ruling council, suggested the prime minister has ignored “the elephant in the room” of staff absence levels, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. And the chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, has warned that the effect of greater social mixing over Christmas is still to come, telling BBC Breakfast the same day that the NHS was bracing for an increase in patients being hospitalised with Omicron. Staff self-isolations are putting the NHS under severe strain, with one union leader saying that already overstretched public services are in a “perilous state” and experts warning of a “worst case scenario” in which up to 40% of NHS staff in London are unable to work. Hopson added: “We’re now seeing a significant increase in the level of staff absences, and quite a few of our chief executives are saying that they think that that’s probably going to be a bigger problem and a bigger challenge for them than necessarily the number of people coming in who need treatment because of Covid.”",News/World news,Minister rejects calls to reduce self-isolation to five days in England ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/minister-rejects-calls-to-reduce-self-isolation-to-five-days-in-england
12/29/2021,"A lack of lateral flow tests (LFTs) in UK pharmacies is a “huge” problem as people have been requesting them every five minutes over the Christmas period, providers have warned. Leyla Hannbeck, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, said a lack of LFT kits over Christmas and new year had put those “doing the responsible thing” in an impossible situation.  “What our members are telling us is that demand for the lateral flow tests is very high at the moment due to the current guidelines around self-isolation. Pharmacies are reporting that every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy asking for a test,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “But, unfortunately, because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent, it means that those who come for the test don’t always get it, which is very stressful; not just for the pharmacy team, but for the patient. “The scale of the problem is huge because the demand is high, because of the current guidelines. “People are doing the responsible thing by wanting to be tested. And we are in the Christmas area of time and the new year is just around the corner and people want to be with family and friends.” Current rules in England allow anyone who has tested positive to cut their self-isolation from 10 days to seven if they have negative LFTs on days six and seven. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the self-isolation period for those who test positive remains 10 days. The UK Health Security Agency has said nearly 900,000 test kits are being provided each day, double the supply before 18 December. The government’s policy has driven demand for LFTs in England, adding to the seasonal demand throughout the UK among those wanting to see family and friends over Christmas, and the underlying testing requirements. Hannbeck, whose organisation represents 2,000 pharmacies around the UK, told Today: “It just simply isn’t enough to meet the demand and it’s patchy. Some days you get one box delivered and other days none.
