12/13/2021,"(Corrects name in third paragraph to McEwen) By Richa Naidu EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (Reuters) - Amazon cargo driver Austin J. McEwen, 26, was an only child who loved to listen to rapper Mac Miller and hunt with his friends. He died trying to shelter from a powerful tornado in the bathroom at an Amazon.com warehouse on Friday night, according to a coworker. McEwen was one of six workers identified by police on Sunday who were killed when their plant in Edwardsville, Illinois, buckled under the force of the devastating tornado. A swath of tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km). ""He was my friend and he didn't make it,"" said coworker Brian Erdmann, who was on his way to make a delivery to the warehouse. ""If I would have got back 45 minutes earlier, I probably would have been at the same place. I would have been right there with him."" The other Amazon workers identified as dead by the local coroner were Deandre S. Morrow, 28, of St. Louis, Missouri; Kevin D. Dickey, 62, of Carlyle, Illinois; Clayton Lynn Cope, 29, of Alton, Illinois; Etheria S. Hebb, 24, of St. Louis, Missouri; and Larry E. Virden, 46, of Collinsville, Illinois. Several employees told Reuters that they had been directed to shelter in bathrooms by Amazon managers after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from local authorities. The first warning was issued about 40 minutes before the tornado hit, according to firefighters and the Illinois governor. Amazon confirmed in an email that the site got tornado warnings through various alerts. ""Our team worked quickly to ensure as many employees and partners could get to the designated Shelter in Place,"" the company said in a statement. ""We thank them for everything they were able to do."" Workers gave conflicting accounts as to whether the bathroom was the designated shelter. Amazon did not comment. Some of those workers said they had kept their phones in violation of an Amazon policy that prevents them from having cellphones at work. The company responded by saying employees and drivers are allowed to have their cellphones. ""I was at the end of my route. I was just getting in the building and they started screaming, 'Shelter in place!'"" said David Kosiak, 26, who has worked at the facility for three months. ""We were in the bathrooms. That's where they sent us."" ""It sounded like a train came through the building. The ceiling tiles came flying down. It very loud. They made us shelter in place til we left - it was at least two and a half hours in there."" The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time by the tornado accompanied by 155 mile-per-hour (249 km-per-hour) winds, authorities said. The force was so severe that the roof was ripped off and 11-inch (28-cm) thick concrete walls longer than football fields fell on themselves. At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers. On Sunday, Amazon workers arrived at the warehouse across the street, heavily guarded by security, to start shifts. ""It's a reminder of the trauma that I just endured but I will be returning to work at Amazon,"" said McEwen's friend and coworker Emily Epperson. ""This is my livelihood.” (Reporting by Richa Naidu in Edwardsville, Illinois and Caroline Stauffer in Chicago; Writing by Leela de Kretser; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",Business/Reuters,Amazon driver died in bathroom sheltering from tornado with colleagues,https://news.yahoo.com/amazon-driver-died-bathroom-sheltering-195027330.html
12/13/2021,"After gaining some weight which left him feeling dissatisfied with his physique and weighing the heaviest he ever had, fitness YouTuber Will Tennyson recently underwent a cut. In a new video on his channel, he shares the lifestyle changes he made that helped him drop 11.6 pounds over the course of one month. Tennyson started eating at a caloric deficit, consuming 2,500 calories per day, but soon found that he was losing weight too quickly and that this was not safe or sustainable, so he upped his daily intake to 2,750 at the end of the first week. Aside from that, he ate the exact same meals every day. A typical pre-workout breakfast is yogurt with protein powder, cashew milk, peanut butter and berries. Lunch is chicken, cabbage and zucchini, with a serving of butternut squash. Dinner is a savoury French toast with a ""sloppy Joe"" topping made with ground turkey, followed with a protein-rich shake at the end of the day. ""I was in a monogamous relationship with these foods,"" he says. ""I have found, personally, on a cut, when I have structured meals and I stick with the same things every single day, I'm much more likely to adhere to my cut, whereas if I had my calories open to interpretation day to day, I'm more likely to find ways to fit things in, like donuts."" Tennyson didn't adjust his training routine too much, other than allowing himself plenty of time for recovery between workouts as he was more prone to fatigue while eating fewer calories. ""In terms of my strength, that didn't really go down, what did go down was my endurance with that strength,' he says. In terms of cardio, he increased his walking, aiming to hit 1,500 steps every day by the end of the cut. ""If you're going on a cut, stay committed to your decision to do it, but stay flexible with your approach,"" he says. ""Find what works best for you, and make sure you enjoy the process.""

12/13/2021,"Mark Meadows indicated in a Jan. 5 email that the National Guard was on standby to “protect pro Trump people,” according to an email obtained by the House committee investigating the Capitol riot and described in a public document Sunday night. The context for the message is unclear, but it comes amid intense scrutiny of the Guard’s slow response to violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and conflicting timelines about their response from the Pentagon and National Guard leadership. The description of the message is part of a 51-page document released Sunday by the select panel a day before it is set to vote to hold Meadows in contempt of Congress. The full House is expected to vote to hold Meadows, former White House chief of staff to President Donald Trump, in criminal contempt of Congress on Tuesday. In other messages described by the committee, Meadows appears to have asked members of Congress to help connect Trump with state lawmakers. “POTUS wants to chat with them,” Meadows said, according to documents obtained by the Jan. 6 committee and described publicly Sunday evening. The messages also describe numerous contacts with members of Congress about Trump’s efforts to recruit state lawmakers and encourage them to help overturn the election results. They also included questions about Meadows’ exchanges with members of Congress as they pressed him urgently to issue a statement telling rioters on Jan. 6 to exit the Capitol. Meadows’ attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The messages are the clearest insight yet into the conversations Trump was having with senior advisers in the chaotic months after his defeat in which he sought to cling to power in increasingly desperate ways. Though Meadows turned over thousands of text messages and emails, he has declined to sit for a deposition to discuss those messages, claiming he is barred by executive privilege. The committee and Meadows had reached a tentative agreement for him to come in for an interview, but the pact collapsed last week. Instead, the committee held a closed-door deposition without Meadows present and described the questions they would have asked him. The transcript of that closed session was appended to the panel’s contempt report, describing the details of the documents Meadows had provided. “We would have asked him about text messages sent to and received from a Senator regarding the Vice President’s power to reject electors, including a text in which Mr. Meadows recounts a direct communication with President Trump who, according to Mr. Meadows in his text messages, quote, ‘thinks the legislators have the power, but the VP has power Too,’” the panel’s investigators noted. The committee pointed out that many of the messages he shared already appeared to violate privilege by describing his own contacts with Trump. He also revealed many of those contacts in his recently released book. The committee described a slew of other messages it obtained from Meadows including: — Text messages with a “media personality” who had encouraged Trump to issue a statement asking those at the Capitol to “peacefully leave.” — A text “sent to one of — by one of the President’s family members indicating that Mr. Meadows is, quote, ‘pushing hard,’ end quote, for a statement from President Trump to, quote, ‘condemn this shit.’” — Texts in December 2020 regarding efforts to install Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general. — Texts to and from a member of Congress in November 2020 seeking contact information for the attorney general of Arizona to discuss claims of election fraud. — Texts to and from organizers of the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the violent attack on the Capitol. — Texts “reflecting Mr. Meadows’ skepticism about public statements regarding allegations of election fraud put forth by Sidney Powell and his skepticism about the veracity of claims of tampering with Dominion voting machines.”",Politics/Politico,"Meadows Jan. 5 email indicated National Guard on standby to ‘protect pro Trump people,’ investigators say",https://news.yahoo.com/meadows-jan-5-email-indicated-233516809.html
