5/12/2022,"A short-seller known for uncovering the Nikola Motor fraud has bet against Twitter, warning publicly that Elon Musk has “all the cards” to renegotiate a lower price. In a statement on Monday, Hindenburg Research concluded the deal’s $1-billion breakup fee was not a sufficient enough deterrent given the heady cocktail of poor first-quarter results and inflated user numbers for the social media platform, as well as an ongoing market crash in tech stocks. That gives the Tesla CEO an opening to pressure Twitter’s board into accepting more favorable terms by threatening to abandon the bid entirely and let the share tank, Hindenburg said. “We believe that if Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter disappeared tomorrow, Twitter’s equity would fall by 50% from current levels,” it wrote, adding it was now actively shorting the social media company. “Consequently, we see a significant risk that the deal gets repriced lower.” The centibillionaire responded with a cryptic non-statement that revealed little as to whether he disagreed with the underlying analysis: “Interesting,” he posted via Twitter. “Don’t forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!” Hindenburg Research is probably best known for blowing the whistle on Nikola Motor CEO Trevor Milton’s fraudulent attempt to pass off his hydrogen fuel cell truck rolling downhill as being driven by his own proprietary propulsion technology. Milton is now awaiting trial on criminal charges he lied to investors. Thanks to Musk’s Twitter bid, approved unanimously by the board late last month and announced by chairman Bret Taylor, its stock has succeeded in largely decoupling itself from the broader tech market. The share price is now essentially little more than a barometer of investor confidence in Musk’s deal going through at the $54.20 offer. Twitter has climbed 22% since April 1, before news broke of Musk’s 9.2% stake purchase, to finish Monday’s session at $47.96. While that indicates the market still sees a material execution risk for the deal, it has proved far more resilient than the broader tech sector. This outperformance is not because of strong fundamentals, but solely down to the existence of Musk’s bid propping up the price. By comparison, the Nasdaq Composite has lost nearly a fifth of its value over the same period of time. Pricing a similar drop into the $44 billion offer would mean Musk could lower the cost of the deal by a good $7 billion after paying the breakup fee. Even a conservative 10% reduction to the bid price to reflect prevailing market conditions would still save him billions. Considering that the current deal would encumber Twitter’s balance sheet with some $13 billion in debt, or nearly nine times its annual underlying cash earnings (Ebitda), Hindenburg Research argued a lower price with a less aggressive financing profile would furthermore put the acquisition on more solid financial footing. “The heavy debt load would make it more challenging to pursue Musk’s goal of reducing Twitter’s reliance on advertising, which currently comprises the vast majority of its revenue,” it wrote. Importantly, Musk is also not the only one fronting capital for the deal—and therefore not the only one calling the shots either. In order to avoid liquidating any more of his Tesla stake or pledging too many shares as collateral, he recently enlisted help from Wall Street whales to finance the deal with over $7 billion of their own money. Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as crypto exchange Binance were just a few to be tempted by heady growth targets such as a fivefold increase in Twitter’s annual revenue by 2028. These investors would likely advocate more favorable terms should they see any opening to extract meaningful concessions, according to Hindenburg Research. Since the Tesla CEO’s current offer was “vastly superior to alternatives,” the short-seller warned there was little alternative for Twitter’s board than to accept any revised terms—a situation that presents a key risk to existing shareholders. “Musk has incredible leverage to renegotiate should he choose to,” Hindenburg Research concluded.

5/12/2022,"Markets have well and truly changed direction from last year’s bullish trends. The downward shift has brought us a major selloff, and declines of 27% and more in the tech-heavy NASDAQ index. For investors, it’s a situation that requires a close watch on the markets, and clear eye for the opportunities that will pop out as conditions change. It’s also a situation in which investors can use expert advice. Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, tells investors that when the market starts to change direction, in response to shifting trends or increased volatility, it’s also time to change strategies. And in the current clime, Cramer is recommending profitable stocks in the tech sector – especially those that are beaten-down. Describing his stance, Cramer says, ""Many tech companies that make real things and return capital to shareholders now do sell at reasonable prices after the tsunami of selling... Right now the facts are a lot less hostile to the beaten-down high-flyers..."" With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two heavily discounted tech stocks that return capital regularly through dividends. Each is a Strong Buy, according to the analyst community, and has a strong upside potential for the coming year. Let's take a closer look. Absolute Software (ABST) First up is Absolute Software, a leader in enterprise resilience, or maintaining normal operations, along with the ability to recover systems and data, against network security breaches. The Canadian-based company's product lines offer customers the ability to manage, control, and heal devices, networks, data, and operations, shortening recovery times and speeding up the return to normalcy. In addition, Absolute offers IT and security solutions to protect systems and prevent breaches from occurring. Absolute boasts over 13,000 global customers, including 28 OEMs who factory-embed Absolute products into devices. The company also has 140 patents to protect its intellectual property. More importantly, however, the move toward remote work in the last two years has put a high premium on networking and network security – a move that has benefited Absolute. The company’s revenues started taking off in the past year, and in the most recent quarter, Q3 of fiscal year 2022 (the quarter ending March 31), the company reported $52 million at the top line, up 69% year-over-year. The high revenue was supported by an 18% acceleration in annual recurring revenue, which broke above $200 million in the quarter. Quarterly cash from operations grew by $7.3 million to reach a company record of $17 million. Also of note to investors, the company declared a dividend of 8 cents Canadian per common share for the quarter. At a rate of 6 cents US, the dividend annualizes to 24 cents and gives a yield of 3.3%. Absolute has maintained its dividend for the past 9 years. Despite these positive drivers, Absolute’s shares are down 51% over the past 12 months. That has not, however, dissuaded Canaccord's 5-star analyst Michael Walkley from take a bullish view of the stock. “We believe Absolute has a unique technology moat – an embedded software in the firmware of 500M+ PCs by OEM partners – and the ability to drive towards 20%+ long-term growth in a large and growing TAM, while maintaining its rule of 40 metrics. Further, enterprise / government computers typically run an average of 10+ security apps, which Absolute’s resilience offering can ensure are correctly installed and working properly... management is executing well and the share price represents a very attractive entry point. We believe patient long-term investors are likely to be rewarded,"" Walkley opined. These bullish comments support Walkley’s Buy rating on ABST shares, and his $17 price target implies an upside of ~134% for the coming year. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) Walkley may be particularly bullish here, but he is not the only analyst positive on Absolute Software. The stock’s 4 recent reviews break down to 3 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus view, and the $13.56 average price target suggests an 87% one-year upside from the current trading price of $7.25. (See ABST stock forecast on TipRanks) National Instruments (NATI) Now we’ll turn to National Instruments, a Texas-based company that offers a wide range of tech products, including automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. The company’s products give solutions for a series of tech-related issues, including prototype design and validation, and factory device testing. National Instrument’s product line has found applications as varied as semiconductors and electronics to transportation to aerospace and defense. National Instruments has been making strong moves to expand its footprint in recent months. This past March, the company completed its purchase, for an undisclosed amount, of the Electronic Vehicle segment of the German firm Heinzinger GmbH. Heinzinger is a leader in Europe’s high-current and high-voltage power systems. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash and credit. In another acquisition, this May, National Instruments closed its transaction with Kratzer Automation AG. Kratzer provides customer solutions in the EV market, and this acquisition further expands NI’s footprint in the EV market, a growing segment in modern manufacturing. In the first quarter of the year, NI reported 1Q22 revenue of $385 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, but below the $402 million estimates. Product orders were up in the quarter, increasing by 27% over the year-ago period. The company reported positive non-GAAP diluted earnings of 41 cents per share, just missing the 43-cent forecast – but increasing 28% from the same metric in 1Q21. NI ended the first quarter with $143 million in cash on hand. This was more than enough to support a dividend of 28 cents per common share. At current share pricing, this dividend yields 3.5%. Even though this stock is feeling pressure right now (down 25% year-to-date), Morgan Stanley's Meta Marshall remains optimistic. The analyst writes, “While we acknowledge a relatively disappointing Q1 result for NATI on greater than expected supply chain challenges / Russia exposure, we view dip as a buying opportunity for the name given operating leverage potential and growing exposures to key megatrends. We remain cognizant that achievement of price target will require NATI to move past supply chain issues and investors gaining greater confidence in ability to measure impact, but think lead times remain competitive (7-8 weeks vs. competitors at 14-16 weeks for some areas)” In line with this bullish outlook, Marshall rates NATI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $44 price target that indicates room for 39% growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Marshall’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with 4 recent stock reviews, including 3 Buys against 1 Hold, and a Strong Buy consensus rating. NATI is trading for $31.65 and its $46.50 average target suggests ~47% upside from that level.

5/12/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a long few weeks since the crypto crowd was partying in Miami. Most Read from Bloomberg Don’t Bother Paying Off Student Loan Debt Right Now, Advisers Say Nike Escalates StockX Feud, Says Site Is Selling Fake Shoes Stocks Slide as US Curve Flattens After Hot CPI: Markets Wrap Highest Inflation in America Is Punishing a Texas Town and Its Residents TerraUSD Stablecoin Plunges as Crypto Market Awaits Rescue Coinbase Global Inc. founder Brian Armstrong had a personal fortune of $13.7 billion as recently as November and about $8 billion at the end of March. That’s now just $2.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after a selloff in digital currencies from Bitcoin to Ether triggered a precipitous decline in the market value of Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. The firm’s shares have tumbled 84% since their first day of trading in April 2021, closing Wednesday at $53.72 after the company warned that trading volume and monthly transacting users were expected to be lower in the second quarter than in the first. It’s raised questions about Coinbase’s ability to withstand the sharp decline in crypto prices, forcing Armstrong to take to Twitter to defend the company. There is “no risk of bankruptcy” even amid a “black swan” event and users’ funds are safe, said Armstrong, the firm’s chief executive officer. Then there’s Michael Novogratz. The CEO of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital has seen his fortune plummet to $2.5 billion, from $8.5 billion in early November. He’s been a champion of TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that’s now at risk of a complete collapse amid a breakdown in the price of a crypto token in the same ecosystem, Luna. “I’m probably the only guy in the world that’s got both a Bitcoin tattoo and a Luna tattoo,” Novogratz said at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on April 6. Billionaire crypto fortunes that swelled over the last two years are disappearing after a selloff that began with tech stocks spilled over into digital money. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, and Ether have both fallen more than 50% since their record highs late last year. While almost all crypto holders have suffered wealth declines, some of the biggest and most visible losses are concentrated among founders of exchanges, where traders buy and sell digital currencies. At least on paper, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of closely held Binance, has lost an even larger fortune than Armstrong or Novogratz. He debuted on the Bloomberg wealth index in January with a net worth of $96 billion, one of the world’s largest. By Wednesday that had shrunk to $11.6 billion, using the average enterprise value to sales multiples of Coinbase and Canadian crypto firm Voyager Digital as a basis for the calculations. Crypto exchanges in the US appear to be suffering more of a downturn than their global competitors. Trading volumes at Coinbase have steadily fallen since the beginning of the year, while more internationally focused Binance saw an uptick in volume last month. Binance’s US-focused business, by comparison, experienced even steeper declines than Coinbase’s. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of rival crypto exchange Gemini, have each lost about $2.2 billion -- or roughly 40% -- of their wealth this year. The fortune of Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has fallen by half since the end of March to about $11.3 billion. Armstrong isn’t the only Coinbase billionaire losing money. Co-founder Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, is currently worth $1.1 billion, down more than 60% this year. Armstrong owns 16% of Coinbase and controls 59.5% of its voting shares, according to the company’s 2022 proxy statement, while Ehrsam has a 4.5% stake and controls 26% of its voting stock. Coinbase’s bonds have also plunged, recently trading in line with some of the riskiest junk-rated notes. (Updates valuations throughout.)

5/12/2022,"The S&P 500 is down 16% so far in 2022. While investor sentiment is far from bullish these days, Goldman Sachs sees opportunity in one specific group of companies: those that return cash to investors on a regular basis. “We continue to recommend investors own stocks with high dividend yield and growth,” Goldman’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin writes in a note to clients. Kostin says strong corporate earnings growth means companies can hike their payouts going forward. And better yet, the market has not priced in that potential. “The futures market is expecting S&P 500 dividend growth to be negative in 2023 and 2024,” Kostin says. “Looking ahead, our forecast implies 6.7% CAGR dividend growth over the next ten years, significantly above market pricing of 0.4%.” Kostin’s team has identified several companies that fit this investment theme. Here’s a look at three of them. *Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Gilead Sciences is already one of the more generous dividend-payers from the healthcare sector, currently offering an annual dividend yield of 4.8%. But Goldman sees bigger payouts on the horizon. The financial juggernaut predicts that by 2023, Gilead’s dividend per share divided by its current price will lead to a yield of 5%. There’s good reason to be optimistic about this biopharmaceutical company. In Q1, Gilead’s revenue grew 3% year over year to $6.6 billion while adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.12. It also has a solid cash position of almost $7 billion as of Mar. 31. Gilead started paying dividends in 2015 with a quarterly payout of 43 cents per share. Today, the company pays 73 cents per share — so the amount has grown by almost 70%. The past few years haven’t been kind to brick-and-mortar stores. So who would have guessed that electronics retailer Best Buy — with more than 1,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada — would be able to deliver the dividend growth that it has of late? In 2021, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 27% to 70 cents per share. Earlier this year, management announced another 26% quarterly payout increase to 88 cents per share. While many retailers are still struggling, Best Buy has found its momentum. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, the company delivered record revenue and profitability, highlighted by 10.4% same-store sales growth. The stock currently yields 4.1%. Goldman sees Best Buy continuing its dividend growth streak and offering a yield (based on the current price) of 4.3% in 2023. With oil and gas prices shooting through the roof, energy stocks have become some of the healthiest dividend payers in the market. Devon Energy, for instance, recently hiked its quarterly payout by 27% to a record high of $1.27 per share, giving the stock a mouth-watering annual yield of 7.6%. The board also increased the company’s share repurchase authorization by 25% to $2 billion. In Q1, Devon generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the quarter, marking an 18% increase year over year. Goldman expects prosperity to persist for the oil and gas producer, projecting a dividend yield of 7.8% in 2023 based on the current stock price. That said, it’s important to note that Devon’s dividend consists of a fixed quarterly payout and a variable dividend that includes up to 50% of excess free cash flow.

5/12/2022,"Crypto diehards suffered a brutal month, and there are few bigger backers than the Bitcoin whale himself, Michael Saylor. His software company, MicroStrategy, has effectively become little more than a levered play on rising Bitcoin adoption rates through events like Fidelity’s 401(k) launch, a “shot heard round the world,” according to Saylor this month. Since his titular core business is unable to produce enough cash to satisfy his appetite for the cryptocurrency, the CEO has borrowed heavily to finance his buy-and-hold strategy. Lately that included the first-ever Bitcoin-backed term loan for $205 million, which resulted in 19,466 Bitcoin from its own holdings set aside to meet the minimum requirement of $410 million security. With leverage, however, comes the risk of margin calls. So when news emerged earlier this month that it might be forced to post further collateral if the price drops below $21,000, investors were spooked, fearing a whale might be forced to liquidate part of his holdings. Saylor, after all, has made it crystal clear his company is not the equivalent of a crypto prop desk earning trading income from short-term fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price that could prove to be a systemic risk for the crypto community. “[MicroStrategy] has 115,109 Bitcoin that it can pledge,” he tweeted, referring to his Q1 presentation and assuring fellow HODL (“hold on for dear life”) believers on Tuesday there were other ways of meeting obligations without a fire sale. Thanks to reserves of 129,218 Bitcoin currently worth $2.9 billion on its balance sheet and roughly $4.1 billion at the going market price, MicroStrategy is the largest public holder of the cryptocurrency. Saylor is positioning his company to investors as little more than an exchange-traded fund, with two key differences. “Our goal will be to offer them the same Bitcoin holding but without charging that [management] fee, and to use intelligent leverage from time to time when the opportunity presents itself,” Saylor told investors last week. “If you think it would be a reasonable idea to borrow money at 1.8% interest to buy Bitcoin, then MicroStrategy looks like a rational company to invest in.” Over the past month, however, the father of all cryptocurrencies has seen a quarter of its value wiped out thanks to an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve raising demand for its fiat rival.
