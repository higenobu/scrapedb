12/29/2021,"“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” So opens Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities. Set in London and Paris during the late 1700s and the lead-up to the French Revolution, the novel was a warning about what happens when wealth funnels upwards while the masses stagnate. Nowhere do the best and worst of times collide with more geopolitical force than in Africa. African writers swept the board for literature awards from the Nobel to the Booker, while seven out of eight children in the continent’s sub-Saharan region are unable to read by the age of 10. This year the continent was home to the slowest internet speeds on the planet, as African judges granted the world’s first patent given to a robot inventor. About 50 million Africans are expected to fall into extreme poverty in 2021, when the continent’s richest billionaires have seen their wealth increase by a fifth.  Globalisation has polarised societies, an effect that has been supercharged during the pandemic. This pattern is not unusual in other nations, but to apply it to Africa suggests that it possesses a unity beyond the mere geographic. African nations have huddled together in the face of climate and Covid storms – with good reason. Instead of rewarding African scientists for identifying the threat of Omicron, the west imposed travel bans on the continent. The suspicion is that had the Sars-CoV-2 virus been found in Africa, it would have been cut off. The pandemic has made visible a world being shaped to Africa’s disadvantage. Low vaccination rates are a reason for the emergence of dangerous coronavirus variants, so why let just 8% of 1.3 billion Africans be fully vaccinated? The industrialised world won’t issue Africa a vaccine patent waiver, and foreign aid is just 2% of the continent’s GDP. So African nations can’t manufacture their own cheap medicines and lack the foreign exchange to cushion distribution costs. Despite having played a negligible role in creating the climate crisis, African countries already find themselves paying a heavy price for it. The EU plans to introduce greenhouse gas taxes on imports that will pull a carbon curtain across the Mediterranean. Carlos Lopes of the University of Cape Town says African train projects built by Chinese companies are not using the low-carbon technology rolled out at home. The performance of Africa has been described as the worst economic tragedy of the 20th century. Commonplace explanations don’t bear much scrutiny. Statistics can show that the closer a country is to the equator, the poorer it is. Yet no one would argue that slow growth caused a country to get closer to the equator. Africa has been destabilised by conflict, but that has, says Prof Lopes, not stopped Thailand developing an export base. One controversial argument is that too few, not too many, colonisers were the problem. The theory goes that higher levels of European settlement led to more productive institutions. However, the historian Morten Jerven, in his book The Wealth and Poverty of African States, says that real wages stagnated in the settler economies of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, whereas in the peasant economies of Uganda and Ghana, real wages rose. Africa was not colonised because it was poor. European powers occupied and divided up the continent in the 19th century because it was rich. Africa was once a breadbasket; how did it earn a reputation for being a basket case? One reason is an extractive economic model that promotes African development via foreign direct investment, export-led growth and financial liberalisation. This web, according to Tunisian economist Fadhel Kaboub, drains nearly $2tn annually from the developing world. Today, African economies export low-value-added goods relative to their imports. Instead of growing their own food to feed their people, countries import foodstuffs. While some nations export crude hydrocarbons, many more import refined petrochemicals such as gasoline. The right to bring in these essentials is handed over to a politically connected business “rentier” class that has a vested interest in the status quo. There is a demand for jobs, a hunger for education and a desperate need for health in Africa. Yet leaders are caught in a dilemma: if they create money to spend on social cohesion, they risk increasing food, energy and capital goods imports, and increasing their trade deficit. That puts downward pressure on the national currency. A weak exchange rate means that imports of basic necessities will be more expensive. History is littered with examples of violent revolutions preceded by price spikes. Economic orthodoxy has no answer. Its textbooks would have African governments instructing central banks to borrow US dollars to prop up the local currency and prioritising foreign creditors with austerity. Africa’s stunted development demonstrates that poor states continue to be impoverished by being integrated into the world system through a relationship of unequal economic exchange with wealthy states. An alternative African strategy would see governments spending on public services and on increasing food and renewable energy sovereignty, while cracking down on corruption. This provides a way out of the current development trap. In their book Africa’s Last Colonial Currency, Fanny Pigeaud and Ndongo Samba Sylla suggest that, instead of importing food and burning through foreign reserves, African states should produce food at home, as land, work and knowhow are abundant. “If they financed the development of their agriculture, they wouldn’t reduce their foreign exchange reserves; on the contrary, they would save money.” State-owned enterprises and a competitive domestic private sector would help Africa evade activities demanded by the global north. As African countries become increasingly digital, data will be power in economic governance – and local entities must be its custodian, not transnational corporations. Trade agreements between countries of similar income levels are more beneficial for them compared with the World Trade Organization’s framework. The African Continental Free Trade Area, created by 54 of the 55 AU nations, is a good start. African economies would benefit by producing green industrial goods that rich countries take for granted, but whose mass production has not reached the continent. It would be in Europe’s interest to help – as more Africans would be able to find jobs at home, pressure to migrate would ease. Africa is caught between history and geography. Understanding how and why it got to where it is today will help the continent move forward in the future.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Africa rising: the continent must develop in its own way | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/28/the-guardian-view-on-africa-rising-the-continent-must-develop-in-its-own-way
12/29/2021,"A police officer took selfies at a murder scene where a teenager had been stabbed to death, and sent “appalling” racist, homophobic and offensive images via WhatsApp, the Guardian has learned. PC Ryan Connolly from the Merseyside force committed a litany of disciplinary offences over a six-year period while a serving officer, a tribunal has decided.  While on duty, he also took photos on his mobile phone of people in mental health crisis, in hospitals, who had been sectioned under police powers. His case echoes that of the two Metropolitan police officers who used their mobile phones to take pictures at the scene where two sisters lay murdered. The pair were convicted in court and sacked in a case that rocked policing. Details of Connolly’s wrongdoing have been confirmed by Merseyside police after inquiries by the Guardian. Merseyside police said Connolly’s actions had undermined public confidence in policing, and were an “insult” to the majority of officers who served the public with distinction. The discipline tribunal found Connolly guilty of gross misconduct. He had resigned before the November hearing, and after the tribunal he was formally sacked by Merseyside police. Merseyside police said their anti-corruption unit had caught Connolly and his “offensive behaviour”. Connolly had also had an association with a known criminal without informing his bosses. Connolly joined the force in January 2003 and had served under the police identification number 2133. According to papers lodged with the tribunal, his offending against police rules began in 2014. In an astonishing catalogue, Connolly was accused of a litany of offences, mainly involving his personal Samsung mobile phones. The discipline panel found that Connolly took photos, or had images on his phone he should not have had, and that he frequently shared them. Its findings included:  Connolly had photos and graphics that were grossly racist, and one depicting Muslim people. He also had an image of a Klu Klux Klan member.  In 2016 and again in 2017, while on duty, he took photos on his mobile of men detained by police under mental health powers, who were in hospital, and shared it via WhatsApp.  While on duty he took and sent a photo of men in hospital on at least two occasions.  He took photos of people who had been arrested.  In October 2015 he took a photo, while on duty, of someone who had slashed their wrists, and shared it via WhatsApp.  He took a photo of a fellow officer’s rear and shared it via WhatsApp.  In 2016 he sent a graphic homophobic message.  He took photos in 2018 of himself at a murder scene where he had been assigned to guard the cordon after a teenager had been stabbed to death.  He took photos of crime victims, including someone missing from home, and shared details about a woman who went to police for help alleging she had suffered domestic violence.  Other images mocked disabled people. He was cleared of trying to get cannabis while a serving officer. When interviewed by detectives from professional standards, Connolly made no comment. Before the discipline hearing he provided a written statement, saying he did not know why offensive images were on his phone. Merseyside police’s deputy chief constable, Ian Critchley, said: “Connolly had taken photographs of vulnerable people on his personal phone whilst on duty … This breached the duty of confidence; lacked honesty and integrity and through his discreditable conduct he has undermined public confidence. “Between 2015 and 2018 Connolly stored images on his personal phone that were racist, homophobic and severely offensive and on some occasions had shared those images. “Connolly maintained contact with a known criminal and did not disclose the relationship… … as a result, by socialising and associating with the criminal, brought the service into disrepute.” Critchley added: “An investigation by our anti-corruption unit uncovered the fact that Connolly had been using his own phone to take photographs of vulnerable people whilst on duty and that the phone also contained appalling homophobic, racist and offensive images.” He added: “The behaviour of this officer is deplorable and serves to undermine the public’s confidence and trust in the police. “Our officers carry out exceptionally brave selfless acts every single day, protecting the most vulnerable people in our communities, yet here we see the despicable acts of a very selfish individual who has no place in our police service.” Police said the pictures from the murder scene only showed Connolly and did not show the teenage murder victim. Merseyside police say they will enhance their vetting procedures following the case. Connolly, in a written statement to the tribunal, said he could not recall the offensive images, after they were shown to him during interview by detectives, or how they came to be on his phone. He added: “I do have the insight to know that the images should not have been in my possession. “This has been a learning experience for me to be more mindful of the WhatsApp groups that I am in and being more aware [of the] material that is sent to me.” Connolly’s phone were seized in February 2020 by detectives from Merseyside’s anti-corruption unit. He resigned before the discipline tribunal in November, which ruled he would have been sacked if still a serving officer. He is barred for life from rejoining the service.

12/29/2021,"Your informative obituary of Archbishop Desmond Tutu (26 December) missed an important dimension – his warnings on the need to save the planet. In March 2004, he delivered a lecture entitled God’s Word and World Politics at the United Nations as part of Kofi Annan’s public lecture series on cutting-edge topics in the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences and the arts. The archbishop said: “Ecological concerns are a deeply religious, spiritual matter. To pollute the environment, to be responsible for a disastrous warming, is not just wrong and should be a criminal offence; it is certainly morally wrong. It is a sin.”Prof Abiodun WilliamsTufts University   The humanity of Desmond Tutu was a candle of hope in a darkening world. His moral reach was global. His warnings about the future of humankind on the planet remain as true today as when he summarised his thoughts in a Guardian article (This fatal complacency, 5 May 2007). The focus then was on climate disruption; 14 years later, we have added the weight of a 1.5 billion population increase, the actions of failing states and tyrannical governments, and selfish international failure to help our neighbours during this present coronavirus pandemic.Bob PikeSaint-Cyr-sur-Loire, France  Your obituary focused, understandably, on Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s contribution to peace and reconciliation in South Africa. In the last 15 years of his life, however, he also made a huge contribution to the process of peace elsewhere in the world through his adopted philosophy of Ubuntu, whereby we live through our shared humanity with others. In the UK, the work of the Tutu Foundation supported the bringing together of young people, especially Black young people in deprived areas, to confront some of the difficulties arising from the over-policing of minority communities through, for example, the disproportionate use of stop and search. It is too early to say what the long-term effects of this work might be, but early signs are encouraging in replacing fear and distrust with openness and engagement as equals.Prof Gary CraigYork  I was disappointed that your obituary of Desmond Tutu made no reference to his support for Palestine, and his powerful statement in 2014 when he made a direct comparison between the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and the apartheid regime in South Africa against which he had fought so hard. Archbishop Tutu was a remarkable and principled man and an inspiration to many. His fight against apartheid and racism was not just confined to one country; he challenged it wherever it occurred.Ann KramerHastings, East Sussex  Among all the stories of Desmond Tutu, my favourite is of two friends who visited Cape Town some years ago and attended a service in the cathedral. On leaving, they were greeted by him and asked where they came from. “Worcester,” came the reply. “Ah yes, its lovely cathedral…” “Well, actually, we are Methodists.” Whereupon he placed his arms round their shoulders and pronounced, “I forgive you, my children”, before giving vent to that well-known chuckle.Elizabeth DunnettMalvern, Worcestershire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/29/2021,"However moved I am by Aditya Chakrabortty’s article about Giovanni Rose, a prize-winning young black poet (The teenager’s poem that reveals the cruel reality of life in modern Britain, 23 December), I can only feel a limited sense of optimism for his future. I fear that he will continue to feel the effects of institutional racism throughout his life. If this were not so, then why have the injustices suffered by members of the Windrush generation still not been properly addressed? Over 50 years ago, another young black teenager wrote a poem. She was spirited and rebellious. Little wonder. As a pupil in a school for “educationally subnormal” pupils, she was feeling the full weight of a racist judgment that had already blighted her life. I was her teacher whom she accused of treating her harshly “just because I’m black”.  To make amends for her outburst, she wrote a poem for me in her jotter. I will regret for ever that I failed to keep this amazing, moving and well-written cry for help. I resigned shortly afterwards in search of a “better career”, leaving her behind in a totally unsuitable environment. How I wish that she could have had the inclusive support of a school like Giovanni’s. But supportive schools are not enough. I would love to meet her now to talk about how our lives have gone. We are not that far apart in age. However, I fear that her life will not have passed as easily as mine. I could not have written a poem like that. But I was white and privileged.

12/29/2021,"I had a look at the 1967 edition of Wisden on Tuesday morning, after hearing the news of England’s Ashes defeat. Its report of the 1965-66 England tour of Australia shows that the team arrived in Australia in late October and played 10 warm-up matches, including five four-day state games, before the first Test started on 10 December. The team was not an outstanding one, but it was competitive in the series, which was drawn one-all. By contrast, the current England team was scheduled to play just two warm-up matches against scratch teams, both of which were rained off. I am sure there are other systemic causes of England’s poor performance, but the idea that we can fly a team a diagonal of the Earth away from their own fields and expect them to acclimatise within a few days to become competitive with a home team is surely fanciful.Richard WilliamsHove, East Sussex   On hearing the overnight news from the Melbourne Test, I felt sure I already knew 11 of the “15 words associated with horror” in your Wordsearch in the print edition (G2, 28 December).Andrew HolderSouth Wonston, Hampshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/29/2021,"Iknow we are almost there when we spot the lone yellow house on the left hand side of the rural and isolated Whanganui River Road, near the central North Island. The quiet thoroughfare winds its way alongside native bush and through valleys that have been carved out by the longest navigable river in Aotearoa. Even as a kid, I knew the little yellow house meant we were just a few bends away from reaching my favourite place in the world, Koriniti Marae. Marae are sacred communal meeting grounds for the indigenous Māori peoples of Aotearoa – they provide for everything from sleeping and eating to learning. They are the basis of traditional Māori community life, and typically feature one or more wharenui, or meeting houses, usually painted white and deep red and sometimes carved with Māori art. While many marae are no longer the bustling communities they were pre-colonisation, they continue to serve as pillars of Māori cultural identity today.  If you blinked, you would probably miss the turn off to my marae just across from Auntie Lois’s cottage on the hill. Whenever the world gets too loud, I come here. As you drive down the hill, there is a clearing of land revealing Koriniti Marae, a small picturesque settlement that sits on the banks of the river. It has three wharenui, a large hall and kitchen, a church, a Māori language learning nest for children and a few houses that are still occupied. Ever since I was a baby, my grandmother Wahi would bring me on the one-hour journey here from the city. This place remains raw, still and serene, made all the more grounding by the sound of the powerful river that flows around the base of the marae. New Zealand boasts the most beautiful native birds, and I am kept company here by a flock of pīwaiwaka (fantails), which dance around me every step that I take. An old friend once told me the birds were doing that because we were loosening up the earth as we walked, making it easier for them to find bugs to eat. But this is a magical place, and I knew they were guardians welcoming me home. For my people of the tribes of Whanganui, the river is our ancestor. She is formidable and her current is strong, so we wouldn’t swim down here as children. From the water, huge mountains rise sharply up and stretch into the sky. They are covered in thick dark green trees that roll back into the distance. I am comforted by the familiar shape of these jagged ranges – the backdrop of the marae – that has looked the same for longer than I know. But change isn’t always bad. Last Christmas, the rocks by the river moved so much that they blocked part of the river from the current, making it calm enough to swim in. I remember how it felt diving in for the first time in years. My mind immediately went to my grandmother Wahi, who had sadly died a month earlier. Her body rests at the urupā or marae cemetery across from Auntie Lois’s house. I feel her presence when I am in the water and I know I can connect with her under here. A big gasp of breath on my way up and the earthy smell of silt and freshwater covers me. A bittersweet moment as I return to the now. We spend our days basking in the place our ancestors once walked. This is home. And even when there is no one here, I am not alone. What’s your favourite wild place?

12/29/2021,"Chris Silverwood has refused to entertain debate about his position as England’s multi-format head coach, insisting his sole focus after his side’s humiliating thrashing in the third Test in Melbourne is on avoiding an Ashes whitewash. “Worrying about myself is at the bottom of the list to be honest,” Silverwood said. “What we have to do is look forward to the next two Tests, stay positive if we can and make sure we are there, we compete and we take something from this tour. I do feel like I am capable of leading this team to winning things and that’s what I’m going to stay focused on and that’s all I can do.”  England’s previous head coach, Trevor Bayliss, stood down in 2019 with this series in mind, describing the away Ashes as “our holy grail” for which “you are better off making changes well in advance and giving those guys time to bed themselves in”. After Silverwood’s appointment that October the England director of cricket, Ashley Giles, said he particularly impressed in his interview with “some detailed thoughts on what it will take to win the Ashes in Australia”. England have lost the first three Tests by nine wickets, 275 runs, and an innings and 14 runs respectively. “There are some positives,” Silverwood said after England had been skittled for 68, their lowest total in Australia since 1904, to confirm the hosts’ victory in the series. “We had the problem [of positive Covid tests in the camp on Monday] but they went out and competed. The bowlers showed a lot of spirit, guts and determination. I thought the attitude and effort the guys showed yesterday was excellent so there is a lot of fight and spirit in that dressing room. Try to harness that. “I think at this moment in time the sole focus is how do I get the best out of these players to make sure we compete for the next two Tests? I don’t want to be going back having lost 5-0. I want to win games over here.” Silverwood acknowledged that there are structural issues, potentially including an unhealthy focus on white-ball cricket, which have held England back. “There’s certainly things that we have got to look at and we will look at, at the end of this tour,” he said. “But I just don’t think those conversations are for right now. I think we’ve got to deal with what’s in front of us because we’ve got two Test matches coming up – then I think the debrief will happen.” Australia’s superiority has been so emphatic that the position of Joe Root as England captain has also been thrown into doubt, despite him ending 2021 with 1,708 Test runs, enough for third on the all-time list. “I think he is a fine young man and a great human being,” Silverwood said. “The year he has had with the bat shows that he is a class act. But again I don’t think it’s time to be discussing things like that. What we really have to be concentrating on is doing what we came here to do, which is to compete. We have two Test matches left so we have to put our best foot forward and that has to be the focus.”",Sport/Sport,"Worrying about myself is bottom of list, says Silverwood after Ashes humbling",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/worrying-about-myself-is-bottom-of-list-says-silverwood-after-ashes-humbling
12/29/2021,"On the day five teenage girls from a Detroit suburb recorded a song called Please Mr Postman in August 1961, 18-year-old Wanda Young was the only one old enough to have graduated from high school. Only after the session was over were they given a name: the Marvelettes. The man who named the group was Berry Gordy Jr, then in the process of establishing his Motown label and still short of hit records. So striking was the song, originally roughed out by one of the girls and completed by Motown’s cadre of young staff writers and arrangers, that it was released before the month was out.  Within weeks it had become a million-seller and the first of the fledgling label’s records to hit No 1 on the US pop charts. The 16-year-old Gladys Horton had contributed the lead vocal to that initial hit, but it was Young, who has died aged 78, who would take over for many of their subsequent successes, starting with Don’t Mess With Bill, before the hits dried up towards the end of the 1960s and the group gradually disintegrated. Young’s life was thereafter defined mostly by tragedy. Her marriage in 1963 to Bobby Rogers, a member of the Miracles, a fellow Motown group, fell apart after she had witnessed the murder of her sister. Her brother was injured in another shooting incident. She had suffered years of mental problems and addictions by the time the youngest of her children, a daughter, was shot and killed in 2015. She was born in Inkster, then a semi-rural black suburb built for workers in Detroit’s car factories. Her first ambition was to become a nurse. Of the five embryonic Marvelettes who gathered for their first recording session, Young had been the last to join, replacing Georgia Dobbins, who had come up with the initial idea for the hit song but left before the recording, citing parental disapproval. The group struggled to follow up that initial breakthrough and there would be two early departures, Juanita Cowart, who detested touring, and Georgeanna Tillman, who suffered health problems. In 1964 they were offered the choice of two songs by Motown’s in-house writing teams. The one they rejected was the winsome Where Did Our Love Go?, which would start the Supremes’ climb to superstardom. The song the Marvelettes preferred, the more obviously danceable Too Many Fish in the Sea, gave them only a medium-sized hit. Their fortunes revived in 1966 when Smokey Robinson, the lead singer and chief songwriter of the Miracles, took a particular liking to Young’s voice and wrote the slinky, finger-snapping Don’t Mess With Bill with her delivery in mind. A Top 10 hit, it was followed with almost equal success by The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game and My Baby Must Be a Magician, which would mark the Marvelettes’ final visit to the Top 20. Perhaps Young’s finest performance came in 1967 on When You’re Young and in Love, a Van McCoy song originally recorded by Ruby and the Romantics. Given a sweepingly romantic arrangement to which Young’s ardent tones added a charming poignancy, the Marvelettes’ version failed to become a big hit but lodged itself firmly in the hearts of soul fans, particularly in the UK. Not as receptive as the Supremes to attempts to polish their act for a wider audience, the group had drifted apart when Robinson offered to produce a solo album for Young in 1970. Lacking faith in the appeal of her name, the label decided to revive the collective identity and released it as The Return of the Marvelettes, despite no other members of the group having taken part in the recording. It was not a success. Young already had an 18-month-old daughter, Meta, when she married Rogers in 1963. They had two children together, a son and a daughter, Robert and Bobbae. During one of her husband’s absences on tour, she went back to Inkster to visit her sister. The two women left the house to go shopping, her sister having put on a distinctive wig left at her house by a friend. While out, they were spotted from across the street by a spurned boyfriend of the wig’s owner. Mistaking the sister’s identity, he pulled a gun and shot her in the head. She died in Young’s arms. Thereafter Young fell into despair, addiction and mental illness. Her marriage ended in 1975, with Rogers granted custody of their children. In 1982 she had a fourth child, a daughter called Miracle, who was brought up by an aunt and was murdered in a double shooting in Inkster in 2015. In 1989 Young was among a group of former Motown acts invited by the British producer Ian Levine to take part in recordings for his new Motorcity label. In the words of one witness who had known her during the good times, she arrived at the studio in Detroit looking “a decrepit mess”. Overnight she was groomed, coached and encouraged by Kim Weston – another Motown hitmaker – until she was capable of giving a performance alongside Horton, whose own post-Marvelettes life had included bringing up a disabled child. But while Horton was keen to revive her career and fought lengthy legal battles to be allowed to use the group’s name, which had fallen into the hands of an entrepreneur, Young quickly returned to obscurity. Young is survived by Meta, Robert and Bobbae, seven grandchildren, a great-grandson, four sisters and four brothers.

12/29/2021,"My friend John Toye, who has died aged 79, was director of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex (1987-97) and of the Centre for Study of African Economies at Oxford (2000–03). However, “development economist” does not properly describe him: he was also a historian, political scientist and sociologist. When I first met him in the early 1980s, I was looking for someone who could help me understand the World Bank’s attempt, during those years of global depression, to impose free-market policies on developing countries. My proposal of partnership luckily was accepted, and eventually emerged as Aid and Power (1991), written by John and myself, and Jane Harrigan, and provided the basis for a 40-year friendship.  The 1980s were a turning-point for John, which strongly influenced much of his later work. In his book Dilemmas of Development (1987), he characterised the approach of influential free-market advocates of the time as “first turn liberty against equality and fraternity, then overthrow liberty itself”: a sombre prophecy which exactly describes not only the behaviour of many rightwing regimes in the 1980s and 90s but also the governments of modern-day India, Nigeria and Brazil, and most notoriously the behaviour of the Trump administration in the US. John was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, the son of Jack, an engineer, and Adele (nee Francis), a teacher. He went to Christ’s college, Finchley, in north London, then read history at Cambridge, achieving a starred first in his final year. He was a Treasury civil servant between 1965 and 1968, and from then on a development specialist, at Cambridge (1972-80), Swansea (1982-87) and then Sussex. His last published work, The Counterrevolution in Development Economics, a chapter in the book The Political Economy of Development Economics: A Historical Perspective (2018), edited by Michele Alacevich and Mauro Boianovsky. This is a backward look to the themes explored in Dilemmas of Development and describes the damage that economists of the last three decades have done to the concept of development economics. In our judgment George Akerlof’s 1970 idea of market failure can and has been used by many economists, of whom Akerlof and Nicholas Stern are outstanding examples, to explain why public policies still need to be more interventionist in developing than in industrialised countries. John was not only an outstanding development expert, but also a brilliantly kind, generous and versatile person. His support for me extended from identifying flaws in my economic models to showing me how to improvise a bedtime story for my children when they were little. He is survived by his wife, Janet (nee Reason), whom he married in 1967, and their children, Eleanor and Richard.",News/Business,John Toye obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/28/john-toye-obituary
12/29/2021,"Covid cases in the UK have reached a record high, with 129,471 new cases reported on Tuesday in England and Wales, as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a winter wave of infections. While official data was not provided for Scotland and Northern Ireland, a record 117,093 cases – infections that are picked up through testing – were reported for England, up from a previous high of 113,628 on Christmas Day.  Despite the incomplete nature of the data, the total number of cases reported on Tuesday for England and Wales is higher than the previous record for the entire UK. The UK Health Security Agency reported 17,269 additional confirmed cases of Omicron across England and Northern Ireland, with the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to date at 177,201 – although such figures are a significant underestimate. UKHSA said Wales had not reported Omicron figures due to Christmas and bank holidays, while Scotland was only giving the total number of Covid cases for all variants combined in daily reports, although it will separate out the Omicron figures on a weekly basis. Data from NHS England released on Tuesday revealed that the number of patients in hospital had risen by more than 1,000 in the space of a day, with 9,546 beds occupied by people with Covid on Tuesday, compared with 8,474 the day before – although some trusts, thought to have about 220 Covid patients in total based on recent submissions, did not report their figures for Monday. Tuesday’s figure is a 38% increase on that reported on 21 December and the highest since 3 March, although still far below the peak last winter of more than 34,000. On Monday Downing Street confirmed that no new coronavirus restrictions would be introduced in England before the new year. In other nations in the UK, a raft of measures are in place, including the closure of nightclubs in Wales, and limiting socialising in Scotland to groups of up to three households. Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, cautioned that the latest reported daily case figures do not take into account changes in testing behaviour over the festive period, or delays in the processing of tests. Clarke added that while some people in hospital with Covid will have been admitted for a different reason, the situation should not be dismissed as insignificant. “These are vulnerable people whose condition is serious enough to require them to be in hospital over Christmas,” he said. “There is no condition I know of that cannot be made worse by Covid-19.”",News/World news,"UK sets new record of more than 129,000 Covid cases in a day",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/uk-new-record-daily-covid-cases
12/29/2021,"An Australian national living in Israel has said he is subject to an 8,000-year travel ban unless he pays an outstanding £1.8m in child support payments. Noam Huppert, a 44-year-old analytical chemist working for a pharmaceutical company, is not allowed to leave Israel until 31 December 9999 owing to a 2013 “stay of exit” order handed down after a family court case was brought by his ex-wife, according to news.com.au.  The court ruled Huppert must pay 5,000 shekels (£1,200) a month for each of his two children until they turn 18. It was not immediately clear whether Huppert has made any payments to date, or whether he must pay the entire sum in advance in order to lift the stay-of-exit order. It appears the year 9999 was arbitrarily set because it was the highest possible date allowed by the online system. The Guardian has contacted Huppert for more information. Huppert’s former spouse, an Israeli national, moved back to the country in 2011, when their children were aged three months and five years old. He followed in 2012, and says he has not been able to leave for any reason – including work – in the eight years since the court ruling. “Since 2013, I am locked in Israel,” Huppert told news.com.au, adding that he was one of many foreign nationals “persecuted by the Israeli ‘justice’ system only because they were married to Israeli women” and that he was speaking out “to help others who may suffer this literally life-threatening experience”. Israeli family law has been frequently criticised for discriminating against women. In 2018, the finance ministry found that 43% of divorced fathers refused to pay any child support to their ex-spouse, and single mothers who rely on the state for funds because the fathers of their children do not pay were hit by funding cuts this summer thanks to budget disputes. A 2017 supreme court ruling, however, decided that fathers should no longer be solely responsible for alimony, particularly in cases where their ex-wives earn more money than they do. “Truth be told, the core of family law in Israel – the laws of marriage and divorce – are characterised by a lack of equality between men and women,” Judge Noam Solberg said at the time. “Despite this, there is no justification for unequal division of child support payments.” In its travel advice for Israel, the US state department includes a warning to citizens that Israel’s civil and religious courts “actively exercise their authority to bar certain individuals, including non-residents, from leaving the country until debts or other legal claims against them are resolved”.",News/World news,"Australian man ‘cannot leave Israel for 8,000 years’ over unpaid child support",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/australian-man-cannot-leave-israel-for-8000-years-over-unpaid-child-support
12/29/2021,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions.  It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation. In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”",News/World news,Rights group’s closure is part of rapid dismantling of Russian civil society,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/international-memorial-rights-group-closure-russia-analysis
