3/18/2022,"Constable Zachary Rolfe’s father spoke to a witness about their evidence and stared at them in an intimidating manner during his son’s trial for murder, counsel for the Department of Public Prosecutions claimed during Rolfe’s trial. The court did not consider or make any finding as to whether the alleged incident occurred and no explanation from Rolfe’s father was sought, but he later denied the allegation. Instead, Justice John Burns issued a general warning to all people present at the court about the importance of not speaking to witnesses. Rolfe, 30, was on trial for the murder of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker, who died in November 2019 after he was shot three times by Rolfe during an attempted arrest. He was found not guilty of murder and two alternative charges on 11 March. Rolfe’s father Richard, who was not involved in the proceedings, was a constant presence in the public gallery throughout the five-week trial. On 1 March, Phillip Strickland for DPP told the court that he had been instructed that Richard Rolfe had spoken to Det Sgt Andrew Barram in the toilets of the court on 1 March. Details about the allegations can now be reported after Judge John Burns lifted a suppression order on all matters heard in the Northern Territory Supreme Court outside the presence of the jury on 1 March. After a short break during that day’s hearing, Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC told Burns he had been instructed that Barram had been in the toilet when he was spoken to by Richard Rolfe. “He was spoken to by the accused’s father, who commented on his evidence. And stared at him, in what was described as an intimidating manner. “I’d simply ask your Honour to warn everyone in court, that they ought not to speak to any witness who’s giving evidence in court. Burns agreed to give a warning to those in the court about witnesses. “Well without in any way commenting upon the rights or wrongs of the suggestion that’s been made by the Crown about the particular incident, it is of course, important that all witnesses be able to give their evidence freely, and without any suggestion of interference or intimidation. “So that all persons who are present in or around the court, should not attempt to speak to or in any other way, interact with witnesses, either before they give their evidence, or whilst they are giving their evidence, or even after they have given their evidence.” Richard Rolfe has not responded to a request for comment from Guardian Australia, but he told the NT News that he had not intimidated Barram. He said Barram entered the bathroom while he was already inside and his only interaction with him was when Barram held the door for him as he left. “I said ‘thank you’ to the bloke for holding the door open,” he said. “I didn’t know that Barram had [come] in and those were the only words.” Barram, a senior NT police officer with extensive experience in training who conducted multiple reviews of the shooting for the prosecution, was described by Rolfe’s defence barrister David Edwardson QC during the trial as “undoubtedly the most controversial witness”. The court heard that, until recently, Barram had oversight of all firearms and defensive tactics training within NT police, and reviewed and wrote the force’s training manuals. He gave evidence over three days, saying Rolfe had acted against his training as an NT police officer when he shot Walker a second and third time. Barram said that instead of firing the second and third shots, Rolfe could have used “defensive tactics … that don’t involve a weapon” to assist his colleague, then-constable Adam Eberl, in controlling Walker once they were struggling on the floor. He said that the firing of the last two shots did not “tactically give them any advantage”. Another expert witness called by Rolfe’s solicitors disagreed with Barram’s conclusion saying: “In my view once the struggle went from a standing struggle to the ground it became a far more dangerous and dire situation for constable Eberl.” “They had gone from a standing position in a fairly equal fight, to being on the ground … and constable Eberl pinning Mr Walker down,” he said. ”",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe’s father spoke to a witness about evidence during his son’s trial, prosecutor claimed",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/zachary-rolfes-father-spoke-to-a-witness-about-evidence-during-his-sons-trial-prosecutor-claimed
3/18/2022,"When Maria Borzunova and Sonia Groysman attended a briefing with their team at the independent Russian media outlet Dozhd TV earlier this month, it didn’t take place at their office in a trendy Moscow neighbourhood. Instead, the former colleagues met in Istanbul to discuss what to do next, after fleeing Russia when their channel was abruptly taken off air. “There is simply no plan at the moment. We are all just trying to figure out what to do with our lives,” said Borzunova, who was a news presenter and correspondent at Dozhd, on a rooftop terrace overlooking the Bosphorus. On 1 March, Russian internet providers shut down the website and app of Dozhd TV, the country’s only independent television channel, also known as Rain TV. The move was part of an unprecedented attack on free speech in Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Practically all independent Russian-language media outlets, including the news site Meduza and the long-established radio station Ekho Moskvy, were blocked or shut down. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have been banned and access to foreign news outlets including the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Radio Free Europe has been restricted. Russia has also passed a law that punishes spreading “fake” information about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine with up to 15 years in prison. “We really wanted to keep working even after we were taken offline,” said Groysman, who was a video reporter at Dozhd. But after the channel received “credible threats” that police were about to storm their office, Borzunova and Groysman, together with the rest of the team, started to frantically look for plane tickets to escape abroad. “Once we heard about the possible raid, we knew we had to get out. It was game over,” Groysman said. At least 150 Russian journalists, including most of the team from Dozhd, are believed to have fled Russia. Istanbul has emerged as a popular destination, given a lack of alternative options in the west after countries closed their airspace to Russian airlines who, in turn, cancelled international flights. Some media, like the last major independent newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, have tried to stay alive by telling their readers they self-censor while covering the war. Others, such as Meduza and the Moscow Times, moved their whole offices outside of the country. For Dozhd, both options seemed futile. “It was clear we couldn’t do our work honestly with the new law,” said Borzunova. “And since we are a television channel, which needs studios and proper equipment, we couldn’t just go underground or move abroad. There was no other option but to close down.” While Istanbul became the first stop for Dozhd, many of the team plan to fly next to Tbilisi, which is fast becoming another refuge of choice for Russians. Journalists working in Russia had already faced a complex web of repressive tactics by the state, including a law instituted last year labelling many independent media organisations as “foreign agents”, or even worse “undesirable.” The latter essentially places sanctions on news outlets, making their activities inside Russia entirely illegal, including contact with potential sources or networks. For Groysman, the latest events at Dozhd felt eerily familiar. She was previously a journalist at the investigative outlet Proekt, which was branded as an “undesirable” organisation, and she was personally designated as a “foreign agent”. Shortly after that, Proekt was shut down and the police raided and searched the apartments of some of its staff. “In the first few hours after Dozhd was blocked, you felt a rush of adrenaline through the office. No one wanted to give up, but deep down, I knew it was over, you can’t win against the system,” Groysman said. For a long time, Russian journalists have tried to continue operating while playing a constant game of cat and mouse with the authorities. However, the war seems to have killed off any independent journalism. “Towards the end of last year, most independent media was labelled ‘foreign agents’, but you could still access them,” said Aleksandr Gorbachev, a journalist, film-maker and editor with the independent website Holod, who has also moved to Istanbul. “You could read Meduza, watch Dozhd, Mediazona or the BBC. It was obviously not a great situation, but it was a bearable situation if you wanted to do good journalism. “Things were obviously getting harder, but you could still do stories about people in Russia and all kinds of things. Covid, local government, just interesting stories about how people live in Russia, which is what we were doing at Holod. “Since the war started, it’s all become impossible. After the law criminalising ‘fake news’, journalism is basically illegal in Russia now, pure and simple.” Gorbachev and his wife, a journalist with the BBC, began strategising about leaving Russia as soon as Putin announced the invasion. “It was obvious from that very moment … that our lives would never be the same again,” he said. Journalists working from abroad are now faced with the challenge of how to report on life inside Russia, particularly around protests or other sensitive stories. “We don’t know how journalism will be conducted in Russia, but as long as the internet is open and people can use virtual private networks (VPNs), we will get information,” said Gorbachev. “If they switch off the internet completely, then I’m switched off from my mother and brothers and people there. It’s hard to imagine that. We are in uncharted territory. It feels like this madness can’t last long, but at the same time it could last years, we don’t know.” Russia has already taken steps to isolate itself from the global internet, particularly with the introduction of a “sovereign” internet law in 2019 that expanded state control over internet infrastructure. Some observers fear that the war will contribute to the Kremlin moving further towards a restrictive, walled-off internet, like that in China. “It is very important that somehow information continues to flow within Russia, because the only way to change the regime is from within,” said internet policy expert Konstantinos Komaitis. Not everyone in the industry shared the despair expressed by many Russian journalists. “I don’t think my work has ever been more important,” said Ilya Shepelin, another former Dozhd journalist who was holidaying in Tbilisi when the invasion began and decided to stay in the Georgian capital. He now sees his objective as fighting back against the Russian government’s official messaging about its invasion of Ukraine. “I am not sure I am a journalist any more, in the traditional sense. I call my work counter-propaganda,” said Shepelin, who launched a YouTube show earlier this month. “At some point, Russians will be waking up to the fact that their fridges are empty, regardless of what the television tells them. There will be a moment when they realise the Kremlin has been lying about this war all along. And that is where we come in, ready to tell the truth.”",News/World news,‘It was game over’: Russian journalists flee to Istanbul after Putin’s shutdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/dozhd-tv-staff-russian-channel-in-exile-istanbul
3/18/2022,"About 8,000 of the 122,000 people who hope to offer rooms in their homes to Ukrainian refugees joined a hastily organised online conference on Wednesday night to hear how they could be matched with families fleeing conflict. A stream of questions poured in, reflecting an intense willingness to help and profound confusion about how the scheme will work and what hosting traumatised people will entail. “Is there a way I can get a name of someone wanting to come to the UK?” “What about language difficulties?” “The government website says we would not need to feed refugees and they can claim benefits?” “What if we don’t fit well together?” “What if you have holiday planned, who helps them then?” “We live in the countryside, will this be OK?” “As an 80-year-old man on his own, is there a refugee category I could host?” These were just a few of the myriad questions that were asked by the would-be hosts. As the evening progressed it became clear that the matching website that will link people had yet to be fully launched, leaving attenders uncertain about how and when their desire to help would translate into practical action. Three weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 3 million people have fled the country, and so far the Home Office has granted visas to allow only about 6,000 to travel to Britain. The refugee hosting scheme launched this week has offered hope that the UK response to the humanitarian crisis may in time improve, but refugee organisations are cautious, uncertain whether to view the initiative as an inspirational drive to harness a burst of popular goodwill towards refugees or as an underwhelming attempt by the government to construct a “big society” approach, outsourcing its duties towards refugees to under-prepared, unsupported members of the public. Some organisations that have run small-scale refugee hosting programmes for years are angry to have been named by the communities secretary, Michael Gove, without prior consultation, as places that can help match hosts with refugees. Others fear security concerns may be ignored in the race to approve homes. Some describe the scheme as shambolic. There is continued frustration that the UK is insisting people fleeing a war zone must apply for visas using an application process that, despite modest refinements, is still taking a long time. Robina Qureshi, the director of the refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said that at the moment the hosting scheme was a “dead end” because there was no system in place for matching host families with refugees. “The government has unleashed chaos upon chaos for the refugee hosting system,” she said. “Ukrainian refugees have contacted us, some were in Kyiv, some were in burning buildings, saying: ‘Please, can you desperately help us?’ We’re getting people calling us up from the UK and asking: ‘Could you get me a name of a Ukrainian refugee?’ But that’s not how we do things.” The charity has a fastidious vetting and awareness-raising process, to make sure hosts are well informed about what they are taking on. Lawyers are alarmed by an explosion of informal social media accounts offering to help match people with refugees. But most refugee organisations are attempting to swallow their doubts and do everything they can to try to make the scheme work, as it is clear that there is no better alternative scheme on offer. “In principle we shouldn’t be outsourcing this work to random, untrained people who haven’t had any orientation process and apparently will have no home visits in advance,” said Jennifer Blair, an immigration lawyer. Last month she co-founded the Ukraine Advice project, with lawyers offering free advice to Ukrainians making their way here. “But it’s hard to see what the alternative would be. We understand this is being organised at pace; people are fleeing a war zone, they need to get to safety.” The Afghan resettlement scheme, in which more than 15,000 people were airlifted from Kabul last August, is widely seen as a failure, with 12,000 people stuck in hotels and waiting for permanent homes. “The broader asylum system is really not functional at the moment; it’s overwhelmed, you can’t get appointments until July,” Blair said. Charities question why the government is refusing to classify people fleeing war in Ukraine as refugees and to bring them into the asylum system. With parliament currently debating the nationality and borders bill, which will criminalise refugees who arrive in the UK uninvited, ministers are treading a difficult line between wanting to show support for people forced to leave Ukraine and pushing through legislation that weakens refugee rights. “Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good,” said Krish Kandiah, who launched the Sanctuary Foundation last month to help people offer their homes to people fleeing Ukraine, and who chaired Wednesday’s online meeting. “The refugee sector has been quite angry about the government’s response. I’m not a fan of the nationality and borders bill, but the mood of the nation is ‘let’s help these people’, so I’m taking a glass half full approach.” His optimism was shared by most of the people participating in the meeting, who posted cheerful welcomes to each other. Only a few people voiced doubts: “The government proposal are dangerous and not thought through,” “the risk of abuse, human trafficking and modern slavery is immense.” There was surprise from some when it emerged that details of how charities would help match hosts to people who need support had yet to be announced. These concerns are echoed by people in the sector. Naccom, a network of 140 organisations that provide housing to people who have had difficulties with their asylum claims, and usually accommodate about 3,000 people a year who have been left homeless because of their immigration status, asks how the matching, vetting and safeguarding checks will be done. Viktoria Lyubarevich-Torkhova, a psychotherapist who lived in a village outside Kyiv, hopes the Homes for Ukraine scheme will allow her to travel to London when the next phase launches on Friday. She studied at Essex University, and when Russia invaded Ukraine a groups of university friends calling themselves “the Essex crew” came together to offer practical help to get her and her 13-year-old son, Miron Torkhov, to the UK. She is staying with friends in Germany, settling her parents there, and waiting until the UK scheme begins to function. “I’ve got a huge community of friends who want to help. I’m just waiting until we can get a visa,” she said. One college friend, a police officer in London, has offered to sponsor her because he thought he was likely to pass the vetting process quickly as he is already routinely vetted for his work. He completed one stage of the online application process this week, he has been emailed a reference number and will be online on Friday morning to try to match his offer of a room with her application for a visa. “I didn’t give it a moment’s thought. I’ve known Viktoria for over 20 years,” he said, asking not to be named. But he was surprised by how chaotic and ill-prepared the system appeared to be. “We knew this conflict was coming; we knew that potentially millions of refugees might be coming westward. We could have been a bit better prepped.”",News/UK news,Questions mount amid eagerness in UK to help Ukraine refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/questions-mount-amid-eagerness-in-uk-to-help-ukraine-refugees
3/18/2022,"Joe Biden is due to make a phone call to Xi Jinping on Friday at a potential tipping point in China’s role in the world as it decides how far to go in backing Russia’s war on Ukraine. While China has abstained on United Nations security council resolutions on the invasion, it has sided with Moscow rhetorically, echoing Russian talking points blaming Nato, and recycling conspiracy theories, and the Biden administration believes it has already decided to bail Russia out economically. At a meeting in Rome on Monday between the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, the Chinese delegation stunned US officials by echoing debunked Russian claims that the US and Ukraine had been pursuing a secret biological weapons programme together. The Americans came away from Rome more pessimistic than ever about Beijing intentions. “There are lots of indications that the Chinese are doing more behind the scenes to support Russia, in every sector: financially, economically and militarily,” one official said. “And that’s deeply troubling. If they continue on this path, it will be a decisive turning point that will likely lead to much deeper anxiety in Europe about China and a more profound schism between Washington and Beijing.” Members of Congress have warned that if there is evidence of Chinese military aid to the Russian campaign in Ukraine, they will impose punitive economic measures. Corporate leaders are also likely to reassess their business with China, along with European governments. In his phone call with Xi, Biden will reprise some of the arguments Sullivan made in Rome: that the Chinese leader has been wrong about Vladimir Putin, about Russian intentions towards Ukraine, and the strength of its military. He will argue that it is not in Chinese interests to double down on a mistake and to back a loser. Adding to the downsides, the UN’s international court of justice on Wednesday ordered Russia to halt its military operations in Ukraine. The Chinese judge voted against the ruling, but under the UN Charter, China is still legally bound by the decision. “China may be tempted to support Russia in its conflict with Ukraine,” Oona Hathaway and Ryan Goodman, both former Pentagon legal counsels, wrote in the Just Security blog, pointing out that supplying weapons “would implicate China directly in Russia’s illegal war” and could expose Beijing to sanctions. “China cannot provide military aid to Russia and still remain on the legal sidelines,” they argued. Since the Rome meeting on Monday, there have been a few signs of China continuing to hedge its bets, enough to give some hope in Washington that all is not lost. Chinese state-run television channels began to show footage of the devastation wreaked on Ukrainian cities, though they have yet to call it a war or an invasion. The Chinese ambassador to Ukraine assured his hosts: “We will always respect your state.” The German paper Bild reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had been on his way to Beijing on Thursday but had turned his plane around and returned to Moscow for unknown reasons. A US official confirmed the incident but cautioned it was too early to tell its significance, speculating that China was “perhaps wanting to downplay public displays” of amity. On 12 March, Prof Hu Wei, the vice-chairman of the policy research centre attached to the State Council, wrote an article on China’s Ukraine dilemma, noting that Putin’s military effort was faltering. “China cannot be tied to Putin and needs to be cut off as soon as possible,” he argued. “At present, it is estimated that there is still a window period of one or two weeks before China loses its wiggle room. China must act decisively.” The Mandarin version of the article was censored soon after it appeared. The pessimistic view within the Biden administration is that Xi is not listening to such voices and has made his pact with Putin an overarching priority aimed at blunting US power and influence at all costs. The two leaders have met 38 times in the past nine years, and in February pledged the relationship would have “no limits”. The repercussions from the Ukraine war have already spread into the Indo-Pacific, where a small democracy’s resilience in the face of a far more powerful autocracy has local relevance in the shape of Taiwan. US allies in the region have joined in the sanctions on Russia, including Australia and Japan, which announced new measures on Friday, and in some cases sent military supplies. A division of the world into two camps, along political and economic lines, would represent a profound dilemma for India, which has been trying to stay on the fence over Ukraine. “For India, one of its foreign policy objectives is to keep Russia from getting even closer to China,” Tanvi Madan, the director of the India project at the Brookings Institution, said. She added that India has seen Russia historically as a supporter of last resort in its rivalry with China, and its primary arms supplier. “They have at the very least hoped for Russia neutrality to keep Russia from tilting towards China, particularly in a crisis,” Madan said. If Russia drifts towards dependence on Beijing because of its misjudgments in Ukraine, Moscow’s support for India is no longer guaranteed in a confrontation with China, like the clash in the Himalayas last year. “That is leading to a discussion in India in terms of needing to reduce India’s over-dependence on Russia for military supplies,” Madan said. Europe too would find itself with hard choices to make about its economic links with China, as the schism grows over Ukraine. “As Xi Jinping positions himself and China as the leading power in an authoritarian bloc, it would make it almost impossible for any European democracy to grow close to Beijing,” said Abraham Denmark, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia, now at the Wilson Center thinktank. “It would be a dramatic shift in the geopolitical balance of power.”",News/World news,China’s decisive turning point: will it side with Russia and divide the world?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/chinas-decisive-turning-point-will-it-side-with-russia-and-divide-the-world
