5/19/2022,"Early 00s pop TV was fertile ground for hyperactive performances. From the flirty cheek of TMi to the saccharine staging of CD:UK, bubblegum pop, in a new millennium, found its perfect companion in fresh-faced presenters enthusing to viewers at home wishing to escape hormone-fuelled existences. That use of music as a means of transport to an imagined space is universal. It takes us to Afghanistan in 2004 in Waleed Akhtar’s debut play, Kabul Goes Pop: Music Television Afghanistan, directed by Anna Himali Howard in a co-production with HighTide. Based on the true story of the country’s first pop TV show, Hop (here named Vox), Akhtar’s two-hander follows his fictional twentysomething presenters as they beam the finest boybands and girl groups to their teen audience. As the country responds to a newfound western influence after the US invasion, hosts Farook (Arian Nik) and Samia (Shala Nyx) present their frantic showfrom its kitsch set, adorned by a wall of screens and pulsing neon. Nik and Nyx’s performances are equally – and appropriately – camp: Nik has a touch of Louie Spence, and Nyx the gum-chewing defiance of Mean Girls. Hits such as Britney Spears’ … Baby One More Time, Shape of My Heart by Backstreet Boys, and Sugababes’ Push the Button keep the initial scenes moving to a satisfyingly swift beat as Farook and Samia’s burgeoning friendship develops. Yet the Taliban are regaining influence and making life on the frontlines of innuendo-laden pop-presenting increasingly dangerous. As the peril encroaches and the camp fades, the play, in its second half, falters. The music recedes and the drama enters an exhausting downward spiral. The script is hampered by self-consciously clunky lines – the refrain of “when it’s written, it’s written” to gloss over moments of tragedy – and an insistence on spelling out each beat of the political atmosphere. Equally, as we reach a shocking conclusion, the emotional bond between Farook and Samia feels unearned; we are told they are best friends, but we rarely feel it. Ultimately Akhtar’s play is uneven but refreshing in its insistence on the hope shared by Afghanistan’s youth in the early 00s. It is a pop-fuelled optimism that is eventually smothered – a crushing denial of youth made all the more poignant since its echoes are still felt today. Kabul Goes Pop: Music Television Afghanistan is at Brixton House, London, until 29 May. Then at Harlow Playhouse on 8 June; Mercury theatre, Colchester, 15-18 June; and New Wolsey theatre, Ipswich, on 20 June.",Arts/Stage,Kabul Goes Pop review – a fizzing tribute to bubblegum songs of hope,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/19/kabul-goes-pop-review-fizzing-tribute-afghans-britney-waleed-akhtar
5/19/2022,"Dolphins are able to recognise one another by the taste of their urine, a study has found. Researchers at the University of St Andrews have discovered that the mammals can recognise friends and family members without seeing or hearing them. This unique sense of taste allows dolphins to tell between their peers through their urine and other excretions. In order to find this out, Prof Vincent Janik, director of the Scottish Oceans Institute, and his colleagues Jason Bruck and Sam Walmsley tested how dolphins reacted to urine samples from different individuals. According to the study published in the journal Science Advances, the sea creatures were far more interested in urine from animals they recognised than ones they did not know. Janik, the lead author, said: “Dolphins explored urine samples for longer if they came from known animals or when they were presented together with the dolphin’s unique and distinctive signature whistle, an acoustic identifier that works like a name.” The dolphins in the study were from the Dolphin Quest resorts in Hawaii and Bermuda, where their “day job” is swimming with tourists. They live in natural seawater in their social groups so were ideal to study. By training animals to give urine samples when needed, the scientists were able to create a collection that was used across facilities to present known and novel tastes to dolphins. Due to this finding, the researchers believe dolphins have a different experience of taste to other mammals. Janik added: “We still know very little about how the sense of taste works in dolphins. Other studies have shown that they lost a lot of the common tastes that we find in other mammals such as sour, sweet, umami or bitter. But they have unusual sensory cells on their tongue that are probably involved in this detection of individual tastes of other animals.”",News/Environment,"Dolphins can recognise each other by taste of their urine, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/dolphins-can-recognise-each-other-by-taste-of-their-urine-study-finds
5/19/2022,"A fantastic curio from the Mystery to Me album. Written by Bob Welch, Keep on Going sets Christine McVie’s voice against an arrangement audibly influenced by the soul music coming out of Philadelphia International Records at the time: high-drama strings, dancefloor drums. It’s like nothing else Fleetwood Mac recorded. If you want to trace the roots of Fleetwood Mac the multimillion-selling pop-rock phenomenon, start with the LP Bare Trees. Tellingly still in their live set long after Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined, McVie’s beautiful Spare Me a Little of Your Love has a relaxed mood at odds with that album’s rockier inclinations. Fleetwood Mac remain a stadium-packing live act despite lineup changes, intra-band strife and not having released a great album since 1987. But if you want evidence that the contemporary Mac aren’t a spent creative force, try Sad Angel – from 2013’s overlooked four-track Extended Play – a taut, catchy Buckingham rock song about his perennial subject: Nicks. Santana’s slinky, conga-heavy cover version is more famous, but Fleetwood Mac’s first Top 40 hit is darker, more raw and exciting. It feels live, as if someone pressed record during a rehearsal; the mood is ominous, and it’s punctuated with frequent pregnant pauses. Nevertheless, it’s commercial. By far the least revered album of the classic Buckingham/Nicks-era Mac, Mirage has something of the holding pattern about it – Tusk’s experimentation is gone, expensive-sounding soft-rock abounds – but it contains some real hidden gems, including McVie’s luscious, lovestruck, small-hours paean to her soon-to-be-ex, soon-to-be-late fiance Dennis Wilson. Mac’s original, increasingly troubled frontman Peter Green treats the listening public as a shoulder to cry on. Perhaps a more unsettling song in hindsight than it seemed at the time, the tune is beautiful, the arrangement almost ascetically stark and the lyrics full of dread: “I just wish I’d never been born.” Rescued from obscurity by the soundtrack of Almost Famous, the title track of 1971’s Future Games demonstrates how Welch’s arrival shook Fleetwood Mac up. Subsequently covered by MGMT, it’s a charming, sprawling, stoned summer’s afternoon of a song, thick with harmonies and lyrics of a laid-back hippy-mystic bent. The standard line is that Nicks and Buckingham’s arrival transformed Fleetwood Mac, but on McVie’s majestic Come a Little Bit Closer – a hidden gem from 1974’s Heroes Are Hard to Find – the band sounded as if they were already preparing for a musical shift: it could have slotted on to Rumours with ease. Thunderous and eerie – Green sings in a chilling falsetto that he’s beset by forces “creeping around, making me do things I don’t wanna do” – The Green Manalishi is both a signpost on the route to heavy metal and, like Pink Floyd’s long-suppressed Vegetable Man, the sound of the psychological wreckage wrought by LSD washing up in rock music. Many 70s superstars struggled in the 80s pop landscape. If Fleetwood Mac wobbled at the decade’s start, by 1987 they seemed almost as imperious as they had been circa Rumours thanks to songs such as Little Lies, co-written by McVie and her then-husband, Eddy Quintela. While the keyboardist-singer was keen to emphasise its blues roots, to everyone else it just sounded like impeccable pop music. Bombed on prescription tranquillisers, Nicks was barely there during the Tango in the Night era: her credit on Seven Wonders was down to substituting one word on writer Sandy Stevens’s demo. But her vocal performance on the song, an 80s AOR masterpiece, is amazing, as if she’s fully identifying with the chorus’s intimations of mortality. The highpoint of the post-Green, pre-Buckingham/Nicks era, Hypnotised captures Fleetwood Mac in transition. A distinct blues undertow remains in the guitars and vocal, but the overall sound is smooth, cosseting and sunlit, at odds with the paranormally obsessed lyrics. Though still based in England, here they sounded as though they were already in LA. A vastly successful single, there’s a twinge of darkness and unease about Big Love that undercuts its breathy sampled voices and ostensibly lubricious nocturnal mood. For a swinging single on the prowl, Buckingham’s vocal sounds weirdly distressed; the acoustic guitar interjections and pattering electronics are fidgety; the guitar solo broiling. The first single from 1975’s eponymous Fleetwood Mac was a refinement of the kind of luscious, mid-tempo song McVie had been quietly contributing to their albums for years. Her powers of prescience were still intact: she wrote it about Buckingham, far from the last time another band member would provide a songwriter’s subject matter. As if the romantic entanglements depicted elsewhere aren’t emotionally wrenching enough, Rumours ends with a description of a cocaine overdose. Gold Dust Woman offers yet more evidence of the album’s ability to set bleak subject matter in a quite preposterously charming way; that said, the instrumental finale is powerfully dark. Hypnotised by new wave, particularly Talking Heads, Buckingham steered Rumours’ follow-up down some unexpected paths, not least on its title track, a chaotic, paranoid melange involving a marching band, voices that whisper and shriek, and a leg of lamb being hit with a spatula. Both weird and weirdly compelling. One reason Fleetwood Mac exploded in the mid-70s was that their new songs chimed with fellow boomers, whose hippy optimism and youthful zeal had been eroded by other concerns: marriage, divorce, parenthood. “Can I handle the seasons of my life?” ponders Nicks’ stunning ballad Landslide. “Even children get older, and I’m getting older, too.” To add to Rumours’ interpersonal chaos, You Make Loving Fun features McVie’s husband, John, playing bass on a song hymning her affair with the band’s lighting director. Her claim it was actually about her dog is among rock’s feeblest lies; it really doesn’t account for the chorus’s sighing, post-coital glow. Fleetwood Mac’s solitary UK No 1, Albatross has its roots in dreamy 1950s instrumentals – particularly Chuck Berry’s Deep Feeling – but its flawlessly becalmed atmosphere seems very 1969, fitting a post-psychedelic, 60s comedown mood. Moreover, it transcended its era, becoming a hit again in 1973, then a chill-out collection and ad-soundtrack perennial. After McVie’s lovely opener Over & Over, Tusk’s second track plunges the listener into the album’s strangeness. Arranged differently, it might have sounded like Rumours’ acoustic Never Going Back Again; here, Buckingham’s fantastic melody proceeds at breakneck speed, accompanied by a downtuned, off-key electric guitar, the harmonies so drowned in echo they’re barely there. The Chain was famously spliced together from parts of old songs, including a track that had already appeared on Buckingham Nicks’ eponymous 1973 album. And yet its episodic structure works: the moment that celebrated bass riff appears never fails to feel exciting, no matter how many times you’ve heard it. Begun in 1978, at the hedonistic height of Fleetwood Mac’s celebrity, Gypsy finds Nicks looking longingly back at her pre-fame life. By the time they recorded it on Mirage, her memories had been sharpened by the death of her high-school friend Robyn Snyder Anderson. The result is wistful, warm and affectingly heartbroken. In an imaginary alternative history of Fleetwood Mac, Green and guitarist Danny Kirwan keep their mental equilibrium, they refine the tough sound of 1969’s superb Then Play On, and ride a Zeppelin-esque wave of hard rock success in the US. The tumultuous, ultra-powerful riffing of Oh Well Part 1 suggests it could have happened. Rhiannon introduced one of Nicks’ characteristic songwriting tropes: the depiction of a mysterious but desirable woman for whom the adjective “witchy” might have been invented (also songs via which Nicks’ own shawl-twirling stage persona might be projected). The music is coolly understated and atmospheric, Buckingham’s guitar riff perfect. Dropped from Rumours due to time constraints, Silver Springs is nevertheless one of Nicks’ greatest songs, on which the mask of diffidence she affects on Dreams cracks, and jealousy, misery and dire imprecations gush forth, alongside a prescient warning to Buckingham: “The sound of my voice will haunt you.” Sometimes Tusk’s experimentation involved weird sounds and marching bands; sometimes it was more subtle. Six-and-a-half minutes long, Sara is a Nicks ballad turned dreamily expansive. Entrancing, sensual and opaque, it’s apparently about Nicks’ friend marrying Mick Fleetwood, but could just as easily be about a passionate affair ending. A glimmer of optimism amid Rumours’ romantic angst? Maybe. McVie’s Don’t Stop is actually the sound of a departing wife blithely telling her ex-husband to buck up, but its cantering rhythm and chorus are so impossibly, infectiously buoyant, the song so flawless, that it cancels out the unhappiness that provoked it. With Nicks largely out of action, McVie’s songwriting went into overdrive on Tango in the Night. Everywhere is just an incredible song, its enduring power bolstered by the fact that, on an album with a very late-80s production, its sound still cleaved close to that of Rumours. Perfect pop distilled from passive aggression and, according to Buckingham, the Rolling Stones’ Street Fighting Man. The verses build tension, the choruses and the fantastic guitar solo are an angry, cathartic release. Nicks, however, was not pleased by her ex’s depiction of her: “I wanted to go over and kill him.” The crowing glory of Fleetwood Mac’s oeuvre and the apotheosis of a certain super-smooth 70s LA studio sound; supposedly rendered terminally unhip by punk, it has been endlessly imitated over the past 20 years. Of course, the melody is irresistible, but a chunk of Dreams’ lasting power comes from the way the lyrics, essentially Go Your Own Way told from a different angle, are at odds with everything else in the track – Nicks’ drowsy delivery, the laid-back rhythm, the hazy combination of acoustic strumming, spare lead guitar and electric piano – transforming their anger into a dismissive screw-you shrug, turning rancour and bitterness into something exquisite.",Arts/Culture,Fleetwood Mac’s 30 greatest songs – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/19/fleetwood-mac-ranked-30-best-songs
5/19/2022,"Brad Raffensperger was on his way out when the bartender stopped him. He wanted a word. The man had been lingering in the doorway as Raffensperger, a Republican serving as Georgia’s top election official, spoke to a little over a dozen members of the chamber of commerce in Washington, a small town about two hours east of Atlanta. Raffensperger had seen him from the lectern and asked if he wanted to ask a question – he declined. Now the bartender had more courage. He wanted to ask about the phone call. “How did that make you feel?” he said. He was referring to the infamous 2 January 2021 call from Donald Trump in which the president asked Raffensperger to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,” Trump said. Raffensperger, who oversaw three recounts of the presidential vote, all of which affirmed Joe Biden’s victory, refused the request, enraging Trump. That phone call is now at the center of what may be the most important primary election this year. Raffensperger is running for re-election as Georgia’s secretary of state and Trump is seeking to oust him from office. He wants to replace him with Jody Hice, a Republican congressman who has said the election was stolen and joined efforts to overturn it. It’s one of several races across the country in which Trump is seeking to install allies in important election administration positions in which they could throw out the results of a future election. Georgia’s race is especially significant – it’s the only place where Trump is seeking to punish a statewide Republican election official for explicitly refusing his request to subvert democracy. It could determine whether the person overseeing the next presidential election in Georgia is someone who prevented an election from being overturned or someone who tried to overturn the last one. Election day is 24 May and the race is very close, recent polling shows. Whoever wins will oversee elections in Georgia, which has emerged in recent years as ground zero in fights over election rules. The state has long been seen as a Republican bastion, but in recent years non-white voters have been exercising new levels of political power. It is now a political battleground after Democrats won the presidential race and two Senate seats last year. “All eyes should be on this race between Raffensperger and Hice,” said Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office across the country. “Georgia was a place in 2020 where we watched three statewide elected officials stand up and protect the vote, protect the will of the voters. If we want to see that happen again in 2024, if there are further efforts to undermine our elections and the results and ultimately the will of American voters, we need to make sure that we’re electing people who fundamentally believe in the system.” She noted all three officials who refused to overturn the election in 2020 – the governor, attorney general and secretary of state – are up for re-election. Raffensperger, a mild-mannered engineer, is an odd fit to be at the center of a race for US democracy. He’s not a flamethrower and he’s a little bit awkward as a politician, occasionally stumbling over his words. He can land a political punch, but is more comfortable discussing trusses and beams and quoting Ecclesiastes and CS Lewis. One day in early May, Raffensperger stood in front of the federal courthouse in Atlanta, a wrinkle or two in his red tie, as he raised his voice to speak over nearby construction. After speaking and taking questions for about 10 minutes, he darted off from the podium, down the steps, and hurried back toward his office at the Georgia capitol. “I’m an engineer through and through and so sometimes I’m not as eloquent with my words as I need to be,” he said the next day. He also has wholeheartedly championed traditional Republican efforts to restrict voting access. He is a staunch defender of a new Georgia law that bans handing out food or water to people standing in line to vote. He believes Georgia should get rid of no-excuse mail-in voting. He also supports getting rid of a federal blackout period that prevents people from being purged from the voter rolls within 90 days of an election. The centerpiece of his campaign is preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually nonexistent, according to Raffensperger’s own office. Nsé Ufot, CEO of the non-partisan New Georgia Project, which works on voter registration in the state, said Raffensperger had received national praise for not overturning the election, “as if that alone is the litmus test as to whether someone is a vote suppressor or not”. “He did not break the law that one time. That does not mean that he does not align with the party’s priorities and with their lies and rhetoric about voting,” she said. Raffensperger’s focus on non-citizen voting in particular shows how he is pandering to his party, said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University. “He is looking for a low-cost symbolic gesture that I think he hopes will restore his conservative bona fides among people who questioned them because he didn’t overturn the results of the 2020 election,” she said. Raffensperger has refused to back down from his defense of the 2020 election, essentially betting that voters will re-elect him for doing his job and standing up to Trump, even if they support the former president. At the event in Washington, Raffensperger methodically laid out his case for upholding the results of the 2020 election to the small crowd (there was a competing baseball game and awards dinner that night). He relied on statistics: 28,000 Georgia voters skipped the presidential election but voted down ballot, Raffensperger said, repeating a statistic he frequently mentions on the campaign trail. Republican members of Congress got 33,000 more votes in Georgia than Trump did, he said. Republican state senators got 400,000 more votes than Trump, he added. He then detailed how he looked into Trump’s claims of election fraud. When Trump said thousands of dead people voted in 2020, Raffensperger’s office investigated and found just four. Then Trump said more than 2,000 felons voted in the 2020 election. Raffensperger investigated and found that there were possibly 74. Trump then said 2,423 non-registered voters cast a ballot in 2020. Raffensperger investigated and found there were zero. Then Trump started saying machines were flipping votes and Raffensperger did a hand recount of all 5m ballots cast in the state and found the results were essentially the same. It was one of three ballot counts in the state that affirmed Biden’s victory there. “Every allegation that was made, we checked it all out. As an engineer, you want to make sure you check it out, right? Because you don’t want to look foolish,” he said later. Raffensperger doesn’t say it outright, but it seems that a central bet of his campaign is that the truth about the 2020 campaign will prevail. He is betting on voters like Carolee Curtis, an 82-year-old retiree who lives in Rome, a city in deeply Republican north-west Georgia, who voted for him. At the early voting site where she voted, signs dotted the parking lot for Hice and Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who represents the district. There were none for Raffensperger. “I felt that under all that pressure, he did a good job,” she said after casting her vote. “I know it upset Trump, and I’m a Trump person, but fair is fair.” Kenneth Studdard, 56, who owns Dogwood Books in Rome, also said he liked Trump, and said he would probably vote for Raffensperger, though he wasn’t following the race too closely yet. “I think he did a good job. I think the other guy’s running more for spite,” he said. It seems unlikely that Hice, a pastor and former radio host, would be running absent the myth of a stolen election. He has built his entire campaign around the idea. This contrast was on full display during a candidate debate in Atlanta in early May. Hice repeated a number of lies about the 2020 election and said that Raffensperger created so-called ballot harvesting in Georgia (Raffensperger supported a 2019 law that outlawed third-party collection of mail-in ballots). He claimed Raffensperger had made a deal with Stacey Abrams to weaken signature matching standards in the state (a 2020 court settlement required that multiple election officials check a signature before it was rejected and notify the voter before rejecting it). Hice also criticised Raffensperger for sending out mail-in ballot applications during the election (Raffensperger sent out mail-in ballot applications to all Georgia voters during the state’s 2020 primary, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but did not do so during the general election). After the debate, Hice told a small gaggle of reporters that nothing would convince him the 2020 election results were accurate. “I would not have certified them without getting first, an absolute understanding of what an accurate election result was,” he said. “This election was just overwhelmed with fraudulent activity. There’s nothing that can change my opinion of that.” If elected secretary of state, it could be Hice on the other end the next time Trump, or another politician, calls with a request to find votes. Hice didn’t answer how he would handle such a request, but said he didn’t see anything wrong with it in 2020. “Absolutely, there was nothing wrong with that request,” Hice said. “He was not saying ‘go out and find illegal ballots for me.’ He was saying look at all the fraud that’s out here. Do your job. Make sure we have legal ballots that are cast, legal ballots that are counted, and had Brad done so, I believe the outcome would have been different.” Trump’s phone call was not a generalized request to investigate. When Raffensperger and a lawyer told the president they had probed his allegations, the president said refused to accept it. “I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There’s no way I lost Georgia. There’s no way,” Trump said. Hice’s message that resonated with Mike Albright, 62, who voted for Hice in the Atlanta suburbs. “I was very disappointed by the last election. I didn’t think the results were honest. I think there was a lot of corruption that went on. And the current secretary of state didn’t know how to do an adequate investigation,” he said. “I don’t think his audits were adequate. They weren’t real audits. Basically, they didn’t confirm that voters were really voters.” In Rome, Tom and Emily Saltino also voted for Hice. They said they were unconvinced Trump lost the 2020 election in Georgia because they had seen the large crowds of people that came to see him when he visited the state. “[There were] a lot of things he could have done, it seems, that was not done to satisfy the masses that everything was on the up and up”, Tom, 84, said. “I just think that position needs to be cleaned up, somebody new come in.” Emily added she would not vote for Raffensperger in November if he won the Republican nomination. During the debate, Raffensperger pointed out repeatedly that Hice was lying, but at times even he seemed exasperated by trying to convince people that was the case. “The real problem that you have gets down to basic honesty,” he said. “It gets down to, it was actual, total, disinformation, misinformation, outright lying. And there’s not much I can do about that,” he said. “Jody Hice has been running from one rumor to another for the last 18 months. And how can you have confidence when people that should be holding a responsible position as a sitting congressman should be telling the truth?” Talking with the bartender in Washington, Raffensperger defended his decision to stand up to Trump. “I wanted to make sure I was respectful to President Trump’s position of authority,” he began. “He was disappointed. But I’ve been disappointed in life. I haven’t won every football game or basketball game ever played. My volleyball team in high school wasn’t that strong either, but we still played and had a good time. And when we lost, we tried harder.” “It sounded like intimidation to me,” the man said. “I personally appreciate what you did very much. I hope you hear that all the time.” “You’re a good man,” Raffensperger said back. “God bless you.” Afterwards, Raffensperger lingered in the town square for a bit talking to voters as the sun set over the courthouse – the county’s early voting site. He sounded like a man who was at peace with his decision to defy the leader of his party, even if it costs him his job. “Those are all good people in there. And even people that can dog cuss you and the people that are mad, I keep in mind that they’ve been lied to. I gently say misinformation, disinformation. People know that there weren’t thousands of dead people,” he said, swatting the occasional bug away. “A person of integrity expects to be believed, and when he’s not, he lets time prove him right. So time has proven me right.” Raffensperger would not say whether he would vote for Trump again in 2024. And he declined to say whether he would vote for Hice if he gets the Republican nomination. “As secretary of state, I don’t endorse candidates,” he said. Even though he has received an onslaught of death threats and harassment since the 2020 election, Raffensperger doesn’t really seem to have given much thought to the possibility of not running again. “If the good walk off the field and leave the field to the bad, then the bad wins,” he said. But in his race, it’s quite possible that lies could prevail. What message would it send if that happens? “It means that we need to do more rebuilding of ourselves individually,” Raffensperger said.",News/US news,He became a hero for halting Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.
