3/31/2022,"The Home Office has failed to transform its culture or to become a more compassionate department as it promised to do in the wake of the Windrush scandal, a critical inspection report has found. Expressions of disappointment appear 14 times in the progress report published by independent expert Wendy Williams, who was appointed to advise the Home Office on how to reform to avoid any future crisis. Reviewing the department’s progress in its commitments to addressing the problems that caused by the Windrush scandal, Williams concluded she was “disappointed by the lack of tangible progress or drive to achieve the cultural changes required”. Acknowledging that some positive steps had been made, she said the department was at a “tipping point”, and unless improvements were made, it was only a matter of time before it would face another crisis, she said. Williams was appointed in 2018 to investigate the causes of the Windrush scandal, under which the UK government erroneously classified thousands of legal residents as illegal immigrants. Her 2020 report contained 30 recommendations for Home Office improvements, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, later committed to implementing all of them, promising “to build a fairer, more compassionate” department and committing to “a total transformation of our culture”. But only eight of the 30 recommendations have been fully implemented, Williams said, adding that the department had yet to implement the spirit of her recommendations, and criticised officials for exaggerating the progress they have made. “Much more progress is required in policymaking and casework, which will be seen as the major indicators of improvement,” she said. “I have seen limited evidence that a compassionate approach is being embedded consistently across the department,” she concluded. She was also critical of the department’s failure to review the effectiveness of the hostile environment policies (now known as compliant environment policies) that caused so many of the Windrush problems. “The failure to complete the review of the compliant environment policy will fundamentally hamper the department’s efforts to learn lessons and move on constructively,” she wrote. The department has failed to appoint a migrants’ commissioner, which Williams views as a key measure “to signpost systemic risks”. More work needed to be done to increase the level of black, Asian and minority ethnic staff at a senior level. Williams had found that an insufficiently diverse Home Office leadership team had “contributed to some of the errors in thinking which gave rise to the Windrush scandal itself”. Although some steps had been taken to address this issue, “success remains elusive and a much more dynamic approach is needed”, she said. Williams was particularly concerned by the slow pace of the compensation programme. A small poll of applicants to the Windrush compensation scheme conducted by Williams found that 76% said they had not been treated respectfully by Home Office staff, and that 97% said that they did not trust the Home Office to deliver on its commitments. Around 386 claimants have waited more than a year for their claims to be resolved, 179 of whom have been waiting more than 18 months. “I met people who were still in severe financial and personal difficulties two years on from my original review. Some were unable to find work after time away from the job market. Others were in temporary accommodation, having to live with families or facing eviction because of unpaid bills. Some were in serious debt,” she wrote. “Many still had unmet physical and psychological needsand had experienced a sense of loss and devastation which had fundamentally affected their ability to cope, undermining their sense of identity and feelings of self-worth.” Several anonymous Home Office staff interviewed by Williams also expressed concern about the scheme. One told her: “Our approach does not scream ‘righting the wrongs’ or compassion, but ‘how little can we get away with paying out’.” The Windrush compensation scheme has paid out more than £45m on 993 claims. It has also provided more than 14,800 individuals with documentation confirming their status or British citizenship. However, this is a fraction of the amount originally estimated to be paid out, expected to be between £200m and £390m. At least 23 people have died after submitting a claim, but before receiving any payment. Although the department has taken steps to introduce a training programme to educate Home Office staff about the legacy of empire and colonialism, only 163 people (out of a total headcount of around 38,000) had visited the Windrush learning hub on its internal intranet system. Responding to the report, Patel said: “I have laid the foundations for radical change in the department and a total transformation of culture. We have already made significant progress. Having said that, there is more to do and I will not falter in my commitment to everyone who was affected by the Windrush scandal. Many people suffered terrible injustices at the hands of successive governments and I will continue working hard to deliver a Home Office worthy of every community we serve.” Windrush victim Anthony Bryan was wrongly held for five weeks in immigration removal centres and was booked in 2017 on a flight back to Jamaica, the country he left when he was eight in 1965 and had not visited since. After his case was highlighted in the Guardian, officials acknowledged he was in the UK legally. He has still not resolved his claim for compensation, and is appealing against the sum offered to him by the Home Office. “Their offer doesn’t reflect what I went through – it felt like an insult. I don’t think the Home Office has changed; when the spotlight is on them they make promises, but once the public attention moves away nothing happens.”",News/UK news,"Windrush: Home Office has failed to transform its culture, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/windrush-home-office-has-failed-to-transform-its-culture-report-says
3/31/2022,"No excuses for the Tories, no place to hide: that poverty and economic insecurity kill is an incontrovertible fact. Some may flinch when they hear that the government’s failure to address a worsening cost of living crisis will tip many of its citizens into premature graves, but the macabre nature of a fact does not make it less true. New research published by the Office for National Statistics is merely the latest addition to what has been understood by anyone with a sufficient interest in matters of life and death for centuries. The ONS figures show that avoidable deaths account for four in 10 male deaths in England’s poorest communities: in the least deprived, that figure is less than half, at 17.8%. For women, the figures are lower, but the gap barely less acute: 26.7% and 11.9% respectively. Covid, meanwhile, was almost four times more likely to kill in England’s most deprived areas, according to the ONS, a finding that accords with previous research. Viruses are not sentient, of course, and Covid did not consciously seek out the poorest. But it is a heat-seeking missile for health conditions that are directly linked to poverty – from hypertension to diabetes, from heart disease to cancer. The pandemic disproportionately robbed the poor – who, in turn, disproportionately come from minority communities – of their lives, but it merely heightened the deadly consequences of our entire economic system. This reality was labelled “social murder” by Friedrich Engels in 1845 in The Condition of the Working-Class in England. If an individual injures a fellow human being and causes death, he noted, that was manslaughter; “when the assailant knew in advance that the injury would be fatal, we call his deed murder”. So why was it different, he asked, when society placed its working-class citizens in such a position that they suffered “too early and an unnatural death”, where it imposed conditions on them in which it knew death was the “inevitable consequence”? When the government cancelled the universal credit uplift last autumn in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, it could not claim ignorance about the consequences. The Legatum Institute thinktank highlighted that 840,000 people would be driven below the poverty line. According to leading economists, chancellor Rishi Sunak’s failure to help struggling households in his spring statement last week will push 1.3 million Britons into deprivation. Sunak and his team know all this: they have their own number-crunchers. They are consciously imposing a state of poverty on a significant portion of the people they purportedly exist to serve, and this will lead to premature deaths. In a politics governed by hypocritical standards of civility, such an argument will be deemed inflammatory and extreme. Disagreeing with government policy is one thing, it will predictably be said, but accusing a government of knowingly shortening lives is quite another. Ours is a political culture in which showering venom on marginalised minorities is deemed to be political debate, but pointing out that a government knowingly imposing a state of poverty on its own people will objectively take lives is liable to set teeth on edge. When former shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the Grenfell disaster as “social murder”, his comments were condemned by then chancellor Philip Hammond as “disgraceful”. Ours is a politics more offended by the language used to describe systems that produce great loss of life than the systems themselves. As the British Medical Association notes, poverty in infancy is “associated with a low birth weight, shorter life expectancy and a higher risk of death in the first year of life”. For children, the risk of chronic disease is heightened, as are problems related to diet. Mental health problems are three times more likely, which in turn can lead to damaging forms of self-medication, such as overeating, smoking and alcohol abuse. Poor mental and physical health feed off each other. If you have the means to prevent these outcomes and yet, instead, pursue policies and approaches that make them worse, are you not open to being accused of knowingly harming the health of the nation? Ultimately, this is not all down to Sunak or his fellow politicians. It is, after all, inherent in an economic model that takes wealth produced by the efforts of millions of people and then hands much of it to a tiny elite. Such a system leaves significant numbers in cramped housing, skipping hot meals to ensure children are fed, and battered by daily stresses such as the cost of heating their home. This model leaves millions with little protection when storm clouds gather and crowd out the light. The government’s decision – and that is what this is, a conscious choice – not to at least introduce measures to protect livelihoods will mean two things: poverty and, accordingly, avoidable death. They can’t feign ignorance or deny reality: this is a truth known for generations, indeed for centuries.

3/31/2022,"Nearly half of working-age women are providing an average of 45 hours of unpaid care every week, compared with 25% of men providing 17 hours, according to a study highlighting the gulf in unpaid care work. Every year women in the UK are providing 23.2bn hours of unpaid childcare care worth an estimated £382bn, while men provide 9.7bn worth £160bn, according to research from the thinktank Centre for Progressive Policy. Calling unpaid work “one of the driving forces of gender-based inequalities in the workplace”, the CPP found that caring responsibilities “disproportionately impact women and exacerbate workplace inequality”. The thinktank recommends increasing the amount of “free childcare” for three- to four-year-olds from 570 hours a year to 720 hours and expanding to the 15 hours a week allowance for disadvantaged two-year-olds to cover 48 weeks and funding for after-school and holiday clubs. It also calls for a national target of 70% of job adverts highlighting flexibility by 2025 and a reform of parental leave that offers take-it-or-lose it paid leave for fathers and co-parents. Campaigners have long argued that current shared parental leave (SPL) policy is a “deeply flawed and chronically failing policy” and should be replaced. A survey carried out for the What Women Want research found that women do most unpaid care work for adults, with one in five women reducing their hours and 830,000 unable to work entirely because they cared for an adult. A quarter of women had reduced their hours at work to care for a child, while childcare prevented one in five women working more hours despite wanting to, the Yonder survey of 2,002 people found. One in five women caring for an adult had also reduced their paid hours. Calling for flexible work to be made a day-one right for workers, the CPP said 45% of women said they could work more with more flexibility. Increased flexible working could increase the earnings of female carers by £28.4bn a year, and add £60bn a year to the UK economy. Access to childcare needed to improve, working practices changed and unpaid work shared more equally if women were going to get an equal shot at work, said Dean Hochlaf, social policy expert at CPP. “The economic gains for women and wider society could be immense giving women greater control and choice in their working lives, and generating significant economic gains that benefit everyone,” he said. It comes as the Coram Family and Childcare’s 21st annual childcare survey revealed that the cost of childcare for children under two has risen by 2.5% in the past year, while only 57% of local authorities report having sufficient childcare places for children under two. A survey by Pregnant Then Screwed and Mumsnet last week found that two-thirds of respondents were paying as much or more for their childcare than for their rent or mortgage. The Labour MP Stella Creasy, said women were being squeezed from the workforce. “This is destabilising our future financial security and draining talent from the economy,” she said. “We need the government to act and make balancing work and family life a reality for everyone, not just those who can afford it.” A government spokesperson said: “We have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver the government’s free childcare offers, including the 30 hours per week for working parents. We are also investing millions in Family Hubs – where families can access important support services. “We continue to look for ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare, and to further support working families we have brought forward flexible parental leave arrangements, including up to 52 weeks of maternity leave – one of the most generous entitlements in the world.”",News/World news,Almost half of working-age women in UK do 45 hours of unpaid care a week – study,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/almost-half-of-working-age-women-in-uk-do-45-hours-of-unpaid-care-a-week-study
3/31/2022,"Good morning. Russia is preparing its forces for a fresh assault in the breakaway Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed, despite peace talks resuming on Friday. Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian army’s resistance had forced the Kremlin to announce it would deescalate attacks on cities such as Kyiv and Chernihiv. Despite the announcement, Russian forces have continued to attack Chernihiv and parts of the capital. The Ukrainian president said that his government was seeing “a buildup of Russian forces for new strikes on the Donbas and [is] preparing for that”. The region, which includes the besieged city of Mariupol, was a focus of talks on Tuesday. The talks will resume online on Friday, according to a senior Ukrainian negotiator. A special tribunal must be set up immediately to investigate the crime of Russian aggression, leading international lawyer Philippe Sands has argued. While the investigations are needed, he said that “war crimes and crimes against humanity investigations alone could end up as a means of letting the main man off the hook”. The White House has rebuked Donald Trump after he called on Vladimir Putin to release potentially damaging information about Hunter Biden. The remarks came during an interview on Just the News TV program that raised unsubstantiated questions about Biden’s past business dealings in Russia. Arizona’s Republican governor has signed a bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote for president, as well as proof of address for newly registering voters. Although the state legislature’s own lawyers said much of the bill is unconstitutional and likely to be thrown out in court, voting rights advocates fear it is an attempt to get the measure before supreme court, which has become more conservative. Representative Jake Hoffman, who helped develop the bill, said it aimed to eradicate voting fraud, despite cases of non-citizens voting being extremely rare. Arizona is the only state that requires voters to prove their citizenship at registration. How many people could it affect? Voting rights advocates fear it risks affecting 200,000. It comes amid an unprecedented supreme court ruling that threw out Wisconsin’s redrawn electoral map, which created a new district to represent Black population growth. The descendants of enslaved and free Black people who were in the US in the 19th century could receive compensation for the harms of slavery after California’s reparations taskforce made the landmark recommendation. The taskforce voted 5-4 to recommend restitution based on lineage, rather than the broader category of race. It has been working through divisive questions of who should be eligible, with those pushing for a more limited scope arguing that those who migrated to the US in the 20th and 21st centuries did not experience the same harms as enslaved people. Other argued for reparations for all Black residents, saying that they continue to suffer from the effects of systemic racism. What reparations would people receive? It has not yet been decided; California would need to pass a new law. How many could be eligible? Two million of the state’s 2.6 millions Black Californians are estimated to be descendants of enslaved people, according to the taskforce. The UK government has given more than £5bn within the last three years to international projects connected to labour abuses and environmental damage, according to Guardian analysis. The funding comes from the government’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), and went towards projects including oil refineries. North Carolina congressman Madison Cawthorn will not face immediate disciplinary action after making claims about orgies in Washington and cocaine use. After meeting with Cawthorn, who is a controversialist and Trump supporter, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, told reporters his comments were “unacceptable”. Will Smith was asked to leave the Oscars after hitting Chris Rock but refused, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has said. It added that it had initiated disciplinary proceedings against Smith. Almost 500 ghost flights – those with no passengers, or less than 10% of capacity – left the UK between last October and December, data shows. As flying is one of the most carbon-polluting activities, the practice has angered environmentalists. It has been blamed on airports requiring airlines to run most of their flights in order to retain their landing slots – but despite this threshold being dropped from 80% to 50% in October 2021, there has been little effect on the number of ghost flights. Yu and Me Books has become a community oasis and literary hub for New York’s Asian American community since it opened in December. Amid a rise in racist attacks since the onset of the pandemic, 27-year-old owner Lucy Yu set the store up due to the “need for a sense of celebration and security” felt by the city’s Asian American community. “I wanted to do things for communities that look like me – immigrant communities.

3/31/2022,"Chelsea know the exhilarating feeling of edging a Women’s Super League title race. Last season they won the trophy on the final day and they go into the last five matches of this campaign one point clear of Arsenal at the top and will be confident of repeating the feat. It seems like Chelsea always peak at the right time and this is not luck but thanks to careful planning by Emma Hayes to get the best out of her players at the crucial points of the season. It is a risky tactic but when I played under her the idea was always to get the team to reach their optimum level when things started to matter. Chelsea were not at their best when this season started – losing to Arsenal – but as last weekend’s 9-0 win at Leicester shows, they look unstoppable now. When I was at Chelsea, you would start the season at 60-70% of your capacity and build up. There were no small-sided games because Hayes did not want any muscle injuries and the people coming back from international tournaments were gradually reintegrated whereas those who had benefited from a full pre-season were pushed a little harder. Through the season, Hayes will start working you harder during the week and tell you that you will go into the game fatigued but that you have to get through that – which is as much in the mind as it is physical – so you will come good towards the end of the campaign. There were times in games where we were fatigued and not at our best when I was there but we would get the result because we had the quality; and then when it did matter we were strong. Arsenal have a different approach and started like a house on fire, using the bounce from a new manager and signings to build momentum. Jonas Eidevall replaced Joe Montemurro over the summer and quickly brought in five players as he looked to return the intensity which seemed to have dropped off last season. Under Eidevall the team have become more direct, whereas the old Arsenal wanted to pass and keep the ball. They have been at their best this season when they have been direct, limiting their passes to get the ball forward as quickly as possible, and also using more width to deliver the ball to the players who can make a difference. Arsenal lost momentum when Leah Williamson was ruled out for two months with a hamstring injury. If she had stayed fit, the league would be in Arsenal’s hands now. They were hugely affected by her absence and forced to change their style. She gives them speed and cover in defence and is their best player in terms of playing out from the back and building attacks. My two players of the season are Williamson and Millie Bright, both right-sided centre-backs. Luckily for Chelsea, Bright has stayed fit and the team have continued to improve. It is not a coincidence that when Williamson was injured Arsenal suffered their only league defeat of the season, went out of the Continental Cup and lost the FA Cup final. Since her return they have started to pick up again. You could argue the signing of the forward Stina Blackstenius has improved Arsenal but if it does not matter how many strikers you have got or how many of the best players in the world you have up top, if you cannot defend, you will not win anything. Sign up for our new women’s football newsletter Chelsea have the experience of Hayes on their side. She has led the team to four of the past five WSL titles, proving she knows a thing or two about winning them. She has been coaching in the women’s game for 20-odd years, including in America, and she understands the league, the business side of things, how to assemble a team and she’s a good man-manager in terms of how she communicates with players and motivates people to get the best out of each individual. Her biggest strength, though, is to generate a winning culture within a club. To create that and replicate it is incredible. It has taken time but now it is being sustained. Chelsea have spent a lot of the season chasing and closing the gap but the mindset will not have changed since going top. There are still some tough fixtures for both sides: Chelsea have to face Tottenham twice and travel to Manchester United on the final day, and Arsenal have a rearranged north London derby to cope with. Tottenham are in good form, are looking at the Champions League spots and will be desperate to take a late scalp of one of their capital rivals. It’s been another brilliant WSL season as the women’s game continues to grow. It is an exciting time with the Euros coming up in England and we want a thrilling league finish that gets people even more excited for the summer as the game tries to attract a new audience who will then look forward to watching quality players in the WSL next season. The title race is too close to call and – as someone who played for Arsenal and Chelsea – being a neutral may be the best way to enjoy a tense finale that could come down to the last kick.",Sport/Football,Emma Hayes’s nous could give Chelsea edge over Arsenal in WSL title race | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/31/emma-hayes-could-give-chelsea-edge-over-arsenal-in-wsl-title-race
3/31/2022,"This story is published in collaboration with Grist. For Daniel Delgado, the Fourth of July marked a turning point in 2020. It was the first holiday after Covid-19 had kept much of America locked down. In nine days, he’d be entering his twenties. He planned to spend his birthday relishing the Arizona sun with friends, but in the meantime, the holiday offered him an opportunity to be celebrated by family and friends, surrounded by love and human connection — things that had been hard to come by that year. He spent the day at his aunt’s home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Wilmington, California. His parents, Sonia Banales and Roberto Delgado, and his large extended family remember laughing, grilling ribs and setting off fireworks. Shortly after midnight, as the celebration died down, Delgado left the house to drive a few friends home. He never made it back. About 2am, Delgado was shot and killed in the only place he ever called home, a small corner of Los Angeles tucked between the largest port in North America and the largest oil refinery in California. He was one of at least 160 people in the US who lost their lives to gun violence that weekend. The exceptional deadliness of Independence Day weekend is one of the few American norms that the pandemic did not disrupt. In the 20 months since Delgado’s death, his family has found little solace and fewer answers as they grapple with what happened that night. They’ve expressed disillusionment at the social support available to them; the police have not discovered a motive or firmly identified a suspect. “We know that he didn’t deserve to die like this,” said Banales, Delgado’s mother. “It hurts so badly.” “Every time I call [the police] they say, ‘I’m working on another case. I haven’t had time to work on Daniel’s case,’” she added. Banales claims that the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) has suggested to her that Delgado’s case has suffered due to “budget cuts” spurred by the historic protests against police violence the summer Delgado died. (Although the LAPD’s budget was cut by $150m in 2020, it then grew by $213m in 2021, making it the city’s largest police budget in history.) LAPD press representatives did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication of this article. Wilmington community members are no stranger to early death and the social inequality that drives it. The neighborhood is located in the Los Angeles city council district, home to the most federal public housing projects and federally regulated toxic sites of all the city’s 15 districts. The port in its backyard contributes to 1,200 premature deaths annually; the air pollution from the refineries on its soil and trucks on its streets contributes to 4,100 premature deaths across southern California; and a lack of green spaces, jobs, and safe housing contributes to the zip code’s five most populous census tracts being less healthy than 93% of the state, according to the California Healthy Places Index. As structural and environmental damages have piled up, interpersonal violence has followed. According to a Grist and Guardian analysis of California’s department of public health reports and the Los Angeles Times’ homicide tracking database, at least 189 people have been shot and killed (10 of them by police) in the community of 55,000 since the year 2000. That amounts to nearly 2.5 times as many fatal shootings as the Los Angeles county per capita average and four times as many as those experienced in the cities that border Wilmington – San Pedro, Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates – over the same time period. The vast majority of those shootings have taken place in the city’s industrial corridors, which are the west coast’s main arteries for oil production, trucking, and logistics. They are home to more than 200 oil drilling sites, five fossil fuel refineries, three railways, and dozens of truckyards and scrapyards. Delgado’s killing fits the trend: he was killed on the corner of Drumm Avenue and East Pacific Coast Highway, two streets flanked by shipping container overflow yards and metal scrapyards. According to southern California’s air pollution regulator, Wilmington is home to nearly 400 polluting sites, but their locations aren’t equally distributed. In 13 of the city’s 29 census blocks, where roughly 40% of the zip code’s residents live, there are just eight industrial sites. In the other 16 census tracts, there are nearly 370 industrial sites. Every single one of the community’s fatal shootings since 2000 have taken place in those industrialized tracts. These inequities can be traced to America’s history of racist housing policy, including the practice of redlining. In the mid-20th century, the federal government considered roughly half of Wilmington’s residential area to be “hazardous”, which cemented its industrial character by maintaining low homeownership rates and paltry government support. The legacy of pollution and disinvestment persists, and it is also connected to the area’s rate of violence: formerly redlined communities have significantly higher rates of gun violence than non-redlined neighborhoods. Academic research on the relationship between pollution, land use, and violence has not definitively established a physiological relationship between pollution, access to green space, and violence and aggression. But it is known that air pollutants act as stressors, eliciting endocrine stress responses in our brains that lead to irrational decisions and violent tendencies and also disturb the physical, cognitive, and emotional health of people exposed to it at high levels. And research has shown a strong correlative relationship between violent crimes and air pollution levels, and that violence rises in communities that don’t have access to public green space. In one study that combines environmental data with Los Angeles crime records between 2005 and 2013, researchers found that, even when controlled for many social, economic and circumstantial variables (such as weather), violent crime was 6.1 % higher on days with dirty air than on days with clean air. In another study focused on Youngstown, Ohio, researchers found that turning vacant lots into community green spaces drastically decreased crime, including gun violence. The research tends to support the “cues to care” theory – that if there is visible maintenance and care offered to shared spaces in communities, a feeling of security and social cohesion follows. The inclusion of natural landscapes, green spaces, and accessible outdoor community spaces helps mitigate the prevalence of violence, including gun violence, and pollution. Green spaces also help facilitate community interactions, which stifle interpersonal rifts. Wilmington enjoys few such “cues to care”, especially compared to its neighbors to the south and south-west: Wilmington is home to three times less park space, relative to its size than neighboring communities. Moreover, all but one of Wilmington’s green spaces are on land that is either a former industrial site or home to active and inactive oil wells, according to Los Angeles’ Zone Information and Map Access System. Since 2000, more than 100 times as many toxins – or 16m more pounds – have been released into Wilmington’s air and water compared to its neighbors, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “The slow violence that drives death [in Wilmington] – pollution – has become accepted and normalized,” said Julie Sze, a professor of American studies at the University of California, Davis, who studies the connection between violence and pollution. “Then the fast violence – gun violence – is seen as normal.” Wilmington’s current violence prevention strategies place a heavy emphasis on policing. Although 27% of Los Angeles’s record-setting $11.2bn budget for 2021 was allocated to the LAPD, less than 11% was allocated for transit, emergency management, neighborhood empowerment, community investment, housing, and creating more climate-resilient infrastructure. Despite the prevalence of policing as a violence prevention strategy, data suggests that Wilmington residents do not utilize the massive resource. According to data shared by LAPD after a public records request, the department received just one single call for service due to shots being fired in the neighborhood between January 2019 and January 2022. Nearly 30 people were shot and killed in Wilmington over that same period. “I think [policing] needs a lot of improvement,” said Roberto Delgado, Daniel’s father. “Someone took our son from us. They took everything from us, but there has been nothing done about it.” Wilmington, a place contending with overlapping forms of social and environmental violence, shows that there is an opportunity to expand the scope of public health interventions for violence prevention beyond individuals and into the physical environment, according to Octavio Ramirez, a community organizer and director of community gardens at the Wilmington-based Strength Based Community Change. Ramirez was born and raised in Wilmington. He plans to die there, too, but before that he wants to see a change. “Growing up, I’ve noticed how a lot of things relate to each other here,” Ramirez said. “How the community being poorer means there aren’t as many good jobs; and how it being home to more renters means there’s not enough room for people; and how there not being enough places for people to relax outside leaves people agitated — how all this leads to more violence, more shootings.” To fill the gaps that Ramirez has noticed in his community — and to build on skills that his dad, a gardener, passed on to him — he has turned his activism toward community gardening. With the support of his community organization, the local city council member’s office, and grants from local refineries (which he admits is ironic given the industry’s impact on public health in his hometown), Ramirez hopes the “Heart of the Harbor” garden, which is located in one of Wilmington’s top five hot spots for gun violence, will open doors for a trapped community. “At the bare minimum, this community garden provides a place for people to relax,” he said. “But what I really hope it does is provide a place for people to build community, learn how to grow their own food, and feel connected to each other and our home.” The 1-acre garden, home to 66 raised beds which can be rented by community members for $10 per month, also includes a public kitchen stocked with a state-of-the-art grill and stove top, as well as a worm farm used for composting. In the coming year it’s expected to expand to include a “food forest” with 80 to 120 fruit trees. It’s the first step in a community-centered movement to reframe Wilmington residents’ realities, their access to the environment around them, and how they relate to each other, Ramirez says. He’s already seen a difference. The garden, and programs like it, are meant to provide sustainable models for reducing violent interactions that are community-led and do not rely on burdening victims. “In a way [the garden] can help turn a very hostile environment into something really cool,” Ramirez said. “A lot of people just don’t see opportunity here,” he added, “but I still have faith in my community.” This article was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2021 Data Fellowship.",News/US news,‘Slow violence that drives death’: a California port city’s struggle with pollution and shootings,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/31/california-port-city-pollution-gun-violence
3/31/2022,"It happens late in the season. A woman with long, salt-and-pepper hair stands in line at the Trader Joe’s on 72nd Street in Manhattan, evangelizing to her fellow shoppers about the magic of Sumo oranges. We can’t hear what she is saying, but whatever it is, it’s effective. The camera pans: half the line has added Sumos to their carts. When she posted a video of the 16 March moment to TikTok, Elizabeth Venter, a 28-year-old clothing designer, never expected to spark a Sumo conversation. But 7.7m views later, Venter’s video has precipitated a watershed moment for citrus on the internet. TikToks of first-time Sumo buyers specifically citing the influence of the anonymous New Yorker abound, with new converts reporting back from Florida and Virginia to California and beyond. This article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. “There are so many other videos [with people saying], ‘Now I’m going to buy Sumo oranges because the woman at the 72nd Street Trader Joe’s convinced me!’” says Venter. TikTok may be a hotbed of weird food trends, but “I’ve never seen it specifically with a fruit before,” she adds. There are a number of reasons the clip works: because of the music it was paired with (Hello, Hello, Elton John featuring Lady Gaga); because Trader Joe’s is social media catnip; because it was a perfect only-in-New-York moment. But also: the oranges themselves. Venter did not include audio in her clip, out of respect (“I don’t know her!”), but she walks me through the evangelist’s key talking points: Sumos are easy to peel, extremely juicy very large and extremely in-demand. “She said the first time she had them was at Whole Foods, and people were grabbing them off the shelves like they were free alcohol,” Venter says. The Sumo moment has been a long time coming. Shiranui, as the fruit is called, are a Japanese invention, an extraordinarily sweet hybrid of mandarin and orange, explains David Karp, a citrus researcher with the University of California, Riverside and noted “fruit detective”. In Japan, they’ve been marketed since the late 90s under the trade name Dekopon – “pon” for ponkan, and “deko” meaning “bump”, in reference to the fruit’s distinctive shape – but didn’t make their long-awaited US debut until 2011, when Suntreat Growers & Shippers started marketing the fruit as Sumo Citrus. In the last few years they have become even more widely available, now under the mantel of AC Brands. Other Shiranui growers have entered the market – Trinity Fruit Company calls them Big Honey, for example – but Sumo has become the default name for the bumpy orange with the top knot in the US. “The loved child,” Karp informs me, “has many names, and that’s never been more true than with Shiranui.” They are spectacular, seedless, gargantuan, startlingly sweet. Where a satsuma might be a 12 on the Brix sweetness scale, a Shiranui can be up to 18. But sweetness alone is not enough. “You judge a Mozart symphony by how loudly it’s played?” asks Karp. “No. You want balance. And Shiranui, when properly picked and shipped, has real good acidity to it.” For a fruit to become a sensation, a few things need to happen: it needs to be delicious, obviously. But it also needs to grow well and abundantly. It has to stand up to shipping and to storage. And it needs financial backing. “You need to have the money to get it into orbit, basically,” says Karp. “If something is delicious enough, it might take off on its own,” but probably, you’re going to need “some marketing muscle behind that”. AC Brands gave Sumos that push. “Meet Your New Healthy Obsession,” read a full-page advert in the New Yorker for the giant, dimpled fruit. Sumos have also wrangled premier placement in grocery aisles across the country as well as in-store promotion and billboards. The fruit is “a little weird” but “enormously delicious”, the fruit’s television ads declare – a sentiment echoed by an army of paid influencers, who, all across the internet, are singing the praises of the fruit. It isn’t totally unheard of for a single fruit to get this kind of backing – Halos, a branded mandarin, had a robust TV ad campaign – but, Karp observes, “it’s quite rare.” “They promote their fruit the way Doritos promotes Doritos,” says Angela Scarfia, an exotic and specialty produce marketer who’s built an Instagram following hyping less familiar fruits. She started noticing Sumos in the grocery store three or four years ago, she tells me – how could she not? “They brand the heck out of their company. And they make sure you see their products.” Late last year, she officially signed on to start producing Sumo content for this season. Karp says “the whole social media thing makes me want to vomit”, but even he admits that Sumos have certain advantages that make it unusually well-suited for these contemporary times. With their dimpled skins and unmistakable bumps, they are instantly recognizable – a true character orange. “They’ve got this sort of scraggly look about them,” Karp agrees, approvingly. “And I think they came up with a great name.” Even their intense seasonality is arguably an asset. Sumos are generally available from January until April, and what is produce, really, if not the ultimate limited-edition drop? Viral moments fade, and seasons end, but Venter, for her part, remains a committed Sumo fan. “I think they’re worth the hype,” she laughs. “A lot of people were saying, ‘Oh, Cara Cara oranges are better. I disagree … It’s the best orange I’ve ever had.”",Lifestyle/Food,The sweetest limited-edition drop: how Sumo oranges became the latest it fruit,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/31/sumo-oranges-fruit-sensation-trader-joes
3/31/2022,"Ingmar Bergman’s 1972 feature is rereleased for its 50th anniversary and it looks even more intimately disturbing and pornographically painful than ever: a supernatural horror-tragedy of three sisters, and nothing could be less Chekhovian. Tableau scenes from a spiritual hell are vouchsafed to us, with cries of pain, surging and insistent zoom shots on troubled faces, together with inner-life static portraits, whose subjects stare dispassionately at us out of the screen in half-shadow while the whispering of despair susurrates on the soundtrack. In the early years of the last century, or the late years of the century before that, Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is living alone in the house where she grew up, attended by the family maid Anna (Kari Sylwan). Lonely, wretched Agnes has never married and is now dying of cancer. Her two married sisters Maria and Karin have come home, supposedly to nurse her, although they are selfishly concerned with their own unhappy marriages; the real business of caring is of course down to Anna, who sometimes devotedly gets in to bed with the patient in a strange pietà. Agnes’s suffering secretly disgusts and horrifies her sisters, intensifying their own disappointment with life and fear of death. As they wait for her end to come, the long days stretch past in a weirdly eroticised torpor, to the pitiless ticking of a clock and the ting of the quarter-hour that pierces like a hypodermic needle without morphine. (And despite having seen this film many times before, this is the first time I have noticed that no one talks about ordinary pain relief.) Maria (Liv Ullmann) has inherited her late mother’s beauty, vanity and melancholy caprice; Ullmann also plays the mother in flashback. She has been having an affair with David (Erland Josephson), the supercilious and cynical doctor who calls at the house to attend to Agnes, who may also be in love with David: his clinical touch is the nearest thing she has to a caress. David’s affair with Maria started when he came to tend to Anna’s ailing child who has since died: a chilling ill-omen. Maria’s pathetic husband Joakim (Henning Moritzen) has made an impotent attempt on his own life, clearly suspecting the truth about his wife. Karin (played by the magnificently charismatic and powerful Ingrid Thulin) hates her husband Fredrik (Georg Arlin) and herself, a loathing that culminates in an unwatchable scene of self-mutilation; her dread may be due to being complicit with Maria in some unsubtly indicated incestuous transgression. They are desperate for the ordeal of Agnes’s death agony to be over. But it appears that death is not the end. Cries and Whispers has the impact of a scary movie; for all its refinement and severity – and the echoes of Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1955 film Ordet – there is also something diabolically inspired in the aggressive way it confronts the audiences with its physicality. (Ari Aster said that before shooting his horror film Hereditary, he showed Cries and Whispers to his cast.) This film burns, like ice held to the skin.  Cries and Whispers is released on 1 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Cries and Whispers review – Ingmar Bergman’s diabolically inspired claustrophobic horror,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/31/cries-and-whispers-review-ingmar-bergman-horror

An evening yakatabune cruise is perfect for catching the breeze on the waters of Tokyo Bay. These small, traditional boats, necklaced with lanterns, have transported centuries of sightseers on moon-watching and cherry-blossom parties. Now, they offer sumptuous dinners afloat. As our flamboyant chefs tossed knives and chopped ingredients to prepare Edo-style food, we floated past the illuminated Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Tower and the Skytree.

It calls itself a ferry but that belies the magic of it. It’s a tiny boat with a knowledgable, friendly local skipper, and although you’ll depart on time, you’ll arrive only when there’s nothing more of interest to be seen in the sea – whales, seals, dolphins, birdlife, the lot. The journey is the adventure.arisaig.co.ukAbi Ross knows so much about the wildlife and broads which he is keen to share. The trip runs from Horsey Staithe and takes you out across Horsey Mere and into the narrow channels through the reed beds. All you can see are reeds, the tops of windmills and church towers. The wind rustles through the reeds, murmuring as it has done for generations.

3/31/2022,"You have to feel for singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright, whose memoir frames her as the least celebrated and – in her opinion – least desirable member of a revered musical family. Growing up in Montreal and New York, the younger of Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III’s two children, she was given multiple reasons to doubt herself. Her mother told her she was “the definition of mediocrity”; her brother, Rufus, claimed he was McGarrigle’s favourite child; and her father, absent for much of her childhood, wrote a song directed at her. Titled I’d Rather Be Lonely, it detailed the ways she displeased him: “I think that I need some space / Every day you’re in my face / How can I get rid of you? / I’d rather be lonely.” (Martha later countered with Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole.) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbdsR5cDJlk ] With that kind of raw material at her disposal, it’s remarkable that this isn’t another celebrity-tribulation story. Wainwright, though, isn’t that kind of celebrity. You’d struggle to call her a celebrity at all – despite abundant critical acclaim and a contacts book that includes Pete Townshend, Sean Lennon and Van Morrison (he was “a schmuck”, of which more below), she’s a steadfastly cult figure, albeit one connected enough to be able to casually note, “During [a recording session], Donald Fagen of Steely Dan dropped in to hear how things were progressing.” Her refusal to be impressed by big names also provides one of the book’s funniest lines. Recounting the day the Police invited her mother and aunt to their studio, she laconically adds: “Or maybe it was Mark Knopfler, not the Police.” That conveys the tenor of her writing: acerbic, often hilarious and more candid than it should be. It’s easy to understand why she “might regret” telling some of these stories, especially those related to her rancorous 2018 divorce from producer Brad Albetta. But that’s Wainwright, and her transparency is the book’s golden ticket. Spoiler: there’s a mostly happy ending. She and her family learn to live with their differences, she finds love again, and her mother’s 2006 cancer diagnosis leads to greater kinship between them. Because she has never been a big name herself, Wainwright views her career as something of a failure, an undercurrent that throbs throughout the book, along with her incessant doubts about herself. She’s too loud, too brash, not pretty enough to attract the men she falls in love with, and she writes about it with flinty humour. (“I found it devastating that I was thought of as handsome, at best” is her appraisal of her looks.) Coming from a famous clan and having seen success close up makes it all the harder. Wainwright believes in her music and loves performing, but continually compares herself with her more garlanded family and friends, undermining her confidence even further. “Though I was a ‘daughter-of’ twice over, doors seemed closed to me,” she writes, brooding that sons-of such as Sean Lennon and Chris Stills quickly got record deals and media attention while she had to slog for years. In the early stages of her career, an invaluable source of income was touring with Rufus as his support act, and selling her self-released EP at the gigs. Eventually, aged 28, she signed to a Canadian label and put out her self-titled debut album. Four more studio LPs have followed, most recently 2021’s post-divorce release Love Will Be Reborn. To the initiated, she is one of a kind, greatly admired for her blood-letting autobiographical songs and adventurous one-offs, such as a live album of Edith Piaf numbers, sung in French. Before having children, she lived an indie dissolute life, with plenty of drugs, unfulfilling sex and dysfunction in the mix – she was the sort of hedonist whose close friend gave her “a lot of good blow” as a wedding present. And she doesn’t hesitate to call a schmuck a schmuck. Wainwright found Van Morrison so boorish backstage after she had opened a show for him, she couldn’t believe this was the same man who had made one of her favourite albums, Veedon Fleece. (It didn’t stop her loving the record.) In short, she has had a life worth documenting. At the end of 244 remarkable pages, she signs off with a typically self-effacing line: “Perhaps I am someone whose luck gets better halfway through. That would be good.” It would be good, and she would deserve it.  Stories I Might Regret Telling You by Martha Wainwright is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

3/31/2022,"As social media companies promise to crack down on Russian disinformation about the war in Ukraine, studies show they continue to fall short, allowing disproven narratives to reach millions. Facebook failed to label 80% of articles on its platform promoting a fast-spreading conspiracy theory that the US is funding the use of bioweapons in Ukraine, according to a study released Friday by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The nonprofit disinformation research group studied a sample of posts from between 24 February and 14 March sharing external articles containing baseless claims about bioweapons. It found Facebook in 80% of cases failed to label posts as either “missing context”, containing “partly false information” or “false information” outright. “If our researchers can identify false information about Ukraine openly circulating on its platform, it is within Meta’s capability to do the same,” said CCDH chief executive Imran Ahmed. “But we found that in the vast majority of cases, conspiracy theories are given a free pass.” The bioweapons theory began to spread in the early days of the war on Ukraine, amongst fringe QAnon accounts, ultimately making its way to larger platforms such as Fox News. The White House has condemned the myth, saying it may have been manufactured by Moscow to justify a possible use of chemical weapons against Ukraine. But it continues to spread across social media, including Facebook. CCDH researchers used the social analytics tool NewsWhip to identify more than 120 articles from external sites that had false or misleading claims about bioweapons labs or misrepresented statements made by US officials and found articles in the sample had received more than 150,000 likes, comments and shares on Facebook. CCDH has called on Meta to more thoroughly enforce its “false information” and “partly false information” labels and expand the use of its existing “missing context” label. “Russia’s propaganda campaigns have benefited for years from Meta turning a blind eye to disinformation,” Ahmed said. “Despite taking action against state channels under enormous pressure, Meta is failing badly to contain major disinformation narratives that benefit Putin’s regime.” Previous studies published by CCDH found Facebook struggled to enforce its own rules surrounding the labeling of state-sponsored news sources. And it is not alone: another study from Media Matters for America found YouTube had not only failed to remove thousands of videos about the biolabs theory, but had also profited off them through monetized channels. While some experts have conceded Facebook is now stepping up to more thoroughly crack down on state propaganda, others say disinformation will continue to spread on social media as long as it is baked into the views-driven business model. “At the end of the day, the algorithm will always prioritize misinformation because it is contentious, and Facebook makes more money when we are arguing with one another,” Ahmed said. “To reduce disinformation spread, we have to cut it off at the source.”",News/Technology,Facebook fails to label 80% of posts promoting bioweapons conspiracy theory,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/31/facebook-disinformation-war-ukraine-russia
3/31/2022,"Even on bright spring days in New York City’s Chinatown, Yu and Me Books – with its dark brown shelves, thoughtfully placed lamps and fairy lights strung around the store – feels as cozy as settling in to a good book. The calm ambience of the shop is a contrast to the bustle of the neighborhood. The park across the street is home to frequent mahjong, ping-pong and soccer matches. Those heading to popular restaurants and bakeries around the corner pack the sidewalks, dodging families wheeling shopping bags toward grocery stores. Since the bookstore opened in December, Yu and Me Books has become a literary and community hub. Go to the store on a weekend, and it will be packed with people browsing its shelves and sipping coffee. Signed copies of recent releases are showcased around the shop, and the store has hosted readings and events with authors from around the country. The bookstore’s opening in December, and the love and support it has gotten since, is a sign of resiliency from a community that continues to withstand some of the pandemic’s harshest impacts. Asian Americans have seen an uptick in race-based attacks since the beginning of the pandemic, with more than 10,000 self-reported hate incidents reported across the country since March 2020, according to the non-profit Stop AAPI Hate. New York this year has specifically seen some of the most brutal crimes against Asian Americans. In February, a woman was murdered in her apartment in Chinatown, just half a mile away from the bookstore. In early March, an Asian woman in a suburb north of the city was hit in the head 125 times by a stranger. To Lucy Yu, 27, owner of Yu and Me Books, the attacks highlight the need for a sense of celebration and security among people who have become accustomed to fear because of their identities. Yu opened the store with the idea that it would be dedicated to carrying books by writers of color and immigrants, particularly Asian Americans. “Especially with the hate crimes that were going on, I wanted to do things for communities that look like me – immigrant communities. Something that makes them feel a little less alone, a little less scared in the world,” she said. “Our immigrant communities can come together and find a lot of commonality and connection with each other.” The concept of Yu and Me Books is inspired by Yu’s own upbringing in west Los Angeles, where she was raised by a single mother who emigrated from China. Reading was an important part of Yu’s childhood, but she was often left disappointed by the lack of representation she saw in books. “I was a big reader as a kid, but I didn’t see myself in a lot of books,” Yu said. “That’s not just my experience. Any child growing up in an environment where no one looks like them or very few look like them, that’s what they experience.” To Yu, opening a bookstore was a far-off dream, a plan after retirement. Before opening the store, Yu was a chemical engineer and a supply chain manager – jobs where she found stability, but no passion. But the death of a close friend in 2020 led her to realize the lack of fulfillment in her life and re-evaluate the possibility of opening a bookshop. “I had an urgency to figure out how I’m going to do things that fuel me with love and passion and joy,” Yu said. “And this was it, so I started putting the business plan together in January 2021.” The name of the store is not only a clever pun, but is also a recognition of her mom, whose initials are “YM”. While she has come to love the shop, Yu recalls her mother’s skepticism over her plan to spend her life’s savings to open the bookstore. “When I first told her about this store, she’s like, ‘What the hell? You’re an engineer! You have a 401K,’” Yu said, adding that she understood her mother’s initial reaction. “It took her a while to get used to the instability [of running the bookstore]. She came here to have stability. She escaped the Cultural Revolution, all these things. So I understand the perspective that she has, it’s just very different from mine.” In May 2021, Yu started a GoFundMe for the store, stating her goal to open the first Asian American female-owned bookstore in Manhattan. Within two months, she raised $18,000. While working her full-time job, Yu spent her weekends looking for retail space. When she came across the location at 44 Mulberry Street, she knew it was the perfect spot.“I saw this space and it just felt so right, like the shelves were already there. I could envision it was going to be a cozy spot,” she said. The bookstore sits on a street nicknamed “funeral row” for the funeral homes that are located along the block. Yu said that the space, which used to be a funeral supply store, feels even more special in this somber setting. “I feel like I have to respect all these generations of people,” Yu said. “Their stories are here on the shelves.” Yu designed the store with reading, gathering and community in mind. A reading alcove in the back features portraits of Chinatown residents taken by photographer David Zeng. Chairs and small tables are placed throughout the store. A shelf of books is dedicated to her friend who died in 2020. Yu serves coffee and chats with customers sitting at a wooden counter in the middle of the store. Above this counter are framed prints, including a portrait Yu painted of her dog, Odie, and photos of Asian American activism taken by the late photographer Corky Lee. Though the store was built to showcase diverse writers and artists, Yu and Me Books has also turned into a community space for safety and healing in light of the recent violent incidents against Asian Americans. In mid-March, hundreds of people lined the blocks around the store to get free pepper spray and personal safety devices from Soar Over Hate, a non-profit that set up a distribution table outside. Yu and Me also hosted the Asian American Writers’ Workshop (AAWW), which held an event in memory of the victims of the Atlanta spa shootings on the anniversary of the attack. “Yu and Me Books is just so perfect,” said Lily Philpotts, programs manager for AAWW, who has coordinated several events at the store. “It’s in the heart of Chinatown. It’s really beautiful to just walk in there and be immersed in that community.” Those who visit Yu and Me Books agree that they see it as a physical love letter to Chinatown and immigrant communities, and there is a special sense of belonging when they enter the store. “I felt really safe in there. It’s just a really nice, positive, uplifting space,” Celina Liu, an ad ops specialist based in Brooklyn, said of her visit to the store. She noted that the store highlights authors that may not be prominently featured by other bookstores or bestsellers lists. Leanne Gan, a Brooklyn-based designer and illustrator, said there is an “immediate comfort when you walk in”, and its existence gives her a sense of optimism amid news of violence against Asian Americans. “I feel like the store is a huge celebration for the community and something that we can all look to,” Gan said. “I feel so grateful to have the store.” Yu said her favorite part of running the store has been meeting customers and hearing their stories. A few people have become regulars, coming in once a week for a new book and to chat with Yu. Local writers, artists and photographers have come to see the store as a place to showcase their work. “That’s really special,” she said. “There’s so much beauty in Chinatown that I don’t think gets represented as much as it should be.”",Arts/Books,"Amid a rise in anti-Asian hate, a bookstore in New York’s Chinatown is helping its community heal ",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/31/yu-and-me-bookstore-chinatown-new-york-community

3/31/2022,"An MPs committee has rejected the government’s choice for the next chair of the Charity Commission, blaming ministers for a “slapdash and unimaginative choice” in selecting the one-time Tory parliamentary candidate Orlando Fraser. While the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee said it had no grounds for concern about Fraser as an individual, it had serious reservations about the selection process, including the lack of diversity in the shortlist. The committee chair, Tory MP Julian Knight, said: “While we recognise Mr Fraser’s potential to do the job, such a slapdash and unimaginative approach to his recruitment means we cannot formally endorse his appointment.” The failure to endorse Fraser reflects deep frustration in the committee at the government’s chaotic handling of the appointment. The post has been open for more than a year and dogged by allegations of political interference by ministers. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, must now decide whether to disregard the committee and appoint Fraser regardless. The previous commission chair, Tina Stowell, was rejected by the committee, but took up the job after the then culture secretary Matt Hancock waved through her nomination. Educated at public school and Cambridge University, Fraser is a white, upper middle-class barrister. He is the son of the late Tory MP Sir Hugh Fraser, and the writer Antonia Fraser. His grandfather was the Labour peer Frank Pakenham. He stood for the Conservatives at the 2005 general election, and had close links to the right-of-centre thinktank Centre for Social Justice. He told the DCMS committee hearing he was no longer a party member, and had no interest in party politics. Fraser was not the government’s first choice, after being interviewed for the £62,000-a-year job in the autumn. However, he was shortlisted, and when the preferred candidate Martin Thomas quit the post days after being approved by the committee in December, Fraser was invited to step in. Both the committee and the voluntary sector were keen that the appointment process be re-run, not least to ensure that potential candidates could be drawn from a wider and more diverse background. Ironically, ministers had indicated at the time they had been disappointed at the lack of diversity. The committee’s report said: “Despite these protestations, [ministers] resulting candidate, while likely competent, represents yet another archetypal and unimaginative choice from this limited shortlist. We see this as demonstrative of the department’s lack of care, attention, and commitment to quality in this important public appointment.” Knight called on the DCMS to change its approach to public appointments: “Unless it changes tack, trust in the process will continue to be damaged and we risk missing out on getting the most qualified people from all backgrounds for these very important jobs.”",News/Society,MPs reject government’s ‘unimaginative’ choice for Charity Commission chair,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/mps-reject-governments-unimaginative-choice-for-charity-commission-chair

The incident happened shortly before 7pm on Wednesday at the filling station in Dungannon, County Tyrone. Two fire crews were called. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said they used specialist breathing apparatus, with one firefighter using a 9-metre ladder and a harness. The boy was conscious but had sustained minor injuries to his back. The Northern Ireland ambulance service confirmed he had been taken to the Craigavon area hospital for further checks.

3/31/2022,"My father, Leslie Durham, who has died aged 87, committed his life to helping others through a career spent at Oxfam, a commitment to peace, and a dedication to his faith and Quaker values. A keen artist who painted throughout his life, in 1957 he was asked to design and organise the production of Oxfam’s first Christmas cards, to test how useful they would be for raising funds. He said: “Nobody had time to think how successful they would be but it’s amazing to have been at the beginning of something that has ultimately raised millions of pounds to help people overcome poverty and suffering around the world.” Born in Nelson, Lancashire, to Samuel Durham, an iron turner, and Rose (nee Ladell), Leslie went to the local further education college, where he studied art. In 1952, after finishing college, he was called up for national service, but applied to be a conscientious objector. This was refused, as was his appeal, and he was sent to Walton jail in Liverpool. Much later in life, these principles wedded to his stubbornness led Leslie to refuse an MBE honour offered to recognise his career at Oxfam. He never saw what he did as remarkable and he had no desire to think he was better than anyone else, particularly as he did not support the monarchy. Following several weeks in prison and a year of working in a furniture shop he joined the Friends Ambulance Unit, and did a stint with the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, which became Oxfam. In the spring of 1956 he went to Greece with the FAU. Stationed for a while in the Greek island of Zakynthos, he decorated an orphanage and painted a large mural. On his return to the UK he worked at Oxfam’s first shop in Broad Street, Oxford. From there he was offered a paid position with the charity and from 1959 began managing shops across the country until his retirement in 1994.As well as making and selling paintings in aid of Oxfam, he also designed sets for an amateur dramatic group, where he met Anne Davies, who was working as a typist at the publisher Blackwell’s. They married at the Friends Meeting House in Oxford in 1959 and went on to have three children. Leslie’s design skills and love of art were always part of his life, and his children and grandchildren all had creations on their birthdays, whether a hand-drawn card, a model, or a toy. In 2007, to mark the 50th anniversary of Oxfam Christmas cards, his original 1957 design was reproduced. Leslie’s other great love was of the British countryside. He was a keen rambler and holidays were under canvas in the Yorkshire Dales, Northumbria, Scottish Highlands and, probably his favourite place, the Lake District. He is survived by Anne, his children, Jean, Mike and me, and five grandchildren, Maisie, Peter, Matthew, Kate and Lydia.",News/World news,Leslie Durham obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/leslie-durham-obituary
3/31/2022,"Parts of eastern England and Scotland woke up to flurries of snow on Thursday morning, with more snow, hail and ice expected in a dramatic contrast to last week’s spring-like weather. Top temperatures across the UK are plummeting from last week’s highs of 20C to reach a maximum of 10C this weekend due to air coming from the Arctic bringing temperatures below average for the second week of spring. West Yorkshire woke up to a deep blanket of snow on Thursday morning after several hours of snowfall during the night, although Manchester and Durham also saw significant drifts, and some light flurries were seen further south-east in the east Midlands and East Anglia. Temperatures fell below freezing between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, with some councils such as Newcastle City issuing emergency protocols to deal with the sudden change, including services to help people sleeping rough. A Met Office yellow weather warning for ice covering a large swathe of eastern Scotland, north-east England and Yorkshire until 10am on Thursday stated that “snow and hail showers could lead to icy surfaces, with possible travel disruption”, with snowfall potentially affecting roads at high elevations. Widespread frost is forecast for Thursday evening, and a spokesperson for the Met Office said that more weather warnings could be issued for Friday morning. Meteorologist Matty Box said there was currently a “cold air mass” over the UK. He said: “There is an ice warning out at the moment. If there’s any melt and it refreezes over night then there’s an ice risk. I suspect there will be a similar risk for Thursday night to Friday morning.” He added that there will be a similar chance of concentrated snow, rain and sleet showers in eastern and northern areas of the UK over Thursday night and Friday morning as well. The weather is set to gradually improve over the weekend, with “a fair amount of sunshine” and some sunny spells, Box said. “Showers will become less frequent, but still with the chance of some wintry showers in the east coast and the North Sea coast in particular through Saturday,” Box said.",News/UK news,Parts of the UK wake up to snow as more wintery weather expected,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/parts-of-the-uk-wake-up-to-snow-as-more-wintery-weather-expected
3/31/2022,"The share price of Sir Martin Sorrell’s advertising business has slumped further after a surprise delay from its auditors caused the postponement of financial results and a dive in the company’s valuation. S4 Capital’s share price dropped by 36% on Wednesday afternoon after it announced the delay by the auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers without outlining a reason. On Thursday morning it dropped by a further 4.2% to 298p, its lowest point since June 2020. The company said it had received notice “at 2:30pm” on Wednesday from PwC that “they were unable to complete the work necessary for S4 Capital to release the preliminary statement tomorrow morning”. Sorrell started S4 in May 2018, only weeks after he was ousted as chief executive of WPP, the company he transformed from a shopping basket manufacturer into a FTSE 100 advertising and marketing agency. His departure followed allegations of personal misconduct, which he has always strenuously denied, and he left without having to go through a non-compete period. Since then Sorrell has built up S4 through near-incessant dealmaking, and its market value reached £4.8bn in September, closing in on the valuations of some FTSE 100 companies as it benefited from the economic rebound from the pandemic. However, since then its share price has fallen back dramatically, and the company’s market value fell by £1bn on Wednesday to £1.7bn. The decrease has dented Sorrell’s net worth: he owns 10% of S4 stock, suggesting his worth on paper fell by almost £100m on Wednesday and Thursday alone. Delayed financial results often prompt investors to sell because of fears that auditors have found problems, although S4 did not offer any update on Thursday morning on why the results were postponed. It is the second time S4 has suggested that results had been delayed, after PwC at the start of March “requested a further period to complete its audit work” because of the “impact of Covid and Omicron on travel and resource allocation, particularly in the Netherlands”. S4 said on Wednesday it would release its results for 2021 “as soon as PwC have completed their work”. It added that it believed the results for 2021 remained “within the range of market expectations and continued to trade strongly in the first two months of 2022”.",News/Business,Share price of Martin Sorrell’s S4 Capital slumps again after auditor delay,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/share-price-of-martin-sorrells-s4-capital-slumps-again-after-auditor-delay
3/31/2022,"Deborah Hutcheon, a retired support worker, lives in Bristol. “I call this my hobbit house,” says Deborah, 61. “I bought it last June after just one rushed viewing. I needed to relocate from Essex to Bristol in a hurry, to be nearer my daughter, Holly, who’s 26 and was having a difficult pregnancy with her first child – my first grandchild.” Deborah downsized drastically almost overnight. “My previous house, where I’d lived for 20 years, had two double bedrooms, with a separate living room, dining room and conservatory; whereas this has one bedroom and bathroom upstairs, and downstairs there’s a tiny kitchen and a living room that opens on to both the street and the garden. “Everything happens in the living room – it’s my hallway, dining room, entertaining space and TV room. As it’s just over three by three metres square, that’s a lot to fit in.” Although the house was small, it was perfect in terms of location. “I can’t drive long distances and it’s just five minutes from Holly,” says Deborah. “She had a very traumatic birth – Olivia was 12lb 6oz – and for the first few months they were back and forth to hospital. So, I’ve never regretted moving; I was exactly where I needed to be.” Although the house served its purpose while Deborah was in crisis mode; over the winter the cramped space took its toll, particularly as she has clinical anxiety and depression, which worsens in the colder months. “Being stuck indoors, it felt cold, dark, claustrophobic and depressing – my heart would sink when I walked in the door,” she says. “There was nowhere to put coats and shoes; my old furniture was too big for the space; the slatted blinds meant passers-by could see straight into the room; there was nowhere to eat dinner or sit with friends; all my belongings were piled everywhere and there was hardly any storage. I needed light, I needed privacy, and I desperately needed space to relax.” IKEA believes that every home should be a sanctuary, but according to its 2021 Life at Home report, less than half of us say our homes meet our needs. Perhaps that’s not surprising given how hard our homes need to work these days – as offices and gyms, as well as places to rest and relax. So how can we get that feeling of sanctuary back? First, we need to understand what sanctuary is. IKEA’s research found that it is made up of three elements: function – whether a room works as you need it to; emotional stability – whether the room makes you feel happy and calm; and space – or rather, the feeling of enough space (even a big room can feel cramped if poorly designed). Deborah’s living room had a major space issue, which had a knock-on effect to how it functioned and how it made her feel. So, IKEA’s interior design team stepped in to help her make the house feel spacious. “With a small, tricky room like this, with lots of doors, windows and the stairs, you obviously have to work out how to maximise the space, but you also have to consider your needs and dreams, as well as the functionality – how you want to live in it,” says IKEA designer Clotilde Passalacqua. She is part of a team taking on three makeovers for the Guardian over the next few months, to show how little changes can make a big difference. “We began by looking at what needs to happen in the space, as this will influence the final layout,” Clotilde continues. “For instance, when Deborah enters the house, she immediately needs somewhere to put her coat, shoes and keys, so we added hooks and a wall tidy by the door. And in the evenings, she needs somewhere she can sit and put her feet up, so we chose a comfortable compact sofa and footstool, and positioned them opposite the television. Everything else then fitted around this.” When it comes to storage, being honest about how much stuff you want and need to find homes for is crucial. “Be realistic about how you live, and actually count your belongings before you buy anything, so that you pick the right solution,” says Clotilde. “There’s no point having a lovely shoe rack if it doesn’t fit all your shoes and you have to stuff the rest under the sofa!” Giving everything a dedicated home will also help reduce clutter. “We used a Besta unit as a television stand and filled it with baskets and boxes, to keep Deborah’s bits and pieces neatly together in one place,” says Clotilde. Another trick is to look for furniture with hidden functionality, and items you can use in more than one way. “The lid of the footstool lifts up to store blankets inside; while the top drawer of the Bissa shoe cabinet by the back door is being used for stationery rather than shoes,” says Clotilde. Deborah was surprised by how much was fitted into the room. “I used to think that, to avoid a room feeling cluttered, less was more when it comes to furniture. But all you need is the right piece for the space. I’m surprised how many more places I have to put things now,” she says. “Things like the shoe rack and the picture ledge shelf behind my sofa – for displaying photos and mementos – are so clever, particularly as those walls were unused before.” Smart small-space living is about using every inch without overwhelming the room. “Work out where to compromise,” says Clotilde. “Deborah needed a table and chairs for entertaining but was happy not to have them out permanently. She wanted to keep the cosy armchair from her previous house so we tucked a fold-up table and chairs behind it. Yes, she has to unfold them when guests visit, but it means she has that extra floorspace the rest of the time.” Light has a big effect on the feeling of space in a room, and the team replaced Deborah’s clunky wooden blinds with a three-layered solution. “The Sandvedel roller blind inside the window recess stops people peering in, but still lets in plenty of light and leaves the windowsill free as a useful surface; and two layers of sheer curtains add softness, and can be closed individually or together,” says Clotilde. For Deborah, it has achieved exactly the effect she wanted: “I love the way the light comes into the room now. I have privacy, but it’s much brighter, and the floaty fabric is so calming. It’s made such a difference.” A few finishing touches – plants to bring the outside in; cushions for subtle colour and texture – and the transformation was complete. “It’s amazing how much bigger the room feels,” Deborah says. “Everything is hidden neatly away, and every piece of furniture has a purpose. From the draught excluder by the front door to the clip-on Ranarp lamp, which I can move around as needed and read by in the evenings, it all works so well, whether I’m entertaining, eating or just relaxing in here.” Most importantly, Deborah has finally found the sanctuary she needs. “The whole room feels peaceful and serene. Instead of my shoulders slumping when I walk in the front door, I instantly relax. “I’m proud of my home now and feel ready to tackle this new chapter in my life. It’s beautiful and makes me so happy. Now I no longer live in a hobbit house, but a mini-mansion!” With inventive solutions for everything from clutter busting to lighting and decor, IKEA is on a mission to turn every home into a sanctuary.
