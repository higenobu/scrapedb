12/29/2021,"The movie Don’t Look Up is satire. But speaking as a climate scientist doing everything I can to wake people up and avoid planetary destruction, it’s also the most accurate film about society’s terrifying non-response to climate breakdown I’ve seen. The film, from director Adam McKay and writer David Sirota, tells the story of astronomy grad student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) and her PhD adviser, Dr Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio), who discover a comet – a “planet killer” – that will impact the Earth in just over six months. The certainty of impact is 99.7%, as certain as just about anything in science.  The scientists are essentially alone with this knowledge, ignored and gaslighted by society. The panic and desperation they feel mirror the panic and desperation that many climate scientists feel. In one scene, Mindy hyperventilates in a bathroom; in another, Diabasky, on national TV, screams “Are we not being clear? We’re all 100% for sure gonna fucking die!” I can relate. This is what it feels like to be a climate scientist today. The two astronomers are given a 20-minute audience with the president (Meryl Streep), who is glad to hear that impact isn’t technically 100% certain. Weighing election strategy above the fate of the planet, she decides to “sit tight and assess”. Desperate, the scientists then go on a national morning show, but the TV hosts make light of their warning (which is also overshadowed by a celebrity breakup story). By now, the imminent collision with comet Diabasky is confirmed by scientists around the world. After political winds shift, the president initiates a mission to divert the comet, but changes her mind at the last moment when urged to do so by a billionaire donor (Mark Rylance) with his own plan to guide it to a safe landing, using unproven technology, in order to claim its precious metals. A sports magazine’s cover asks, “The end is near. Will there be a Super Bowl?” But this isn’t a film about how humanity would respond to a planet-killing comet; it’s a film about how humanity is responding to planet-killing climate breakdown. We live in a society in which, despite extraordinarily clear, present, and worsening climate danger, more than half of Republican members of Congress still say climate change is a hoax and many more wish to block action, and in which the official Democratic party platform still enshrines massive subsidies to the fossil fuel industry; in which the current president ran on a promise that “nothing will fundamentally change”, and the speaker of the House dismissed even a modest climate plan as“the green dream or whatever”; in which the largest delegation to Cop26 was the fossil fuel industry, and the White House sold drilling rights to a huge tract of the Gulf of Mexico after the summit; in which world leaders say that climate is an “existential threat to humanity” while simultaneously expanding fossil fuel production; in which major newspapers still run fossil fuel ads, and climate news is routinely overshadowed by sports; in which entrepreneurs push incredibly risky tech solutions and billionaires sell the absurdist fantasy that humanity can just move to Mars. After 15 years of working to raise climate urgency, I’ve concluded that the public in general, and world leaders in particular, underestimate how rapid, serious and permanent climate and ecological breakdown will be if humanity fails to mobilize. There may only be five years left before humanity expends the remaining “carbon budget” to stay under 1.5C of global heating at today’s emissions rates – a level of heating I am not confident will be compatible with civilization as we know it. And there may only be five years before the Amazon rainforest and a large Antarctic ice sheet pass irreversible tipping points. The Earth system is breaking down now with breathtaking speed. And climate scientists have faced an even more insurmountable public communication task than the astronomers in Don’t Look Up, since climate destruction unfolds over decades – lightning fast as far as the planet is concerned, but glacially slow as far as the news cycle is concerned – and isn’t as immediate and visible as a comet in the sky. Given all this, dismissing Don’t Look Up as too obvious might say more about the critic than the film. It’s funny and terrifying because it conveys a certain cold truth that climate scientists and others who understand the full depth of the climate emergency are living every day. I hope that this movie, which comically depicts how hard it is to break through prevailing norms, actually helps break through those norms in real life. I also hope Hollywood is learning how to tell climate stories that matter. Instead of stories that create comforting distance from the grave danger we are in via unrealistic techno fixes for unrealistic disaster scenarios, humanity needs stories that highlight the many absurdities that arise from collectively knowing what’s coming while collectively failing to act. We also need stories that show humanity responding rationally to the crisis. A lack of technology isn’t what’s blocking action. Instead, humanity needs to confront the fossil fuel industry head on, accept that we need to consume less energy, and switch into full-on emergency mode. The sense of solidarity and relief we’d feel once this happens – if it happens – would be gamechanging for our species. More and better facts will not catalyze this sociocultural tipping point, but more and better stories might.

12/29/2021,"Most people find seeing themselves on screen distinctly squirm-inducing. Even an unintended glance in the mirror can trigger a minor identity crisis, as we glimpse the gulf between how others see us and how we imagine ourselves. But for writers whose life stories are adapted for television – their flawed personalities painstakingly recreated by actors – the experience can be even more bewildering. “Bizarre is the only way to describe it,” reflects Adam Kay, whose 2017 bestseller This Is Going to Hurt, a memoir of his hellish and hilarious years as a junior doctor, lands in 2022 on BBC One. On TV, Kay is played by Ben Whishaw, who evidently took his research seriously. “I watched an early cut with my husband,” Kay recalls, “and he said: ‘It’s amazing how he’s got all of your weird mannerisms.’ I didn’t even realise I had weird mannerisms!”  Dolly Alderton, whose acclaimed account of her “roaring 20s” in London, Everything I Know About Love, also hits the BBC this year, found seeing her life reconstructed on screen disconcerting. “It was really, really trippy,” she says. “Some of the argument scenes were verbatim conversations that happened in my life 10 years ago, and watching them felt very strange.” For Alderton, the creative team’s obsessive attention to detail made visiting the set uncanny. “There were all these tiny details that were a carbon copy of the house I lived in,” she explains. “I sent the art director a picture of a drunken letter I had written my friend, promising that if she came out with me that night, I would wake her up early the next morning for work. And there was that letter, from one of the fictional housemates to the other, stuck on the fridge.” Eerie moments of deja vu notwithstanding, Kay and Alderton have both kept a tight grip on the reins of their stories by adapting the memoirs themselves. But Stephanie Land, whose book Maid spawned a hit Netflix series last year – garnering audience figures second only to the streamer’s other huge success story, Squid Game – gave control to screenwriters working under John Wells, former showrunner of ER and The West Wing. “When I learned they planned to fictionalise the characters, I felt relief,” she tells me. “It’s one thing to write a story about your kid’s life. It’s another thing to have it played out as a series.” But while Maid’s writers crafted a story that was part true and part fiction, recasting Land as a young woman called Alex and her daughter Story as Maddy, there were moments lifted straight from real life that hit close to home, particularly when it came to the scenes of abuse. “There were definitely aspects of the show that surprised me in my body’s reaction to them,” Land tells me. “A few times, when it cut to a shot of [Alex’s boyfriend] bending over to yell in her face, it made me flinch. “Those parts were a little too real, and I wasn’t prepared for them.” Like Land, Alderton’s on-screen alter ego goes by a different name – Maggie – but telling them apart is not always easy. “It would be a lie to say that I can completely depersonalise it,” she admits. “There were certainly moments in the process of hashing out stories where I realised that when I was defending Maggie, I was actually defending myself.” For Kay, the distinction between Adam the writer and Adam the character was also a tricky one. “It was always ‘him’ rather than ‘me’ when I was talking to producers,” he explains, “to give myself the necessary distance, and also so I didn’t implode during the many discussions of how dislikable he is – I am – throughout. The truth is that he started as me in every way, and as the writing continued he became his own person, albeit one who constantly says and does things that I did in my actual life.” Alderton also struggled with ambivalent feelings towards her character. “I’m much harder on Maggie than the other creatives on the show,’ she admits. “I will say, ‘I think Maggie is too unlikable here’, or ‘I don’t understand why she’s doing this.’ And it’s obviously because I recognise myself in her, and we are our harshest critics, as the cliche goes. But I also have to be truthful about how much it’s defensive self-preservation. I’m trying to make her a more palatable version of me.”Sometimes, autobiographical shows can even outlast the characters whose experiences are at their heart. Call the Midwife was adapted from the memoirs of author Jennifer Worth, but when Jessica Raine, who played the show’s lead Jenny, announced she wanted to leave the series, the character was written out but the story continued. For showrunner Heidi Thomas, who has delivered more than 80 episodes (with at least two more series confirmed), losing her star was a blessing in disguise. “I realised the drama could open up and expand,” she tells me, “because we would have more time to spend with our other characters.” Having used up the majority of the material in the books by the end of season one, Thomas had already begun supplementing Worth’s stories with accounts sent in by the show’s legions of fans from the nursing and midwifery professions. Worth herself, sadly, never got a chance to see herself on screen since she died during the show’s development period, and Thomas attended her funeral the week before filming began. “There was a lot of trust between us, there was friendship, and I have to say there was love,” she recalls. After her death, any storylines involving the character were sent to her family for approval. “They were entitled to read them and to comment,” explains Thomas, “because I loved and respected Jennifer and I didn’t want to do anything that wasn’t germane to her experience.” In fact, even after Raine left the series, Thomas kept Vanessa Redgrave on as narrator, reasoning that since Worth had stayed in touch with the nuns she had worked with right up to the end of her life, she could continue to tell their stories. In the 2014 Christmas Special she even put Redgrave on screen as old Jenny, wearing some of Worth’s jewellery supplied by her daughters. “It was a way of keeping Jennifer alive,” she tells me. For any long-running series, change is a means of survival, and in the case of shows adapted from true stories, this generally means an increasingly loose relationship to the source material. This Is Going to Hurt was a publishing phenomenon, spending a record-breaking 52 weeks in the charts and shifting more than 2.5m copies. Kay’s one-man show based on the book had sell-out runs throughout the UK. Does he expect the TV show to run and run as well? The answer, surprisingly, appears to be a resolute no. “I wrote it as a self-contained series, with a beginning, middle and end,” he tells me. “Never say never, but at the same time, probably never.”  Call the Midwife series 11 is on BBC One, Sundays at 8pm. This Is Going to Hurt and Everything I Know About Love come out this year on BBC One and iPlayer.

12/29/2021,"Jurors in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial resume deliberations Wednesday morning with the heightened threat of coronavirus and potential trial disruptions should any of them fall ill looming over them. On Tuesday, Judge Alison Nathan voiced deep concern that surging coronavirus infection rates across New York City – fueled by the hyper-transmissible Omicron variant – could send proceedings into a tailspin if they don’t end soon. The jury has deliberated about 32 hours over the course of five days without reaching a verdict.  Nathan told lawyers on the case that if jurors don’t reach a verdict Wednesday, they should be prepared to deliberate until they do so – including possible deliberations over the new year holiday weekend. “We now face a high and escalating risk that jurors and trial participants may need to quarantine,” Nathan warned, “thus disrupting trial, putting at risk our ability to complete this trial.” While the onslaught of Covid cases has been felt across the US, New York City has been hit particularly hard. The seven-day average of positive tests for city residents hit 19.97% as of Sunday, according to NBC 4 New York. “We are very simply at a different place regarding the pandemic than we were only one week ago,” Nathan remarked. “Put simply, I conclude that proceeding this way is the best chance to give the jury as much time they need and to avoid a mistrial as a result of the Omicron variant.” Before the trial started in earnest, Nathan told lawyers on Maxwell’s case that she would not boot prospective jurors based on vaccination status. One potential juror – who was ultimately selected to serve on the panel – told the court that she was not currently enrolled in graduate school “because of the vaccination requirement.” Maxwell, 60, is being tried on six counts for alleged involvement in her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty. Epstein, a convicted sex offender and financier with powerful associates including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, was apprehended in July 2019 for sex trafficking minor teens. He killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail about one month after his arrest.",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell jury deliberates as Covid threatens to disrupt trial,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/ghislaine-maxwell-jury-deliberations-covid
