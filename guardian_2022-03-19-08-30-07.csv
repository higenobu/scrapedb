3/19/2022,"Thomas Tuchel is confident that Chelsea’s next owner will be more interested in winning trophies than making money. Chelsea are in an uncertain position as they face up to a future without Roman Abramovich and it remains to be seen who will buy the club from the Russian oligarch. The deadline to submit offers to the Raine Group passed on Friday night, with a consortium led by Todd Boehly, Hansjörg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein viewed as the leading candidate among those groups who have shown their hand publicly. Their chances have been boosted after it emerged that the consortium is receiving extra funding from Clearlake Capital, a California investment firm with more than £45.5bn of assets under management. Raine, the US bank handling the process, received at least 30 offers and its next step will involve selecting a handpicked few to proceed to the next stage. Offers were arriving close to the deadline and on Friday evening it was confirmed that The Blue Football Consortium had made a bid. The group is led by British property tycoon Nicky Candy and involves two Korean companies, Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group. “I can confirm that the two South Korean firms Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group are a significant part of Mr Candy’s global consortium of investors,” read a statement. “Their involvement is representative of Chelsea’s global brand and huge loyal fan base in Asia.” Among its commitments should a successful acquisition go ahead, the consortium is promising to provide fans with an opportunity to acquire a share of the economic and voting rights in the club. “Chelsea is one of the most iconic and successful professional football clubs in the world, with a rich heritage, global following, and a highly valuable brand,” said Candy. “Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club.” Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, in partnership with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, also submitted an offer on Friday evening, as did a consortium led by businessman Martin Broughton and World Athletics president, and Chelsea fan, Sebastian Coe. The winning group is expected to pay between £2bn and £3bn – the offer from The Blue Football Consortium is believed to be over £2bn – and Tuchel, speaking before Chelsea’s FA Cup quarter-final against Middlesbrough on Saturday, was asked whether that kind of price for a Premier League club is sustainable. “If somebody buys a club for this amount of money then it’s about challenging on the highest kind of level, then it’s about trophies, then it’s about winning and then it’s about being the best you can,” Chelsea’s manager replied. “It’s not about developing a project, it’s not about making money with the club. “Who am I? I don’t know the ideas behind buying a club or any organisation for this amount of money because I cannot afford it and I will never be able to. But that’s what I hope and what I think. I think Chelsea as a club and a structure and an organisation has an awful to offer, and that’s why the price is like it is.” Tuchel, who dismissed suggestions that Manchester United could lure him from Stamford Bridge, said he did not know much about the owners of American sports teams amid interest in Chelsea from the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs, and Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets. “I know the teams but the owners are not so familiar to me,” he said. “I pretty much watch almost every sport because I simply love it – I watch American sport too.” Chelsea are operating under a restrictive licence as a result of sanctions imposed on Abramovich and have had their travel costs capped at £20,000. However Tuchel confirmed they had been allowed to fly to Middlesbrough. There will be only about 700 away fans there after Chelsea’s licence prevented them from taking their full allocation. They are not permitted to sell tickets and unless a new owner arrives soon they face having no fans at either leg of next month’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. Abramovich transferred a company he controlled with tens of millions of dollars of investments, Ervington Investments Limited, to the Chelsea director Eugene Tenenbaum on the day Russia invaded Ukraine, UK corporate filings showed. Tenenbaum told Reuters the purchase was in compliance with laws and regulations.",Sport/Football,"Next Chelsea owner should put trophies before money, says Thomas Tuchel",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/next-chelsea-owner-should-put-trophies-before-money-says-thomas-tuchel
3/19/2022,"Herald Sun sport reporter Michael Warner has been awarded the top honour at the Melbourne Press Club awards for his scoop on a report that found “systemic racism” at Collingwood football club, which prompted the resignation of club president Eddie McGuire. Guardian Australia also received two awards after five nominations. The judges said Warner’s “genuine scoop set in train a series of events that rocked Australia’s biggest sporting club and its high-profile president to the core”. News.com.au’s political editor Samantha Maiden received the Graham Perkin award for investigative journalism for her reporting on the alleged rape of former Liberal Party staffer Brittany Higgins. Accepting the award, Maiden said she would not speak further about the case, which is currently before the court, but thanked Higgins for trusting her with the story. The Age’s veteran football writer, Caroline Wilson, received a lifetime achievement award for 40 years covering the AFL, a career that was acknowledged as “smashing the glass ceiling” for women in sports reporting. She recounted attending a football writers’ dinner as the first woman to ever to be granted admittance, and being “given an apron and taken up to the kitchen” because they assumed she was there to help. Guardian Australia’s inequality editor, Luke Henriques-Gomes, won the quill for reporting on disability affairs for his work reporting on the National Disability Insurance Commission, including the revelation that a family who won a landmark case over NDIS transport funding were now facing another cut to their support. The judges said Henriques-Gomes’ work “stood out for revealing widespread problems in the administration and provision of services” under the NDIS and “exposed how the NDIS has turned into a bureaucratic and legal nightmare for those often poorly placed to advocate for themselves”. Matilda Boseley was awarded the quill for innovation in journalism for reports she wrote, filmed, starred in and produced for Guardian Australia’s Tiktok account, which have amassed tens of millions of views worldwide. The judges said Boseley’s work was “a remarkable individual effort” which combined clear and accurate journalism “with a refreshing and clever approach to reaching new audiences on a platform not known for its journalistic reach. A remarkable individual effort.” Business reporter Ben Butler was highly commended for the Grant Hattam award for investigative journalism for his work on the Pandora Papers, a joint production between Guardian Australia, the ABC’s Elise Worthington, and Mario Christodoulou, and the Australian Financial Review’s Liam Walsh and Neil Chenoweth. That award was won by Nick Mckenzie and Joel Tozer, for their investigation inside Australian neo-Nazi groups. Guardian Australia sports writer Jonathan Horn was a finalist for the Harry Gordon Australian sports journalist of the year, which was won by Warner. Reporter Caitlin Cassidy was a finalist for the young journalist of the year award, won by the Herald Sun’s Olivia Jenkins, who was arrested covering anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne last year.

3/19/2022,"Bradford, County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham county borough have been shortlisted to become the UK next city of culture, it has been announced. The finalists were whittled down from a record 20 bids to eight longlisted regions, which also included Cornwall, Derby, Stirling, and the district of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon. The successful area will take the baton from Coventry, which is the 2021 UK city of culture, with Hull and Derry having previously enjoyed the status in 2017 and 2013 respectively. The start of Coventry’s year was delayed to May 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The UK city of culture competition shows the important role that culture can play in levelling up our towns, cities and rural communities – bringing investment, great events, thousands of tourists and opportunity for people of all ages and backgrounds,” said the arts minister, Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay. “We have seen a huge positive impact in this year’s host city, Coventry, will millions of pounds in investment and thousands of visitors.” The competition, organised by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in collaboration with the offices for Scotland and Wales and the Northern Ireland executive, uses culture as a tool for social and economic recovery. According to the DCMS, as city of culture Coventry has seen more than £172m invested in funding music concerts, public art displays, the UK’s first permanent immersive digital art gallery, improvements to public transport etc. More than a third of event tickets issued to Coventry residents as part of the city of culture have gone to those facing financial or other adversity, and a third of the programme has been co-created with local communities. Hull, during its 12-month tenure, had more than 5.3m visits to more than 2,800 events, cultural activities, installations and exhibitions, and 75% of those who visited in 2017 said it had changed their perception of the city for the better. Nine out of 10 people in Hull thought that city of culture status had had a positive impact and 90% of residents took part in at least one cultural activity, according to DCMS data. This year, for the first time, the eight longlisted bidders received a £40,000 grant to strengthen their applications. Sir Phil Redmond, chair of the city of culture expert advisory panel, said: “Culture can act as a catalyst for community engagement, civic cohesion and a driver for economic and social change as previously seen not just in Derry-Londonderry (2013), Hull (2017) and Coventry (2021), but all those other places who went on a journey to develop their own cultural strategy. “Simply taking part has proved a catalyst in itself. We have had a great longlist to select from, which made the shortlisting difficult, but I am now looking forward to visiting each of the shortlisted places with the panel to witness culture’s catalytic effect in action.” The winner of UK city of culture 2025 will be announced in May.",Arts/Culture,UK city of culture 2025: Southampton and Bradford among those on shortlist,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/18/uk-city-of-culture-2025-shortlist
3/19/2022,"Mikel Arteta says Arsenal must find a way this summer to drastically increase their goal output if they are to become title contenders, suggesting they will require 90 or 100 to challenge for the Premier League. Arsenal are favourites for fourth place but have fallen short against Manchester City and Liverpool when, despite strong performances, they lacked cutting edge in the penalty area. That was evident in Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat by Jürgen Klopp’s side, who have scored 75 goals to Arsenal’s 43 this season, and Arteta knows finding finishers is a priority for his side to evolve. “To be with the top teams this season you need to score 90 to 100 goals at least,” he said. “Somehow you need those goals in the team. Don’t ask me how, but you need them. They have to come. That contribution, how it’s done and how possible it is to happen, you have to find the right pieces to do it. But it’s a non-negotiable.” Last season Manchester City won the title with 83 goals but, in the previous campaign, they came second with 102 while Liverpool scored 85. In 2019-20 City came top with 95 and Liverpool second with 89; Arteta’s point essentially stands and, according to his logic, Arsenal will probably have to find another 30 goals. “If you look at the history of [successful] football teams, they always have that,” he said when it was put to him that players who could guarantee such a return will come with a hefty price tag. “You look at the Barcelona team that won six titles; they scored 100 goals for three years. If you don’t need that then you need to have 30 clean sheets. In the last 11 games, if we can score 11 goals and concede zero we’re going to win 11 games. Or we can score 35 and concede, and we’re still going to have 33 points. But in a very different way.” Arsenal’s recruitment last summer focused on youth, to thus-far successful effect, but Arteta anticipates a shifting of the dial this summer and suggested more ready-made options may come into play. “There are certain things that we have to achieve in the summer that are not always especially age-related, but things we want to add to the squad,” he said. “There are a lot of topics that are very important and we have to find the right piece. When we find that player, maybe the top priority won’t be the age in that position. Maybe in another one, yes. So we’ll have to get that right.” Arteta spoke of having “more winners in the team that can now take that drive they have, the experience to do that, and they can be contagious to the rest of the team”. Arsenal travel to Aston Villa for a Saturday lunchtime fixture that, coming less than 72 hours after the Liverpool game, caused Arteta to rail at the Premier League’s scheduling this week. “I get all the points and how everybody tries to explain the situations,” he said, continuing the theme. “It cannot affect one club, that’s what I’m saying. If there are more involved I think we have to share that responsibility and try to do it with equity so the integrity of the competition is always there.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta targets 100 goals if Arsenal are to be title contenders next season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/mikel-arteta-targets-100-goals-if-arsenal-are-to-be-title-contenders-next-season
