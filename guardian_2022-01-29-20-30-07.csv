1/29/2022,"The Scots pine plantations in Abernethy forest are the crème de la crème in forestry terms: tall, straight and dense. These plantations were created in the 1930s, and the wood had a variety of uses, from ships’ masts to trench timbers. Now, this woodland is being retrofitted for wildlife as part of the UK’s largest land restoration project because, although it is striking to wander in such a regimented landscape, nature prefers things to be less orderly. The gnarled older and bigger trees are better for woodland species, which is why conservationists working on Cairngorms Connect are intentionally making a mess and artificially ageing trees as part of their efforts to restore Scotland’s old Caledonian pine forest to its former, imperfect glory.  Over the total area of the Cairngorms Connect project – 600 sq km (230 sq miles) – partners are spending more than £40,000 a year on plantation restructuring, which includes a range of wildlife-enhancing projects, from artificially ageing trees to thinning out commercial plantations. More than 10 sq km of Scots pine has been restructured since 2019. “Here we want twisted, forked trunks, we want the more open-crowned trees,” says Jeremy Roberts, programme manager at Cairngorms Connect, who is showing me around. The woodland is draped in spiderweb lace and the spongy forest floor is spattered in blaeberry, also known as bilberry. Large natural forests are affected by storms or have grazing animals moving through them, knocking down trees and creating “storm tracts”, so conservationists are replicating this process by using a winch and ropes to pull the trees down. They are also doing ring barring, which means scraping off a circle of bark a few metres up the trunk. It looks as if a hungry giant beaver has chomped its way through the forest. A tree surgeon even cut the top off one of the trees and now the deadwood is being used by a woodpecker. These homogenous forests have less than 15% of the deadwood that should be there. It might seem odd for conservationists to intentionally damage trees, but dead and decaying wood is a crucial habitat. These pinewoods are the most important sites in Scotland for deadwood-loving beetles. Conservationists have recorded 144 species of saproxylic beetle, 32 of which are of conservation concern. Getting light into the woodland floor also helps to establish broadleaf trees such as birch, rowan and juniper, which can’t survive in dense forest. “A goldilocks amount of light is always useful in a Scots pine plantation. A bit too much light and you end up with a dominance of heather, a bit too little light, and you end up with a dominance of grass,” says Roberts. Cairngorms Connect land is home to 55% of the UK’s capercaillie population and 90% of them are in Abernethy forest. As ground-nesting birds, the tangle of logs provides shelter and cover for them. The exposed roots provide the dust capercaillie need to keep their feathers in good condition and get rid of parasites. “The single most useful thing is expanding the forest, making more forest habitat for capercaillie, and that can happen surprisingly quickly if you control the deer numbers,” says Roberts. Currently, the project has 130 sq km of forest. The aim is to double that as part of the 200-year vision, mainly through natural regeneration, rather than mass planting. Young woodlands are flowing out into the moorland like a river and there is a single key reason for this: culling deer. In the early 2000s, there were more than 25 deer a square kilometre; now there are just one or two. Numbers have been so successfully reduced because all landowners included in the project agreed to do it over a vast area. The Cairngorms Connect project has £9m of funding, including about £3.7m from the Endangered Landscapes Programme. Landowners involved in the project include RSPB, Forestry and Land Scotland, NatureScot and Wildland, set up by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. This landscape has been damaged over centuries and the vision is to “rewiggle” rivers, rewet peatlands and restore forests. Unlike other conservation projects, Cairngorms Connect covers a vast area of continuous land owned by a handful of landowners. Forestry and Land Scotland has owned Glenmore for nearly 100 years, RSPB has worked at Abernethy for 60 years, NatureScot has been at Invereshie for 60 years and Povlsen bought Glenfeshie in 2006. Four senior representatives from each organisation have met with the Cairngorms national park authority almost every month since 2014. If the key person can’t make a meeting they’re not allowed to send a proxy. “It’s a tight group of people with a lot of trust, which makes it a safe space to challenge and that’s where great collaborative ideas come from,” says Roberts. The project had a low-key launch in 2016 because a lot of work was already happening in the respective areas, but things such as deer management work more effectively over a wide area. If you cut deer numbers, creating new forests in places you have existing forests is pretty easy. Seeds from pine forests can be dispersed 150 metres away from the parent plant over moorland and if the density of deer is below four per square kilometre then the pine will regenerate. A report from 2020 estimated that there were up to 1 million wild deer in Scotland, which could be seriously hampering national efforts to increase tree cover. “The priority here is expanding the forests. All the partners are achieving forest expansion by deer control,” says Roberts. We walk into the open area leading to Ryvoan bothy, where saplings are sprouting. On one side of the path a forest of rowan is forming from seeds planted by wintering thrushes, such as fieldfares and redwings, says Roberts. They feed on berries, then go into the heather to roost, dropping seeds as they go, which grow into saplings. Next morning, I wake at 5am to do the wildlife equivalent of financial accounting, to see what impact these investments are having on species diversity. Ellie Dimambro-Denson, a monitoring officer at Cairngorms Connect, is doing a high-altitude moth survey up the hill from Glenmore visitor centre, using a Robinson light trap. We are joined by what feels like a million midges. These traps are set once a month between May and September at a variety of altitudes – the lowest is at 300 metres and the highest at 900 metres. Moths are great indicator species because they are diverse and respond quickly to changes in the landscape. “We can get so much data in one session,” says Dimambro-Denson. “Moths have relatively fast reproductive cycles and so are able to colonise areas quickly and respond to habitat changes, especially sudden change such as tree planting and other direct management work, on short timescales.” She counts 469 moths from 39 species (plus an additional 46 micro-moths) – including a nationally scarce angle-barred sallow – which is a relatively large and diverse haul. It also includes a brimstone moth, whose caterpillars feed on blackthorn, hawthorn and rowan, and a green carpet moth, whose caterpillars feed on oak and rowan. Their presence suggests broadleaf regeneration is working. “You can see a response. That’s very exciting,” says Dimambro-Denson. Regular moth trappings can show which direction the landscape is moving in. What Dimambro-Denson has done this evening is repeated each year so conservationists can understand how the landscape is changing. Similar monitoring surveys are being done with birds and vegetation. “You could come back in five, 10 or 100 years and repeat this,” she says. The landscape is becoming a complex mosaic of habitats, but the basic ingredients are simple: reducing deer and giving the landscape time and space to recover. Although this is not being billed as a rewilding project, nature is at the helm and the land is naturally covering itself in a complex of forests, bogs and wild rivers.

1/29/2022,"Andrew Neil is in talks to present a weekly politics show on Channel 4, in a move that would see him lurch leftwards to join what he once called “the broadcast arm of the Guardian”. Neil, who is the chair of the conservative Spectator magazine and last year put in a brief and calamitous stint with the rightwing channel GB News, had previously dismissed suggestions about a such a move:  Channel 4 is basically the broadcast arm of the Guardian. Don’t think they’d have much interest in me. https://t.co/koROkAd7bi The former editor of the Sunday Times is in advanced talks with the channel’s director of programmes, Ian Katz, and the director of news and current affairs, Louisa Compton, according to industry trade newspaper Broadcast, which first reported on the development. The paper understands that a Sunday evening slot is being considered for a politics analysis show. Channel 4 is said to be eyeing an evening slot because it is reluctant to coincide with the BBC’s 9am politics programme, which is presented by Sophie Raworth after Andrew Marr’s departure. Sky News also has a Sunday morning programme, Sophy Ridge on Sunday, at present fronted by Trevor Phillips. The early evening slot for the politics show means it could follow C4 News’ early evening Sunday bulletin, which airs around 6:30pm, allowing Neil to offer analysis of the day’s news, interview heavyweight figures and look ahead to the coming week. Channel 4 declined to comment. Neil, 72, has described his decision to help found GB News as “the single biggest mistake” of his career. He said in an interview in November that the channel washeading in a “Fox News direction”, with its backers resembling a “Ukip tribute band”. He said he did not want it to be the “full stop” to his television career. Despite being the face of the programme before it went on air in June, Neil left after presenting just eight programmes in three months. He resigned in September, saying he was unhappy with technical errors, the loss of top staff and the channel’s political direction. Discussing his departure and the stress leading up to it, the former BBC presenter, who walked away from a £4m contract, told the Daily Mail: “It was a big decision but I frankly couldn’t care if it was £40m. This would have killed me if I’d carried on.” News of Neil’s possible move follows the departure of Jon Snow, who left Channel 4 News in December after more than three decades. Snow will continue to work with Channel 4 on long-form projects and devote more time to his charitable work. It also comes amid ongoing questions about the state-owned broadcaster’s future. Ministers are working through 600,000 responses to the government’s consultation on privatising the channel. Privatisation could mean up to 60 British production companies going bust, according to a report published last September.

1/29/2022,"Arizona Republicans have introduced a bill that would impose significant new voting restrictions and allow the state legislature to reject election results.  The measure would require the state legislature to convene after primary and general elections to review the ballot counting process and “shall accept or reject the election results”. The proposal does not require lawmakers to find evidence of fraud or lay out any factors they would have to consider in order to overturn an election. If the lawmakers were to reject the results, any voter in Arizona would be allowed to petition a local judge to hold a new election. The same measure would also require Arizona voters to give an excuse if they want to vote by mail, even though mail-in voting has long been used by the vast majority of voters in the state. It also would restrict voting to election day and prevent the use of vote centers, essentially mega voting precincts where anyone in a county can vote, regardless of where they live. One of the co-sponsors of the bill is Mark Finchem, a state representative who believes the 2020 election was stolen, has ties to the Oath Keepers, and was at the Capitol on 6 January. Finchem is running to be Arizona’s chief election official and Donald Trump has endorsed him. “We need to get back to 1958-style voting,” John Fillmore, another Republican state representative who introduced the bill said on Wednesday, according to the Arizona Republic. Arizona had a racist literacy test in place in 1958, the Republic noted. The Voting Rights Act, which wiped out many blatant efforts to keep Black people from the polls, passed in 1965. Fillmore did not respond to an interview request from the Guardian. “What’s clear from this bill is that there are some members of the Arizona legislature who are prepared to replace the judgment of Arizona voters with their own,” said David Becker, an election administration expert who leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research. It’s unclear if the measure will ultimately pass. Republicans hold a 16-14 majority in the state senate, which means, if Democrats unanimously oppose it, any Republican could kill the bill by voting against it. A Republican bill last year that would have allowed the legislature to override the results of a presidential election stalled. “I can’t imagine that they will move forward with that idea because I think the outrage from the community would be pretty big,” said Martin Quezada, a Democrat in the state senate. “But the fact that they’re even talking about this issue just shows what kind of a space that we are in right now.” Even if Republicans drop the provision allowing the legislature to overturn elections, Quezada said, the measures that roll back vote-by-mail access in Arizona would still be extreme. “The impact would be tremendous. It would drastically change the way elections work in the state of Arizona. I mean right now the overwhelming majority of voters vote by mail,” he said. “The turnout overall would be suppressed tremendously … The process of actually showing up at the polls to vote would be so frustrating and time-consuming that many people would feel even if they did want to vote, it’s just not worth it to deal with that type of problem.” The proposal comes as there is increased alarm over Republican efforts across the country to make it possible for partisan actors to overturn election results, something scholars have begun calling election subversion. “This bill follows a worrisome anti-democratic trend of legislation introduced in statehouses across the country that would make it possible for legislatures to overturn election results they don’t like,” said Jessica Marsden, a lawyer at the watchdog Protect Democracy who is tracking election subversion bills across the country. “This brazen power grab reveals the cynical strategy behind the deceptive big lie movement: to create a pretext for interfering in election outcomes by undermining confidence in elections.” The bill also underscores how Arizona, where Joe Biden narrowly defeated Donald Trump in 2020, has become a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the election. The state senate authorized an unprecedented months-long post-election review of 2.1m ballots in the state’s most populous county that fanned lies about the 2020 race but ultimately affirmed Biden’s win. Some provisions in the legislation appear to be connected to conspiracy theories that flourished during that review, including the debunked belief that voting equipment was tampered with and ballots had bamboo fibers in them. The bill would require a hand count of ballots within 24 hours of an election and require the use of a hologram or other unique mark to verify the authenticity of ballots. “They keep inventing solutions where there are no problems,” said Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund and a former election official in Arizona. Changing the paper used for ballots would probably make it more costly for counties to run elections and more difficult to reprint ballots if there is an error in the printing process, she said. And requiring election officials to complete a hand count of ballots within 24 hours just isn’t feasible in Arizona, where the ballot can be extremely long, with dozens of races. “It’s not feasible, it’s not accurate, and it’s cost prohibitive … To think that you can do a full ballot hand count within 24 hours is ridiculous,” she said. Humans are also prone to make counting errors. “Everyone who has done a hand count will tell you that machine counts are more accurate,” Patrick said. Jennifer Morrell, a former election official who now works as a consultant and election administration noted that Cyber Ninjas, the firm that conducted the unusual election review in Arizona, took months to count ballots by hand. “The idea of hand counting all ballots within 24 hours of election day is completely unrealistic and shows how little the bill’s sponsors understand about the mechanics of counting ballots,” she said. “Besides the time frame being unrealistic, the process of counting by hand is prone to error. That’s part of why it takes so long. You have to go at it in a way that is slow and methodical to get it right and include enough time to verify the counting was done correctly.” “Hand counting ballots is problematic to begin with. The time frame they’re suggesting is completely unrealistic,” said Jennifer Morrell, a former election official who now works as a consultant on election administration. Earlier this week, Republicans in the state legislature advanced several other bills that would change election processes in the state. One bill would expand the threshold for an automatic recount from 0.1 percentage point to 0.5 (Biden defeated Trump by 0.3 points). Other bills would require the state to make ballot images public after an election while another would end all mail-in elections for school boards and cities.",News/US news,Arizona Republicans introduce election subversion bill,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/29/1958-style-voting-arizona-republicans-election-subversion-bill
1/29/2022,"For more than a year, officials in a northern California coastal town have been debating whether they should rename. This week, the commission examining the issue said that, for now, the Fort Bragg name is here to stay. But the effort highlights the challenges that come as cities, schools and parks across the US reconsider controversial placenames with racist histories.  After the murder of George Floyd in 2020 prompted a national examination of systemic racism in the US, the small California town of Fort Bragg commissioned a group of citizens to examine the possibility of changing its name. The name had been in place since it was established as a military post in 1857. Braxton Bragg, the slave-owner Confederate army general for whom the city is named, reportedly never stepped foot in the area, but the post established in his name was responsible for controlling rebellious Indigenous tribes, part of a grim history in the area, a local teacher told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat. The commission discussed the issue over the course of a year and more than 60 hours of meetings. An informal survey it conducted found that a majority of residents in the town of 7,000 wanted to keep the name. In previous city council meetings, some residents argued in favor of keeping the name because of what it meant to the area, rather than any connection to the Confederate general. This week, the citizen group declined to issue a decision about the name, advising the city council that it had been unable to reach a consensus though 60% of commissioners supported the change. “As a commission, we came to the conclusion that, at this time, because the citizens are so divided, this commission cannot unanimously recommend a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Cesar Yanez, a commissioner, told the city council on Monday. The group did issue a list of recommendations to correct historical wrongs in the area, including the creation of a city policy to prioritize the return of land to Indigenous coastal tribes and a formal agreement recognizing their sovereignty. “As we studied the name, it became apparent that the many atrocities and the attempted genocide committed against the Indigenous peoples of this land, when the US military’s Fort Bragg was established here, are fully wrapped up in the town name,” the group said in a presentation to the city council. “We came to unanimous agreement on the following recommendations the city council should carry out to make amends for this tragic history.” The commission also recommended the city support the creation of a cultural center to “honor the way of life that existed pre-contact” and to form a committee dedicated to working with tribes and schools to tell a more complete history of the area. Some renaming efforts in California have been successful. A state commission renamed a park that had been named for a white settler accused of murdering Indigenous people, and a county board voted to change a racist street name in north Lake Tahoe in response to concerns from residents. In September 2021, the popular Lake Tahoe ski resort Squaw Valley announced it would change its name to Palisades Tahoe to remove the “derogatory and offensive” slur from its name. But such efforts have not been without opposition – indigenous activists in Fresno county campaigning to change the name of a town called Squaw Valley there faced pushback from local officials. Organizers said the name acts as a grim reminder of the atrocities Indigenous people have suffered while officials argued it was significant to the area’s history.",News/US news,California city to retain Confederate general’s name after year of debate,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/29/california-city-to-retain-confederate-generals-name-after-year-of-debate
1/29/2022,"It is late January and I only have one thing to say – sow your chillies. You could wait until March, but there is little chance of you eating a chilli until September that way. You’ll have plenty, but they will have ripened in the weaker sun of autumn, rather than the hot summer, which will affect their flavour and heat. The reason we sow chillies early is because they are slow to get going, especially the hot ones. The basic rule is the hotter the chilli, the more temperature-dependent it is, and this affects the time it takes to germinate and grow to harvest.  Also, what else have you got to do? It’s wet and cold outside; sowing chillies on a dark winter’s night is a welcome sign that the days are lengthening and spring will return. There is little else to sow now (unless you are into growing giant show leeks and onions, in which case you are already three weeks too late). By the time your windowsill is packed with other seedlings, your chillies will be a decent size and able to look after themselves. Chillies germinate between 20-30C, and do it best with a little underfloor heating, AKA a heated propagator, and a propagator lid or a clear plastic bag to keep in humidity. Make sure the seedlings don’t sit in wet, cold soil: keep them on the propagator until they have at least two sets of true leaves; to stop the soil from getting too wet, cut your compost with something to improve drainage, particularly if it is standard multipurpose peat-free compost. The most sustainable option would be homemade, sieved leaf mould. But if you don’t have that, horticultural sand, fine grit or vermiculite are other options. There are many chilli varieties – too many for here – but you can’t go wrong with Nigel’s Outdoor Chilli from Real Seeds, which ripens whatever the weather, with no protection. If you have space somewhere protected and warm, the unusual flavour of Aji Limon or Lemon Drop, originally from Peru, is worth a go. It has a delicious kick of lemon and then a hit of heat, and works wonderfully in sauces. It does need heat to germinate, around 28-30C, and makes a huge bush, so it won’t fit on a windowsill. Of course, not everyone has a propagator. Many excellent nurseries offer not only a plethora of varieties, but also understand this issue and send out truly well-grown plug plants later in spring (from the end of March to the beginning of May), so all you have to do is grow them on. Order now, though, because the best varieties go early.

1/29/2022,"When I was young, growing up in Dublin, Ulysses was considered the greatest novel in the world and the dirtiest book ever written. I bought a copy as soon as I had money and it was taken away from me when my mother discovered me reading it – though Lolita, for some reason, had passed unnoticed in our house. I was 14. I was outraged, and delighted with myself, and a little confused. Ulysses contained something worse than sex, clearly, and I did not know what that could be. “It is very scatological,” my mother said and then, “Look it up!” which is certainly one way to develop a daughter’s vocabulary, though the definition left me no further on. What could be so terrible – or so interesting – about going to the toilet? After much argument, I put the book up in the attic, to be taken down when I had come of age. Four years later, I retrieved it and read the thing all the way through, though I think I skipped some of the stuff in the brothel, which seemed to contain no actual information about brothels, or far too much information, none of which was real, and which managed all this at great length.  Clearly I was missing something. It was sometimes hard to tell if a character was doing a thing or only thinking about doing it and this constant sense of potential gave Joyceans a very peering look. Meanwhile, he was a very great genius, so discussions about what Joyce meant by one or another line were airy, pedantic, and so properly masculine I found it hard to join in. Reading Ulysses made a man very clever, clearly, and a woman not clever, but intriguingly dirty. For some of these intellectual types at least, there was something a little creepy in the way they said: “Fourteen?” The irony is that the freedom Joyce brought to the Irish tradition has been more useful to female writers than to male. His heretical legacy has been welcomed as a gift by writers such as Edna O’Brien, Eimear McBride and Mary Costello, while his innovative genius is more often declared a burden by the men. Here’s a thing: there is no sex in Ulysses – it is all remembered or anticipated sex, all jam tomorrow and jam yesterday and no jam on the single long day of the book itself. A novel that is interested in love and fascinated by the body contains no passionate union, unless you count Molly Bloom’s afternooner with Blazes Boylan, which is intuited by her husband, but which happens off stage. Things do happen in the book, as they do on any ordinary day but, like most of our days, Ulysses contains very little plot. Two men, Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, wander around Dublin, bump into each other and form a connection. Bloom is mild, ruminative, maybe a little masochistic: he is happily present in his body, comfortable in his own skin. Dedalus is more cerebral, and very unhappy: he is mourning his mother and deeply ashamed of his blaggard of a father (the always amusing Simon Dedalus) who leaves his own family short of money for food. Both men are caught by tragic betrayals and impossibilities that are made less impossible, less burdensome by their meeting each other. This seems very little to happen in such a large book – but it is also an amazing thing to happen and in order to effect it, the book does heroic and remarkable things. They begin the day with breakfast. Bloom’s is now famous, and served up every year in Dublin on Bloomsday, 16 June, the day on which the book is set. After setting a tray for his wife, Molly, he nips out to buy a pork kidney for himself; “a moist tender gland” with its – after decades of Bloomsdays, slightly tiresome – “fine tang of faintly scented urine”. The streets the men walk were obsessively researched by Joyce, who then declined to describe them for the reader in any conventional way. As the hours pass, their minds become more porous to the world. Voices interrupt, thoughts intrude. We don’t know who is telling the story any more, or from what point of view. At dusk, an oddly romantic scene turns out to be about Bloom masturbating on Sandymount Strand, to the apparent delight of a young woman sitting on a rock. This was the episode that got the book definitively banned in the US, perhaps because the style was so clear there was no doubting the content. “But it is all a parody!” the clever reader cries, perhaps a little uneasily. Fireworks explode. The prose becomes fragmented, heaps up, becomes maximal, turns psychotic. In Bella Cohen’s brothel, Bloom is accused, crucified, turned into a woman, violated. Dedalus sees the ghost of his mother, Bloom sees the lovely apparition of his long dead son. Dedalus wrecks the joint, gets into a fight, is briefly knocked unconscious. After which, the two adventurers go back to Bloom’s place for a quiet cup of cocoa and the book falls asleep completed in the mind of Molly Bloom. So, apart from everything that you could possibly imagine, nothing much happens in Ulysses. Joyce wanted the book to be “encyclopedic”. As well as high thoughts and fond emotions, it contains much that is small, or small-minded; from Dedalus’s frayed cuff as he looks out over the vastness of Dublin Bay, to the hairpin Molly runs down the page to find the word “metempsychosis”. He is also fascinated by things we revile or find disgusting. Despite Buck Mulligan’s wonderful evocation of the sea, “Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother”, a hundred years later, it is the “snotgreen” that sticks. Recently, I was taken aback by students who knew all about Joyce’s niche sexual interests, and very little about his work. There is a cartoon meme – one lone person at a ticket booth advertising the novels while hundreds queue up to see something called “Fart Letter”. Joyce wrote to his partner Nora when he was alone in Dublin in 1909, and failing miserably to publish Dubliners. He called her his “dirty little fuckbird” and showed an urgent and unholy interest in the contents of her backside. As peccadilloes go, this one lacks glamour. The students certainly thought so, and used the silliness of it to dismiss the writer entirely. (Oh, my heart!) “If you can think it,” I said. “Joyce would write it.” The discovery of these letters brought Leopold Bloom’s (very fleeting) coprophilia into focus and stoked the discussion as to how “dirty” Joyce himself was. He lost his virginity to a prostitute at the age of 14, he was interested in threesomes, but never seemed to get one. When is a happily married man to be considered disordered? A recent critical spat debated whether he had syphilis, which was widespread at the time, rather than the autoimmune Reiter’s syndrome, which is usually given as the cause for his failing eyesight. There is a sly reference to syphilis on the first page, but Ulysses is very far from being pox-riddled. It is, however, excremental, happy to scratch an itch and also to accommodate voyeurism, fetishism and whatever you call Bloom’s covert actions on Sandymount Strand. Something there for everyone, you might say, though enacted in a public space these interests are usually considered predatory and misogynistic. Women have consistently higher levels of disgust than men. We are, in general, less likely to talk (about) shite. Ulysses is full of men doing just that: bantering with each other in that very masculine, mock-heroic way. All in all, it is a very male book. And then, at the very end, there is Molly Bloom. Is she enough? Her soliloquy was hailed as “liberating” for the way it acknowledged, way back in 1922, the power of female sexual desire. And although her thoughts contain the shadow of Joyce’s own fantasies, Molly is very much her own person, a free spirit and nobody’s fool. “The works of James Joyce are remarkable in their frankness about sexuality and their sensitivity to the value of women’s experience.” In 2018, a letter in the Modernist Review, signed by 100 academics of all genders, described the contradictions in Joyce’s work as they sometimes played out in the real world. These academics called upon the Joycean community “to take meaningful action to reduce the incidents of sexual harassment, inappropriate behaviour, abuse, and even assault at conferences, workshops, summer schools and any other events affiliated with the community”. The writer’s own streak of badness was not unconnected to his grandiosity. More often, we privilege the grandiose; the impossibly high or unattainable. Just last week I got an email asking about “the burden of confronting Joyce for the contemporary Irish novelist”. I replied that I had no interest in confronting anyone (what?!) and that Joyce was not a burden but a great boon. I am also sometimes asked how I can write “in the shadow” of Joyce, as though his work were a kind of darkness, and not a great light to me. These questions are about Joyce as genius and monument, and not about Joyce as transgressor and disruptor – as such, they do his work a disservice. Joyce was much exercised by the problem of fathers, especially bad ones. Male as it may be, Ulysses is a seriously anti-patriarchal book. Molly’s soliloquy was a great historical moment for women, but it doesn’t seem especially liberating, these days, to break the big news that women think about sex (really? I didn’t know we could). Female writers are, however, still required to be female at all times – we are relentlessly embodied – so the fact that Leopold Bloom lives so fully in his body feels egalitarian, to me. What I find liberating about Ulysses is not just the way the language gets under the skin, however, it is the way the language moves. Joyce refused to fix the meaning of the words on the page and left the reader to fend for themselves. So the content may not be actually shocking, but the book feels exciting – as though it might turn shocking any second. Anything might stir in the body or consciousness of a character, in the body or consciousness of the reader. My mother was right to consider it a dangerous text. The thing the censors worried about were the uncensored workings of their own minds. More than any other book, Ulysses is about what happens in the reader’s head. The style obliges us to choose a meaning, it is designed to make us feel uncertain. This makes it a profoundly democratic work. Ulysses is a living, shifting, deeply humane text that is also very funny. It makes the world bigger. About a third of those who attempt the book do not finish it, according to a Bloomsday poll on an Irish news website. I never considered this to be a problem. I am not sure you can ever finish Ulysses. I am certain it can never be fully understood. I think I knew this instinctively at 14; a time when I lived inside and not outside the words on the page, a time when many books were beyond my understanding, and that was just fine.  The anniversary reissue of Ulysses is published by Vintage.",Arts/Books,‘A world inside one head’ – Anne Enright on James Joyce’s Ulysses at 100 ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/29/dangerous-voyeuristic-transgressive-exciting-anne-enright-on-james-joyces-ulysses-at-100
1/29/2022,"When Margaret Shiplee retired from her job as a homecare worker for people with special needs 15 years ago, she was at a loss. “I thought, oh God – I have to do something now,” she says. “If I stopped doing anything I’d be bored out of my brain. I’m not very good at relaxing.” Shiplee, who is 75 and lives in Worlingham, east Suffolk, then heard about an initiative called the Befriending Scheme, which connects adults with learning difficulties or mental health needs to people in their community. She signed up and was paired with Julie Martin, 58, from nearby Beccles, who has a learning disability. The two have now been friends for nearly 15 years.  The first time Shiplee met Martin was at a bingo night at a drop-in centre in a Quaker hall. Julie seemed a little forlorn. “Her mother had just died,” says Shiplee. “She was all on her own.” Shiplee’s 40 years of working with people with learning disabilities was a boon. “We hit it off,” says Shiplee. The key, she says, is to “treat them as you’d treat anyone else. Don’t talk down to them, or anything like that. Talk to them as you would talk to your friends, because that’s who they are, really.” Every Wednesday, Martin and Shiplee meet up. They go for lunch, or coffee, or bowling, or to the beach. “You get so much more out of it than you give,” Shiplee says of their friendship. “It’s wonderful. Julie is so much fun. She’s full of beans. She has her down days, like we all do. But she’s mainly quite bubbly, and she’s always grateful.” Martin recently learned how to use a mobile phone, and sent Shiplee a nice message afterwards, which Shiplee treasures. The feeling is mutual. “She does care about me,” says Martin. Shiplee is “a special friend. Always friendly and nice. She’s easy to talk to. And she’s kept me away from the doctor, which is brilliant.” By this, Martin means her habit of going to the GP surgery regularly, worried that something is wrong with her. “She used to go and sit at the surgery almost every day,” says Shiplee. “I think it was so she would have a bit of connection with someone. Every time I see her now, she says: ‘I haven’t phoned the doctor!’” They joke about how much money Shiplee has saved the NHS. Shiplee assists Martin with forms and paperwork, helped her get her Covid-19 vaccine, and takes her to hospital appointments. “If she has a problem,” says Shiplee, “she comes to me.” Martin goes to Shiplee’s house for Christmas most years. “She comes around for lunch and I take her home in the afternoon,” she says. “I can’t let her be on her own.” Sometimes people are worried about joining befriending schemes, because they’re scared they won’t have anything to talk about. But silence isn’t the worst thing in the world. “Silence doesn’t bother me at all,” says Shiplee. “If Julie sits in silence, I just say: ‘Are we not speaking now? Have we fallen out?’” According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, an estimated 9 million people are lonely in the UK. Loneliness is associated with negative health outcomes such as high blood pressure, heart disease and strokes. Half a million older people are estimated to go at least six days a week without seeing or speaking to anyone at all. Making new friends can “transform lives” says Christine Roe, who works for the Befriending Scheme, by “making the vital initial links between vulnerable people who might otherwise be feeling sad or lonely”. Both women have gained much from the friendship. “She’s taught me how to take life as it comes,” says Shiplee of Martin. “She’s always so happy. We always have a little laugh.” When I ask her about her Guardian Angel treat, Shiplee balks, as so many altruistic people do. “I’ve never been offered anything like that before,” she says, aghast. The one thing she would like, says Shiplee after thinking for a while, is fresh flowers. Shiplee grew up on a farm and loves to be surrounded by living things. “They’re so beautiful to have around the house, but expensive,” she says. Arena Flowers, a flower subscription service, offers to send Shiplee fresh flowers every fortnight for a year. I catch up with her after her first delivery arrives. “It was such a big bouquet,” says Shiplee. “I wasn’t sure if I had a vase big enough. But I didn’t want to break them up, because they’re done so nicely.” She can’t wait for her next delivery. The flowers will be replaced by a fresh bunch in two weeks. They are a living reminder of a treasured friendship, as well as the mutual benefits that come from connecting with our local community, and getting over your fears to say hello to a stranger.
