1/22/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two Canadians died of gunshot wounds after an argument turned violent at a resort near Cancun on Mexico's Caribbean coast, authorities said on Friday. Both guests at the upscale resort on the Riviera Maya of Quintana Roo state had criminal records, said Mexican officials, citing information from the Canadian police. Mexican police are searching for another person thought to have fired the shots who had a ""long"" criminal record in Canada, said the attorney general's office in Quintana Roo, home to a stretch of white-sand beach resorts and lush jungles. Quintana Roo's head of public security, Lucio Hernandez, said on Twitter a gun was fired amid ""an argument among hotel guests"" at the Hotel Xcaret. Three people were injured and taken to hospital, Hernandez said. He posted photos of the alleged shooter, showing a man in a gray track suit and black face mask wielding a gun in front of green landscaping. Xcaret said the incident appeared to be ""targeted and isolated"" and that the hotel was helping the affected people. ""We deeply regret the events that occurred at Hotel Xcaret this afternoon,"" it said in a statement. The Canadian government said it was contacting Mexican authorities and could not provide more details due to privacy considerations.

1/22/2022,"Russian military forces and hardware began arriving in Belarus this week for the ""Allied Resolve"" drills to be held near the former Soviet republic's western border with NATO members Poland and Lithuania, and close to its southern flank with Ukraine. Western states fear that Russia, which has massed tens of thousands of troops on its borders with Ukraine, is planning a new assault on a country it invaded in 2014. Russia has denied such plans. Lithuania has also said the build-up of Russian troops there was a threat to its security. Russia's defense ministry said two S-400 battalions - which typically include eight anti-aircraft missile systems each - have started moving to Belarus from Russia's Far East by train, Interfax said on Friday (January 21). Moscow has said that 12 Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and a Pantsir missile system would also be deployed to Belarus for the drills.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russia sends S-400 battalions to Belarus for drills,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-sends-400-battalions-belarus-094444004.html
