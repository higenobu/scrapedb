5/7/2022,"Russian fighters have been sharing tips with one another about how to deliberately damage their own equipment and hamper Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war plans in Ukraine, according to recordings of alleged Russian troops’ phone calls that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) intercepted. In one regiment, one Russian soldier allegedly said they’ve been pouring sand into the tanks’ fuel systems to clog them up. “I don't follow stupid orders, I simply refuse,” one fighter can be heard telling a comrade. “The motherf*cker sent me to tanks, motherf*cking piece of shit. I f*cked it up and that's it.” When the fellow Russian soldier on the other end of the line heard the unit wasn’t punished for the insubordination, he indicated he might repeat the tactic later in his own unit. Another Russian fighter shared with a family member that he and his comrades deliberately damaged their tank—the last one left in their regiment—to interfere with an attack plan, as well, according to another intercept the SBU shared. “We have one tank left in the regiment,” he said. “In short, we broke our tank ourselves in the morning so as not to go.” Throughout the invasion, Russian battle plans haven’t gone the way Putin has wanted them to, leaving Putin frustrated and on edge, according to a senior U.S. defense official. One of his major goals was to capture the capital, Kyiv, and install a pro-Putin puppet government. But his troops faltered outside of the capital for days and had countless logistics problems, and in particular had troubles with the fueling, according to the defense official. And while some U.S. officials have said for weeks that it’s at times been unclear if Russia’s military’s failings are due to lack of planning or just poor execution of plans, the intercepted calls suggest in some cases the answer is much simpler. The troops themselves are disobeying orders and sabotaging the war effort on purpose. A mainstay of the war has been images of Russians abandoning their equipment and weapons. Russian military morale has been low from the beginning of the invasion, and it’s not getting any better; Russian troops have begun posting on social media begging for donations to the war effort, showing a side-by-side comparison between their dismal first-aid kits and the Ukrainians. Putin Put on Blast Over Pathetic War Gear for Russian Troops The Russian war effort isn’t only being hampered from the inside. Inspired by the Russians’ intercepted phone calls, Ukraine’s government encouraged other Russian troops to disobey orders and refuse to attack, echoing earlier calls to surrender and abandon the war path. “The SBU welcomes this practice,” the SBU said in a statement Friday. ""But even it can be improved—just ‘give up’ and leave the war in Ukraine!” Ukrainians have been putting up a stiff resistance from day one of the war, surprising Putin along the way, according to the Pentagon. The Pentagon, too, has been providing key intelligence that has helped the Ukrainians target key Russian assets, including the Russian warship the Moskva, which sank in the Black Sea after Ukrainians hit it in a missile strike in April, according to The Washington Post. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby has acknowledged the intelligence-sharing effort but said the U.S. had no part in the targeting. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/7/2022,"Ukrainian military forces have credited their artillery with making the biggest dent in the war with Russia. The Western coalition supplying Ukraine with weapons is now shipping NATO-standard heavy artillery into the theater to bolster Ukrainian field artillery units. The shift to NATO equipment will also make a whole slew of smart artillery shells available that will make Kyiv’s artillery deadlier than ever before. As Western countries ship increasingly heavy arms to a beleaguered Ukraine, one of the most important transfers so far is an arsenal’s worth of field howitzers. Unlike the Ukrainian army’s existing big guns, these artillery pieces come in NATO calibers and are the key to unlocking the West’s precision-guided artillery technology. The tech, which includes GPS-guided artillery shells and tank-hunting munitions, could make Ukraine’s cannon-cockers exponentially more powerful. Ukraine’s army has halted Russia’s advance into the country, and in some cases—like northwest of Kyiv—even sent the Russian Ground Forces scurrying back across the border. The Ukrainians have relied heavily on field artillery to hold off Russia’s invasion and consider it their most effective weapon. A recent study from the United Kingdom-based Royal United Services Institute cites a Ukrainian military official as saying “anti-tank missiles slowed the Russians down, but what killed them was our artillery. That was what broke their units.” The Ukrainian Ground Forces have a considerable number of artillery, both traditional tube and rocket artillery. The total includes 2S3 Akatsiya 152-millimeter and 2S1 122-millimeter Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers; 122-millimeter BM-21 Grad truck-mounted multiple launch rocket systems; and D-20 152-millimeter and D-30 122-millimeter towed artillery pieces. Although theoretically numerous, the pieces are almost all old, produced by the Soviet Union before its collapse in 1991. The guns are also produced in Soviet-era calibers, which a dwindling number of countries (including Russia and Ukraine) continue to operate. NATO forces, on the other hand, use standardized 155-millimeter artillery shells. Those three millimeters make a world of a difference, rendering Western and Soviet-derived shells incompatible with one another. But now, as the West grows bolder in sending advanced weapons, Ukraine is set to receive more than 100 155-millimeter artillery pieces. The United States is slated to send 90 M777 towed howitzers, the current towed artillery piece in use by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps; Australia is sending six M777s, and Canada is sending four. The Netherlands has promised six Pz2000 155-millimeter self-propelled howitzers, while France will send between 10 and 12 CAESAR truck-mounted 155s. These howitzers have powerful implications for Ukraine’s hitting power. Ukraine’s current artillery pieces are at least three decades old, have fairly short ranges, and with the exception of Ukraine’s Kvitnyk laser-guided artillery shells, are unable to take advantage of the last four decades of technological progress and innovation. All of the donated pieces, by contrast, were developed and fielded long after Ukraine’s entire artillery fleet was already built. The Soviet-era 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled howitzer has a range of 10.5 miles and can fire up to three 152-millimeter rounds per minute. By comparison, the French CAESAR self-propelled howitzer has a range of nearly 25 miles and can fire up to six rounds per minute. Ukraine will almost certainly get Western precision-guided rounds as part of the package. The American-developed M982 and M982A1 Excalibur artillery shells can home in on a set of GPS coordinates, and unlike artillery of the past, can hit a target with the first round. Excalibur is so precise, the U.S. Army claims, it will hit within two meters of the target “regardless of range.” This level of accuracy will allow Ukrainian artillerymen to hit more targets faster and without so-called “collateral damage” to civilians still living in combat areas. Excalibur will allow Ukrainian forces to take out enemy forces quickly and more efficiently than ever before—a major asset for a defending force that might find itself outnumbered. A Bayraktar-type drone, for example, could act as a spotter for an Excalibur-armed artillery unit, locating dozens of enemy targets in a single sortie and sending back GPS coordinates for nearby artillerymen to service. Excalibur could take out stationary enemy vehicles one at a time, or even rain down a curtain of well-placed explosive shells along a trench line of enemy troops. A target that might take one battery of six howitzers to destroy might well just take one Excalibur-armed howitzer to destroy. Another round likely winging its way to Ukraine is the UK/French BONUS artillery shell. BONUS was developed for one thing and one thing only: to kill tanks and other armored vehicles. BONUS, once fired from the muzzle of a howitzer, flies downrange and ejects two smart submunitions. The two submunitions use a multispectral sensor package to detect enemy armor across an area of up to 32,000 meters. Once an enemy tank or armored vehicle is detected, the submunition fires a self-forging warhead that lances down through the top of the vehicle, penetrating the thin armor and destroying it. BAE Systems, which is in the process of supplying BONUS to the U.S. Army, says one shell will on average take out one target. Imagine a Russian tank company of ten tanks advancing across an open Ukrainian field. A nearby battery of six M777 howitzers responds to the attack, firing six BONUS at the column. The Russian tank company could lose up to six tanks in a single salvo, instantly rendering the company combat ineffective. BONUS would be devastating against Russian artillery units in firing positions, seeking out and destroying howitzers, ammunition carriers, and headquarters vehicles alike. The United States and its allies believe Ukraine can win, as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said late last month. The new generation of field artillery on its way to Ukraine, as well as an equally new generation of smart shells, will go a long way toward victory for Kyiv. Russia has faced serious setbacks in its “special military operation,” many of its own making, but the hurt inflicted by Ukraine’s new artillery could cause the Russian Army a whole different level of pain.

5/7/2022,"After more than two years in the wilderness, Japan is finally planning to reopen to some tourists from next month. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced on May 5 that the country will start easing its strict border rules from June and bring its approach more in line with other G7 countries. However, he gave no exact details on what the loosening of restrictions might look like. In a speech to the City of London Corporation he said: “At the end of last year, Japan strengthened its border control measures in response to the global spread of the omicron variant. We have now eased border control measures significantly, with the next easing taking place in June, when Japan will introduce a smoother entry process similar to that of other G7 members”. It’s worth noting that all other G7 countries (UK, USA, Canada, Germany, France and Italy) are open to tourists, though some still have vaccination or test requirements. Specialist tour operator InsideJapan was among those celebrating the news. “This is something we have waited over two years for and something that can’t come soon enough,” said co-founder, Simon King. “Although details and dates are yet to be confirmed, it would seem that Japan is set to open for tourism again in June. We have thousands of customers that cannot wait to travel, and enquiries are verging on pre-pandemic levels.” he added. Japan is one of the last major tourist destinations to remain shut off to holidaymakers. In 2019, the country welcomed nearly 32 million overseas visitors and was growing in popularity. However, this figure slumped to just 250,000 in 2021 as the country stuck to fortress-style border restrictions, even while it hosted the delayed Tokyo Olympics. Below, we run through its current rules and look at what the tourist experience might look like if the country meaningfully reopens this summer. Tourist visas remain suspended so it is not currently possible to holiday in Japan. Foreign nationals with residence permits are allowed to travel and it is possible to apply to visit on business or studying grounds. A cap on overseas arrivals remains in place and currently stands at 10,000 passengers per day, up from 7,000 earlier this year. Those who obtain a visa must meet the following conditions before travelling Japan: Show proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before your flight departure time Sign a written pledge that commits you to abiding by any quarantine and self-isolation rules and to a number of other requirements Complete an online health questionnaire On arrival, visitors must take another PCR test and download a health monitoring app. No announcements have been made on exact timings but Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s statement on May 5 suggests the first tourists will be able to travel to the country from June. Following the Prime Minister’s tentative announcement, Japan’s major newspapers have offered conflicting reports on timelines and how the reopening might look, though most have suggested at least some tourists will be able to visit from next month. Details are yet to be confirmed but Japan’s Fuji News Network has reported that those planning on visiting the country must have received at least three Covid vaccinations. Furthermore, they are expected to be required to travel as part of a package tour and will not have free movement around the country. Citing government officials, the broadcaster said the limited reopening would be treated as an experiment and expanded if it didn’t adversely impact Covid rates. A daily cap of visitors is also likely to remain, meaning competition to travel to Japan could be fierce. However, the Nikkei newspaper has suggested that this will at least be doubled to 20,000. It’s worth noting that if the country was genuinely to follow other G7 countries, as suggested by Prime Minister Kishida’s speech, then restrictions might range from nothing (as per the UK) to both proof of vaccination and a negative pre-departure test (as per the US). Japan has recorded 7.99 million Covid cases since the start of the pandemic but only 29,724 deaths from the virus – a much lower tally than many other comparable countries. Cases have been steadily decreasing since an omicron-fuelled surge earlier this year. In terms of restrictions on the ground, its national state of emergency was lifted in March and cross-country travel, eating out and other activities are permitted. Masks are worn by an overwhelming number of citizens both indoors and outside and social distancing guidelines remain in place.",World/The Telegraph,Japan travel advice: latest news as PM finally indicates tourism will restart,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-travel-advice-latest-news-105318302.html
