3/20/2022,"England all but eliminated New Zealand’s chances of reaching the semi-finals of their home World Cup on Sunday – though not after a thorough scare, losing five wickets for 20 runs in their chase of 204 before finally securing a jittery win with one wicket to spare. It should have been a straightforward run chase after England had earlier bowled New Zealand out in 48.5 overs, thanks to three wickets apiece from Kate Cross and Sophie Ecclestone. A half century from Nat Sciver and contributions from Heather Knight (42) and Sophia Dunkley (33) later, and England were coasting at 176 for 4. But Sciver was bowled for 61 in the 44th, while Frankie Mackay spun one past Dunkley’s outside edge before removing Ecclestone and Cross in the space of four balls, finishing with career-best figures of four for 34. The run-out of Katherine Brunt, who inexplicably called for a second run after pulling straight to deep midwicket, left England nine down with eight runs still needed. Finally, to the sheer relief of the England dugout, No 11 Anya Shrubsole whipped out a perfectly timed cover drive for four to level the scores, before clipping a single through midwicket to hand England a narrow win. England’s own path to the semi-final is still far from guaranteed, but beat Pakistan and Bangladesh in their remaining two matches and they will likely scrape through to the knockout stages. “It shouldn’t have got that close, we need to be better than that,” Knight said. “We have to be better at soaking up pressure.” Cross added: “We’re not being clinical enough. It’s been a difficult tournament for us, it’s not gone how we wanted it to or how we envisaged that it would. But we’re starting to pick ourselves up at the right time. The main thing is we’ve got the win on the board and we’ve got the points that we needed.” New Zealand were forced to take to the field without their talismanic captain Sophie Devine, who had retired hurt while batting after collapsing to the ground mid-run. Then, minutes after Lea Tahuhu became her country’s leading wicket-taker of all time in women’s ODIs by bowling Tammy Beaumont between bat and pad, she too was forced off the pitch after pulling up in her follow-through with a hamstring issue, leaving the Kiwis a bowler short. Nonetheless, England did their best to make a meal of the run-chase, losing Danni Wyatt early to a brilliant catch by Hannah Rowe at mid-off, while Amy Jones limply holed out yet again to midwicket. With rain steadily falling, a 70-run partnership between Sciver and Dunkley did enough to ensure England remained ahead of DRS, but the last-minute collapse almost put paid to their efforts. “It’s pretty gut-wrenching to get that close and not quite get over the line,” stand-in skipper Amy Satterthwaite said. “But to show that guts and fight and keep going, I’m proud of the group for doing that consistently throughout this campaign.” Earlier, New Zealand had started strongly, reaching 134 for 2 in the 31st over before another tidy performance from off-spinner Charlie Dean (two for 36) removed Amelia Kerr (24 off 38) and Satterthwaite (24 off 42), both attempting the sweep. Maddy Green (52*) successfully took on Ecclestone, hitting her over the top for the sole six of the New Zealand innings en route to her first half-century in World Cups. But Ecclestone (three for 41) worked her magic at the other end, wrapping up the tail with help from a phenomenal diving catch by Knight at cover to see off Tahuhu. Though Jess Kerr punished two Katherine Brunt’s gimmes for boundaries to take her side past the 200-mark, she was eventually run out by Dean at square leg – seven balls of the New Zealand innings going unused. Wayward opening spells from Brunt and Anya Shrubsole had earlier seen New Zealand off to a flyer as Devine and Suzie Bates put on 44 in the first seven overs, with Knight forced to rotate both bowlers out of the attack early. Brunt set the tone with the very first ball of the day, a leg-side full toss that added one more to England’s total of 69 wides conceded so far in this tournament. But the introduction of Cross in the eighth over, combined with some controversial umpiring from Ruchira Palliyaguruge, underscored an England fightback. The Sri Lankan official adjudged that Bates and Devine had encroached into the danger zone batting out of their creases, and issued warnings to both openers, leading to coach Bob Carter remonstrating with him from the sidelines. Bates was clearly affected, and sent a leading edge to Beaumont at mid-off, trying to loft one over the top. When Devine limped off in the 15th over, having reached 37*, she might have hoped not to be needed again. But when New Zealand lost four wickets for 11 runs, sinking to 155 for six in the 39th over, back she came. And yet, having received treatment for back soreness while off the field, she never looked comfortable, and lasted just six more balls before smashing Cross straight to Dean at long-on. It remains to be seen whether she will be passed fit for their remaining match, against Pakistan on Friday.",Sport/Sport,England wobble but wriggle past New Zealand to stay in World Cup reckoning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/england-wobble-but-wriggle-past-new-zealand-to-stay-in-world-cup-reckoning
3/20/2022,"Shocking new evidence of how Boris Johnson blundered when he was foreign secretary over the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe can be revealed – after the 43-year-old former charity worker was reunited with her family following a harrowing six-year detention in Iran. The emotional reunion early on Thursday with her husband, Richard, and seven-year-old daughter Gabriella came after Britain agreed to pay a debt of £393.8m to Iran relating to an order for Chieftain tanks. Johnson described Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return, alongside that of retired British-Iranian civil engineer Anoosheh Ashoori, as the result of a “great deal of UK diplomacy”. But writing in the Observer, the family’s MP, Tulip Siddiq, reveals new evidence of the shortcomings and at times seemingly callous behaviour of Foreign Office officials and ministers – and the way Johnson failed to grasp even basic details of the case in 2017 – as Richard Ratcliffe sought to highlight his wife’s plight. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Iran during a visit without her husband to see her parents in 2016. She was convicted of plotting to overthrow the country’s clerical regime, claims she has always denied. As foreign secretary, Johnson mistakenly told the foreign affairs select committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been “simply teaching people journalism” – remarks that were seized on in Iran as evidence of her “crimes”. But Siddiq also reveals in her article her shock when Johnson betrayed his ignorance of the case again when he met her with Richard Ratcliffe to discuss his previous error before the committee. “This disastrous blunder meant Johnson was forced to meet us. Again, I raised my concerns about the debt, which were flatly denied by him,” she writes. “Incredibly, he asked if Richard had enjoyed his visit to Iran. Anyone who had read a newspaper article on the case was aware that Richard had been at home in the UK when his wife was arrested in Iran. To this day, I feel astonished by Johnson’s extremely poor grasp of his brief.” The MP writes about how successive prime ministers denied there was any link between the UK’s debt to Iran and Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release, despite the fact that her captors told her there was. It was only last year, after Liz Truss became foreign secretary, that the link was acknowledged and accepted as “legitimate”. Despite widespread elation at the releases, there are growing calls from MPs for a full investigation into the government’s handling of the case, and signs of wider dysfunction in the Foreign Office on matters including the evacuation from Afghanistan. On Monday Philip Barton, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, and Nigel Casey, the special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan, are to be questioned by MPs on the select committee after suggestions that previous evidence given on Afghanistan was incorrect. Sources say the hearing could be explosive. Several members of the committee want the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case to be investigated, including Johnson’s role and the issue around the debt payment. Former cabinet minister Liam Byrne, who is on the committee, said: “It’s now vital we get to the bottom of why Nazanin’s family was forced to resort to a hunger strike to push for the Foreign Office to step up the work to secure her release. “The last thing families should be forced to do at such an acutely distressing time is organise public campaigns to push ministers to act. With the Foreign Office facing big questions from its flawed evacuation efforts in Afghanistan to our lagging effort on sanctions, this latest crisis confirms we need to ask some fundamental questions as to whether the department has its house in order.” Another Labour MP, Chris Bryant, said that despite everyone’s delight at the releases, “we cannot possibly get into a situation where arbitrary detention of dual nationals is rewarded. We will need to do a broad inquiry into the Foreign Office’s handling of this.” A government spokesperson said the prime minister was delighted that Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been reunited with their families. “The Iranian government was responsible for Nazanin’s unfair detention and the decision was always in their gift. However, the prime minister has previously apologised for his comments.” The Home Office is also facing calls to explain why it deported an official Iranian delegation in a move that insiders believe played a role in the problems securing the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori. A small Iranian diplomatic delegation landed at Heathrow in 2013 to discuss a historic £400m debt Britain owed. However, upon arriving, their visas were dismissed, they were held in a detention centre and finally deported. Former prime minister, Theresa May, was home secretary at the time. The current defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was among the MPs to criticise the incident. Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, said their treatment helped fuel the distrust that repeatedly hampered attempts to secure the release of British nationals held in Iran. He called for an explanation. “Their visas were given in the full knowledge of why they were coming here,” he said. “After that experience, the revolutionary guards thought, we need to take more direct action. “This is either a total mistake by the Home Office and the border people or it could have been something more deliberate. I absolutely think that this is something that the home affairs committee ought to look at. Whatever the intention, it had the effect of completely disrupting our negotiations and adding to their instinctive district of us.”",News/News,Family’s MP says Johnson’s ‘poor grasp’ of Zaghari-Ratcliffe case led to errors,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/20/familys-mp-says-johnsons-poor-grasp-of-zaghari-ratcliffe-case-led-to-errors
3/20/2022,"The first time I heard about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case in 2016, I was in my living room with Richard Ratcliffe and Jeremy Corbyn while breastfeeding my newborn. Aside from feeling utterly sorry for this softly spoken accountant, a constituent of mine, I remember being apprehensive about Richard’s determined plans to go public about his family’s plight. In his typically calm manner, he told me the Foreign Office (FCDO) had strongly advised him to stay quiet, as had lawyers he had consulted. Yet he was dismayed the FCDO hadn’t been able to locate or even communicate with Nazanin in 30 days. The officials simply seemed pleased that Iran wasn’t denying her existence, he told me in disbelief. As a legislator, I felt conflicted. Were we putting Nazanin’s life in danger by going public, I asked him tentatively. He said he had put a great deal of thought into it, and that he believed going public would keep his wife safe. I decided to take my cue from Richard and offer support for his campaign, as his MP. It was important to give Nazanin a voice, for her story to be heard. Within three days of going public, Nazanin was allowed a visit from her family, and soon afterwards was transferred out of solitary confinement. We had to recognise these small victories, even though they weren’t enough. Over time, I became bolder in my view that going public was the right approach, but not all parliamentarians agreed. One FCDO minister told me that every time I mentioned Nazanin in parliament I added five years to her prison sentence. Given I was granted eight urgent questions and countless debates in parliament about her, that was an alarming thought. Thank goodness, the maths didn’t add up. I also got into hot water when telling the press that Nazanin’s treatment in prison fitted the UN’s criteria for torture – another FCDO minister tracked down my personal phone number in order to berate me. But soon afterwards, Nazanin was finally allowed a medical examination. When speaking to her months later, while under house arrest, she thanked me and said the campaign meant she was the best-protected inmate in Evin prison. As the years went by, the link between Britain’s historic debt of £400m for a cancelled arms deal with Iran and Nazanin’s imprisonment became a growing source of tension. Along with Labour’s then shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, I repeatedly raised concerns over state hostage-taking and Iran’s clear pattern of behaviour in this area. Nazanin was repeatedly told by her captors that her arrest was linked to the debt, while the then Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, cited it in an interview at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019. Despite this, all three prime ministers and the four foreign secretaries that I dealt with refused to acknowledge the link, beyond off-record briefings to journalists. They were not alone. In March 2021, I asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, then leader of the House of Commons, whether he would agree there was a clear link between Nazanin’s case and the debt. In a call to the prime minister the day before, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, had all but confirmed that resolving this debt was the key to diplomatic progress and could help Nazanin’s case. Rees-Mogg replied: “It would be quite wrong to link payments of any money to the release of somebody who is improperly detained.” The message seemed clear: this government would not acknowledge the link. A breakthrough came towards the end of 2021 when we met Liz Truss (our fifth foreign secretary). For the first time, an elected government official seemed to explicitly acknowledge the link, and she has since described the debt as “legitimate”. Richard and I have, in recent days, found ourselves laughing in sheer disbelief at how the narrative has changed, with the entire government now openly celebrating how it paid the debt to get Nazanin back. While we are overjoyed at the outcome, it’s impossible not to regret all the time that was wasted. I also cannot reflect on Nazanin’s story without lamenting the prime minister’s damaging role in it. In 2017, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, wrongly told the foreign affairs select committee that Nazanin had been in Iran “simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it”. His remarks were weaponised in the Iranian state media and cited by the Iranian judiciary as evidence for her “crimes”. This disastrous blunder meant Johnson was forced to meet us. Again, I raised my concerns about the debt, which were flatly denied by him. Incredibly, he asked if Richard had enjoyed his visit to Iran. Anyone who had read a newspaper article on the case was aware that Richard had been at home in the UK when his wife was arrested in Iran. To this day, I feel astonished by Johnson’s extremely poor grasp of his brief. (Richard gasped at the question.) I should add that this was certainly not the case for the FCDO officials who knew the details of the case inside out. In contrast, I pay tribute to Jeremy Hunt during his time as foreign secretary. He too went against advice from officials when he granted Nazanin diplomatic status. He was frank that it had given him sleepless nights, but said it was the right thing to do as it made her case a state-to-state dispute. While his biggest regret was not bringing Nazanin home, he told me Richard inspired him, reminding him of the need to be there for ordinary people who need help: “We all need that prompt sometimes.” Ultimately, was Richard Ratcliffe vindicated for going public on his wife’s case? Could Nazanin have come home earlier if we had stayed quiet? We will never know, but a great deal of credit must be given to his campaigning, which raised global awareness and ensured the debt was centre of people’s minds. No doubt the government’s need to find another source of energy helped expedite things too. But in my opinion, Richard has been vindicated because his goal evolved as the campaign ran on. It wasn’t just about getting Nazanin home, but also drawing attention to hostage taking and arbitrary detention. As one former foreign secretary said, “Thanks to him, a global scandal has been uncovered.” Not bad for an accountant from West Hampstead.

3/20/2022,"The left are urging a green energy revolution. The right are sounding a battle cry of “Drill, baby, drill”. And American voters, tired of political excuses, are feeling angry. Rising gas prices pose a fresh election year headache for Joe Biden. Republicans accuse him of pushing “a radical anti-US energy agenda”. Democrats put the blame on greedy oil companies and the assault on Ukraine by the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. While some argue that crisis offers opportunity, consumers are feeling the pinch in the latest knotty problem for a US president who, after 14 months in office, seemingly cannot catch a break. “Biden has a cursed presidency,” observed Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. “He’s gotten nailed by the continuation of Covid, by inflation being out of control, by a lunatic leader in Russia and now soaring energy prices that are hitting voters in the pocketbook. They want to be able to get gas for their cars and not spend a hundred bucks.” Prices at the pump, which hit a record high of $4.43 a gallon on average last weekend, were rising long before Russia invaded Ukraine as demand recovered from coronavirus lockdowns. But in announcing a ban on US imports of Russian oil, Biden sought to reframe it as “Putin’s price hike”. Republicans, however, saw a political cudgel with which to beat him. They argue that Biden campaigned on a promise to “wage war” on domestic energy production, signed an executive order to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and suspended or halted oil and gas leases on federal lands. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, tweeted: “Nobody buys Democrats’ efforts to blame 14 months of failed policies on three weeks of crisis in Europe. Inflation and gas prices were skyrocketing and hurting families long before late last month. The White House needs to stop trying to deny their mistakes and start fixing them.” Republicans have also condemned the White House for reportedly considering deals with autocratic regimes for a back-up oil supply, undermining Biden’s moral authority at a critical moment on the world stage. Former president Donald Trump told supporters at a rally in South Carolina: “Now Biden is crawling around the globe on his knees begging and pleading for mercy from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela.” Their solution? Vastly increase domestic oil and gas production to end reliance on foreign countries. Introducing legislation to that end, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said: “To be strong and free as a nation, we must be energy independent. My bill will reverse Joe Biden’s disastrous energy surrender that has allowed Russian energy dominance and instead open up American production full-throttle.” But critics say that, while “energy independence” appears a resonant campaign slogan, it is based on false premise. The price of oil is set on the global market, not by domestic producers. The US exported more petroleum than it imported in 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration, while also increasing overall crude oil production. Nikos Tsafos, an energy and geopolitics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank in Washington, said: “We are energy independent by the definition that people use. We are a net exporter of energy and it doesn’t do anything to protect us, which is not a surprise to anyone who has ever thought about energy markets.” There is a different potential culprit. Consumer gas prices usually move in tandem with oil prices but this week, when oil prices fell below $100 a barrel as China’s Covid-19 outbreak threatened demand, there was little relief for at the pump. Democrats accuse giant oil corporations, already raking in billions of dollars, of profiteering. Biden wrote in a tweet: “Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too. Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it’s $4.31. Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans.” Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and Frank Pallone, chair of the House of Representatives’ energy and commerce committee, requested that oil company chief executives testify before Congress on 6 April. Schumer said on the Senate floor: “The bewildering incongruity between falling oil prices and rising gas prices smacks of price gouging.” In an interview with the Guardian, Ed Markey, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, pointed out that oil companies already have all the land they need to heed Republicans’ plea to “drill, baby, drill” – but will not do it because it is contrary to their business model. “Chevron, Exxon, BP, Shell – they made a combined $75bn in net profits last year and, despite all their crocodile tears right now about this crisis, they’ve already announced that they’re going to return $38bn to their shareholders instead of taking the $38bn and beginning to drill on the 12,000 leases that they have on federal land in the United States for oil and gas,” Markey said. “The reason they’re not going to do it is that they are hypocrites, they are liars. They don’t want to drill because if we produce more oil, that would lower prices for consumers. So it’s all one big lie.” Markey, who helped devise the Green New Deal platform to wean America off fossil fuels at home or abroad, welcomed Biden’s move to tap into the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains 600m barrels. But he added: “In the long term, we need a technology revolution. If we do it, we’re going to be looking at all these companies and countries in a rear-view mirror historically. “We need to go to ‘plug in, baby, plug in’. We need wind, solar, battery storage technologies, all-electric vehicles, all the other innovation technologies that reduce greenhouse gases, but also back out the need for oil and gas in our economy, the European economy, the economy of Japan and all of our allies.” Does Biden, juggling so many crises, still get that? Markey replied: “I was part of a meeting with the president last Wednesday night and he once again made a commitment to his effort to achieve that energy technology revolution in our country.” There is also grassroots pressure on Biden. More than 200 environmental and indigenous organizations signed a letter demanding that he use the Defense Production Act, normally deployed by presidents in wartime to force companies to make weapons, to compel businesses to produce solar panels, wind turbines and other clean energy sources. John Paul Mejia, national spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, a youth movement to stop climate change, said: “The playbook of fossil fuel executives is clearer now than ever. They have used the crisis of war to surge prices at the expense of working people and the takeaway from this is that it is incredibly dangerous and anti-democratic to have an economy dependent on fossil fuels. “We need Biden to use the Defence Production Act to take decisive measures on the urgency, scope and scale of this crisis and transition to clean, renewable, reliable energy.” Biden has given little hint of such a move as he relies on Congress to take action. But his signature Build Back Better plan, which would have poured about $550bn into the clean energy and climate business, appears to be going nowhere fast. One of the chief obstacles is the Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who recently told an energy conference that he was “very reluctant” to see the development of electric vehicles. A key vote in the evenly divided chamber, Manchin has taken more money in political donations from fossil fuel interests than any other senator. Mejia added: “One of the things to view that’s specific to the United States right now is that the crook executives in the fossil fuel industry have a strong hold over American politics in the sense that they have incredibly powerful politicians bought out like Joe Manchin. “At this moment what we’re seeing, especially ahead of elections too, are the so-called conservative Democrats suddenly overnight flipping and pretending to be working-class champions as they morph themselves into caring about what working people are feeling at the gas pump right now. But they’re really just fulfilling their allegiances to their big oil donors.” Opinion polls suggest Biden’s handling of the war in Ukraine has broad public approval but, with hints of a fresh coronavirus wave, his list of problems never seems to shorten. Whatever the causes of inflation, history suggests that voters may punish him at the ballot box. The president’s legislative ambitions for the climate crisis and other priorities are about to collide with midterm elections in which all signs point to Republicans winning the House and possibly the Senate. Biden could find himself spending the second half of his presidency vetoing laws rather than signing them. Jamal Raad, co-founder and executive director of the campaign group Evergreen Action, said: “If there was ever a moment of need for moving to a 100% clean energy economy was more clear that now, I don’t know when would be with a fossil fueled enabled leader attacking another country and throwing the whole fossil fuel global market into chaos. I do believe this is a make-or-break moment.”",News/US news,Biden’s ‘cursed presidency’: gas prices are latest headache as midterms loom,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/20/joe-biden-cursed-presidency-gas-prices-covid-inflation-russia
3/20/2022,"What does it mean to be an adult woman today? Is it an age or a stage? Parenthood, a steady partner, a career or a home of one’s own? Julie, the central character in The Worst Person in the World, shimmies through her 20s to arrive at her 30th birthday with none of these. She’s unmoored, restless, fancy-free – a romantic adventurer and the charismatic subject of a story that is traditionally told about men. As Julie herself puts it, lobbing a grenade into a cosy gathering of her older lover’s friends: “I feel like I know everything about male problems. It’s in all the books and movies. Where’s the menstrual period, orgasm and desire?” They’re all here, in an existential comedy of metropolitan twentysomething life from the Norwegian director Joachim Trier that has had Hollywood royalty queuing up to pay homage. “It’s so brilliant and it wrecked me. I was crying in a way that was like, weird,” said Dakota Johnson. Jamie Lee Curtis enthused: “This is a marvel of a movie… a deep look inside self-love and what drives us.” But, for all that Barack Obama listed the film among his favourites of 2021, it might all have seemed a little too wafty, a little too hung up on male handwringing, were it not for the transfixing central performance of Renate Reinsve. Previously unknown beyond Norway, the 34-year-old actor has captured the zeitgeist just as surely as the lovers in Sally Rooney’s Normal People, winning the best actress award in the film’s first outing to last summer’s Cannes film festival. “There is energy, there is something extraordinary, vivacious in her performance. Something alive that you just can’t define, but you can feel it,” said Isabelle Huppert at the time. Reinsve’s achievement is all the more startling given that the film offer came through the day after she had decided to give it all up. “After acting school, I did some really great theatre. But somehow I ended up in film and TV doing a lot of roles that were mostly one-dimensional functions of the plot. So I had actually decided to quit. I had this big moment where I made that decision to do something else. And the very next day, Joachim called me. It was the weirdest coincidence,” she says. She’s in London for a Valentine’s weekend charm offensive, just days after learning that she is up for her second best actress award, one of two Bafta nominations for the film, which has also just bagged Oscar nominations for best original screenplay and international feature film. There’s a sense that the whole production team have been ambushed by their own wildest desires: the interview is scheduled for Saturday morning at two days’ notice, and there’s a scurrying along the corridors of the Soho hotel that has become their temporary base camp. When our conversation is delayed for half an hour because Reinsve has insisted on a change of costume mid-photoshoot, I wonder if success might have gone to her head. But the woman who breezes into the room in a slinky beige trouser suit is open, unaffected and wryly amused by the fact that she now has a stylist in tow. The problem, it turns out, was a dress with puffy arms. “It looked really cute. But I don’t know… I just needed to feel a little bit cooler today,” she says. For an actor with no previous experience of the promotional merry-go-round, The Worst Person in the World poses a particular challenge, raising repeated questions as to how close Reinsve’s own opinions and values are to Julie’s. In 12 “chapters”, bookended by a prologue and an epilogue, the film interrogates such millennial issues as: “Can you be a feminist and still enjoy oral sex?” At its heart is Julie’s push-pull relationship with a comic-book artist, Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), whose very different perspective on life is shaped by the fact that he is 15 years older than her. He has made his name with underground comics she finds sexist; he wants to have children, but his attempt to integrate her with his social circle gives her a glimpse of family life that appals her. Does Reinsve herself identify with that experience? As far as having children is concerned, no, she says. “I have a lot of empathy and respect for Julie’s position, but it isn’t something that I am myself passionate about.” But that’s not to say there aren’t resonances. “Sometimes I’ve also been with guys who think they’re stronger because they can keep their cool, or they know exactly what to say and how to say it, so they kind of have an overview over the situation while I’ve been in a mess and chaos.” But then she skilfully steers it back to Julie, not knowing what to do with her life. “She’s in a big, divisive, existential vacuum. I was afraid that she would seem passive, because she is there seeing what the situation is, and having trouble making choices. But I wanted that to be like a wise, strong place to be, because it’s the start of any progressive movement in one’s own life. She’s actually exploring what it is to be in that social structure. I don’t think she’s doing it consciously. But she is trying to really find out what it’s all about before making any big choices.” One of her choices is to leave Aksel for a barista she meets after gatecrashing a party. In the film’s most talked about scene, time is frozen for everyone but Julia, who tears across Oslo to declare her love for Eivind (Herbert Nordrum). The scene was shot in real time, with extras brought in to stand still in the streets while the traffic was temporarily stopped, capturing the heart-stopping power of an infatuation that suspends reality. It’s so reckless that you know it won’t end well. “When she makes a choice, it’s a shitty choice a lot of the time – and that’s very true,” says Reinsve. “I feel I’ve made so many bad choices in my life. I really connect to that way of being. I’ve broken up with people who could have been really great for me, or gone into relationships that were really bad for me. And you don’t know the consequence of your choices before you’ve lived that choice. So it’s impossible to make a good choice, isn’t it? c and try to be happy with what you have.” One look at Reinsve’s biography makes it clear that she is very far from the sum of her bad choices. Growing up in a tiny settlement – “a really, really small place, just like a road with some houses and farmlands all around” – she spent much of her early childhood hanging around the hardware store her grandfather had founded, which employed most of her family. When I ask how many siblings she has, she goes quiet for an unusually long time, before finally deciding that the answer is three. Why the hesitation? “Because there are a lot of step-sisters also. We’ve been a lot of girls, but three are my sisters.” At school she became a competition swimmer. “I did it, like, five times a week, with competitions once or twice a week. So it was quite a lot.” But though she was always busy, and surrounded by people, she was clear by her mid-teens that it wasn’t what she wanted, so at 17 she absconded to Edinburgh. “I had a lot of good things, but I also had a lot of bad things. I was quite sad and angry. So I ran away and tried to grow up by myself,” she says, adding that she’d originally intended to go to Costa Rica because it was warm, but she didn’t have any money, and discovered she could fly to the Scottish capital for £1. “Crazy, yeah? Not good. They can’t have treated their employees very well.” In Edinburgh she worked in a bar and “partied a lot with my new friends”. She also got involved with the Fringe, and discovered her vocation. After two years she moved to Oslo “to, like, actually be an actress. I took all the classes, went to acting school. I love books, but I threw them all away except for scripts and books on acting, just to focus. I was very sure about it,” she says. She was in her early 20s when Trier gave her a single line in his 2011 film, Oslo, August 31st, the second part of a loose trilogy set in the Norwegian capital that culminates with The Worst Person in the World. “I was an extended extra,” she says. “I said: ‘Let’s go to the party’, and tried to bring people to the next location, that was my one task. But Joachim said he liked my energy, so even though I only had one line, I was there for nine days.” Over the years, they became friends; “not close”, she says, “but we always ended up talking about really deep existential stuff, because we’re both interested in putting everything in different perspectives. We talked at a deeper level than I’m used to with my friends.” For all that, his phone call offering the part of Julie was a complete surprise. Can it really be true that she had decided the previous day to make a career change? Indeed it is, she insists. “I wanted to be a carpenter, because I really enjoy it. I’m not good at it, but I just wanted to do something completely different and something calm. But I also had a big vision of making a group for women to learn to fix things and build stuff together.” The story of how she got to that point offers a clue to why she is not Julie, but has managed to turn Julie-like choices, which might have been disastrous, to her advantage. She had recently bought a house, she says. “I bought it because I was very naive, and it was rotten, so I had to fix the whole house. I learned so much, and I found it really empowering and meditative to build. It’s so concrete. It’s the opposite of acting, in many ways. You have to be creative, but you have to know what you’re doing as well. You have to make it structurally sound, don’t you?” That carpentry plan is now on indefinite hold, while she rides the wave of her new stardom: “Right now, I have no time at all.” She’s trying to plan her next moves, while dealing with an apparently insatiable public interest. “And I don’t know how to do it. I say weird things and do weird stuff, and act like a normal person.” In Oslo she is constantly being stopped in the streets. “Whenever I go out, someone always comes up to me. People project their own life and their own perspective on to the film, and that’s what you want when you make a movie: to share it and have the experience together with someone. We asked questions when we made this movie, and I feel we didn’t give any answers. It’s like a big conversation with so many people.” One of the more painful conversations arises late on in the film, when Aksel is demolished on television for the sexism of cartoons he created years earlier. An estranged Julie looks on in appalled sympathy, after catching the interview by accident on an overhead screen. It’s yet another scene that arouses curiosity about Reinsve herself: “Well, you’re not having that conversation to solve anything,” she says. “I remember when #MeToo came to Norway, and this happened. I just pulled out of the whole movement, because I felt the women were so aggressive. I really felt that’s the wrong way to do it, because we need men also. They, of course, feel really, really bad and vulnerable for having had these views that were imposed on them [by society]. They aren’t just bad people who were born like that. So it’s really, really complicated. To solve it together, and talk about it, is the most important thing.” Though she’s getting used to being a spokeswoman for such controversial issues, which is way above the pay grade of the average first-time star, she’s considering signing up for therapy once the press tour is over, she says. She’s not being entirely frivolous. “In interviews, you talk so much about yourself and I’m used to having two-way conversations. I’m going to see the therapist and I’m going to say: ‘OK, hello. It’s been a year. Just how fucked up am I?’” The Worst Person in the World is released in cinemas on 25 March",Arts/Film,"Meet Renate Reinsve, the Norwegian actor stealing Hollywood’s heart ",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/20/renate-reinsve-actor-worst-person-in-world-interview
3/20/2022,"For a moment, Billy Dinh didn’t see that there was a man’s face among all the junk in the shop. The photographer was walking in the back alleys of Mardin, the ancient city in the south of Turkey not far from the Syrian border. The narrow streets there are lined with hole-in-the-wall shacks like this one, where it seems you might buy old paint tins and a bit of pipe. It was only when the stallholder took a drag on his cigarette that he emerged from the wreckage. Dinh, a 32-year-old part-time photographer from Brooklyn, has come to live for such moments. Over the past four years, since he started taking photographs seriously, he has visited 50 countries with his camera, in weeks off from his day job as a product manager for a tech firm. With an extraordinary feel for cinematic light, he has built a following of 180,000 on his Instagram feed. He has made a series called Moments: Around the World in which he finds people, like this Turkish man, at home in their own reality. “I am always looking for people just going about their day,” he says. “The trick is quickly getting a sense of the available light; in this case, fortunately, there was a bare lightbulb right above him.” Dinh is among that group of young photographers who are finding new ways to support their work. He grew up, he says, in a first-generation immigrant family in Philadelphia, where possibilities for an artistic career seemed limited. He always dreamed of being an illustrator, until he picked up a camera. For the past couple of years, he has been selling pictures to followers as NFTs.

3/20/2022,"Last week, two Fox News journalists died in Ukraine, and the news channel grieved along with the rest of the country amid anger at the Russian onslaught. Republicans, too, rapidly shed past views on Russia and some called for no-fly zones and supplying Ukraine with Polish MiG fighter jets as Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion ground on. But the far-right Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the alternately flabbergasted and outraged primetime host and Trumpist standard-bearer, carried on presenting his conspiratorial show with such a seeming lack of regard that the Kremlin itself reportedly considers his equivocations over the causes of the conflict vital to its propaganda apparatus. Even Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov – no doubt largely thanks to Carlson – had praise for Fox’s coverage of the conflict. “If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative points of view,” he said on Friday. But no action has apparently yet been taken by Fox News executives to rein Carlson in. The 52-year-old host has taken on the mantle of “Tucker the Untouchable”, even taking huge public offense when a senior Republican lawmaker called his show “an organ of disinformation”. The criticism came from the Texas congressman Michael McCaul, one of two Republicans who have expressed concern in recent weeks that Carlson’s nightly show – clips of which have in turn been relayed on Russian state media in recent weeks – has veered too close to defending the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Outrage is, of course, Carlson’s specialization. On Thursday, he amped it up after McCaul’s comments. “In other words, not only are we wrong – which is fine – we’re disloyal Americans doing the bidding of a foreign power. It’s not fine. It’s slander,” he fumed. Carlson went on to accuse McCaul and other Republicans of “talking like Joe Biden”, who “calls anything he doesn’t like ‘Russian disinformation’”. And that, typically enough, returned him to the subject of Hunter Biden, who is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over payments he received from a number of foreign companies, including the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Carlson has long questioned Putin as a villain. At the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he went on air to tell his viewers: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” Last weekend, the US website Mother Jones reported that the Kremlin told Russian media it was “essential” that Carlson’s pro-Putin rhetoric was aired, though the outlet did not publish the documents it cited. It comes as his employer lost two members of its newsgathering operation – the Ukrainian producer and fixer Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova, 24, and Fox News cameraperson Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, to shelling in Gorenka, outside Kyiv, on Monday. Another Fox journalist was badly injured and evacuated. Yet, amid a huge outpouring of sympathy for Fox’s staff, and anger at the Russian army, Carlson, on successive nights last week, devoted segments to promoting Moscow’s unfounded propaganda claims of secret American biological warfare labs in Ukraine. US officials have said the labs are Ukrainian and part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that has received US financial assistance. The White House has warned that the Kremlin’s conspiracy theory, used to justify its invasion of Ukraine, could itself be a prelude to a Russian chemical or biological attack. “This is a classic move by the Russians,” warned the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, this week. The Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen told the Senate foreign relations committee that Carlson and others were behind the spread of the bioweapons rumors, which are gaining credence in the US far right. Other Republicans, including the Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger, have refused to go on Tucker Carlson Tonight because of his alleged pro-Putin agenda. Kinzinger has accused Carlson of pushing the narrative that the US is to blame for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “There’s no way I’ll go on his show, for a number of reasons,” Kinzinger, a US air force veteran, said in a Twitter video. “His insistence that the west was provoking war with Putin, his spreading lies about biolabs, and his continued spewing of conspiracy theories are nothing but complete evil. His show is full of Russian propaganda and not news.” Carlson’s power comes amid the rise of far-right groups, individuals and opinions across the US. Whether from militia supporters seeking power in California local government, or in the Idaho state office, or on new social media platforms, the far right in America is undergoing something of a boom. Carlson, experts say, is part of that. And so too is a fondness – or at least a respect – for Putin. According to Scott McLemee, who reviewed a newly published study on the right in Inside Higher Ed last week: “There is no question about Carlson being at very least a white nationalist, which might not be fascist, but close enough. “The appeal of Russian authoritarianism for the American far right is considerable, and not just because of Trump’s fealty to Putin. A common skin color and shared hostility to feminism and gay rights counts for a lot.” But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the daily images of suffering it has produced for US media, have complicated Carlson’s platform, at least in terms of the broader US media landscape, even if not within Fox itself. “This balancing act he’s been playing on so many different levels is getting a lot more precarious,” said Bob Thompson, a former professor of media studies at Syracuse University and current director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. Carlson’s equivocation on Russian aggression is complicating the ideological real estate he occupies. “It’s not only confused, it’s almost dada,” Thompson says. “You see it playing out on the show when someone makes a rational argument and it’s deflected not with an alternative, but the abandonment of rationality.” But that may also be what Carlson’s avid supporters and equally avid detractors come to see. It’s the nature of cable news that relatively few viewers are required to establish a commercial footing, so the power of advertisers to speak for the body politic by pulling advertising when a host says something egregious has diminished – and with it the chances of getting fired. And Carlson remains a hugely popular figure with Fox viewers and, through them, the Trump base and the Republican politicians that it powers. Which leaves Carlson and others on the right and left to indulge whatever particular train of thought, or lack thereof, they choose to follow. “The whole point of these shows is to outrage viewers across the country, which will in turn strengthen the very small audience you need for it to be a hit,” Thompson said. “Carlson is, in a sense, untouchable because outrage is a genre of entertainment all of its own.”",News/Media,‘Tucker the Untouchable’ goes soft on Putin but remains Fox News’s biggest power,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/20/tucker-the-untouchable-fox-news-host-putin-russia
3/20/2022,"Halfway through this subtle, sophisticated attempt to diagnose the state of the nation, Jason Cowley is given a tour of the East London Mosque in Whitechapel – the largest and oldest in Britain. He is there to talk to Imam Mohammed Mahmoud, who became famous for his calm wisdom during the Finsbury Park mosque attack, when he protected a white terrorist from an angry crowd of worshippers. But he also meets Sufia Alam, manager of the Maryam centre at the mosque, where Muslim women can gather and pray. A British Bangladeshi, Alam takes her leave of Cowley with a friendly but pointed reference to the legacy of empire, delivered in a strong east London accent: “We are here because you were there. You will have to learn to live with us – because we aren’t going anywhere. England is our home.” But what is England? The complex, ever-changing nature of our shared national home is the central theme of Who Are We Now? This is a book that Cowley began to write at the height of the political polarisation that followed the Brexit referendum, and completed as the country emerged from the Covid pandemic. It is, in part, a reflection on what these crises have taught us, for better and for worse. But it is also a book about home: specifically, what might a “common home” look like in the future for the citizens of a diverse and at times bitterly divided country? During his long editorship of the left-leaning New Statesman magazine, Cowley has shown a notable willingness to showcase an eclectic range of views that challenge the current liberal consensus in Labour and beyond. Figures associated with the social conservatism of “Blue Labour” have regularly featured alongside more orthodox tribunes of the liberal left. “England” – its fate, meaning and possibilities – is one of the most neuralgic subjects of all for progressives, so often associated with the hubristic delusions of the nationalist right. But it is one that clearly frames and informs Cowley’s political preoccupations, as well as his football passions. Through a series of individual tales compellingly told, he revisits some of the significant news stories that have made headlines in modern England. Shire patriotism, British Muslim identity, post-industrial decline and the dark, ruthless underbelly to the global economy are all explored. One chapter deals with the moving “liturgy of repatriation” that developed in Wootton Bassett, as the bodies of British soldiers were brought back from Iraq and Afghanistan in the 00s, but which then attracted the thuggish attention of the English Defence League. Mahmoud remembers his fear of the anti-Muslim backlash that would follow if Darren Osborne, a white supremacist alcoholic, was beaten to death. But he also recalls his intense homesickness for England – its queues, public transport and NHS – during a sojourn in Cairo. Gillian Duffy, the Rochdale pensioner whose awkward questions helped derail Gordon Brown’s election hopes in 2010, features in a chapter entitled “Visitor from the Future”. Cowley recalls Brown telling him during that doomed campaign that he was consoled by a belief that David Cameron’s Conservatives represented a form of continuity with New Labour’s economic and social liberalism. Looking back, Cowley writes, “Mrs Duffy knew something Gordon Brown did not. She was troubled by… weakening social cohesion. She knew that many other longtime Labour voters shared her unease and sense of loss.” England’s political landscape, and the Labour party’s place within it, was about to be transformed. On Cowley goes, through events that were pivotal and are familiar, but are rarely juxtaposed with each other as evidence of who we are now. The Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 are viewed through the acute lens of Patrick Hutchinson, whose firefighter’s lift to rescue a shaven-headed Tommy Robinson supporter from a beating became the most famous image of that summer. “They think they’re defending Englishness,” says Hutchinson. “They think they’re the last line of defence.” Is that kind of recidivist, insular, punching Englishness, wonders Cowley, the inevitable default setting for a concept that will never escape the shadow of the imperial past? Many progressives would simply say yes. He pushes back somewhat, celebrating the emerging, “inchoate” England captured by Gareth Southgate before the Euro 2020 football tournament. Southgate’s letter to England ranged from his grandfather’s war record to the social activism of his young black players. It proved, writes Cowley, that in defining a new inclusive Englishness “you don’t have to choose between diversity and tradition”. But could Southgate’s “progressive patriotism” really catch on, or was it merely “a haunting glimpse of what might have been in a country without our burden of traditionalism and lack of republican and modernist credentials?” This is a gentle and intelligent book, refreshingly unpolemical and reflective. It is also, at times, a slightly melancholy one. The true hero is perhaps Connie, the author’s 93-year-old aunt and the family matriarch. Moving to Harlow in the postwar years, like the rest of the Cowley family, Connie embodied the “never again” hope and idealism of the Labour new town. Social solidarity forged in war was to make a new peace in which working-class people could live well. In the words of Lord Reith, it would be “a happy and gracious way of life”. In 1961, Connie enthusiastically paid a local tax to finance a sports centre for the town. “We were children of the welfare state,” writes Cowley of himself and his friends. But by 2018 only Connie had stayed in Harlow, which, like so many other towns, had endured a long era of neglect and economic decline. Doughty as ever but heartbroken, she made the national news vainly fighting an American conglomerate’s decision to close a doctor’s surgery built in 1955. Cowley himself, as he moved through more rarefied social circles in his journalistic career, left Harlow behind in his mind. But this book, as well as many other things, is a kind of pilgrimage of return to the place that formed him. The town was overwhelmingly white and working class. But its warm social democratic ethos – “East Germany without the Stasi”, jokes one friend mischievously – placed the common good at the forefront of people’s concerns. Could the crises of Brexit and Covid – and now the horror of the war in Ukraine, which started after Who Are We Now? went to press – expose the need for a modern version of this postwar solidarity, in a very different multi-ethnic and regionally divided England? Unprescriptive, ruminative, Cowley does not say. But that is what he hopes.  Who Are We Now?: Stories of Modern England by Jason Cowley is published by Picador (£20).

3/20/2022,"Liz Harvie was 16 years old when she discovered her name was actually Claire Watts. Sitting on the sofa of her childhood home, on a tree-lined street in a Birmingham suburb, she had just been given a sheet of paper containing the first chapter of her life. The document said “Claire”, a “compact baby” with a “pale complexion” and “light auburn hair”, had been born at a Northampton hospital in January 1974 and then put up for adoption. It also included descriptions of her birth parents: Yvonne, a “neat”, “articulate” and “quite attractive” telephonist who liked swimming, reading and knitting, and Andrew, a “well-built” wireless operator who liked rugby and tropical fish. “It was mind-blowing,” said Harvie, now 48. “I was reading about a different person born in a different part of the country. Technically, it was me.” Adopted by a couple who renamed her Elizabeth, Harvie always knew she had come from “another lady’s tummy” and wondered why she had been given away. But, as she would later discover, she had not been abandoned by choice. Taken from the arms of her sobbing mother at 10 days old, Harvie was one of thousands of victims of forced adoption in the UK. In the 1950s, 60s and 70s, up to a 250,000 new mothers were coerced into giving up their babies in arrangements facilitated by the church, charities and the government. The young unmarried women were not considered “suitable” parents by society or their families, and their babies were given to married couples who were. The scandal of forced adoption reached into every corner of the UK, but the stories of the families torn apart have largely gone untold. Last week in parliament, Harvie, who first met her birth mother when she was 28, gave evidence on behalf of thousands of other adoptees to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is investigating the historical abuses. The hospice volunteer from Surrey described how groups “colluded” to remove children from unmarried mothers and called for an apology. “For many involved in forced adoption the right to family life was simply not honoured,” she told MPs. Speaking after the session on Wednesday, Harvie, now a mother of two herself, said giving evidence was one of “the most important days” of her life. “To get the chance to stand up in parliament and give evidence was humongous. For too long, it’s been like we’re part of a secret society.” Brought up by a finance director and magistrate in a typical middle-class home, Harvie had for years been the “perfect” adoptee. Privately, however, she struggled. At school, she was called a “bastard” by playground bullies and taunted about her mum not being her “real mum”. At home, she had a close relationship with her brother, who was also adopted – but felt she didn’t fit in. “I stuffed things down and appeared to be ‘happy Liz’. But you feel like a stranger in your own skin, in your own family,” she said. Sixty miles away in Northampton, her birth mother, Yvonne Labrum, was living in torment, thinking about her daughter “every single day”. Labrum had always dreamed of having a daughter but when she got pregnant at 19, her father “went mad”. The child’s father, Andrew Conant was a childhood sweetheart but they were not married, and their parents disapproved of the match. “My father said, ‘Right, you’re going to the doctors and having an abortion,” Labrum, now 68, said. “The doctor said it was too late, so he said, ‘Right, the baby’s going up for adoption, then.’ I never got a say in the matter.” Moments after giving birth, Labrum’s daughter was taken from her by the midwives. At first, they had congratulated her on her “beautiful baby girl”. But after checking her file, “One of the nurses said, ‘This baby’s flagged for adoption,’ and that was it.” Labrum, who had given birth without pain relief and needed stitches, was left lying with her legs in stirrups for more than an hour. “I felt like a slab of meat,” she said. Over the next few days, she was required to look after her daughter at the hospital, surrounded by mothers who were preparing to take their newborns home. On the 10th day, a “stern” social worker visited to take Claire away. Labrum packed a bag for her daughter before putting her arms out to give her a final cuddle. But the social worker refused to pass her back. “I was standing there in floods of tears,” she said. “It was like having your heart ripped out of your chest.” In the months that followed, she became “very withdrawn”. “I didn’t want to do anything. All I kept thinking was, ‘Where’s my baby?’” She later married and pursued her career - but she never forgot about Claire. It was not until 1995 that the mother and daughter reconnected, after they had both registered their details with the Children’s Society, the organisation that had arranged the adoption. They exchanged letters and pictures for seven years before agreeing to meet in person. They were desperate to see each other in real life but Harvie was “frightened”. “You have to be ready for something like that,” she said. When they did eventually meet in 2002, at a hotel in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, they “cried and hugged and didn’t want to let go”, she said. They have since made up for lost time, learning each other’s life stories. They have lots in common: small hands, the same eyes, a silly sense of humour. Harvie also reconnected with her birth father, who trained in aromatherapy like her. She discovered she has five half siblings, including sisters she had always longed for. Theirs is a happy ending, but it has not been easy. They both still live with the trauma of the past. For Harvie, giving birth to her daughters was particularly tough. She had an emergency C-section for her eldest. “It sounds silly, but the thing I most wanted was to see my baby come out,” she said. “My brain needed to see that baby was mine.” Labrum still feels that she was robbed of motherhood. She had wanted more children but never fell pregnant again, despite three courses of IVF. “My chance of being a mum was ripped away from me,” she said. The mother and daughter have called on the government to issue an official apology on behalf of the institutions and individuals that treated them so badly. They also called for specialist support for victims of the scandal, who have so far received none, and easier access to counselling services for adult adoptees. Other countries where forced adoption took place, including Canada and Australia, have already apologised. For Labrum, an official apology would mean the recognition that the adoptions “shouldn’t have happened”, and that she – as a young, unmarried mother – was not to blame. “It won’t repair all the harm, but it would help,” she said. “We weren’t naughty girls who did something wrong. We were human beings.”",News/Society,‘We were human beings’: UK families seek apology over historic forced adoptions,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/we-were-human-beings-uk-families-seek-apology-over-historic-forced-adoptions
3/20/2022,"The Australian comedian Bill Kerr used to begin his BBC appearances with: “I don’t want to worry you, but …” Funny how those words came back to me last week as I watched the television coverage of the criminal bombing of homes in Ukraine. Some of us are old enough to remember Hitler’s bombing of London, Coventry and elsewhere, not forgetting Britain’s bombing of Dresden. Kurt Vonnegut’s book about it, Slaughterhouse-Five, is a disturbing classic. It was because European, and American, leaders – let alone their people – never wished to witness such horrors again that the European movement began. Now here we are, with the tyrant in the Kremlin repeating such horrifying scenes in Europe, yes Europe. Putin is the modern epitome of Lord Acton’s famous and well-phrased dictum: “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Quite apart from the inhumanity and carnage, in his infinite folly Putin has set off a process of economic and social disruption which compounds the many obvious crises that the world already faced. As energy prices soar, memories are being revived in the UK of the 1970s, when the first oil crisis of 1973-74 was a major factor in unseating the 1970-74 government of Edward Heath, and also sowed the seeds of the ultimate failure of the Wilson and Callaghan governments of 1974-79. The sight of our egregious prime minister Boris Johnson going, oil can in hand, to Middle Eastern dictators to plead for economic help to counteract damage inflicted by another dictator, Putin, evokes an uncomfortable memory. When Labour chancellor Denis Healey was besieged in 1976 by rampant inflation and a balance of payments crisis, the Treasury’s top civil servant, my good friend the late Sir Douglas Wass, tried to lighten the mood by saying: “It could be worse, Chancellor. The Russians might be invading.” Yes, well, let us not go there. I am sure that when he first had chancellorial ambitions, Rishi Sunak was not expecting to have to cope with echoes of the 1970s. But here we are, with inflation accelerating and the chair of John Lewis, Dame Sharon White, a highly respected former Treasury official, worrying that the rate of inflation may be heading once again for “double digits”. True, inflation has been exacerbated by shortages provoked by the pandemic. It has also been aggravated by the serious impact on food, not least grain, and other shortages resulting from Putin’s war. But something else has been driving prices up all over the place, and that is – you have no doubt guessed it – the mounting impact of Brexit. On which subject I recently had an interesting encounter with a Remainer British expat who was visiting his Brexiter friends in assorted home counties havens. To his surprise, he found that most of them were admitting in private but could not bring themselves to say so publicly: “Brexit is a catastrophe.” Of course, it has not yet unseated the chief elected culprit, Johnson, because he keeps being let off the hook by other distractions, such as Covid – now apparently reviving – and the awful tragedy of Ukraine. But the war in Ukraine has highlighted the geopolitical folly of Britain’s departure from the EU. It has brought European nations together, and left the UK trailing behind, while the absurdity of “global Britain” and aircraft carriers being sent to the far east becomes ever more apparent. Brexiter Sunak faces one hell of a task with his spring statement this week. The soaring cost of energy, as in the 1970s, is both inflationary in driving up prices and deflationary in acting as a depressant on demand in the real economy. Sunak should be telling us that Brexit was a mistake, and that a major reconsideration of economic strategy is required. He himself is very well off. So are the “oligarchs” Johnson and co used to cultivate until the popular tide turned against them. Many people are not so fortunate. As Francis Bacon said: “Fortunes … come tumbling into some men’s laps.” Oligarchy in ancient Greek meant rule by the few. Strictly speaking, the men referred to today as oligarchs are not rulers but rich men who have plundered the Russian nation’s resources. As Aristotle says in The Politics, “sovereignty”, when they tired of tyrants, was “exercised in oligarchy by the rich”. It is an awful commentary on the “values” of Johnson and Sunak’s predecessor George Osborne that they are up to their necks in the scandal that has made London, nicknamed Londongrad, the money-laundering capital of the world. However, as my mother would have said: “It will all come out in the wash.”",News/Business,War has highlighted the geopolitical folly of Britain’s departure from the EU,https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/war-has-highlighted-the-geopolitical-folly-of-britains-departure-from-the-eu

3/20/2022,"What’s the plan, Joe? When he descends on Brussels this week for an emergency Nato summit, US president Joe Biden will proudly point to his big achievement during the Ukraine crisis: maintaining the unity of the alliance and keeping out of the war. Biden wants Russia to lose, to be seen to fail. But bold, decisive action to that end is lacking. The US approach is essentially reactive, tactical, detached. Is this really all that risk-averse American global leadership has to offer these days? As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Congress last week, weapons and sanctions are not enough. US fears of escalation are well understood in Kyiv. But its forces still need combat planes, aerial protection and safe humanitarian corridors. More than that, Ukraine’s people need effective, inspiring western leadership in support of the democratic ideals Biden champions. Their children are dying each day while Nato acts like a self-preservation society. They need a saviour. They need a plan. “You are the leader of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world [which] means to be the leader of peace,” Zelenskiy told Biden in what sounded very much like a reproach. Republican senator Ben Sasse was more forthright. “They [Ukrainians] are fighting for the free world. We’re a superpower. We should act like it,” he said. Unfolding around Ukraine’s mass graves and blasted cities is a new “forever war” of the type Biden vowed to end. Judging by his latest comments, Vladimir Putin will not cease fire any time soon. Talking peace to him is like begging a butcher to turn vegetarian. Bloodbath upon atrocious bloodbath beckons. America’s president needs a strategy with open-ended options. First, he must stop naively assuring Putin that the allies will not intervene in any circumstances. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair, who knows a thing or two about invasions, gently chided him on this point last week. “Is it sensible to tell him [Putin] in advance that whatever he does militarily, we will rule out any form of military response?” It was a “strange tactic”, Blair wrote. Some British ministers reportedly share his concern. “Not provoking Putin” is the nearest the western powers have come to a mission statement. Yet the US alone is providing $2bn in military aid. British anti-tank weapons are exacting a grim toll. Russia is targeting western arms convoys, has bombed a staging post near the Polish border and twice sent military drones into neighbouring Nato states. Like it or not, mutual provocations are multiplying uncontrollably. Biden says Putin is a “war criminal”. So will he now seek his arrest? Will the US join the UN-backed International criminal court, where war crimes are tried? Don’t bet on it. By leaving Ukraine to fight alone, Biden risks confirming the long-held view on the European left that Nato is mostly about America’s forward defence, not enhancing Europe’s security or upholding international law. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, would surely take exception to that claim. His focus is on defending Nato members and he’s doing a fantastic job. “Nato will not tolerate any attack on allied sovereignty,” he declared last week. Fine. So what’s the plan, Jens? What about the slaughter next door? US-led Nato is not a purely defensive alliance. Nato forces fought in Afghanistan for 20 years. They bombed Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. A little more imagination in Washington and Brussels about what might be militarily possible, without triggering world war three, could go a long way in Ukraine. It’s unfair to blame weak US leadership alone. Nato has 30 member states, mostly European. Despite Biden’s talk of unprecedented unity, cracks are showing. East European countries, notably Poland and the three Baltic republics, want Nato and the EU to adopt a more robust military and sanctions posture. They also support Ukraine’s EU membership. Germany, Italy, Hungary, Greece and others are opposed. When the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia travelled to Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy last week, Brussels hastened to make clear this was not an EU delegation, again for fear of provoking Putin. When Jarosław Kaczyński, the Polish leader, suggested an armed “peace mission” inside Ukraine, he was slapped down. So what’s the plan, Olaf? Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Europe’s most powerful country, has hugely increased national defence spending and suspended a Russian gas pipeline. But he rejects Ukraine’s call for an immediate, total energy embargo and is blocking or delaying additional sanctions. Zelenskiy lambasted Germany’s record last week, accusing it of prioritising economic interests over European security. These widening divisions could make for an explosive EU summit. It will take place alongside the Nato meeting this week. French president Emmanuel Macron is firmly in the German camp. The French oil giant TotalEnergies, for example, is conducting business as usual in Russia. Internal EU tensions will surely grow as the war drags on amid “sanctions fatigue”. Since Biden, Nato and the Europeans lack an agreed long-term strategy to save Ukraine, could this be “global Britain’s” big moment? What’s the plan, Boris? Alas, he doesn’t have one either. As usual, Britain’s Churchill tribute act is hugging Washington close, whatever he may privately think about Biden’s leadership. His UK Joint Expeditionary Force carries an unfortunate whiff of Dunkirk. Doing America’s bidding, Boris Johnson went cap in hand to Saudi Arabia last week in search of cheap oil and was ritually humiliated by another mass murderer. Far from holding the ring, Britain, as matters stand, will not even be in the room this week when Europe ponders its biggest security and refugee crisis since 1945. Who’d have thought Brexit could make the plight of Ukrainians any worse? But it has.",Opinion/Opinion,"What’s the plan, Joe?

3/20/2022,"To the outside world, ceramides sound like a new proposition. They’re not. Beauty insiders have heard the word bandied around forever. But that doesn’t mean everyone understood what it meant. I recall, many years ago, attending a beauty launch in Paris. “Ceramide” was injected into every sentence and everyone nodded in all the right places. When we left, my colleagues and I looked perplexed. Finally, someone piped up: “So what the hell are ceramides?” So let’s break it down: if your skin cells were wall tiles, ceramides would be the grout that bonds them together. But more than that, ceramides are lipids – basically, fats – that seal in moisture keeping your skin looking plump, youthful and juicy. Young skin produces tons of ceramides. Older skin? Not so much. And the ceramides that are produced are not the quality they once were – sun damage, humidity, central heating don’t help. So, in order to replenish the ceramides in your skin, you need well-formulated, ceramide-rich products which is where these all come in. They will help keep your skin barrier healthy and (for those interested), they smooth fine lines, improve hydration levels and give you that plumper, youthful, juicy, healthy skin we all long for. 1.

3/20/2022,"Ideology has no place in medicine. An individual’s healthcare must not be influenced by a clinician’s biases. But an independent review has highlighted that the quality of care for children with gender dysphoria in England has been unconscionably compromised in recent years, partly as a result of adult affinities to an unevidenced worldview. The review, led by the distinguished paediatrician and former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Dr Hilary Cass, has published its interim report. Its findings echo concerns already flagged by the courts, the Care Quality Commission, and, as the Observer has reported over the years, several NHS whistleblowers. The report highlights a profound lack of evidence and medical consensus about the best approach to treating gender dysphoria in children. Yet the NHS’s specialist Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) takes a child’s expressed gender identity as the starting point for treatment. This “affirmative approach” leaves little space for exploration of the potential relationship between their dysphoria and neurodiversity or psychosocial needs, including those arising from childhood trauma or internalised hostility to same-sex attraction. GIDS has compounded this lack of evidence with its own failure to track patient outcomes. As referrals to GIDS have increased, capacity has not kept up, meaning that children face unacceptably long waits for care. Also, it has been applying the affirmative model in a looser form than in the Netherlands, where it was conceived, and to a patient group whose characteristics have changed dramatically from those for whom it was developed – teenage girls, whose gender dysphoria has manifested in adolescence rather than in early childhood. The majority of young people now referred to GIDS have other complex mental health issues or neurodiversity, but GIDS has failed to assess these needs in the round. The review is also clear about the lack of evidence about one of the affirmative model’s treatment pathways: puberty-blocking drugs, which, for the vast majority of children prescribed them, function as a precursor to cross-sex hormones. The long-term health consequences of puberty blockers are unknown, and there is clinical confusion about their purpose. It is unclear whether children progress to cross-sex hormones because their gender identity was already settled, or whether puberty blockers interfere with the natural resolution of gender dysphoria. Young people’s gender identity can remain in flux until their mid-20s, so the risk of regret following irreversible treatment needs to be understood, but there is a lack of data on regret. The report notes the lack of services and support for young detransitioners like Keira Bell, who took the trust that runs GIDS to court, and who has played a vital role in drawing attention to its inadequate care. The reason that these failures in children’s healthcare have taken so long to be addressed is the polarised nature of the adult debate about gender identity. There has been a deplorable tendency by some to mislabel clinical concerns about the affirmative model as transphobia. This polarisation has contributed to a climate in which clinicians both inside and outside GIDS are fearful of raising concerns. An employment tribunal found that NHS whistleblowers at GIDS faced shocking levels of vilification and attempts to undermine their professional integrity. Even in the wake of the Cass report’s hard-hitting findings, some clinicians and charities continue in their efforts to shut down legitimate debate about the affirmative model. These adults must examine their consciences, because it is children whose care is compromised as a result of their ideology.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on gender identity services for children | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/observer-view-cass-review-gender-identity-services-young-people
3/20/2022,"Britain’s Homes for Ukraine scheme will be “completely unworkable” unless the government cuts excessive bureaucracy and takes urgent steps to coordinate the matching process, the shadow communities secretary has warned. In an interview with the Observer Lisa Nandy also said charities and local government should have been properly consulted before announcing the sponsorship scheme – through which members of the public or organisations can bring a named refugee fleeing Ukraine to Britain. Phase one of the initiative opened on Friday for visa applications from Ukrainians wishing to travel to the UK and who have a named sponsor. So far there have been 150,000 expressions of interest in assisting those fleeing Ukraine with no family links to the UK. But Nandy said: “There is no formal central system of matching the people on the register to those in need, which is pretty extraordinary. “When you add in the excessive layers of bureaucracy – the lengthy forms and the documents you need to prove your identity and residency – the barriers make this scheme completely unworkable. Unless urgent steps are taken to address this, we will see very small numbers of people taking up this offer and a lot of the public’s generosity squandered.” At first, said Nandy, it appeared the government wanted desperate people to advertise themselves on social media so the British public could find them. “Since this was met with criticism, they seem to have shifted to getting charities involved,” she said. But there is concern from the sector about lack of clarity and consultation. Last week one charity, Reset Communities and Refugees, launched a matching system on its website. But another UK-based refugee charity told the Observer: “The government has asked us to be a matching organisation without telling us what that involves. We would love to assist but do not want to commit ourselves blind to a process we know nothing about. We could ramp up getting hosts through and making placements but we do not have the expertise to do visas. These people are fleeing war and they shouldn’t have to be going through the complexity of the visa process.” Daniel Sohege, a specialist in international refugee law and director of the charity Stand for All, said: “The informal match portals popping up on social media platforms don’t appear to be regulated, meaning they risk exploitation.” Writing on Twitter he said: “If you are basing your refugee protection system on Tinder then you have definitely got issues … Denies access to many, and puts those who do get it at risk of exploitation and trafficking.” He told the Observer: “We need a government-run matching portal with inbuilt safeguarding checks. The government has been liaising with certain groups but it hasn’t brought in the refugee or child protection sectors on a large scale.” Earlier this week communities secretary Michael Gove said hosts would only have to undergo “very light touch” criminal records checks. But in fact the measurements will be tougher, it was later confirmed, with all hosts needing Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. “We support thorough checks because of the sheer volume of children involved who we will need to keep safe,” said Nandy. Local authorities will take on the role of vetting sponsors and inspecting accommodation. However, the Labour MP said: “I met with a group of councils just before Michael Gove came to make a statement about the scheme to the Commons on Monday and not a single one had been contacted. “Councils are desperate to help, but their concern is how to make this scheme work in practice. One council leader from a major city authority said they only have nine secondary-school places across the whole of the city. “This cohort of refugees is different to other groups we have supported in the past – there will be lots of children and elderly people, so we need to make sure there is adequate education and social care provision.” On Wednesday representatives from the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office met on a Zoom call with around 200 council leaders to discuss the Homes for Ukraine scheme. One source said: “The chat box was flooded with questions: when will we find out the numbers? How will they get to us? When will we get direction over what to do about schools? “Everyone wants to do the right thing but the worst thing is not to have any proper structures in place.” They added: “One key question that kept cropping up was why local government was not consulted before the announcement. This initiative was cooked up in Whitehall instead of inviting in council chief executives from across the country and asking them what would work.” Nandy said: “It really does beggar belief that nobody from the department picked up the phone to the councils that will be providing those services, especially at a time when they are really struggling to fulfil their basic statutory requirements.” Local councils have been briefed on estimates of how many refugees they may need to accommodate. One London local authority told the Observer they were expecting around 1,200 families. Councils will get £10,500 per refugee to help with education, social care and English language support. Speaking in the House of Commons last week, Gove said his office was working with the Local Government Association and had been in touch with individual council leaders to outline the level of support. He added: “Obviously we will keep things under review to ensure that local government has what it needs.” Refugees will receive a welcome pack on arrival and will have a contact at local authority level in the event a placement breaks down. The government says it is working at pace to implement phase two of the scheme so charities, faith groups and community organisations can boost numbers by directly sponsoring refugees. The Scottish government said it will initially accept 3,000 Ukrainian refugees with no family links to the UK and has set up a route that removes the need for applicants to be matched with a named individual before they are cleared through the visa system. Speaking earlier this week Gove said: “We want to minimise bureaucracy and make the process as straightforward as possible while doing everything we can to ensure the safety of all involved. Sponsors will therefore be required to undergo necessary vetting checks and we are also streamlining the process to security-assess the status of Ukrainians who will be arriving in the UK.” The sponsorship route comes on top of visas for Ukrainians with relatives already in the UK, with 8,600 visas granted under the family scheme so far.
