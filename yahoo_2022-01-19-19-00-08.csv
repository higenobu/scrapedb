1/19/2022,"By Sam Nussey TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Japan's Sony Group fell 9% on Wednesday after gaming rival Microsoft said it will buy developer Activision Blizzard in a record $68.7 billion deal for the industry. While Sony's PlayStation is widely seen as having a lead in the generational battle with Microsoft's Xbox, the purchase of the ""Call of Duty"" maker comes as Microsoft is aggressively expanding its Game Pass subscription service. Sony has strengthened its network of in-house games studios in recent year and delivered a string of exclusive hits including in its ""Spider-man"" franchise, with Microsoft left playing catch-up. ""Sony will have a monumental challenge on its hand to stand its own in this war of attrition,"" wrote Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors who recommends shorting the stock, in a note to clients. Sony is a pioneer in virtual reality and announced a few teasing details this month of its next generation headset, but deep pocketed and non-traditional players such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms are investing in the metaverse, or virtual online worlds. PlayStation is a major source of revenue for Activision, complicating any potential decision by Microsoft to remove titles from Sony systems and squeeze its rival. Many industry observers believe operability across multiple platforms is essential for the success of a metaverse where users can game, shop and work freely as advances in cloud technology weaken ties to the bulky gaming hardware that made Sony and Microsoft industry gatekeepers. ""If Microsoft continues to provide these games to (the PlaySation) platform as well, that would indicate that it may be positioning itself for metaverse in the long-term,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note.

1/19/2022,"The ""worst house on the best block"" in San Francisco sold last week for $1.97 million. The home built in 1900 on 320 Day St. has no bedrooms and just one bathroom. Because of its condition, the property will likely be overhauled. In a deal that one Instagram user called ""peak San Francisco,"" a 120-year-old home sold last week for just shy of $2 million. The property is notable not so much for what it has but for what it doesn't: a bedroom. According to its listing, the boarded-up ""contractors special"" at 320 Day St. has zero bedrooms, one bathroom, and a kitchen that appears to date to World War II. It is ""the worst house on the best block making it a fantastic opportunity,"" the Compass real-estate agents Todd and Kim Wiley wrote, adding that the ""extreme deferred state"" meant the buyer needed to make an all-cash offer. Todd Wiley told Insider the conservatorship sale, which is a process that involves the California probate court, helped push the price to more than double what they had proposed at the outset. ""We thought the property would sell at $1.6 million â€” we had data for that,"" Wiley said. ""But then the human spirit of competition took over."" In short, Wiley said the conservatorship-sale process subjected the property to a live-auction environment not once but twice, which led to the ""head-scratcher"" closing price of $1.97 million. The house is in the Noe Valley neighborhood, which is peppered with multimillion-dollar homes. Single-family homes there sell for a median price of about $2.7 million, according to Redfin. Nearby, renovated single-family homes with similar space often sell for more than $4 million and can fetch over $6 million, The Real Deal reported, but Wiley said the more appropriate comparisons were the updated homes that sell for $2.8 million and fixer-uppers going for $1.4 million to $1.6 million. The property's other key selling point is its lot size of 2,800 square feet, which is spacious in San Francisco terms. The lot is also zoned for up to two residences. It's the latest in a recent series of seven-figure sales of uninhabitable properties in the Bay Area, including a historic home and an old theater in San Jose and a four-bedroom home in Walnut Creek that was burned to the studs.
