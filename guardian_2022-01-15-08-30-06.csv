1/15/2022,"During Margaret Thatcher’s reign in the 1980s, British cinema was largely downbeat, caustic, political and oppositionist. But over the Channel in François Mitterrand’s France, the movies were glitzy and flashy, with a sexy if superficial neon sheen: the so-called cinéma du look. No director was more responsible for this than Jean-Jacques Beineix.  He became both famed and mocked for that colossal 1986 hit which launched the smouldering career of its star Beatrice Dalle: Betty Blue, a steamy drama in which an aspiring writer embarks on a passionate, destructive affair with Dalle’s impetuous siren, Betty. It was nominated for best foreign film at the Oscars, the Globes and the Baftas and got nine César nominations. But Betty Blue actually won just one César: the horribly appropriate award for best poster (an award discontinued a few years afterwards), the iconic image of the young Dalle looming beautifully up in the blue of deepening sunset-sky with the beach shack starkly picked out down below on a glowing horizon. It was a poster that adorned a million student bedroom walls and soon the movie, and Beineix himself, came to be looked down on as a callow 1980s taste: the legwarmers of French cinema. But that doesn’t do justice to his audacity, energy and exuberance, and to the movie that made his name in 1981: Diva, a film with a residual new wave ethos but with something less political. A young postman zooming around Paris on a moped (that key New Wave vehicle) is obsessed with an opera singer, played by Wilhelmina Wiggins Fernandez; he accidentally comes into possession of a cassette tape containing a confession which incriminates a top cop, which gets muddled up with his own illicit bootleg cassette of the diva singing the passionate soprano aria from Alfredo Catalani’s opera La Wally, Ebben? No andrò lontana, with its window-shattering high note. Beineix single-handedly made this stunningly dramatic aria famous among non-opera fans (to the irritation of hardcore opera buffs) like a smash hit single from an otherwise little-known album. Undoubtedly, Diva inspired the 1987 portmanteau film Aria, in which directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Altman, Derek Jarman, Julien Temple and Nicolas Roeg each created a short piece to the accompaniment of a famous aria. Aria was flash and brash, but some felt it to be a glorified arthouse version of the pop videos that were becoming popular through MTV in the same era. Beineix was not, however, involved. After Diva, Beineix made what both admirers and detractors felt was his key auteur piece, The Moon in the Gutter, starring Nastassja Kinski as a wealthy, predatory woman whose destiny collides with a smouldering dock-worker played by Gérard Depardieu. His fans stubbornly insisted this was Beineix’s brilliantly playful, colourful, visually creative French spin on the American noir genre. The naysayers said it was unendurably pretentious and preposterous; Beineix was deeply hurt to be booed at its Cannes premiere. But, last year at Cannes, I thought of The Moon in the Gutter as the festivalgoers were going wild for Leos Carax’s film Annette, his indulgent, madly ambitious musical fantasia composed by Sparks and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard. Who can possibly doubt that Carax was influenced by Beineix’s anti-puritan flourish? Both Carax and Luc Besson owed a huge amount to Beineix, although it was Beineix’s sad fate to have neither Besson’s enduring commercial clout nor Carax’s highbrow reputation.In the 90s, Beineix’s star waned, perhaps due to his characteristically heartfelt but inauspicious movie IP5: The Island of the Pachyderms, which was coolly received critically and in which his iconic star Yves Montand unfortunately died immediately after filming his character’s death.Beineix was often said to be style over substance. But is that fair? He had just about as much substance as any working director of his time, but a lot more style, and in fact a sensuous love of style. His Diva and Betty Blue deserve to be known as more than fashion accessories: they were vivid, vibrant movie-making. And amazing to think of Altman, Godard, Jarman et al effectively bowing the knee to Beineix in that Aria collection.",Arts/Film,Jean-Jacques Beineix: the French auteur who brought style and substance,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/14/jean-jacques-beineix-the-french-auteur-who-brought-style-and-substance
1/15/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has confirmed Loris Karius has no future at Liverpool and his former first-choice goalkeeper is free to leave the club. The 28-year-old has not featured for Liverpool since his infamous appearance in the 2018 Champions League final and subsequent loan spells at Besiktas and Union Berlin failed to result in a permanent transfer. His last competitive outing was for the German club 11 months ago.  Karius is out of contract at the end of this season and Klopp, who did not consider the former Mainz keeper for selection when Alisson, Caoimhin Kelleher and Adrián were unavailable through Covid or injury, is open to an early exit. The Liverpool manager said: “There are different things [to consider]. One is Loris Karius the player, who is doing absolutely nothing wrong and he is a really good shape. He is training really hard and he is fully committed. That is clear. Before the season we made a decision and obviously it was in the club’s interest as well that Loris finds a new club but that didn’t happen. We made a decision that he will be treated completely normally. “As long as we don’t have a massive situation here our No 1 is Ali, our No 2 is Caoimhin, No 3 is Adrián and No 4 is Marcelo [Pitaluga]. That is already four goalkeepers and we were never in a situation where we had to use a fifth one. It is nothing to do with the quality; we made the decision and the boys do really well. “I think everyone is impressed by the development of Caoimhin Kelleher, who is ready for pretty much everything. We all know about the quality of Adrián and the impact he has on training and in the dressing room and he would be always ready to go. Marcelo is an incredible talent, so the next one in line. I wish Loris only the best and he will find a club whether it is now or in the summer and from there he will go on, I’m very sure.” Harvey Elliott is set to return to first-team training next week as he steps up his recovery from a dislocated ankle. The 18-year-old midfielder sustained the injury at Leeds four months ago.",Sport/Football,Loris Karius told he has no future at Liverpool and is free to leave,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/loris-karius-told-he-has-no-future-at-liverpool-and-is-free-to-leave
1/15/2022,"Steven Gerrard has hailed Philippe Coutinho and Lucas Digne as “statement signings” who have the “steel and style” to help turn Aston Villa into a major Premier League force again quickly. “They are definitely a sign of optimism and ambition,” said Gerrard of this week’s arrivals. “We want to move now, we don’t want to wait.” The manager said the illustrious newcomers had the quality and knowhow to improve their teammates in much the same way as players such as Dietmar Hamann helped Gerrard to develop during his playing days at Liverpool.  “When I was younger I was lucky enough to play with Dietmar Hamann and Gary McAllister, players with real pedigree who had been there and done it before and they helped take my game to the next level,” he said. “Just being around them, watching them on a daily basis. We’ve got young defenders, midfielders and attacking players who will really look up to Lucas and Phil, really appreciate what they have done in their careers and strive to be similar to them. In the last couple of days you’ve seen an excitement in the dressing room that we’ve signed two players who are ready now, with real pedigree and that still have bundles left in our opinion.” Coutinho arrived on loan from Barcelona, where he had a seesaw period since joining from Liverpool in 2018. Gerrard scoffed at the notion that the 29-year-old Brazilian, with whom he played at Anfield, may be past his best. “We’ve signed a wonderful footballer,” said Gerrard. “It makes no sense for me to listen to keyboard warriors in Barcelona. I know the player, I know the boy and I’m confident we can get him moving. He’s a fantastic talent. He needs to smile and enjoy his football, feel the confidence, support and the love, and I’ve got no doubt that we’ll see the real Philippe Coutinho.” Helping Coutinho find fun again is the key to getting him to express his talent, said Gerrard. “I think Philippe would say that himself and that’s probably the reason why we’ve had the opportunity to bring him here. You can see clearly that he’s a player that needs to feel loved and supported, like the majority of footballers. I was the same.” Gerrard was equally enthusiastic about Digne, saying Villa pounced once they learned that the left-back had become unhappy at Everton. “He’s a top player with a top pedigree who knows how to win – he brings that experience. At the same time, he fits into the system and how we want to play, which is vital. His chance creation, his crossing quality, his athleticism and also he’s capable of being very astute defensively.” Gerrard suggested Villa may make further additions this month, identifying centre-back as one area he would like to strengthen after Axel Tuanzebe’s departure. Coutinho and Digne could make their debuts on Saturday when Villa host Manchester United, who knocked them out of the FA Cup on Monday, when Villa were aggrieved to have a goal disallowed. “I’m sure Villa Park will be bouncing,” said Gerrard. “I’m sure there will be a little more of an edge because of what happened on Monday night but also the arrival of two fantastic players. We can’t wait for it.”",Sport/Football,Steven Gerrard: arrivals of Coutinho and Digne show Aston Villa’s ambition,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/steven-gerrard-arrivals-of-coutinho-and-digne-show-aston-villas-ambition
1/15/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has admitted Marcus Rashford’s emotional involvement dropped after the opening 30 minutes of Manchester United’s FA Cup win over Aston Villa but the interim manager believes the forward and the rest of his squad do have the correct attitude. Rashford appeared out of form and lacking mental sharpness during Monday’s 1-0 win. Later in the week Cristiano Ronaldo discussed how younger players cannot be forced to listen to advice from senior ones such as himself and talked about the mentality required to be an elite footballer. The Portuguese stated he was talking generally and did not name any teammates but Rangnick was asked to assess the squad’s mentality.  “We need to discuss what mentality means,” he said. “If one of our players in the game doesn’t give his very best and put all the effort into it then I will address that; you can be assured of that. So far I haven’t seen that but with some players they start well [in games] – if we speak about Marcus Rashford, for example, in the first minutes against Villa he was good, he was on fire, he was emotionally involved. But then after 30 minutes he got worse and didn’t play on the same kind of energetic level as the first half an hour. “We need to speak about that. I do that regularly [wondering] does he need a helping hand? What does that take? So I don’t see any of the players who don’t care about the club or who don’t want to perform to the highest possible level. As long as he [Rashford] is trying to give his very best. There were quite a few training sessions in the last couple of weeks where he trained on a really high level and that’s why I always gave him the chance to play.” Rangnick is happy for Ronaldo and other senior professionals to guide the junior ones. “We have to work and develop as a team together and if it’s necessary to speak in a very direct manner to the boys, it helps a lot, even in the locker room. If Cristiano, for example, or any of the other players address on the pitch or in the dressing room they are more than welcome to do that. It’s not only Cristiano, we have Edinson [Cavani], we have Harry [Maguire], David de Gea, Victor Lindelöf, Bruno [Fernandes]. “In a united team that happens automatically and I can only invite and challenge and tell all the players – also the older players – to do that on a regular basis.” Rangnick said he would like Donny van de Beek to stay but acknowledged the midfielder wanted more game time with the World Cup in mind and did not rule out a loan. “Louis van Gaal [the Netherlands manager] obviously told him that in order to be a regular starter in the World Cup he needs to regularly play for his team,” Rangnick said. “Again, I can understand his wish and desire to play. On the other hand, we have a lot of competition in our squad exactly in those positions.”",Sport/Football,"Rashford’s emotional involvement dropped in Villa win, says Ralf Rangnick",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/rashfords-emotional-involvement-dropped-in-villa-win-says-ralf-rangnick
