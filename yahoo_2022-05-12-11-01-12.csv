5/12/2022,"The S&P 500 is down 10% over the past month alone. According to CNBC’s Jim Cramer, the recent plunge in stocks reflects a lack of investor confidence in the Federal Reserve. He says these investors believe that the Fed has lost control or is helpless to fix things given the state of the global supply chain. But Cramer remains bullish — particularly on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. “I think the consumer is strong. Jobs are plentiful,” he says. “Leaving the market is a mistake because Powell happens to be an incredibly thoughtful, good public servant who’s doing amazing.” For bullish investors who share that sentiment, here are a few Cramer’s top recommendations. Chip giant AMD is starting to look like the baby that gets tossed out with the bathwater. The shares are down more than 40% in 2022 despite boasting a thriving underlying business. In Q1, AMD’s revenue was up 71% year over year to $5.9 billion. Some of that topline growth was driven by the acquisition of semiconductor company Xilinx. Eliminating the impact of that purchase still gives us top-line growth of 55%. That’s excellent for a stock that’s currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio in the high-teens. Nvidia is another chipmaker in Cramer’s “good basket.” While the stock has also plunged by more than 40% year to date, Nvidia’s outlook remains relatively bright. Nvidia is scheduled to report Q1 earnings later this month. Given the recent rout in the digital assets market, the report will likely reflect a plunge in crypto mining demand. But analysts still expect $8.09 billion in revenue and $1.29 in earnings per share. Nvidia could be an ideal target for investors looking for growth at reasonable prices. Picking the right stocks in a choppy market is difficult — particularly in the volatile tech sector. Instead of stock picking, investors can make a broad bet on the entire beaten-down space. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), for instance, offers exposure to the leading names in technology. The fund’s biggest holdings include Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE). VGT is down 23% in 2022. Cramer believes a rising interest rate environment is good for big banks. “They’re gonna make a lot more money off you,” he says. When rates increase, the spread between what banks charge in interest (to borrowers) and what they pay out (to savers) widens. Blue-chip bank stocks are a great option. But investors can also bet on the entire sector through an ETF. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) tracks the total return performance of the S&P Banks Select Industry Index — an index with an average price-to-book of 1.1. The ETF’s top holdings include banks like First Bancorp (FNLC), Northern Trust (NTRS) and M&T Bank (MTB). Investors worried about rising rates and inflated valuations in the tech sector might want to put KBE on their watch list.

5/12/2022,"Last week, a group of Apple employees wrote an open letter criticizing the company's hybrid work-from-home policy, which requires employees to be at the office three days a week starting May 23rd. Now, Apple has lost director of machine learning Ian Goodfellow over the policy, according to a tweet from The Verge's Zoë Schiffer. Goodfellow may have been the company's most cited machine learning expert, according to Schiffer. ""I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team,"" he wrote in a note to staff. A group of Apple staffers called ""Apple Together"" opposed to the RTO (return-to-office) strategy cited multiple arguments against it. They noted that in-person collaboration isn't needed that often, thanks to apps like Slack. They also countered Apple's argument that in-person work allows for ""serendipity"" when people bump into each other, saying that Apple's siloed office structure makes that difficult. It also noted that a daily commute ""is a huge waste of time as well as both mental and physical resources,"" and that the policy will lead to a ""younger, whiter, more male-dominated, more neuro-normative, more able-bodied"" workforce. Mainly though, the group cited Apple's hypocrisy in the way it markets its products. ""We tell all of our customers how great our products are for remote work, yet, we ourselves, cannot use them to work remotely? How can we expect our customers to take that seriously? How can we understand what problems of remote work need solving in our products if we don't live it?"" the letter states. Apple, which brought in a Q3 record $97.3 billion last quarter, has been facing employee discontent of late. On top of issues around RTO, it's facing an NLRB complaint over hostile working conditions, and Apple Store employees are quietly attempting to unionize.",Business/Engadget•2 days ago,Apple loses director of machine learning over its office return policy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/an-apple-machine-learning-director-resigned-over-its-office-return-policy-115040691.html
