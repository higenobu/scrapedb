12/29/2021,"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool have given Manchester City the chance to run away with the title as he rued a “really bad” performance in their 1-0 defeat at Leicester. The substitute Ademola Lookman sealed victory as a depleted Leicester side, missing six injured defenders, became the first team in 35 games to keep a clean sheet against Liverpool, leaving Klopp struggling to explain what went wrong.  Liverpool could be 12 points behind Pep Guardiola’s side when they kick off on Sunday and, as Klopp noted, either they or Chelsea will then drop points in their meeting at Stamford Bridge. “It’s a big gap,” Klopp said. “To top that, Chelsea and us play against each other. It was not our plan to give City the chance to run away. If we play like tonight we do not think about catching up with City, but if we play our football we can see what that means. I don’t have a proper explanation for tonight. To find it is my main concern, not City.” Klopp admitted Leicester merited their win, adding: “We played a really bad game, so it was well deserved. It was a very strange game. We were just not good enough. Tonight I didn’t like a lot in our game so we have to do better. We should have defended better. We do that usually, so why we didn’t do it today is hard to explain. There were so many performances below normal level, there’s no explanation.” Klopp defended Mohamed Salah, who missed a penalty for just the second time in the Premier League when Kasper Schmeichel saved his first-half spot-kick, saying: “Not a little bit of blame for Mo. He scores usually from these situations. Mo is part of the team and the team is usually better in a game. Tonight we weren’t and we lost.” Defender Virgil van Dijk was critical of Liverpool’s attacking efforts. “I think we were poor in the last third,” he said. “We should look at our performance and improve. We all wanted to do better. That’s a fact. We weren’t good enough and they deserved the win.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp rues ‘very bad’ display as Liverpool lose ground in title race,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/jurgen-klopp-rues-very-bad-display-as-liverpool-lose-ground-in-title-race
12/29/2021,"Mark Zuckerberg has added 110 acres to his controversial 1,500-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, dropping $17m for the purchase. The 110 acres of land that the Facebook founder and his wife recently bought includes the Ka Loko reservoir, a century-old reservoir whose dam broke in 2006 and released 400m gallons of water that killed seven people on Kauai’s north shore.  According to the couple’s spokesperson Ben Labolt, the reservoir is considered high-risk and has not been repaired. The Zuckerbergs are committed to fulfilling the legal requirements surrounding the reservoir, Labolt told Business Insider. “Mark and Priscilla continue to make their home at Ko’olau Ranch,” Labolt said. He added that they had “worked closely with a number of community partners to operate a working ranch, promote conservation, produce sustainable agriculture and protect wildlife and look forward to expanding their efforts to include this additional property”. Zuckerberg’s recent purchase comes after two previous acquisitions - a $100m 750-acre purchase made in late 2014 and a $53m 600-acre purchase made in March that includes a public beach and working cattle ranch. Zuckerberg’s massive estate has met with criticism and controversy in the past. In 2016, Zuckerberg angered neighbors when he constructed a 6ft stone wall around his property that blocked easy access to Pila’a Beach, in an attempt to decrease highway and road noise. Then in early 2017, Zuckerberg’s lawyers filed lawsuits against hundreds of local Hawaiians who may own an interest in small pockets within his estate’s boundaries. The “quiet title” suits are used to clarify the often complicated history of land ownership in the state and can often force owners to auction off their lands. In certain cases, defendants are even required to pay the legal fees of the plaintiff – in this case, the world’s fifth richest man. “This is the face of neocolonialism,” said Kapua Sproat, a law professor at the University of Hawaii to the Guardian in 2017. “Even though a forced sale may not physically displace people, it’s the last nail in the coffin of separating us from the land.” “For us, as native Hawaiians, the land is an ancestor. It’s a grandparent … You just don’t sell your grandmother,” Sproat added. Zuckerberg eventually dropped the suit, saying that he and his wife wanted to “make this right, talk with the community, and find a better approach”. The pockets of land were eventually sold at an auction. Along with his Hawaii estate, Zuckerberg owns a total of roughly 1,400 acres and 10 houses in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, amounting to a $320m real estate portfolio.",News/Technology,"Mark Zuckerberg adds 110 acres to controversial 1,500-acre Hawaii estate ",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/28/mark-zuckerberg-110-acres-hawaii
12/29/2021,"Pep Guardiola has said the resurgent Kevin De Bruyne is “unique in the world” and admitted the league champions have had to survive during his absences this season. The Belgian sparkled in Sunday’s 6-3 hammering of Leicester at the Etihad Stadium, scoring an impressive opening goal. De Bruyne’s campaign has been stop-start because of the ankle injury he suffered at Euro 2020, which hampered his pre-season, and contracting Covid in November.  Sunday’s victory was City’s ninth in a row in the Premier League with De Bruyne starting only four of them. Guardiola, whose champions go into the game against Brentford on Wednesday as the league leaders, believes the 30-year-old is nearing his best. “He’s getting better. I don’t think [he has far to go],” said the Manchester City manager. “He played exceptionally well [against Leicester]. We’ve had six years together with Kevin. What we’ve done when he was fit … he has something unique in the world. We know it. Kevin is an exceptional player. “He struggled at the beginning of the season and is now much, much better. The Leeds game [when De Bruyne scored twice in a 7-0 win] was really good and against Leicester he was really good all game. He is a fighter and a guy who creates goals and assists. He has been injured in some seasons for a long time and we survived.” Guardiola often complains about the congested schedule but as City have been eliminated from the Carabao Cup, after winning the trophy the last four years, there is a chance for respite in January with only one match a week. “After the Arsenal game we have long weeks,” he said. “Right now we have games on the 29th [Brentford] and 1st [Arsenal] – two away fixtures against absolutely tough opponents. The Premier League is like this. That is why it is the most satisfying competition if you are able to win it. You play against all the big teams in different circumstances and you have to solve it. It will be no exception in the next two games.” Due to the busy festive itinerary Guardiola is not yet sure what changes he can make for Brentford. “I don’t know,” he said. “With this situation, you [can] arrive and go, ‘Oh, this player cannot play’ or someone is injured. The day before the game we’ll travel to London and on the day we are going to see. We’ll pay attention to the quality Brentford have and take a decision.” Guardiola will soon lose Riyad Mahrez as the Algeria captain will join his nation ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, which starts on 9 January. “It’s early January when he has to travel there,” said the manager, who confirmed that Kyle Walker and John Stones missed the Leicester victory because of injury.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola says ‘unique’ Kevin De Bruyne is nearing his absolute best,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/pep-guardiola-says-unique-kevin-de-bruyne-is-nearing-his-absolute-best
