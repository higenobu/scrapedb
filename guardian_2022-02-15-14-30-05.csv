2/15/2022,"Up ahead, beneath dried splinters of cut kale, the ground appears to shift. A ripple of small birds is working its way through the stubble in the morning sun, foraging on fallen seed. Occasionally they raise their heads, striped like humbugs, the colour of caramel or butterscotch, and I count quickly, scarcely able to believe my luck. I have come to this sloping stretch of farmland on the south Devon coast in the hope of spotting just one of these rare sparrow-sized birds. Instead, I have stumbled across a chattering flock numbering upwards of a dozen.  They are cirl buntings – pronounced “sirl” – and these close relatives of the yellowhammer have every reason to sound chirpy. Once spread across 39 counties, cirl buntings drained from the countryside during the 20th century as agricultural practices intensified, leaving just over a hundred pairs in the west country. A desperate bid to save the species from extinction in the UK was launched in the 1990s by the RSPB, working with local farmers to ensure hedge-lined fields and coastal scrub were providing sufficient food and nesting sites. Thanks to the concerted conservation work, these yellow and brown buntings now number more than a thousand pairs, strung out along the southern edge of Devon and Cornwall. While still far from common, the cirl bunting embodies something every bit as rare these days: a wildlife good news story. And watching the feeding flock, I feel fortunate to witness such a precious sight first-hand. Eventually they fly to a nearby blackthorn bush overlooking the sea, perching in the sunshine, seemingly enjoying the mild weather and companionship of their kind. Among them, there is a handsome male in brighter breeding plumage, sporting stencil-sharp black-and-lemon head stripes. The cirl bunting may sound like an obscurity for the ornithological connoisseur, with its peculiar name of Italian origin and restricted range, but this is now a species anyone can encounter on a stroll along the South West Coast Path, well accustomed to passing hikers and dog walkers. Every one of these little beacons of hope, lighting up the hedgerows, is a cause for optimism. Roll out the bunting and celebrate this conservation success.

2/15/2022,"Boris Johnson and Joe Biden believe there remains “a crucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine” after a 40-minute call between the two leaders on Monday night. Britain said the pair emphasised the importance of unity and, while neither the UK nor the US will send troops to defend Ukraine, they insisted that any further Russian incursion “would result in a protracted crisis for Russia with far-reaching damage for both Russia and the world”.  The sense of an opportunity for diplomacy was echoed by Vladimir Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who told the Russian president that talks “certainly should not continue indefinitely. But at this stage I would suggest that they continue and be intensified.” German chancellor Olaf Scholz was due to land in Moscow on Tuesday in search of a diplomatic solution to avoid a war in Ukraine as the west and Russia signalled tentative hopes of an easing in the tense standoff. His talks with Vladimir Putin are the latest in an intense diplomatic scramble to dissuade the Russian leader from attacking Ukraine. Russia has massed an estimated 145,000 troops along various stretches of its border with Ukraine, in Belarus where joint military drills are taking place, and in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014. On Monday night, the US offered Ukraine a sovereign loan guarantee of up to $1bn to help its economy navigate the tensions. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said: “This offer … will bolster Ukraine’s ability to ensure economic stability, growth, and prosperity for its people in the face of Russia’s destabilising behaviour.” The state department also advised US citizens to immediately leave Belarus and the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, “citing the unusual and concerning Russian military activity” along their borders with Ukraine. Russian forces continue to mass near the border. British officials estimate that a further 14 Russian battalions are heading towards Ukraine, each numbering about 800 troops, on top of the 100 battalions deployed near the borders – a force already believed capable of launching an invasion. UK ministers believe the Russian president has not yet decided to attack and may never do so but the continued buildup prompted Johnson to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday. Earlier, the British prime minister said: “This is a very, very dangerous, difficult situation. We are on the edge of a precipice, but there is still time for President Putin to step back.” He said it was important for western allies to remain united in the face of Russian pressure. Ukraine’s future membership of Nato could not be “bargained away” as part of western leaders’ efforts, he added. The office of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Monday released a decree calling for all villages and towns in Ukraine to fly the national flag on Wednesday, amid speculation it is the day Russia might invade. It also called for the entire nation to sing the national anthem at 10am, and for an increase in the salaries of soldiers and border guards. “They tell us February 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it a day of unity,” Zelenskiy said in a video address to the nation. “They are trying to frighten us by yet again naming a date for the start of military action … On that day, we will hang our national flags, wear yellow and blue banners, and show the whole world our unity.” Zelenskiy has long said that, while he believes Russia is threatening to attack his country, the likelihood of an imminent invasion has been overstated by western allies, responding to Moscow’s efforts to intimidate Ukraine and sow panic.

2/15/2022,"LaQuan Smith’s autumn/winter 2022 show at New York fashion week on Monday evening started over an hour late. It soon became clear why – a celebrity was involved. Julia Fox, the model and actor who has had the lens of the paparazzi trained on her for months thanks to her recent relationship with Kanye West, opened the show and caused a hush across the audience.  Her arrival was preceded by something a little more somber - a moment of silence for Smith’s mentor, former Vogue editor André Leon Talley, who died in January. ‘This one’s for you, Andre’ said a voice over the sound system before the show began. Talley, who loved glamour, would have been proud. The collection was ripe with the dressed up style that Smith has made his trademark. There were red sequined dresses, faux fur corsets, gold leggings, cut-out frocks, Lurex and very short miniskirts. Every model wore sky high heels. Fox’s appearance could be seen as a flex from Smith regarding his increasingly powerful position within the celebrity landscape. The designer has also dressed Rihanna, Beyoncé and Irina Shayk. Hailey Bieber wore his dress last summer when she met French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris. As well as glamour, Smith is gaining a reputation for taking on American landmarks. After his show in September at the top of the Empire State Building, this show was in a private club right at the heart of Wall Street. It could all be seen as a statement of intent - he plans to go to the very top of American fashion. It’s fair to say the audience here weren’t the usual people found in grand rooms with wooden-panelled walls. Club kids with pink hair, extra wide shoulders, PVC and tutus mixed with fashion types in catsuits, faux fur and leather. There wasn’t a pinstripe suit in sight. Smith - like many of the Black designers now on the calendar at New York fashion week - has had a circuitous route to the top of fashion, and his celebrity connections have been central to his rise. Rejected by prestigious schools Parsons and FIT, he first produced textured leggings, which were worn by Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian, and founded his brand proper in 2010, aged 21. Glamour has always been his stock in trade - an aesthetic also bought by non-celebrities thanks to collaborations with Asos and Revolve. “I’m here to bring sexy back!” he said to Vogue Business in September. “Where are the women who want to get dressed up and look fabulous? That is the kind of people I need to market myself to.” This glamour unexpectedly saw him through an era of lockdowns. While sweatpants were the norm for many, Smith’s collections of cocktail dresses, sequin leggings and satin blouses had a sales surge of 87% from early 2020 to September 2021 He was mentored by powerful industry figures including fellow designer Tom Ford and Talley. Talley was instrumental in Smith’s career - as the first person to write about his work - hence the designer dedicating the show to him. “There was no limit to the amount of support or guidance he gave,” Smith said to the New York Times. “When I was designing out of my grandmother’s home with no team or money, cutting patterns out of newspapers, André gave me the money I needed to travel to Paris for the first time.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Julia Fox steals the show as LaQuan Smith sticks to glamour at New York Fashion Week,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/15/julia-fox-steals-the-show-as-laquan-smith-sticks-to-glamour-at-new-york-fashion-week
2/15/2022,"New Yorkers who live in areas where controversial stop-and-frisk searches happen most frequently are also more likely to be surveilled by facial recognition technology, according to research by Amnesty International and other researchers. Research also showed that in the Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens boroughs of the city there was a direct correlation between the proportion of non-white residents and the concentration of controversial facial recognition technology.  “Our analysis shows that the NYPD’s use of facial recognition technology helps to reinforce discriminatory policing against minority communities in New York City,” said Matt Mahmoudi, artificial intelligence and human rights researcher at Amnesty International. The research is a part of the global anti-facial recognition technology campaign, Ban the Scan, investigating increasing use of surveillance initiatives in the New York police department (NYPD). Using thousands of digital volunteers through the Decode NYC Surveillance project, more than 25,500 CCTV cameras were mapped across New York City. Data scientists and researchers from Amnesty International compared the data on the camera placement with statistics on police stop-and-frisk. “We have long known that stop-and-frisk in New York is a racist policing tactic. We now know that the communities most targeted with stop-and-frisk are also at greater risk of discriminatory policing through invasive surveillance,” said Mahmoudi. While the NYPD has been using facial recognition technology for more than a decade, its use has not been without controversy. According to Politico, the NYPD has faced at least six lawsuits over its facial recognition technology use. Additionally, in June 2020, the New York city council mandated that the NYPD publicly disclose information on its surveillance efforts. Despite local and national pushback to facial recognition technology, its use has been fully supported by New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, as a tool to investigate crimes. “If you’re on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter – no matter what, they can see and identify who you are without violating the rights of people,” said Adams in January while discussing a new plan to solve gun violence in New York City. “It’s going to be used for investigatory purposes.” Previously, the use of facial recognition technology has led to false arrests, all of Black men. In 2019, Michael Oliver, a 25-year-old Black man from Detroit, was wrongly identified by facial recognition technology and arrested for grabbing a teacher’s cellphone and damaging it as the teacher was recording a fight among students. Oliver was also wrongly identified by the teacher in a photo lineup. In 2020, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was falsely arrested by Detroit police after facial recognition technology incorrectly identified him as a shoplifting suspect. In the same year, Nijeer Parks, 33, spent 10 days in jail and $5,000 to defend himself after being falsely accused of stealing candy and trying to hit a police officer with a car in Woodbridge, New Jersey. Parks, who was wrongly identified by facial recognition technology, was 30 miles away when the incident took place. He is now suing the police department, the city of Woodbridge and the prosecutor on his case, according to the New York Times.",News/US news,New Yorkers in high stop-and-frisk areas subject to more facial recognition tech,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/new-york-facial-recognition-stop-and-frisk-nypd
2/15/2022,"Liberal democracies can regain their lost sense of shared moral purpose by agreeing to set a long-term internationally agreed target for the number of refugees they are each prepared to take each year, Rory Stewart, a former Conservative cabinet minister, has proposed. Unveiling his plan to the Guardian, Stewart said: “Reforming the international resettlement coalition around the Afghan crisis presents a rare opportunity for key liberal democracies to restore their moral authority, form a workable international coalition, and deliver rapid, concrete, ethical results.”  Stewart has already garnered preliminary support for his plan from a group of Afghan specialists, including three former US envoys to Afghanistan, as well as parliamentarians from the UK, Germany and Canada. He proposes each country joining the coalition should aspire within two years to take refugees equivalent to 0.05 % of their population annually. The voluntary target would be similar to the aspiration for advanced economies to spend 0.7% of their GDP on overseas aid. Stewart said the plan could be adopted at a global pledging summit possibly convened by Germany as the chair of the G7 group of industrialised nations. However, it is unclear whether the UK government would consider the plan. Last year, the government cut its aid pledge to 0.5% of GDP, ending the Tory commitment to spend 0.7%, claiming it was “difficult to justify to the British people”. Under the Stewart plan, the UK would take a minimum of 32,000 refugees annually, several times the number it accepted last year. The plan has won the support of Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, Tobias Ellwood the chair of the UK defence select committee, Michael Roth, the chair of the German Bundestag’s foreign affairs select committee, and Ret. Gen David Petraeus. The co-sponsors, in a joint forward for an Atlantic Council paper written by Stewart, argue the humanitarian system has “atrophied” since the refugee crises of the 2010s and has not been able to respond to a sense of duty the west feels towards Afghans trapped under Taliban rule. Stewart said: “We currently find ourselves in the very odd position that an important part of what it means to be a thoughtful modern international player – a willingness to take people at real risk of persecution – has been severely eroded.” He added: “[The] shared tradition of such democracies, acting in concert, is now being questioned and challenged by authoritarianism abroad and populism and isolation at home. “This is the moment to answer some of those challenges. A practical international response to the Afghan refugee crisis through a credible resettlement system would revive the values that formed the multilateral system in the wake of the horrors of second world war. We have a very special obligation towards Afghanistan after 20 years. We can see we played a direct part in tipping the Afghans into this horror.” Stewart says the 0.05 % commitment would be a modest and realistic move towards transparent burden-sharing. He estimates if a coalition of Germany, France,Benelux and Nordic countries, as well as the UK agreed voluntarily to sign up the proposal, then 120,000 refugees would be guaranteed a home a year. By adopting the target, the US would be committing itself to taking 160,000 a year – slightly more than the number of refugees Joe Biden proposes to take this year. Stewart says the target is the equivalent of a town of 10,000 people hosting a single Afghan family of five. For Canada, the target would be slightly lower than 52,290 refugees it is seeking to take in 2022. For the scheme to work Stewart, a former UK international development secretary, said there would have to be some processing of asylum applicants inside Afghanistan since so many of the countries surrounding Afghanistan were refusing to let more refugees cross their borders. At least three major categories of resettlement priority would be targeted within these overall numbers. The three categories would be those who have been evacuated but lack permanent settlement in a new country; those who remain in their country having already been promised a right to resettle; and those at risk of persecution. He saysas many as 200,0000 Afghans are still trapped there who are already eligible for resettlement under existing international scheme but could not cross into the countries on Afghanistan’s borders. In addition there are tens of thousands not designated for existing schemes that are under extreme threat, such as female judges. Even though many embassies remain closed, Stewart said, “a window is open to process in Afghanistan and evacuate with the consent of the Taliban, which may not remain for long. It should be used”. But Stewart said Taliban cooperation to allow its political opponents to leave would be contingent on the west’s behaviour. He criticised Biden’s decision last week to seize the Afghan Central Bank’s $7bn (£5.2bn) assets frozen in the US and hand half to the victims of 9/11. “For Biden to help himself to half that money is compounding betrayal upon betrayal. The first betrayal was to abandon the country to the Taliban. The second is to leave millions on the edge of starvation. Now the US president is proposing to steal Afghanistan’s own money which could have been used to feed the starving.” Overall global resettlement spaces have fallen by 50% between 2016 and 2019. According to the UN agency for refugees, UNHCR, out of 1.44 million refugees in urgent need of resettlement globally, only 22,770 were resettled through the agency.",News/World news,Long-term refugee targets ‘would help west regain moral purpose’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/long-term-refugee-targets-would-help-west-regain-moral-purpose
2/15/2022,"“There’s only one thing a romance book absolutely must have, with no exceptions,” my boss explained to me seriously, spreading out a bunch of the types of titles we published and sold – regency romances with dashing princes on the cover, paranormal erotica with sultry vampires and butch werewolves, and our speciality: rockstar romances with shirtless tattooed men clad in leather. “Fucking,” I answered. “Or, you know, at least general horniness. Foreplay?”  “No,” he said, shaking his head firmly. “That’s sort of a myth. Mostly. It doesn’t hurt, I guess.” The main rule, I was told, is that a romance book HAS to have a happily ever after. If you’re not across this trope, it’s exactly what it sounds like: the end of the book has to feature the protagonists falling in love – and not just falling in love, but at least the implied idea that they are in love for ever. There’s definitely nuance the deeper you get into it the trope – the debate about the existence and importance of “soul mates” for example being a good one. Erotica doesn’t tend to follow the “happily ever after” rule, replacing it with the innuendo laden “happy for now” instead. But as a rule, Happily Ever After is prescriptive and absolute – when you pick up a romance book, you KNOW that the couple will end up happy, and blissfully in love. It’s a guarantee. Even after my four years doing marketing and publicity for a romance book imprint of a major publishing house, I can’t pretend to have more than a passing familiarity with the fascinating and gorgeous and sometimes remarkably silly world of romance publishing, and the massive community of authors and readers. The romance community is fascinating – often ignored, mocked, and maligned by the male-dominated literary establishment, it became a bubble, where mostly women write for other women. But it’s a huge and extremely successful bubble. It just doesn’t really need anyone else. The experiences I did have, and the lessons I managed to pick up, only made me fall more in love with it all. Maybe not a grand, happily ever after romance (I no longer work in that field), but definitely a gorgeous flirtation. The montage of my relationship with romance and erotica publishing includes the campaign where I got to hang out with hot shirtless models who gave out free copies of one of our titles to people around the city, the hilariously boozy conferences and award nights, and watching with pride as one of our bestselling erotica authors (a middle-aged mum from Queensland) explained on stage to a panel of famous international authors, in clinical and eye-opening detail, the difference between double and dual penetration – and how one was erotica, and the other simply porn. Do NOT Google this on a work computer. It was an incredibly fun and often strange job, but it was also weirdly juxtaposed with my own life. Every day I went out and sold novels about true love and heart-fluttering romance and also centaur-on-centaur sex (don’t ask), while also indulging in the most cynical and heartbroken period of my life, tracking the dissolution and breakup of an 11-year relationship. I didn’t just think a happily ever after was far-fetched – at that point it would have been hard to convince me of a happily ever occurring again. Being dunked head-first into the saccharine sugary neon pink confection of romance books every day while also genuinely believing that love was a myth, that heartbreak was the only constant in a cruel and unforgiving world, was sometimes hard, sometimes hilarious. Once during a publishing meeting (in which I had the pleasure of telling a bunch of upper management types what “pegging” was) I remember cynically describing romance books as “just fantasy, but without dragons”. Genre fiction of all types are often both beloved and criticised for being “escapism”, a way to escape the harsh realities and disappointments of our own lives, through outlandish ideas like wizards and space ships and people falling in love for ever. I remember reading a male/male military soldier erotica book that we published (incidentally, most of our male on male books were written by straight women for some bizarre reason), where lube was not only never used, it simply didn’t seem to be needed in this world. See – it was all a ridiculous fantasy. Give people their little holiday away from the truth, away from loneliness and pain, I thought. It’s easy when you’re heartbroken to feel disillusioned about the industry of romance – the way it’s been turned into a money-making scheme, into a worldwide obsession, an aspiration. Things like Valentine’s Day, billion-dollar weddings, dating reality shows – and romance books – all seem part of a hysteria, a year-round marketing ploy to make love financial, lucrative. When you’re learning about the rules and tropes of a romance book, you realise it’s nothing more than a formula, a recipe for fictional happiness. It seems ludicrous at best, cheap at worst. If it actually worked, surely all these romance authors would be the happiest people in the world, who wouldn’t have time to write books about love, because they’d be too swept up in their own grand romance. I guess the moral is don’t read romance books when you’re heartbroken. I’d recommend true crime, the genre that reminds the heartbroken that things could be much worse. My own heartbreak came from a realisation that the romance I was in didn’t have a happy ever after, despite the fact that I really wanted it to and thought it would. I thought that I was following a set of rules that would ultimately lead to happiness. I think, add or subtract some plot specifics, that’s what a lot of breakups come down to. It’s also why I think we love romance books . We love them purely because real life romance doesn’t have one rule, and it doesn’t have a formula, a recipe. It’s more mysterious, more exciting, more strange than that. It’s also scarier – because at any point you could be let down again. But it’s why we’re so obsessed with love, and why we reflect it in all our art and literature. It’s why, as a treat, we sand the hard edges off in romance books, and enjoy a depiction of a love that will never let you down. All the benefits of being in love (feeling great, being obsessed with someone, having someone to help you do the Wordle) but none of the terrifying lack of certainty. When I think about it, I realise the only real fantasy that romance books peddle (apart from the whole lube thing) is the idea of a guaranteed happily ever after, the certainty, the fact that when we start dating someone they are the one for ever. That certainty would be so nice, so easy. What romance books tap into is the intoxicating hope, the belief that when we open up a new chapter – as I eventually did, years after my time in the industry – that this time we’ll find happiness. They reiterate, which I truly believe, that even though it’s a risk, if you find the right person, it’s worth it.",Opinion/Opinion,Selling romance and erotica books during my breakup taught me about heartbreak | Patrick Lenton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/15/selling-romance-and-erotica-during-my-breakup-taught-me-about-heartbreak
