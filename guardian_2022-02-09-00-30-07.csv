2/9/2022,"Pfizer made nearly $37bn (£27bn) in sales from its Covid-19 vaccine last year – making it one of the most lucrative products in history – and has forecast another bumper year in 2022, with a big boost coming from its Covid-19 pill Paxlovid. The US drugmaker’s overall revenues in 2021 doubled to $81.3bn, and it expects to make record revenues of $98bn to $102bn this year.  Albert Bourla, the chairman and chief executive, said that at the start of the pandemic it had “committed to use all of the resources and expertise we had at our disposal to help protect populations globally against this deadly virus”. “Now, less than two years since we made that commitment, we are proud to say that we have delivered both the first FDA-authorised vaccine against Covid-19 (with our partner, BioNTech) and the first FDA-authorised oral treatment for Covid-19,” he said. “These successes have not only made a positive difference in the world, but I believe they have fundamentally changed Pfizer and its culture forever.” However, the bumper sales prompted accusations of “pandemic profiteering” from campaigners. The campaign group Global Justice Now said the annual revenue of $81bn was more than the GDP of most countries and accused Pfizer of “ripping off public health systems”. The Covid jab, Comirnaty, which the New-York based pharma firm developed with the much smaller German company BioNTech, brought in $12.5bn in revenues in the final quarter of 2021, taking the total for the year to $36.8bn. Pfizer said it had exceeded its target of manufacturing 3bn doses of the vaccine last year. The drugmaker made a net profit of nearly $22bn last year, up from $9.1bn in 2020. It increased its 2022 estimate for Comirnaty sales to $32bn and expects Paxlovid to contribute $22bn in revenues. The pill, which boasts nearly 90% success in preventing severe illness among vulnerable adults if taken soon after becoming infected with Covid-19, was approved for emergency use by the US regulator in late December. A few days later, Paxlovid received the green light in the UK, where the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency described it as a “life-saving” treatment. It has now received emergency approval in 40 countries. While the Covid vaccine, together with that produced by US rival Moderna and the much cheaper jab made by Britain’s AstraZeneca, has saved millions of lives worldwide, Pfizer has been accused of profiteering.Global Justice Now pointed out that Pfizer’s Covid-19 jab was invented by BioNTech, supported by €100m (£84m) in debt financing from the publicly owned European Investment Bank and a €375m grant from the German government. Tim Bierley, a pharma campaigner at the group, said: “The development of mRNA vaccines should have revolutionised the global Covid response. But we’ve let Pfizer withhold this essential medical innovation from much of the world, all while ripping off public health systems with an eye-watering mark-up.” Pharmaceutical companies have been accused of not sharing the recipe for their vaccines, which would enable drugmakers in poorer countries to produce cheaper versions of them. Moderna has said that it would not enforce patent protection on its Covid vaccine and last week, scientists in South Africa said they had developed a copy of the jab. They hope it will boost vaccination rates across the continent, which are among the lowest in the world. Bierley said: “It’s nothing short of pandemic profiteering for Pfizer to make a killing while its vaccines have been withheld from so many. Pfizer is now richer than most countries; it has made more than enough money from this crisis. It’s time to suspend intellectual property and break vaccine monopolies.” Pfizer has charged the UK’s NHS an estimated £2.8bn above production cost for the 189m doses of Covid-19 vaccines the UK government has bought, Global Justice has calculated. According to Reuters, Pfizer has sold the vaccine to African countries at $3 to $10 a shot. It has indicated that a non-profit dose costs just $6.75, or £4.98, to produce, but it has reportedly charged the NHS £18 a dose for the first 100m jabs bought and £22 a dose for the next 89m, totalling £3.76bn, Global Justice Now said – amounting to an eye-watering 299% mark-up.",News/Business,Pfizer predicts bumper year from Covid vaccine and pill as profits double,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/pfizer-covid-vaccine-pill-profits-sales

2/9/2022,"A Mauritian-chartered survey ship, carrying Chagos Islanders exiled from their homeland 50 years ago by the UK government, left Seychelles bound for the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) on Tuesday. The 1,130 mile voyage marks the first time Chagossians have been allowed to enter the remote archipelago – cleared of its entire population in the early 1970s to make way for a US military base on Diego Garcia – without being under close British military escort.  The trip is going ahead amid a diplomatic face-off between the UK and Mauritius over ownership of the islands. By an overwhelming majority, the UN General Assembly accepted in 2019 an opinion by the international court of justice that the Chagos Islands were unlawfully detached from Mauritius by the UK when it granted Mauritius independence in 1968. The survey will measure the height of Blenheim Reef, one of the outlying Chagos islands, to obtain evidence for a separate hearing before the UN’s International Law of the Sea Tribunal. The case involves a dispute over demarcating the seabed between Mauritius and the Maldives; the tribunal has ruled that the UK has no legitimate claims in the area. The chartered vessel, Bleu De Nîmes, is a converted former British minesweeper. Aboard are five Chagossians who cannot return permanently to their homes. The head of the delegation is Mauritius’ ambassador to the UN, Jagdish Dharamchand Koonjul. Prof Philippe Sands QC, the leading lawyer retained by Mauritius, is also on the vessel, as are journalists from the BBC, the Guardian, the Atlantic magazine and Mauritian media. There appear to have been attempts to muzzle publicity about the voyage. It will take up to five days from Seychelles. The trip was delayed because of a cyclone. As Seychelles disappeared astern, Olivier Bancoult, who has taken a series of landmark cases in UK courts over Chagossians’ right to return to their native islands, said: “We are so excited to be travelling to our birthplace. “In previous ‘heritage’ visits [supervised by UK officials], we have always been escorted by British policemen or the army. This time we will be much more free. It’s the first visit organised by the Mauritian government. “I have brought the birth certificates of my mother and father and my family. I will celebrate my 58th birthday on 15 February. I left my beautiful island, Peros Banhos, when I was four years old. We used to live as one large family; it was paradise. I have spent [decades] in exile. “I have never given up taking legal cases because I believe our struggle is a just cause. My dream is to be able to settle in my birthplace. The oldest survivor among our exiles is now 100 years old.” Bancoult said he suspected that the treatment of the Chagossians amounted to racism. “The British government says it is in favour of human rights yet they make a difference between the treatment of Falkland Islanders, for example, and Chagossians,” he said. “Is it because we are black?” On the quayside before departure, Sands told the Guardian: “I’m amazed. I was hired in 2010 when I was on holiday and got a call from the Mauritian prime minister. He wanted to devise a legal strategy for the return of the Chagos Islands. “If you would have told me 10 years ago that Mauritius would win three international judgments [against the UK], I would not have been over optimistic. If you’d said we would be travelling to Chagos in 2022, I’d have been astounded. I will believe it when we set foot on Blenheim Reef, Salomon and Peros Banhos Islands [in the Chagos].” Originally the voyage was due to have started in the Maldives, which is only 500 miles away – a one-and-a-half day trip as opposed to the five days required from Seychelles. Sands explained: “Early in December, Mauritius informed the UK that it would be visiting the Chagos archipelago, to follow up a case before the International Law of the Sea Tribunal. It asked for confirmation from the UK that it would not impede the visit. “The Mauritius government made clear that if that information was not received by 20 December, it would start fresh proceedings against the UK. The UK blinked and sent a note back saying they would not impede the voyage. “The Maldives initially said it would have no problems with the trip but then informed Mauritius that it would exercise a right of veto over the delegation and made it clear that journalists would not be permitted. One can assume that the UK had a role in encouraging the Maldives to take steps to limit who participated.” Sands believes the UK’s hardline resistance is partially because it fears that handing over BIOT would set a precedent for the loss of the Falklands and Gibraltar. “But,” he added, “there’s no other UK [territory] that involves a case of [territorial] dismemberment [before independence].” As the ship left, Ambassador Koonjul said: “Our relations with the UK have always remained excellent. We agree to disagree. But we don’t understand how the UK can still claim morally and legally that this is their territory.” The Foreign Office has been asked for comment. They are a remote archipelago in the Indian Ocean occupied by the UK as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). The largest island, Diego Garcia, is rented to the US as a strategic military base. They were forcibly deported from the atolls in the early 1970s to make way for the US base. Most now live in Mauritius, Seychelles or in the UK. There is a large exiled, community in Crawley, West Sussex. Under the deal with the US, the UK received a discount on the cost of Polaris missiles for its nuclear submarines. The Mauritian government three years ago won a landmark case at the international court of justice in The Hague which found that Britain unlawfully detached the islands from Mauritius before granting it independence in 1968. The UN general assembly subsequently endorsed that ruling. The UK government does not accept the decision – which called on Britain to hand the islands back – arguing that it was only an “advisory opinion”. In 2010, the last Labour government declared the seas around the Chagos archipelago to be a Marine Protected Area. It is one of the largest in the world. The Chagossians believe the decision was taken to prevent them from returning to their homes and former fishing grounds. A Mauritian nautical survey team is going to examine some of the disputed atolls, in particular Blenheim Reef to gather evidence for an International Law of the Sea Tribunal. The boat is carrying a number of exiled Chagossians who will be returning to their native waters for the first time while not under the control of the British authorities. The UK government has said it will not impede its research work.",News/World news,Mauritian ship takes scientific team to contested Chagos Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/mauritian-ship-takes-scientific-team-to-contested-chagos-islands
2/9/2022,"For those at the top, decor and furniture can be tools to impress, charm, and intimidate. The terrifying seat of power in Game of Thrones is a towering iron chair, forged from the melted swords of defeated enemies. In the James Bond series, villains are known for decorating their headquarters with shark aquariums.  In real life, however, there is Vladimir Putin and his confusingly massive white table. Стол переговоров на встрече Путина и Макрона породил множество мемов pic.twitter.com/wybdx1NZJ2 Russia’s leader has started hosting one-on-one meetings with foreign dignitaries at a gargantuan oval table, roughly five metres’ long and held up by three thick pillars. A sole bouquet of flowers rests in the middle. He is not alone among world leaders when it comes to showy furnishings. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un has enough bookcases to rival a small library. And during the pandemic, China’s Xi Jinping has taken to video calls in front of an imposing painting of the Great Wall of China. The former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi held meetings with other leaders in a large and colourful tent, perhaps as a ploy to win them over with hints of his humble Bedouin origins. Gaddafi travelled the world with his tent and pitched it in several cities, including at the Villa Doria Pamphili park in Rome and Donald Trump’s estate in suburban New York. The former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad also had an impressive office with an imposingly large desk, although that may have been for other reasons – he is said to have taken afternoon naps underneath it. But what is the message behind Putin’s table, if there is one? On Monday, he hosted Emmanuel Macron at the three-legged colossus. The French president had flown to Moscow with a puffed chest, promising an “intense” talk with Putin, where he said he would seek a “historic solution” to the impending threat of war between Russia and Ukraine. Will Putin and Macron do face painting after? #Ukraine #pointless #lipservice pic.twitter.com/hi9agrWzmZ Yet after five hours of talks at the white table, Macron failed to extract any public concessions from Putin. Speculation has risen that the table was a show of power to subdue Macron, perhaps even the physical expression of a snub. However, it is also possible the mega-table is not making a political statement at all, or if there is one, it is of secondary relevance to Putin’s primary aim: avoiding Covid. Earlier this month, Putin hosted the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, at the same table. At that time, the message Moscow sought to portray was of close and friendly ties between the two leaders, even if they were sitting shouting distance apart. A very similar table also appeared pre-pandemic but with several people sitting at it. Today, Putin is clearly using the table to socially distance from foreign leaders, as he does in press conferences afterwards where their podiums are kept unusually far apart. The 69-year-old president is notoriously paranoid about Covid-19 and has largely remained in an isolated cocoon throughout the pandemic, taking measures far beyond his global counterparts. The Kremlin continues to require those meeting with Putin to quarantine for two weeks despite claiming that the Russian leader has received his vaccinations and booster shot. The requirements can be disruptive. Before the opening of a major art centre in Moscow, the director and main financier were said to have quarantined for two weeks in order to give Putin a short tour of the building. There is one person Putin has got close to, despite his Covid concerns. At the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing this month, he and Xi Jinping stood for the cameras within hugging distance of each other, a symbol of their powerful alliance as tensions rise with the west. Still, for their sit-down meeting, Chinese officials had arranged for an extremely large dark wooden table to be in place – one even bigger than Putin’s.

2/9/2022,"Several Italian mayors have been left seething after a rival hamlet with just 142 residents clinched €20m (£16.9m) as part of a nationwide project to revive Italy’s battered economy. Trevinano, an ancient hilltop hamlet in Lazio from where residents can also marvel at the views of the rolling hills of Umbria and Tuscany, beat 13 other candidates to secure the windfall from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund.  Italy is the biggest beneficiary of the fund, and of the €191bn the country is set to receive, €1bn will be spent on salvaging 200 villages on the brink of becoming ghost towns owing to depopulation. But just one lucky village in each of Italy’s 20 regions is eligible for a €20m slice of the funds. Trevinano, which falls under the Lazio municipality of Acquapendente, was the first winner to be announced after wooing judges with plans to transform the hamlet into a student training hub linked to the nearby Tuscia University, in Viterbo, and restoring houses for tourist accommodation. Alessandra Terrosi, the mayor of Acquapendente, told La Repubblica: “The idea is that this village can be transformed into a place for training, capable of attracting young people, for programmes including landscape studies and reforestation, and thus favouring not only repopulation, but the economic revitalisation of the whole areas.” Trevinano was settled by the Etruscans and had about 1,000 residents in the 1960s before the population decline took hold. But as the few inhabitants celebrate their win, the mayors of the candidates that missed out argue that such a huge amount of money ought to have been distributed more evenly. Luca Profili, the mayor of Civita di Bagnoregio, a hamlet perched on a plateau of volcanic rock surrounded by steep ravines at risk of landslides, told the Guardian he was disappointed. “€20m for one village is too much,” he said. “It would have been better to share it between several projects in Lazio. The other problem is that often it’s difficult for small towns to spend such a high amount of money. Trevinano has until 2026, so let’s see if it’s a success.” On the bright side, the neighbouring areas would probably benefit from Trevinano’s success, added Profili. Civita di Bagnoregio only has a handful of permanent residents, but has gained tremendously from tourism in recent years. “We are in a good position, but we will apply for other projects from the rest of the funding, so despite the disappointment, we are optimistic.” Maranola, a hub for luthiers and other artisans, was also among the losers. “I regret that the money is all going in one direction,” the mayor, Gianluca Tadeo, told La Repubblica. “But we will continue to work on our relaunch plans.”",News/World news,‘€20m for one village is too much’: Italian mayors agitated over rival’s win,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/20m-one-village-too-much-italian-mayors-agitated-trevinano
2/9/2022,"The morning after Keir Starmer was barracked by anti-vaxxers and accused of being a “paedophile protector”, there was surprisingly little sympathy for the Labour leader in Talacre Town Green, in the heart of his Holborn and St Pancras constituency. Starmer plays football in the park most weeks, but there was no sign of the supporters who gave him almost a 28,000 majority at the last election. “If I see him playing I’ll boo him,” said Tony Walters, 62, who was out walking Coco, his staffordshire bull terrier.  With no prompting about the Jimmy Savile slur, Walters said: “No politicians are any good – Starmer couldn’t even prosecute Jimmy Savile, and Jimmy Savile abused a lot of people. It was all covered up.” When it was pointed out that it was false for Boris Johnson to claim Starmer failed to prosecute Savile when he was director of public prosecutions, Walters replied: “Well, how did Jimmy Savile get off then?” Walters, a former cabby turned full-time carer, said he was suspicious of all politicians. “I picked up a few politicians when I was a taxi driver and I used to tell them the government is corrupt, and they would laugh at me. They haven’t got any common sense. Johnson hasn’t got common sense, he may be educated but common sense is one thing he ain’t got.” Only one in five people in the park were aware that the Labour leader had been mobbed on Monday by angry protesters, some of whom were shouting Savile’s name. It was Johnson’s false Savile claim that appeared to have had more impact with Starmer’s constituents. Eddie Byrne, 62, a retired hotel manager, said he had read online about Starmer’s treatment on Monday. He asked: “Is it true? That would be my first question: did he fail to prosecute Jimmy Savile, because Jimmy Savile got away with stuff for so long. And a lot of stuff has come up since about what was known at the time when Starmer was head of public prosecutions. If it’s true then he shouldn’t be the leader of a political party.” Byrne remained suspicious even when it was explained that Savile’s case was not Starmer’s responsibility. “You see, that’s passing the buck. They’re so good at that – they all blame each other,” he said. But Byrne was in no doubt that Johnson had deliberately made the Savile allegation to divert attention from criticism over lockdown parties. He said: “Johnson was getting all the aggro about parties, so he tried to deflect on to Starmer. All he did was take a little pressure off himself. That was the whole idea of the Savile comments.” Andy Apostolu, 65, the owner of the nearby Andy’s cafe, agreed. “Everything is Boris Johnson’s fault at the moment, which is why he said Jimmy Savile.” Preparing a double order of bacon and sausage sandwiches, Apostolu added: “He was trying to get out of what he’s being doing for the last two years with the parties and everything. I don’t think it was Starmer’s fault that Savile got off.” One of Andy’s regular customers, Louise Lambe, chipped in to express anger at Johnson’s remarks. “What happened to Starmer is directly a result of what Boris Johnson said last week,” the 38-year-old dressmaker said. But she thought the Labour leader could be doing more to attack Johnson. “Starmer seems like the only adult in the room but I think he holds back a little bit – he could be tearing into Johnson a lot more than he does.”",News/Politics,‘They all blame each other’: little sympathy for Starmer after Savile slur,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/they-all-blame-each-other-little-sympathy-for-starmer-after-savile-slur
2/9/2022,"It appeared one winter’s night on a steelworker’s garage, a wondrous piece of street art making points about the innocence of childhood, industrial decay and air pollution. After a three-year sojourn in the town of Port Talbot, Season’s Greetings, Wales’ first and only Banksy, was craned on to the back of a flatbed lorry and trucked out of the country.  As the work headed towards the M4, there was anger and sadness from many townsfolk, who argued that the piece, destined for a secure storage unit in England, was a gift from Bansky and should not be lost. “I’ll definitely miss it,” said retired chef Lynne Thomas, one of those who turned out to bid a melancholy farewell to the Banksy – spray paint on half a tonne of concrete blocks. “I get off the bus just here every day and always have a look. It’s a real shame we couldn’t hang on to it.” Paul Reynolds, who owns the motorbike shop Kickstart, said the town should have done more to save its Banksy. “It was made for Port Talbot,” he said. “It should stay in Port Talbot.” The owner of the garage, close to the Tata steelworks, sold the Banksy to an Essex art dealer, John Brandler, shortly after it materialised in December 2018. Brandler said it could stay for three years and it was moved for safe-keeping to a former police station in the town. Last year, Brandler told Neath Port Talbot council that the town could keep the work for longer – but the loan fee would be £100,000 a year. The council declined and on Tuesday a team of removal experts arrived to take it away. “I wanted it to stay here but spent months banging my head against a brick wall,” said Brandler, who was on site to make sure his multimillion pound piece came to no harm. Brandler said the £100,000 figure was “a starting point” in a negotiation and he had been keen to work with the council to find a way of keeping it in south Wales and turning it into a more permanent attraction. “This is not a rich place,” he said. “Nobody stops here out of choice. I wanted to make Port Talbot a go-to place, not a go-through place.” From behind the fence set up around the removal operation, steelworker Simon Lewis challenged Brandler, claiming that moving the work from Port Talbot made it meaningless. “Isn’t street art meant to be in the street?” he asked. “Not necessarily,” Brandler replied. The dealer said he was in discussion with an English city about building a museum around the Banksy. But plans are also afoot to sell off unique digital pieces of it to fans, who would then own a tiny virtual piece of Season’s Greetings. Under pressure on moving day was John Frankiewicz, the executive chairman of the Egg Group, the fit-out and refurbish company in charge of safely transporting the Banksy (nobody could be found to insure the operation). “It’s a fragile thing, we don’t want it in bits, do we?” It took seven hours to get the work out and strapped on to a lorry. A crowd gathered to wave it goodbye as it headed out past Taibach, the neighbourhood where it appeared. Bev Simmonds-Owen, a leading light in a trail called ARTwalk that has grown up around the Banksy, was sad but said. “The Bansky being here has shone a light on art and culture in the town. A lot of great stuff has bubbled to the surface. The Banksy itself and everything that goes with it has turned into a bit of a circus. In a way it’s good that the circus is leaving town. It’s time to look forward.”",News/UK news,Port Talbot says bye-bye to its Banksy as art dealer brings in a crane,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/port-talbot-says-bye-bye-to-its-banksy-as-art-dealer-brings-in-a-crane
2/9/2022,"The US urgently needs a smarter, multi-pronged strategy and cabinet-level leadership to tackle an escalating overdose epidemic which poses an unacceptable threat to national security and the economy, a bipartisan congressional commission has found.  The long awaited report by the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking calls for a major shift in policy to combat rising fatal overdoses, with much greater focus on reducing demand through public health measures. About a million Americans have died from drug overdoses since 1999, with around 100,000 deaths in the past year. Around two thirds of the recent fatalities – about 170 a day, mostly working-age Americans – have involved synthetic or human-made opioids like fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin. The pandemic has contributed to a surge in substance misuse including fatal overdoses. At least one in 10 Americans initiated or increased drug use amid rising anxiety, depression and trauma, and reduced access to services. The social and psychological impact has been devastating, but economic costs are also high: drug overdoses cost the US economy about $1tn annually, the commission estimated. “In terms of loss of life and damage to the economy, illicit synthetic opioids have the effect of a slow-motion weapon of mass destruction in pill form,” the 70-page report to Congress said. The commission’s findings echo Joe Biden’s declaration last December that the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids constitutes a national emergency. The report acknowledges that the crisis has its roots in an FDA decision to approve the highly addictive painkiller Oxycontin in 1995, fueling a rise in opioid addiction exploited by criminal gangs, at first with heroin but since 2014 with more profitable and deadly synthetics like fentanyl. Amid inadequate prevention and drug treatment services, gangs have adapted fentanyl to American tastes by creating pills which for many are less stigmatised than snorting, injecting and smoking. It is of the “highest concern”, according to the commission, that most users are not at least initially seeking fentanyl, rather that it is laced into heroin and brand-name pills like Vicodin and Oxycontin, driving overdoses. Synthetic opioids are highly potent, far easier and cheaper to produce and transport than heroin – which requires poppies grown in mountainous regions – and much harder to detect as the supply chain is simpler. Law enforcement has been outpaced and outmanoeuvred by criminal networks. At first, synthetic opioids were mostly trafficked into the US from China. But since 2019, Mexico has become the dominant source, drugs manufactured in labs using easy to purchase precursors from China. The vast majority of the drugs enter the US across the southern border, after which powder and pills are increasingly moved by regular postal and courier services. Many vendors use online platforms including social media to connect with buyers including Mexican traffickers, then use encrypted telecoms systems. The commission concludes that it is “impossible” to combat the flow of synthetics and reduce fatal overdoses by focusing efforts only on supply, thus challenging the mainstay principle of America’s ill-fated 50-year “war on drugs”. In order to save American lives, the report says, the government must increase public awareness of the dangers and pervasiveness of synthetic opioids and improve and expand access to treatment options including outpatient care, harm reduction interventions and rehab. “Failure to intervene in ways that appropriately reduce demand and decrease the risk of fatal overdose will almost certainly result in the death of hundreds of thousands of more Americans and will imperil the country’s economic and social wellbeing,” the report says. A recent Lancet study warned that without radical change, the US synthetic opioid death toll could rise to 1.2 million by 2029. The report, which makes 76 recommendations, concludes that serious geopolitical issues are impeding disruption of the drug trade. It is particularly critical of the Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who began his term in 2018 promising “hugs not bullets” for the cartels. Since then, the murder rate has increased and the country has been militarized, while the production and trafficking of illicit drugs like fentanyl has increased. President López Obrador “must do more in the coming months and years to more directly address the threat cartels pose to the health and safety of both the people in Mexico and the United States”, the report said.",News/US news,"New strategy urgently needed to tackle devastating opioids crisis, US told",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/us-opioids-crisis-congress-government-report

2/9/2022,"With the pressure of more than a billion people on her shoulders, Eileen Gu soared and spun high into the Beijing sky before landing a stunning double cork 1620 to take Winter Olympics gold. Then, in another considerable feat of nimbleness, the 18-year-old deftly avoided attempts by the world’s media to drag her into a diplomatic incident with the skill of a UN veteran. It amounted to the performance of these Games, on and off the snow. And across China it also led to an immediate outpouring of support and joy for Gu, who was born in the United States before controversially transferring her allegiance to China three years ago.  China Daily hailed Gu as a “hexagonal all-around warrior”, pointing out that she finished her high school course a year early, was admitted to Stanford University and is favoured by the fashion industry. Meanwhile the Chinese news agency Xinhua called her victory of “great significance” given it was the first by a Chinese woman in a snow event at the Winter Olympics. There was also widespread praise for Gu on Chinese social media, with some noting approvingly that she had answered questions in fluent Mandarin with a Beijing accent absorbed from her mother. But to western ears, the way Gu navigated the trickiest geo-political questions without upsetting the Chinese government was remarkable. Three times she was asked whether she had renounced her US citizenship to compete for China. Three times she adroitly sidestepped answering. “I feel just as American as I am Chinese,” she told reporters. “I grew up spending 25-30% of every year in China. Actually, the tower here I can see from my house in Beijing. My mission is to use sport as a force for unity.” And when asked about the allegations regarding the wellbeing of Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star who has been the subject of considerable speculation and concern after she posted a claim that a government official coerced her into sex, Gu deftly focused on the fact Peng had turned up to watch her. “It is a big honour when athletes from other sports come and pay attention to smaller sports like free skiing,” she said. “I am really grateful that she is happy and healthy and out here doing her thing again.” This delicate attempt to straddle two countries and two cultures has certainly not harmed Gu’s bank balance. Already she has racked up millions in endorsements from more than 20 sponsors, ranging from the Bank of China to Louis Vuitton and Victoria’s Secret. But, inevitably, her decision to compete under the flag of China has led to criticism and worse. On Tuesday, with the US team still without a gold medal at these Games, the hashtag #EileenGuTraitor was trending on US social media. Asked by the Guardian about her critics, Gu was impressively forthright. “I’m an 18-year-old out here living my best life,” she replied. “I know I have a good heart. And I know my reasons for making the decisions I do. They are based on something I feel like is for the greater good. “I’m not going to waste my time trying to placate people who are uneducated, and don’t experience the gratitude and love I have on a daily basis.” Then a twist of the knife. “If they don’t believe me, and if people don’t like me, that is their loss: they are never going to win the Olympics.” Earlier Gu told an adoring Chinese media that her mother had also called her before her final trick to tell her to play it safe – advice she said that she had ignored, prompting many smiles. However, Gu’s story is not the only one of a US-born athlete competing for China that is playing out at these Winter Games at a time of rising cyber nationalism. On Sunday, the 19-year-old Zhu Yi, who was born in California, fell flat on the ice during her routine. Immediately, the hashtag “Zhu Yi Has Fallen” became a trending topic on Weibo, gaining millions of views. “Shame on you,” one wrote. “How dare you skate for China?!” said another angry viewer. That didn’t quite tell the whole story. Even after Zhu slipped, audiences in the venue clapped for her. However, on social media the tone was harsher, with some pointing out her lack of fluency in Chinese language and urged her to learn Mandarin properly. There was even discussion of her family background, including her father’s profession, with some suggesting her selection was down to her family connections. “I just felt very sad that I couldn’t do better and help during this team event but I’m very grateful to have them, and have them cheering for me,” said Zhu afterwards. It led Hu Xijin, the former editor of the nationalistic Global Times, to urge people not to cyberbully her online. “To vent emotions on this young athlete, using social media to throw rocks down a well when she makes mistakes – that’s cyberbullying, and no matter what it’s going too far,” he wrote in a long post on Weibo. On the Chinese internet a new narrative is stirring: that it is the US media stirring up negativity on Zhu, who also fell twice in her programme on Monday. However it is telling that the hashtag “Zhu Yi has fallen” is no longer in existence on Weibo – with censors perhaps realising the seriousness of the matter. Meanwhile, Gu’s Olympic Games is far from over. Over the next week she will set her sights on a historic treble of freeski gold medals. It will require her to show yet more remarkable skill and adroitness. But few would bet against her delivering again. And again.

2/9/2022,"One of the best-known personal art collections ever amassed will reopen to the public in Glasgow next month after a six-year refurbishment costing £68m. The Burrell Collection, which consists of more than 9,000 objects spanning six millennia, uses digital innovation to connect 21st-century viewers to ancient artefacts.  The redevelopment, which many consider a cornerstone of the city’s cultural recovery from the pandemic, also commits to integrating the museum with the surrounding natural environment in Pollok Country Park, Glasgow’s largest green space. There is also a new emphasis on community, including the acknowledgment of the collection’s links to the slave trade, an examination of objects’ connections to LGBT history and a redisplay developed with the input of 15,000 locals. The shipping magnate and philanthropist Sir William Burrell, along with his wife, Constance, collected thousands of works, including Chinese ceramics, stained glass, tapestries and fine art. They donated them to the City of Glasgow in 1944 on the proviso that the collection be housed in a rural setting. The original gallery was opened by the Queen in Pollok Park in 1983, but was built with a single public entrance. The refurbishment adds a 1,000 sq-metre concourse, with a playscape and cafe terrace, making the building more accessible to park visitors. Duncan Dornan, Glasgow Life’s head of museums and collections, says the Burrell’s closure offered an opportunity to re-examine the provenance of its collection, at a time when the rest of the UK sector was doing likewise, resulting in new wording for displays, for example, where art was created to mark the wealth of European plantation owners. “Language is moving on, and we’re much more conscious of the provenance of objects and being transparent about these connections where they exist,” he said. This transparency extends to the whole collection, according to Burrell curators, with visitors having access to a third more of the building, including the basement stores, where, for the first time, they may book to see a particular object. This allows the museum to put on its first permanent display of the Wagner garden carpet, a depiction of Paradise from the Qur’an and one of the earliest surviving Persian garden carpets in the world. It is so large that an entire gallery has been designed specifically for it. Digital is promoted as the primary mode of interpretation, with a particular emphasis on younger visitors – 25% of digital displays are aimed at children under five – and ranging from tablet-based information to 16-metre wide immersive video projections, including images of the Burrells themselves walking through the streets of Glasgow. Nearly half of the funding for the redevelopment was committed by Glasgow city council, with more than a quarter coming from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and significant grants from the Scottish and UK governments. As Scotland emerges from the latest restrictions resulting from the Omicron variant of Covid-19, Dornan says the Burrell’s spring opening places the museum at the heart of the city’s recovery. “As people come back to enjoy museums and social settings again, clearly we are in a park and it’s a very open building, so it is a nice safe-feeling environment,” he said. “As the Burrell did in 1983, when it was really the first step in Glasgow’s reinvention, it can play a part again in 2022 in the city recovering from the pandemic and again rebuilding it economy.” The Burrell Collection will reopen to the public on 29 March.",News/UK news,"Glasgow’s Burrell Collection to reopen after six-year, £68m refurbishment",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/glasgow-burrell-collection-reopen-68m-refurbishment-slave-trade
