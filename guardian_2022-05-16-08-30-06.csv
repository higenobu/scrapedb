5/16/2022,"Children have become more sedentary and their physical activity levels have deteriorated in the wake of the pandemic even after the lifting of restrictions, a study suggests. Researchers said child physical activity levels fell below national guidelines during the Covid-19 crisis and did not recover when lockdowns ended. The UK’s chief medical officers recommend that all children and young people should take part in an hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. However, the study led by the University of Bristol found that by the end of 2021, only a third were meeting the national recommended physical activity guidelines. While there was no change in their parents’ physical activity levels, the findings showed 10-11-year-olds took part in on average just 56 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity during weekdays from last April to December. Researchers said that was around eight minutes on average less – a drop of 13% – than children of a similar age were doing before the pandemic. It found children were less active at the weekend than during the week, taking part in 46 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity during weekend days. This was also about eight minutes lower than children who were measured using the same methods before the pandemic. The study also revealed a marked increase in sedentary time, with children spending 25 minutes longer sitting down each day during the week than previously. “It was surprising, the extent children’s physical activity levels had fallen after the pandemic, indicating that changes in physical activity patterns did not revert to previous levels once freedoms had been restored,” said the study’s senior author, Prof Russ Jago, of the University of Bristol. “These findings highlight a greater need to work with children, families, schools and communities to maximise the opportunities for children to be physically active as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.” Nearly 400 children and their parents from 23 schools in Bristol were recruited for the study. They wore an accelerometer to measure the intensity of physical activity and answered questionnaires. This information was compared with data from 1,296 children and their parents recruited from 50 schools in the same area before the pandemic. “The key strength of this study was that we used data collected before and after the pandemic, using the same methods and in the same schools,” said Ruth Salway, a statistician at the University of Bristol. “The data clearly demonstrates children’s physical activity had deteriorated once the restrictions were lifted. “This emphasises the importance of understanding how such habits change over time, so appropriate support and interventions can be introduced as normality resumes.” The study, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, was published in the International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity.",News/Society,Children’s activity levels have not recovered after end of Covid restrictions – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/childrens-activity-levels-have-not-recovered-after-end-of-covid-restrictions-study
5/16/2022,"The government is permanently lifting restrictions placed on police stop and search powers in areas where they anticipate violent crime, the home secretary has announced. In a letter to police forces on Monday, Priti Patel outlined the easing of conditions on the use of the tactics under section 60 of the criminal justice and public order act. Section 60 powers give officers the right to search people without reasonable grounds in an area when they expect serious violence, and to look for weapons before they can be used or for those used in a recent attack. The limitations were put in place in 2014 by then home secretary Theresa May. Stop and search tactics are controversial because of concerns that they disproportionately affect black and minority ethnic communities, with campaign groups previously warning that relaxing the restrictions could compound discrimination. The changes extend the length of time the powers can be in force from 15 to 24 hours. The period a section 60 can be extended to is now 48 hours, having previously been 39 hours. The rank at which officers are able to authorise the deployment of stop and search has been lowered from senior officer to inspector, while a superintendent can now extend the authorisation. Authorising officers now only need to anticipate that serious violence “may” rather than “will” occur, and no longer need to publicly communicate authorisations to communities in advance. Patel said: “The devastating impact of knife crime on families who have lost their loved one is unbearable. No one should have to endure the pain and suffering of the victims of these appalling crimes and we have a responsibility to them to do everything in our power to prevent future tragedies.” She said the use of stop and search has increased by about 85% since 2019 and contributed to 50,000 weapons being taken off the streets. Patel added: “I stand wholeheartedly behind the police so that they can build on their work to drive down knife crime by making it easier for officers to use these powers to seize more weapons, arrest more suspects and save more lives.” Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up To Racism, told the Guardian that this “draconian action” would lead to “unnecessary conflict”. “The restrictions were put in because two police reports found there was indiscriminate use [of stop and search] against black communities. Our civil rights are being eroded and thrown in the bin by Priti Patel,” he said. The move coincides with the launch of Operation Sceptre, a week of intensive action by every police force in England and Wales to tackle knife crime. The government has also launched a consultation to make it easier for officers to search known knife carriers. It comes after the introduction of serious violence reduction orders under the controversial police, crime, sentencing and courts act passed last month, which are intended to make such checks easier. The Home Office rolled back restrictions on the section 60 tactics in 2019 as part of an attempt to tackle knife crime. A report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog last month urged an overhaul of the use of stop-and-search powers to tackle the disproportionate impact the measures have on ethnic minority groups. In the year to March 2021, black people were seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, while Asian people were two-and-a-half times more likely. The IOPC report cited allegations that one child was stopped 60 times. The Guardian reported that the male teenager was sometimes searched multiple times in the same day over two years, starting in 2018 when he was aged 14.",News/Law,Restrictions on police stop and search powers permanently lifted,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/16/restrictions-on-police-stop-and-search-powers-permanently-lifted
5/16/2022,"Bereaved relatives of those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire and the community living in its shadow are struggling to agree on the best way to commemorate the disaster. Next month marks five years since a fire engulfed the tower block in North Kensington, west London, killing 72 people. A memorial garden is “by far” the most popular option to commemorate the tragedy, according to a report published on Monday by the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission. However, it stresses that there are “very different views” on the best tribute, with the remains of the tower itself proving most controversial. The block is currently covered in green safety wrapping, with the message “Forever in our hearts”. What to do with it remains painfully divisive. “Some bereaved families have asked us to stress the deep pain and sorrow that would be felt if the tower was to come down – and the fury that would be unleashed if this happened without them being properly consulted with,” the report said. It added: “A large number of people – particularly those living and working in the local community – tell us that living with the tower places a huge strain on their mental health.” Parents are particularly concerned about the impact of this on children. Ideas from bereaved families include a museum to commemorate lost relatives, a sky garden and maintaining the charred remains of the tower as a memorial. “Even with the best will in the world and all the imagination we can muster, we know that some painful choices lie ahead,” the commission wrote. The government will decide if the tower comes down, the report said, but if it does, materials from it will be made available for use in the memorial if that is what the community requests. About 2,000 people were surveyed for the report, including about 100 bereaved family members and survivors. Almost two-thirds said they would like the memorial to include a garden, a third would like it to feature artwork or a monument and one in 10 wanted to incorporate a building such as a museum. The commission put its work on hold last September after an article in the Sunday Times said ministers were set to announce the demolition of the tower. The commissioners said they were “shocked, dismayed and completely blindsided” by it and did not resume their work until January this year after reassurances from Michael Gove that he would listen to the community. The commission is co-chaired by solicitor Thelma Stober, who was injured in the 7/7 terrorist attacks, and Michael Lockwood a senior civil servant who ran the response in the aftermath of the fire. He is now director general of the Independent Office for Police Conduct. In a joint statement, they said: “Our role is to ensure that what happened at Grenfell is never forgotten … Today’s report is a huge step forward. It reflects the incredible amount of work undertaken by all of the community representatives on the Memorial Commission, and of all the bereaved families, survivors and local residents involved over the past two years.” The commission will make final recommendations next year. A covenant will protect the site from any use which goes against the community’s wishes. Yvette Williams, one of the organisers of the Justice4Grenfell group, said she was sceptical that the consultation would be listened to by the government. “What evidence do we have to trust the government that they will deliver on what the bereaved families want?” she said. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting the Memorial Commission and the community as they develop their vision for a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives in the Grenfell Tower tragedy.”",News/UK news,‘Painful choices’ remain over tribute to Grenfell Tower victims,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/painful-choices-remain-over-tribute-to-grenfell-tower-victims
5/16/2022,"At least 239 barriers, including dams and weirs, were removed across 17 countries in Europe in 2021, in a record-breaking year for dam removals across the continent. Spain led the way, with 108 structures taken out of the country’s rivers. “Our efforts to expand dam removals across Europe are gathering speed,” said Pao Fernández Garrido, project manager for the World Fish Migration Foundation, who helped produce Dam Removal Europe’s annual report. “An increasing number of governments, NGOs, companies and communities are understanding the importance of halting and reversing nature loss, and buying into the fact that dam removal is a river-restoration tool that boosts biodiversity and enhances climate resilience. We’re also seeing lessons being learned from previous dam removals, new countries kickstarting removals, and new funds, including crowdfunding.” More than 1m barriers are estimated to exist on Europe’s rivers, with many built more than a century ago. At least 150,000 are old, obsolete barriers that serve no economic purpose. Dams, weirs and other river obstacles block fish migration routes, often leading to the loss of breeding areas and reduced numbers of species such as salmon, sturgeon, trout and eel, which affects the wider biodiversity of ecosystems, including species ranging from eagles to otters. Free-flowing rivers also transport sediments and nutrients. “Removing dams is a real need,” said Fernández Garrido. “We have hundreds of thousands of abandoned barriers, which is a safety problem. Dams affect water quality and underground water levels, cause channel and coastal erosion and beach disappearances, generate greenhouse gas emissions and lead to declines and even extinctions of migratory fish populations, with a 93% decline of migratory fish in Europe in the last 50 years. Dams have a negative impact on the environment, so if a dam or weir isn’t strictly necessary any more, we mustn’t pass the burden to future generations.” Dam Removal Europe is a coalition of seven organisations, including the World Fish Migration Foundation, WWF, the Rivers Trust and Rewilding Europe, working to restore healthy, free-flowing rivers across the continent. The latest report found that 76% of the removals were of small dams and weirs, but 24% were higher than 2 metres. Three countries – Portugal, Montenegro, and Slovakia – recorded their first ever dam removals in 2021. In Finland, a functioning hydropower dam was also dismantled, the first of three on the Hiitolanjoki River, which, when completed, is expected to allow landlocked salmon to return to spawning grounds. “This is the perfect example to show that when an operating hydropower dam isn’t needed, and energy can be supplied by other sources, it’s worth removing it and recovering the river,” said Fernández Garrido. “The river will be totally free of dams for the first time in over 120 years.” Spain removed 108 barriers from its rivers in 2021, including the 13m-high Anllarinos dam, the tallest European dam taken out last year. “Spanish law is one of the best for dealing with dams,” said Rafael Seiz from WWF-Spain’s Freshwater Programme. “Spain has legislation that obligates the owner to pay for its infrastructure removal once they stop using it.” “Spain, France, Denmark, Finland and the UK are blazing a trail,” said Fernández Garrido. “There are other countries that need to make strong efforts to start, such as Italy, Portugal and Greece, and almost all countries in eastern Europe, where many proponents of dam removals are still afraid to openly talk about it.” With dramatic declines in freshwater fish populations, restoring free-flowing rivers is seen as urgent. “We truly think 2022 will beat 2021, [because] financial aids are being created to help cover the removal costs, like the new Open Rivers Programme, which will invest €42.5m over the next six years to help remove river barriers in Europe,” said Fernández Garrido. “We really want to see governments from all countries taking action and creating national grants and plans to completely free some of their rivers from obstacles, so there is, at least, a free and healthy river per country. We’re talking about creating a big shift.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Record number of dams removed from Europe’s rivers in 2021 ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/record-number-of-dams-removed-from-europe-rivers-in-2021-aoe
5/16/2022,"A group of 58 leading economists and politicians, including the former business minister Vince Cable, has written to the chancellor to say that scaling back City regulation will put the UK at risk of another financial crash. The open letter, which has also been signed by the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and Columbia University professor Adam Tooze, was sent in reaction to the Queen’s speech, which outlined Rishi Sunak’s plans to “cut red tape” through a financial services and markets bill. “We wholeheartedly support the government’s aim to stimulate long-term UK economic growth, including through financial regulation,” the letter said. “Yet we believe that competitiveness is an inappropriate objective for regulators.” News of the pending bill – which comes as the UK aims to replace EU regulations following Brexit – has stoked fears about a regulatory race to the bottom, with economists saying it could force watchdogs to act as “cheerleaders” for big city institutions. They argued that competitiveness objectives could be a “recipe for excessive risk-taking”, and could create the same conditions that have since been blamed for the 2008 banking crash. “After the last global financial crisis, which cost the world economy some $10tn, it was accepted that a focus on competitiveness by the then Financial Services Authority (FSA) had helped cause the disaster,” the letter said. They even pointed to a 2019 speech by Andrew Bailey – the Bank of England governor who formerly headed the FSA’s successor, the Financial Conduct Authority – in which he argued against reintroducing a competition objective for the City watchdog. “It didn’t end well for anyone, including the FSA,” Bailey said. Cable said in a statement: “It is extraordinary that the lessons of the financial crisis are being forgotten already, despite the massive harm that was done. The new emphasis on ‘competitiveness’ rather than stability and safety is an ominous warning that those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it.” The pending bill is part of the government’s response to pressure from lobby groups including UK Finance, TheCityUK and the City of London Corporation, which were broadly opposed to Brexit but have yet to see any of the benefits promised by pro-leave politicians. City groups have, for example, been pushing for a review of capital requirements for insurers and banks that could help free up cash for new investments and loans, and make it cheaper to take riskier bets, since they would have to hold less capital to protect against potential losses. That is on top of pushes to make changes to a wide-ranging package of regulations known as Mifid II. There are calls for firms to be allowed to bundle customer charges, and for the permanent removal of caps on “dark trading” – which obscure the size of planned trades but can give investors access to better market prices. Some are calling for a review of UK-specific rules like ringfencing – which require banks to protect consumer deposits by separating their retail and investment banking operations – as well as reducing the time it takes to secure regulatory approval for company directors, and simplifying regulation for challenger banks. The Treasury has not yet confirmed the main policies that will make up the financial services and markets bill, which is expected to be put to parliament in the coming months, but has pushed back against claims that it will result in a watering-down of regulation. Miles Celic, chief executive of the TheCityUK, defended the reintroduction of competitiveness objectives for regulators, saying other countries like Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore had managed to strike a balance with other goals such as financial stability and consumer protection. Celic said: “It is self-evident that high-quality, well-implemented and effective regulatory standards are clearly good for competitiveness and economic growth, and so there is no contradiction between an effective regulatory regime and the proposed new secondary competitiveness objective.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We want to ensure the financial services sector is delivering for businesses and consumers across the UK, while also cementing our position as a global leader and promoting high international standards. “Now we have left the EU, it is right that the regulators’ objectives reflect financial services’ critical role in supporting the economy, making the UK an even more attractive place to invest and do business.”",News/Business,"Cutting City regulation risks another financial crash, say economists",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/cutting-city-regulation-financial-crash-economists-rishi-sunak-uk
5/16/2022,"The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, will release a $173bn balance-of-power wishlist at the party’s campaign launch in Brisbane on Monday night, outlining seven key concessions it wants from Labor in the event of a minority government. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has ruled out doing any deals with the Greens to form government, while Bandt has said the party will not support the Liberals under any circumstance. But the Greens are preparing their list of key demands for Labor in the event that it falls short of the 76 seats it needs to form majority government, with the party confident of winning at least one seat in Queensland to give it two lower house MPs. The party’s seven key demands are no new coal and gas; dental and mental health into Medicare; building 1m affordable homes and better renters’ rights; free childcare; wiping student debt; lifting income support; and progress on all elements of the Uluru statement from the heart. The cost of the policy demands is about $173bn over four years but the Greens are also advocating $182bn in new revenue and savings measures to cover the cost, including through a superannuation profits tax, a billionaires tax, a crackdown on corporate tax avoidance and ending fossil fuel subsidies. Bandt will release the party’s demands at a campaign launch at the BlackHops Brewery on Monday in the Brisbane electorate of Griffith, which is held by Labor’s Terri Butler on a 2.8% margin. The Greens are hoping they can secure a win in Griffith and are also eyeing off the Coalition-held seats of Ryan (6%) and Brisbane (4.9%) as possible gains. Labor is also hoping to pick these seats off the Coalition. The Greens candidate for Griffith, Max Chandler-Mather, secured 23.6% of the vote when he ran in 2019 and the party is confident it can build upon this 6.6% swing at Saturday’s election. Bandt predicted a close result on election night that could put the Greens in the box seat, and said voters “deserve to know what will be on the negotiating table”. “This election has become a narrow contest between a terrible government that’s got to go and a visionless opposition that keeps agreeing with them,” he said. “The Greens will kick the Liberals out and keep Labor on track.” He said the party would tackle the climate crisis by stopping new coal and gas mines, and address the rising cost of living by getting dental and mental health into Medicare, building affordable housing and making childcare free. Bandt said expanding Labor’s childcare policy to make it free for everyone would cost up to $3bn more than its existing policy. Labor has not released full costings of its childcare proposal but it is estimated to be between $5.4bn and $6.3bn a year. The Greens childcare policy is costed at about $8.3bn a year. “The Greens also want action for First Nations people, including a Truth and Justice Commission to begin acknowledging the violence and dispossession of this land’s first peoples, as well as progress towards a Treaty, to complement Labor’s commitment to progress the Voice to Parliament,” Bandt said.

5/16/2022,"Failure to act on the promises made at the Glasgow Cop26 climate summit last year would be “an act of monstrous self-harm”, the UK’s president of the conference will warn today in Glasgow. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who led the UK-hosted summit that ended with agreement to limit global heating to 1.5C, will say that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rising energy and food prices, have changed the global outlook drastically in the six months since. But responding to those changes by reneging on climate commitments would only result in worse damage, he will say. “The current crises should increase, not diminish, our determination to deliver on what we agreed here at Cop26, and honour the Glasgow climate pact,” he is expected to say. “[World leaders must show that] though the world has changed, our resolve has not.” Sharma is returning to Glasgow on Monday to mark six months since Cop26 ended. Nearly 200 countries have agreed to develop new commitments this year to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5C goal, which requires roughly halving carbon levels by 2030, according to scientific advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Though Cop26 made important progress – all the world’s big economies have now committed to net-zero goals, compared with a handful before the UK took on its Cop26 role – it fell short of producing national plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), that add up to the 2030 target. But countries agreed to return this year to the Cop27 conference in Egypt in November with strengthened commitments. Sharma urged countries to “pick up the pace” and make fresh commitments in line with stark warnings from the IPCC in new reports published this spring, and after recent extreme weather such as the heatwaves that have struck India and Pakistan. “The window of time we have to act is closing fast [and] we must urgently adapt and reduce emissions, because current targets are not enough,” he will warn. “Every country must respond to the call to revisit and strengthen their NDCs, and they must do so in 2022. The Glasgow pact calls on countries to look again at their NDCs, not at some vague point in the future, but this year, in 2022,” he will say. Many climate experts have told the Guardian they are concerned that the war in Ukraine, soaring prices for energy and food, and governments responding by increasing fossil fuel production, are imperilling the Cop26 promises. The Guardian has also uncovered evidence of nearly 200 “carbon bombs” – oil, gas and coal mega-projects, proposed or under way – that would destroy any chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts have warned that the answer to these crises is to move much faster away from fossil fuels. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point, towards a cleaner and more secure energy system.” Failure to cut emissions will result in some of the world’s biggest cities running out of water, a report from the charity Christian Aid warned on Monday. London, Sydney, Beijing, Cairo, Cape Town and Phoenix are all in danger of running out of water as the climate crisis takes hold, according to the report, entitled Scorched Earth: the impact of drought on 10 world cities. Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, who studied the 2018 drought in Cape Town, warned: “Changing rainfall and higher temperatures – the result of greenhouse gas emissions – are making drought more common and more severe in parts of the world. As we saw in Cape Town, this can add up to catastrophic water shortages even for some major cities.” Nushrat Rahman Chowdhury, co-author of the Christian Aid report, said: “Drought is not new, but its intensity and frequency have increased over the last 30 years due to global warming. It is a real danger; it threatens lives and livelihoods of some of the poorest people in the world, who have done the least to cause the climate crisis.”",News/Environment,"Breaking climate vows would be ‘monstrous self-harm’, warns Cop26 president",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/15/breaking-climate-vows-would-be-monstrous-self-harm-warns-cop26-president
