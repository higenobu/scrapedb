4/16/2022,"The Australian Electoral Commission has written to political parties warning against distributing “potentially misleading” postal vote applications to residents. Political parties have sent out forms to voters where they can register with the AEC to vote via mail. However, the forms are sent back via the political parties and can be used to harvest personal information about those voters to target later. This year Labor has set up howtovote.org.au and the Liberals have set up postal.vote – with little party branding – to target voters. The AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers, wrote to political parties and candidates on Saturday amid reports of incorrect forms being distributed to voters in one division and the AEC’s purple colour being used on forms in another. “It’s legal but it is potentially misleading and we’re concerned,” Rogers said. “While we haven’t seen unauthorised postal vote applications, the use of colour and wording means someone who doesn’t examine the material in detail could mistake it for a piece of AEC communication.” Rogers said the election mainly involved people voting in person so there was no need for the mass distribution of postal ballots. Political parties and members of parliament are exempt from privacy law, meaning voters have no way of knowing what the parties do with any information filled out on the forms. Guardian Australia has seen one such postal vote application form sent out by Liberal minister and ACT senator Zed Seselja, which includes a reply-paid envelope addressed to the Canberra Liberals. The postal vote form itself asks for personal information including name, address, email address, phone number and date of birth, but also asks for a security question and answer used to verify a person, such as town of birth, first employer, last school, or name of child. Independent senator Rex Patrick has called for the exemption in the Privacy Act for political parties to be removed. “More and more the Liberal and Labor parties are running election campaigns supported by ‘big data’ programs based on access to electoral roll information, harvesting of social media data, highly specific economic and financial information, and through partnerships with contracted polling and analytics agencies,” Patrick said. “Yet none of this sensitive personal information is protected by Australia’s national privacy standards because, more than two decades ago, the Liberal, National and Labor parties self-interestedly agreed that they would exempt themselves from the data protection rules that apply to other large companies and organisations.” He said data collection was now on an industrial scale and the volume of data available had grown exponentially in the two decades since the legislation passed. “This amalgamation and correlation of huge quantities of personal data enables the big parties to precisely direct mail campaigns, political texts and emails at individual voters and households,” he said. “Political spam isn’t random, it’s targeted at you using your own data. “And given the richness of the available data, it’s no surprise that foreign intelligence agencies and criminal hackers have been keenly interested in the honeypots of personal information held by Australia’s major political parties.” Patrick said if he was re-elected to the Senate he would introduce a private senator’s bill to amend the Privacy Act to remove the exemption of politicians, political parties and their contractors. Patrick’s former Centre Alliance colleague Nick Xenophon, who is also contesting a spot in the Senate on the South Australia ballot, also tweeted that if elected he would make amendments to the Electoral Act. AEC has today warned political parties and candidates not to mislead voters with their early voting material, some blatantly masquerading as official voting info - where voter details goes to the parties first.This must stop.If elected I’ll move changes to Electoral Act #auspoll Rogers urged those who needed a postal vote for the 21 May election to contact the AEC directly. “Political parties send postal vote applications to residents every election but the increased variation of channels and wording this election, combined with the environment, is of concern,” he said. “Our message couldn’t be clearer – vote in person if you can, apply for a postal vote through us if you need one.” Voters can apply for a postal vote via the AEC’s website, with applications closing on 18 May.",News/Australia news,AEC warns Australian political parties over ‘misleading’ postal vote applications,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/aec-warns-australian-political-parties-over-misleading-postal-vote-applications
4/16/2022,"Organic dairy, for so long the sector’s success story, is facing a crisis of confidence, with fears about whether people will keep buying organic milk, butter and cheese as food prices soar. Some UK organic farmers are being paid a milk price that is lower than the price some of their non-organic competitors get. On-farm costs have been spiralling. Organic feed prices have tripled year on year thanks to high shipping costs dating back to disruption from the pandemic hiking the price of commodities such as organic soy coming from Asia. The sector has recorded little growth in sales in the UK over the past five years. Overall, organic dairy sales are smaller (1% of cheese and 5% of milk) compared with European countries such as France or Germany. In Denmark, more than one-third of milk sales are organic. Retailers say organic milk and dairy is struggling to stand out to consumers, on shelves crammed with a host of new standards and commitments being rolled out by conventional milk brands and producers, such as claims of “free-range” cows. There is also stiff competition from alternative milks, with sales of oat, almond and soy milk rising fast. Unsurprisingly, there have been reports of producers ditching their organic status and moving over to claim a higher milk price as a conventional farmer. “Others will be looking too,” said a dairy farmer at a recent industry event. Tim Downes, an organic dairy farmer in Shropshire, said the difference between milk prices and feed costs was “untenable” at the moment and predicted organic milk buyers would be short of milk soon, with farmers either switching to conventional or producing less. “We’ve got to be positive in our messaging as organic farmers and let consumers know how much effort goes into making organic food,” he said. David Williams, the chief executive of the Organic Milk Suppliers Co-operative, said: “Organic needs to be 10p per litre more [than milk produced by cows in conventional farming systems], but the challenge is convincing our customers’ customers to pick it off the shelf.” The point of difference for organic appears to have been eroded as the dairy sector as a whole commits to many of the initiatives that previously appeared unique to organic, such as eliminating antibiotic use, giving cows access to outdoor grazing and trialling out carbon audits. There is also likely to be a decline in the use of artificial fertiliser by all dairy farmers this year – another key part of organic farming standards – as the cost rises. “You could question what the significant selling point of organic is any more,” said one industry insider this week. “As food prices go up, consumers are driven to keep the cost of their food basket down to whatever they wish to pay. Why should they fork out extra for it?” Williams, whose cooperative represents almost two-thirds of milk produced by organic farmers in the UK, said organic’s selling point was its farmers’ work to protect wildlife and the environment. He said the standards, including not using artificial fertiliser or antibiotics, were certified, with farms audited annually to ensure they comply. However, Williams said organic products and brands needed to do better at selling their credentials. “Organic looks too much like conventional [on the shelf in its current packaging]. We should not be surprised that consumers are not so interested in paying more for it.” In the long-term, organic farmers need to be able to reduce their reliance on imported feed, said Liz Bowles, the farming director at the Soil Association, an organic farming charity. “We need to get more of the animal feed used by farmers from the UK, through greater use of homegrown proteins such as peas and beans and making sure cows are eating mostly a diet from grass and forage,” she said. Dan Burdett, a Sussex-based organic dairy farmer, said the crunch time for many organic farmers would be this autumn and winter when feed usage was higher with less grass growth.“We’ve been organic here on the farm for 22 years [when his father converted from conventional] and I’ve never known anything else myself so it’d be hard for us to switch out now.”",News/Environment,UK organic dairy farmers fear for futures as food prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/16/uk-organic-dairy-farmers-fear-futures-food-prices-soar
4/16/2022,"From the Easter eggs towers by the entrance to the ad hoc bins filled with Lindt Gold Bunnies and Creme Eggs near the checkout, it takes serious willpower to resist buying chocolate in the supermarket at this time of year. This potent cocktail of prime retail space, extra displays and deals will spur Britons to spend some £370m on calorie-laden treats for the long weekend. But this Easter will be a last supper for supermarkets and their suppliers ahead of a clampdown on how foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) are sold in England. In the autumn new laws, part of the government’s anti-obesity strategy, will prohibit thousands of unhealthy products, including chocolate bars, biscuits and crisps being sold from these lucrative pitches. Volume deals such as “buy one get one free” or “3 for 2” on HFSS products will also be banned in what the retail analyst Bryan Roberts describes as the “most significant change to supermarket operations and economics since they were invented”. “There is a reason snacks and confectionery are called impulse foods,” says Roberts. “They are not often on someone’s shopping list but people have got into the habit of picking them up. They rely on visibility for a lot of their sales and that is being taken away. This has big financial implications for retailers and suppliers.” But the government is staring at one of the worst obesity rates in Europe, with two in three UK adults officially overweight or obese in an escalating crisis that costs the NHS £6bn a year and wider society £27bn. The pandemic has also recorded worsening childhood obesity levels in England. In its guidance for retailers, published this month, the government says the promotional environment in supermarkets was part of the problem. It “did not always align with its healthy eating guidelines” and “makes it harder for families to make healthier choices when shopping”. Voluntary programmes by retailers had been “very limited and unsuccessful” at changing the shopping environment, it says. A government ban on junk food advertising online and before 9pm on TV is due to kick in next year. At a time when the soaring cost of living is weighing on households, these volume discounts might appear to be a way to save money but the evidence stacks up against them. They encourage people to buy, and eat more than they intend. Figures from the data firm IRI give an indication of how susceptible shoppers are to these tricks of the retail trade. It estimates the sweeping changes could see sales of HFSS foods – a long list that will capture products including crisps, sweets, chocolate, cakes, crisps, biscuits, pizza and ice-cream – drop by £1.7bn a year. Analysts say that half of all chocolate is sold on promotion. HFSS refers to foods that score four points or more, and drinks that score one or more, on a nutrient scorecard developed by the Food Standards Agency. Points are awarded for the energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium per 100g, and deducted for things like fibre and protein. This means not all products in a category will be affected, with manufacturers able to reformulate products to avoid being penalised – something that happened at speed ahead of the sugar tax in 2018. So what does this shake up mean for the weekly shop? A glimpse of the future can be seen in trials being run byTesco and Sainsbury’s. In the Tesco Extra store in Royston in Hertfordshire, , instead of chocolate, shoppers are greeted with a garden compost promotion and “clubcard price” deals on big whisky and gin (alcohol is not affected by the new rules). Shoppers must go on an Easter egg hunt if they want to buy one. At the all-important aisle ends, the usual selection of chocolate, crisps and soft drinks has been replaced with deals on tea, coffee, tinned fruit and veg, and meal seasoning kits – not to mention calorie-free options such as toilet roll and detergent. Shoppers are also given healthy eating cues as they shop. In the breakfast cereal aisle a sign highlights “low sugar” options such as Weetabix. Elsewhere they are told that tinned beans and veg are a “source of protein”. There is even hope for crisps fans in a section labelled “under 100 calories”. Tesco aims to increase its sales of healthy products, as a proportion of total sales, from 58% today to 65% by 2025. When reporting a doubling of pre-tax profits to more than £2bn this week its chief executive, Ken Murphy, said it was in “good shape” ahead of the new legislation. “We’re really clear on how we’re going to re-merchandise our stores,” he said, adding that it would work with suppliers to reformulate products and make them healthier. The looming changes have opposition from within the food industry at a time when many companies are grappling with soaring costs. Karen Betts, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said it was concerned that in implementing these measures now the government is “only adding to food price inflation”. The rules apply to retailers with more than 50 employees and stores bigger than 2,000 sq ft (186 sq m). Promotions such as “50% off” or “save £1” are still allowed, leaving businesses with some wriggle room. Ignacio Vazquez, a senior manager of healthy markets at ShareAction, which has campaigned to get listed companies, including Tesco and Unilever, to sell healthier food, said the impact of the new rules would depend on whether companies followed the “spirit” as opposed to letter of the law. “Companies make decisions that have an impact on the products we buy and influence our choices,” he said. “This legislation is trying to encourage companies to do things differently so consumers are nudged to buy healthier products rather than spend more money on unhealthy food.”",News/Business,Last rites?

4/16/2022,"The clashing, freshly painted surfaces of Yinka Ilori’s new studio in west London serve as a colour palette for his design team. “I’ll sometimes find them looking around to find tones to apply to projects,” says the British-Nigerian artist and designer. As you step into the space, there’s a strong powder blue on the wall to your left, a just-paler-than-bubblegum pink on the right, verdant green curtains hang from the high ceiling, and mustard yellow graces the floor. The whole setup is playful: objects and artwork pop with pattern wherever you look. “I’m obsessed with Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” says Ilori. “That immersive, dreamy, psychedelic-type space. When people walk in here, they lose their breath, they can’t focus. You step into a different world.” The vibe embodies Ilori’s heritage. “When I go to Nigeria and go to a market, there’s colour everywhere.” Wedged between MOT garages and cash-and- carries in a maze-like industrial estate, this studio is four times the size of Iloris’ previous space. He moved here last October to expand his design practice and accommodate his team of eight. Work was completed in February. Ilori, 35, was born in north London, and spent his childhood in Islington. “Growing up in a Nigerian household, education was very important, but my parents always pushed us to find our passion.” He studied furniture and product design at London Metropolitan University. “When I finished uni, I couldn’t really see any other practice telling stories in a way that I could connect with: that’s what led me to want to start my own.” The studio bursts with designs telling the story of his career. The back wall, which overlooks a meeting room and kitchen, is covered from floor to ceiling with rows of chairs – items that established Ilori’s name in the design world. There are traditional greasy-spoon chairs reupholstered in Nigerian fabric and painted bright blue, chairs fused together to make a single item, and one with its back replaced by a patterned headboard. “They’re precious and personal to me and to people I know,” he says. In 2015, his show If Chairs Could Talk – telling stories through upcycled chairs – was a hit at the London design festival. “I would find these chairs around London, and I’d stack them up in my bedroom (which wasn’t that big), because my mum wasn’t having them in the kitchen. Then I’d take them to my small studio and work on them.” The project was influenced by the Nigerian parables he grew up listening to. “When we sit on a chair, we tell stories, we argue, we cry – we experience so many emotions with this one object,” he says. A piece from the collection was recently acquired by New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. Others can be bought through the studio. Opposite are two washing machines made from Lego. They were part of an installation called The Launderette of Dreams, which he designed through workshops with primary schools in east London last year. More than 200,000 Lego bricks were used to reimagine a community launderette as an electrifying play space. Behind his desk sit three vibrant basketballs: one is in a winning design by a schoolgirl from east London, as part of a competition run by Ilori. It’s an element of a playground redesign he did with local people, which opens later this month to mark the centenary of Becontree, the UK’s biggest council estate. “I grew up on an estate,” he says. “Galleries weren’t a thing we’d go to, but now I’m taking high art – or whatever art – putting it in an estate and saying, ‘You deserve to experience art as well.’ I’m just trying to say art is for everyone.” His dream is to one day have a Yinka Ilori sculpture park. Ilori has transformed nondescript street crossings on Tottenham Court Road with arresting murals in his signature colours and patterns. “I have found people standing in the middle of the road trying to take a selfie, risking their lives,” he says in disbelief. “When you see my work, you can’t control your smile. The energy controls you. I quite like that.” But not everyone is so receptive. The summer before the pandemic, he designed an outdoor pavilion at Dulwich Picture Gallery called the Colour Palace. An MP (whose name Ilori has decided not to disclose) wrote to the architects involved to say it would be better suited to a Lagos shantytown. A common thread in Ilori’s work is joy. “In our Nigerian household, we were brought up to have a positive outlook,” he says. “My mum and dad would always tell us: ‘You’re amazing.’ I try to adopt that in the work I do.” He is influenced by the fabrics his family wore to weddings and church services. A large painting of his grandmother hangs next to the chairs. “What she’s wearing, there’s a sense of pride in that cloth. It could be Swiss voile lace or Ankara fabric, exclusive and rich in colours. Seeing what joy it gave, it was natural for me to bring it into my work.” Because of the public nature of Ilori’s work, the pandemic saw many projects fall away, but new opportunities arose, too. “I couldn’t get to the studio: people weren’t commissioning work,” he says. “Everyone was at home, and people were cooking loads – I was cooking jollof rice and sharing it online with my mates. People started investing in their homes because home had to be a place that was going to bring joy.” We sit at a table covered in jacquard cloth from the homewares collection Ilori designed during lockdown. We drink from enamel tumblers decorated in a retro flower print, and on the kitchen shelves are his mugs with the slogan “Better days are coming, I promise”. Ilori’s favourite pieces in the collection are Tibetan wool rugs with geometric patterns surrounded by a contrasting border. “I’ve just taken one home for myself,” he says, as if owning up to something he shouldn’t have done. “It’s funny,” he says, “because at home I don’t have a lot of my own pieces. It’s more neutral and I use artwork and rugs and bowls to be talking points of colour. My studio is where I’m chaotic and dream, and then my home’s where I might light a candle and chill.” The studio space appealed to Ilori because of its “brutalistness”. He worked with designer Sam Jacob to plan it; the feel is open, with opportunities for privacy. Jacob designed grand, arched red sliding doors with portholes that open on to Ilori’s office in a theatrical Willy Wonka style. The fourth wall of Ilori’s office is a double-layered curtain between him and his team. The first layer is a transparent, pastel-rainbow gauze, designed by Peter Saville for Kvadrat, called Technicolour Flux. Accompanying it, when he needs privacy, is a heavy green curtain. “Everything is movable,” he says. “The fabrics create shapes.” Does he have tips for choosing bold colours for home interiors? “If a colour makes you feel positive,” he says, “trust your gut and apply it. For me, pink is calming.” He admits that at first he regretted the yellow floor, but after a week realised it worked. “My mum and dad had no rulebook. They would clash violet with blue or purple or green, and do it with confidence. I just try to avoid looking at the Pantone colour of the year.” Last month, Ilori ran a workshop for inpatients at a London mental health facility for a charity called Hospital Rooms. “I went in and I didn’t tell them what my work’s about; I just said I was an artist and selected the colour palette for them to use. And they opened up about the things they care about and I had them paint messages on chairs. They actually wrote ‘Hope’ and ‘Dreams’, and I can’t forget that. It touched me – something about my colour palette evokes hope.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Nigeria meets Willy Wonka: inside designer Yinka Ilori’s new studio,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/16/inside-designer-yinka-iloris-new-studio-nigeria-meets-willy-wonka
4/16/2022,"When it comes to the heist film genre, “based on a true story” isn’t an obvious selling point: knotty crime capers tend to be better the more elaborately and imaginatively concocted they are. The Duke (Amazon) is an exception. The last feature directed by the late Roger Michell, it has a daft underdog story that could have been plucked straight from the brain of Richard Curtis, but just happens to be rooted in fact. Even the name of its true-life protagonist sounds fanciful: Kempton Bunton, a working-class pensioner who, in protest against the TV licence fee imposed by the British government, set out to steal Goya’s painting Portrait of the Duke of Wellington from the National Gallery. The reasoning, like many of the plot mechanics here, is better seen than explained. But it makes for a chipper, cheering romp, delightfully performed by Jim Broadbent as Bunton and Helen Mirren as his weary wife, and directed with unassuming, fleet-footed ease by Michell. All in all, it sits on the lightest, brightest end of the heist movie spectrum: there are no unsavoury criminals or grisly outcomes here, just salt-of-the-earth types doing ill-advised deeds with good intentions. Sixty or 70 years ago – indeed, around the time The Duke is set – Michell’s film might have been a gleefully far-fetched Ealing comedy, though it may, admittedly, not endure quite as steadfastly as The Lavender Hill Mob (BritBox). Seven decades old and still perhaps the spryest and most sparkling of all bank-job films, Charles Crichton’s daffily ingenious comedy mixes complex narrative architecture with an endearing sympathy for small Englishmen against the vast capitalist system, while Alec Guinness’s wry, dry performance prevents things from getting too cute. By 2008, that archetype had shifted to the scruffy hard man embodied by Jason Statham, though The Bank Job (Amazon), written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, retraces a lot of The Lavender Hill Mob’s steps with more tight-jawed charm. Over in the US, the heist film has tended to be a smoother, sleeker operation – even when the criminals are goofing off, as in Steven Soderbergh’s glittering comedy Ocean’s Eleven (2001; Netflix), a rare remake that significantly improves on its Rat Pack-era original. At the genre’s most hardboiled you get Stanley Kubrick’s 1956 The Killing (Apple TV+), about the leanest, meanest, most jolting film ever made from the hoary veteran-tries-one-last-job premise. At its most dishevelled, there’s Wes Anderson’s breakthrough film Bottle Rocket (Microsoft), made well before he perfected his cuckoo-clock aesthetic, drawing on mid-90s slacker energy as well as the then-ubiquitous influence of Tarantino’s droll bloodbath Reservoir Dogs (1991; BFI Player). Anderson and Tarantino both, of course, owed a debt to the French New Wave’s louche, cool reshaping of the heist film, as exemplified by Jean-Luc Godard’s gracefully deconstructed anatomy of a robbery Bande à part (1964; Chili). This in turn owed a debt to Jules Dassin’s frosty, elegantly diagrammatic Rififi (1955; Apple TV+), with its intricate, taciturn jewel-heist centrepiece, followed by an exhilarating pileup of malicious human consequences and betrayals. Finally, if men tend to be the driving heroes and villains (often simultaneously) of the heist film, more recent standouts of the genre have shown that women can take them on with some elan. Sebastian Schipper’s jaw-dropping Victoria (2015; Curzon) – thrusting Laia Costa’s naive Berlin waitress into a real-time bank job executed in one dazzling shot – brought female perspective to a chaotically male underworld. F Gary Gray’s Set It Off (Amazon) was a landmark in its depiction of black women in the criminal sphere, its quartet of bank thieves boasting more community-minded motives than most. Twenty six years after its release, it feels as bracing and forward-thinking as ever, since rivalled only by the politically knotty complexities and slam-bang action set pieces of Steve McQueen’s tough, Viola Davis-led Widows (2018; Amazon). Such films all make Kempton Bunton’s modest, if similarly social-minded heist look rather quaint by comparison. Choose or Die(Netflix)After several well-regarded genre shorts, the British team of director Toby Meakins and writer Simon Allen graduate to features with this techno-horror tale of a young coder rebooting an 80s video game with distinctly cursed consequences. Steeped in moodily dim light and early-millennial nostalgia, it feels a little like a stray Black Mirror instalment, but it’s a creepy, well-made calling card. All the Old Knives(Amazon Prime)Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton are former lovers and CIA colleagues, reopening old wounds – personal and professional – over the course of a tense, flashback-filled reunion dinner with urgent stakes. Adapted by American spy fiction writer Olen Steinhauer from his own novel, this isn’t reinventing any wheels, but it’s a glossy, engrossing bit of le Carré lite, buoyed up by fine performances from its well-matched leads. You Are Not My Mother(Amazon)Irish writer-director Kate Dolan debuts with an impressively eerie, emotionally charged horror film hinging on troubled mother-daughter relationships, centred on a withdrawn teen (the remarkable Hazel Doupe) navigating her mum’s wild, possibly supernatural shifts in personality. It’s effective as either an allegorical domestic drama or a straight-up chiller. The Essential Tavernier Boxset(StudioCanal)A year on from his death, the stately, genre-switching French auteur Bertrand Tavernier gets a suitable tribute with this eight-film collection on Blu-ray and DVD. It’s missing some of his great works, but still spans handsome historical drama (Let Joy Reign Supreme, The Princess of Montpensier), political documentary (La guerre sans nom) and, best of all, the mordant noir of his Jim Thompson adaptation Coup de Torchon, with Isabelle Huppert and Philippe Noiret.",Arts/Film,Streaming: The Duke and other great heist movies,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/16/streaming-the-duke-and-other-great-heist-movies
4/16/2022,"I’ve recently put my wedding and engagement rings back on after about 18 months of their hibernating in a cupboard. It wasn’t marital woe that caused me to remove them – but, less distressingly, a manky finger. Early on in the pandemic, my ring finger began to itch, redden and weep to the point where removing my jewellery altogether became unavoidable. I’m another common case of hand dermatitis. According to consultant dermatologist Justine Hextall, the number of patients seeking help for cases of contact dermatitis apparently caused by rings, bracelets, watches, fitness trackers and protective gloves has increased significantly in the past two years (up to 23% of healthcare workers are sufferers). An assumed “allergy” to jewellery is not pandemic-specific, of course, but the fact that hand dermatitis has flourished during Covid gives us clues to its commonly misunderstood causes (an allergy to nickel is not unusual, but if your jewellery is gold, platinum, rhodium, titanium, sterling silver, plastic or silicone, the issue is more likely to be the environment beneath it). According to Hextall, frequent hand-washing plays a big part. “Although repeated use of alcohol hand sanitiser gels will cause dryness and sometimes irritation, the evidence suggests that it’s less likely to cause dermatitis than soap and water,” she says (to add to the dilemma, it’s likely to be more effective against viruses than the gel, so alternating the two methods might be of value in avoiding flare-ups). Trapped moisture plays a part, too. The sheer frequency of my hand-washing meant that I wasn’t always able to take the time to dry the skin under my jewellery thoroughly, and the residual soapy dampness sat there, causing mischief. This is why so many gym-goers who shower in their Apple Watches and Fitbits find themselves with irritated wrists, then conclude they must be allergic to the strap (again, it’s possible, but more likely to be trapped sweat, soap and bacteria). Best practice is to remove the item and clean it thoroughly with an antibacterial wipe, then switch wrists while the affected area recovers. Try not to tighten straps so much that they can’t move a little on your skin; instead allow some air to circulate. After any showering or hand-washing, take an extra moment to dry well under the band, ring or bracelet, and then create a moisture barrier with an unscented glycerin-rich hand cream, like the Justine Hextall-recommended Neutrogena Norwegian Formula (£2.75).",Lifestyle/Fashion,Suspect a jewellery allergy?

4/16/2022,"One of the marquee moments of any US presidential election – the televised debate – has been thrown into doubt by the Republican party’s decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Republican National Committee (RNC) grumbled that the group that has run the debates since 1988 is biased and refuses to enact reforms. It promised to “find newer, better debate platforms” in future. The long-threatened move was proof of the RNC’s continued eagerness to do the bidding of former president Donald Trump, who has endlessly complained about the timing and formats of debates and the choice of moderators. But in a week that also saw the Democratic National Committee resolve that Iowa and New Hampshire are no longer guaranteed to go first in the party’s presidential nominating process, it was also a reminder that seemingly immutable traditions are fragile. The Commission on Presidential Debates was founded in 1987 as a non-profit sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans to codify debates as a permanent part of presidential elections. But it has faced criticism from various quarters. Republicans in particular have complained that it favours Democrats since the Barack Obama v Mitt Romney debates of a decade ago. Trump, as ever, took the grievance to a new level and refused to take part in what was meant to be the second of three debates with Joe Biden in 2020 after the commission made it virtual in the wake of the then president’s coronavirus infection. “He’s got a long-running dispute with the commission,” said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan. “He thinks the composition is a bunch of Never Trumpers and the deck has been stacked against him and they haven’t given him a fair shake. “In some ways it’s a negotiating ploy if this particular commission’s not involved. I think there’s still likely to be some debates but there’s going to be negotiation for timing and location and who the moderator is. So, if he’s the candidate again, it may give him more leverage.” The RNC is chaired by Ronna McDaniel, a Trump loyalist who has proven determined to enforce his will. Earlier this year the RNC censured Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, two Republicans who broke with Trump to sit on the House of Representatives select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Should Trump be the party’s nominee in the 2024 presidential election, McDaniel would no doubt push hard for debates that suit his whims – a potentially tough and complicated negotiation with TV networks, social media companies, thinktanks or other entities. Kall continued: “The Commission on Presidential Debates have been doing it for the last several decades but they weren’t the first one; they won’t be the last one. I don’t think anyone will shed a tear if whatever debates we have in the next cycle are not sponsored by the commission. “But it’ll be kind of the wild west and everyone will want to be involved in a debate. They get tens of millions of viewers. There’s very few events these days, given how bifurcated we are, that command the respect of debates. We have basically the Super Bowl, presidential debates, the inaugural address, the State of the Union – it’s very rare.” The value of debates has been questioned in this highly partisan, fragmented media age. This month Republican Herschel Walker and Democrat John Fetterman skipped primary debates in Georgia and Pennsylvania, respectively. Now the Commission on Presidential Debates may have passed its sell-by date. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, said: “I’m only surprised it took this long. It’s all about Trump, really, but there’s another segment of people who’ve looked at that and the whole system is stale and it’s run by the same people that have been running it for decades. “That’s what I’m kind of torn about. I certainly don’t agree with Trump’s reasoning for doing it but I do think the system needs shaking up. This won’t do it because they’re just trying to avoid tough questions and they won’t want neutral anchors and reporters asking questions. They’re going to want partisans. They want the hosts of Fox’s morning show.” Presidential debates were first made famous by John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960 but were then not held again until 1976. Sabato added: “We actually had 16 years there with no presidential debates until they were restarted because both candidates needed them in 1976. “We thought for a while that it was so well established that candidates couldn’t avoid debates; they’d have to participate. Well, just goes to show, nothing’s permanent. It doesn’t hurt anybody to say no. All they have to do is tell their partisans, ‘This thing is stacked against us. You know how those awful media people are.’”",News/US news, What does Republicans’ break from the presidential debate commission mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/16/republican-party-presidential-debate-commission-withdraw
4/16/2022,"A community group in one of the poorest parts of Bristol has met its funding target to build the tallest wind turbine in England, despite a lack of any central government funding for locally owned wind power generation. The group of residents from Lawrence Weston, a deprived housing estate on the edge of the West Country city, have secured £4m, and expect to begin groundworks for the turbine, which measures 150 metres from its base to the tip of its blade, in June. The wind turbine, which has a maximum capacity of 4.2MW, will sell energy to the grid. The group estimates it will bring in at least £100,000 a year. Mark Pepper, who grew up on the estate and helped found the Ambition Lawrence Weston charity to regenerate the area, said the turbine would make hundreds of thousands of pounds for community projects, including a new renewable energy skills training centre and a crisis fund to help local families trapped in fuel poverty. “The fantastically exciting work begins soon. I feel proud of the residents as there have been a lot of challenges along the way and a lot of barriers put in our way,” he said. “Yet the residents have stayed resolute because they know this could be a gamechanger for Lawrence Weston.” However, he added that the turbine, which will generate enough power for 3,000 homes, had taken eight years to build because the government had made it so difficult to get planning permission and provided no financial support for communities to generate their own power. “The government’s resistance to more onshore wind has been a problem,” he said. “It’s been a long slog but hopefully soon the residents will be able to reap the rewards of all their hard work.” Government research shows community-owned energy delivers 12 to 13 times more social and community benefits than equivalent commercial installations. The profits from the Lawrence Weston scheme will be partly used to help families on the estate unable to heat their homes and keep the lights on as energy prices shoot up. “A lot of residents here are on prepaid meters – if they can’t afford to put money on, they are effectively cut off,” said Pepper. “We see a lot of people running out of gas and electricity.” Other areas are keen to follow Bristol’s lead, with around one-third of the 220 local groups linked to Community Energy England interested in developing similar on-shore wind schemes. But the organisation is only aware of a handful of small-scale community-owned turbines that have been erected in England since David Cameron’s Conservative government tightened planning laws, requiring, unlike other infrastructure projects, proof of local backing, as well as ending financial support. Although wind projects were allowed to apply for subsidies again in 2020, only developers with commercial-scale windfarms were able to meet the minimum energy threshold. The government’s new energy strategy, which was published last week, disappointed many community energy campaigners. There is no ringfenced funding for community projects and no target for increasing on-shore wind power generation, even though it is regarded as the cheapest and quickest way to generate electricity. The strategy only promises to consult with “a limited number of communities” to develop turbine projects in return for lower energy bills. The Lawrence Weston turbine, which will be erected on Bristol city council-owned scrubland in nearby industrial Avonmouth, is expected to be completed next spring. The electricity it generates will be sold to the National Grid. The vast bulk of the funding comes from Thrive Energy, a renewable energy investment company, which provided £4m for the project. Other funders included Bristol city council and the West of England Combined Authority. Andrew Garrad, visiting professor in renewable energy at the University of Bristol, said the turbine would be the “biggest in England”. Garrad, who is on the board of the energy company set up by Ambition Lawrence Weston, added the height and size of the turbine allowed it to catch the maximum amount of wind. “The energy gathered from a wind turbine goes up with the square of the diameter – so if you double the diameter, you get four times the energy,” he said. “And as you go higher, you get more energy because the wind blows more strongly.” A shorter turbine would have been uneconomical . David Tudgey, the project’s development manager, who took the turbine through planning and funding rounds, said: “We had to go for the tallest turbine possible for the site because there are no subsidies available – anything smaller wouldn’t have made enough money to benefit the local community.” Tudgey added that ministers should create a national community energy fund to allow others to copy Lawrence Weston: “Communities up and down the country need help to deliver similar schemes that address fuel poverty and climate change.” Matthew Clayton, managing director at Thrive Renewables, said the funding would enable them to get the turbine built and operational. “Locally owned projects such as these will play a fundamental role in the future energy system, providing clean electricity that will help to reduce bills and generate revenue that can be plugged back into the community,” he said.",News/Environment,Bristol community secures funding to build tallest wind turbine in England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/16/bristol-community-secures-funding-to-build-tallest-wind-turbine-in-england
4/16/2022,"The residents of at least two Cambridgeshire villages say they could have lost thousands of letters after their deliveries mysteriously stopped for almost three weeks. They have been left “hugely frustrated” and say Royal Mail has indicated to them that any missing items will never be delivered and should now be considered lost. At the start of March, people living in Great and Little Eversden – and possibly two other nearby villages – only a few miles from Cambridge, noticed their post had stopped arriving. When they asked Royal Mail for an explanation, they were originally told there were no problems. Six weeks on, they claim the company has, in a series of emails to affected villagers, partly revealed what happened but is refusing to investigate. It seems that after a reorganisation of rounds out of the Cambridge depot, the reliable postwoman who had served their area for years was moved to a new round. Other staff took over, and at that point the deliveries all but dried up. The company has apparently told villagers that an undisclosed amount of post was discovered in a Royal Mail van after an employee had “withheld mail from delivery”, and that this member of staff had been dismissed. It also said: “Any items posted that have not reached you, we would have to assume have not made it to the Cambridge unit and have been mislaid in the network.” The South Cambridgeshire MP, Anthony Browne, has written to the company asking for a full investigation after receiving “a disappointing response”– but to no avail. “All the way through this, Royal Mail has been deliberately opaque,” said Susan Tacq, a retired academic, who is one of those trying to find out what has happened to their missing post. “We had one letter delivered to our home over the three-week period but have been told by the company that all our mail has been delivered. Across the village, bank statements, credit card bills, birthday cards and letters that we don’t know about have all seemingly disappeared into thin air.” She says one villager had a parking ticket notification that failed to arrive and had to pay the full £90 fine as a result. Another’s mammogram test results didn’t arrive, while a third villager’s new passport failed to turn up. Online orders have gone missing for items such as contact lenses, leaving the community very frustrated. “The Royal Mail CEO’s office has told us that any items posted that have not reached us must have been mislaid in the network. This is simply not credible. It might feasibly explain the loss of a few items of post. The loss of nearly three weeks’ mail to about 330 households, thousands of items, cannot all have been ‘mislaid in the network’. If they were, then Royal Mail is in even worse straits than this episode suggests. The company has said it won’t investigate – but why not?” she asks. The villagers are the latest community to complain that their post has stopped, although in most cases the backlog is eventually delivered. Residents in more than 120 postal districts across the country reported poor service over the Christmas and new year period. Meanwhile, Royal Mail received more than 1m complaints from householders last year, the highest level for a decade. Only a few days ago it increased the price of a first-class stamp by 10p to 95p. Royal Mail sent Guardian Money a statement that did not appear to address some of the aspects of this curious saga, and which – contrary to what the villagers are saying – seemed to suggest that the matter had all been resolved. It said: “On this occasion a route revision in late February caused some delays to deliveries in the villages of Eversden, Harlton and Haslingfield. We are very sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused to our customers and have now resolved the issues that caused these delays, and have delivered any mail that was outstanding from the period in question. We have restored our service locally to its normal high standard. Anyone who has concerns over the delivery of their mail should contact the Royal Mail customer service team on 03457 740 740 or via the Royal Mail website www.royalmail.com.”",Lifestyle/Money,Villagers frustrated after Royal Mail deliveries stop for almost three weeks,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/16/villagers-frustrated-after-royal-mail-deliveries-stop-for-almost-three-weeks
4/16/2022,"Anthony Albanese has attacked Scott Morrison for blaming a lack of Labor support as the reason he couldn’t legislate his proposed anti-corruption commission, saying the argument “fails the laugh test”, as the federal opposition defended their rocky start to the election campaign. On Saturday, as Labor unveiled a commitment to legislate a national anti-corruption commission by the end of 2022 if elected, both the prime minister and opposition leader faced questions over their ideal model for an integrity body, with Albanese suggesting Labor’s version would be stronger than the Coalition’s proposal that was widely panned and opposed by some government MPs. Campaigning in Cairns on Saturday, Albanese suggested that the Morrison government’s lack of progress on a federal anti-corruption watchdog – a promise it made at the previous election but did not deliver – was due to a fear its own recent scandals could come under further scrutiny. “We know the reason why Scott Morrison doesn’t have a national anti-corruption commission is sitting on his frontbench,” Albanese said. “The fact that there have been so many integrity issues raised against minister after minister.” Albanese listed “the sport rorts affair, the commuter car parks affair”, as well as “issues like the correspondence that was dropped out from Angus Taylor’s office about Clover Moore”, “the purchase of land worth $3m where the government paid $30m for it” and the decision to give $444m to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation without a tender process as reasons why Morrison did not want the watchdog. “It’s very clear that not only has Scott Morrison failed to legislate for one, not only has he failed to introduce legislation, he’s now saying somehow, once again, in perhaps the greatest underlining element of Scott Morrison’s characteristic of always looking to blame someone else, somehow, it’s the Labor party’s fault that he hasn’t introduced legislation for a national anti-corruption commission. “It fails the laugh test. But it also fails the integrity test.” Albanese said his vision for an anti-corruption commission to be legislated by the end of the year would be one “with teeth, one that has independent, investigative powers”. “It is one that will be real, as opposed to their model that has been rejected by everyone.” Asked about how he would deal with any Labor politicians who faced charges from a future commission, he said “of course, they should stand aside”. Albanese said that under his model “there would be scope for public hearings, if the anti-corruption commission itself felt that was necessary” and said investigations could be retrospective as “it would be a matter for them [the commission itself]”. The Coalition’s model is a commission that would not conduct public hearings or release reports into alleged corruption by public servants and politicians. The model has been panned by experts. Morrison, speaking after visiting a lolly shop in Melbourne, said he would try to implement the same model for an integrity commission in the next term of parliament, but that he would ultimately “need the support of the parliament” to do so. He called his plan for an integrity commission “detailed legislation” that spans 300 pages, and said Labor’s plan was a “two-page fluff sheet”. Morrison echoed criticisms of New South Wales’ Independent Commission Against Corruption that he made in recent days – when he likened the body to a kangaroo court – and said his vision for a federal counterpart would not “seek to judge people before they’re able to have their matters properly considered”. Meanwhile, the opposition treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, also responded to news reports citing anonymous Labor insiders and MP claiming morale within the party had deteriorated after the first week of the election campaign. “Of course, we are match-fit,” Chalmers said. “We are up for the challenge of getting this country a better future under Labor and providing the kind of alternative that people are proud to vote for.” Asked if the Labor campaign was a “shitshow”, as one anonymous Labor MP is reported as describing it, Chalmers said “it is not my experience of this campaign”. “My experience is that, all around Australia, there is an appetite for something better than this current government,” he said. “People are hurting because their wages are not keeping up the cost of living. That is what people are focused on. And that is what the Labor party is focused on.”",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese says PM’s broken federal Icac promise ‘fails the laugh test’ as Chalmers defends Labor campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/anthony-albanese-says-pms-broken-federal-icac-promise-fails-the-laugh-test-as-chalmers-defends-labor-campaign

4/16/2022,"He has long held that the true measure of a man is his TV ratings. So perhaps it came as no surprise when Donald Trump endorsed a celebrity doctor for a US Senate seat in Pennsylvania. “They liked him for a long time,” Trump said of Mehmet Oz at a rally in Pennsylvania last week. “That’s like a poll. You know, when you’re in television for 18 years, that’s like a poll. That means people like you.” Trump stunned his own party by his decision to back Oz, who is struggling in the real polls and far from certain to win the Republican primary. It was one among dozens of risky bets placed by Trump on extreme candidates. The upcoming primaries – votes in states and districts to decide which Republicans will take on Democrats in November’s midterm elections – are shaping up to be a referendum on his dominance of the party. Next month could be pivotal. Defeat for Oz by David McCormick in Pennsylvania on 17 May, followed by defeat for Trump-backed David Perdue against incumbent governor Brian Kemp in Georgia a week later, could deal a huge blow to Trump’s status as party kingmaker. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “Donald Trump is like a reckless gambler that’s gone into a casino and put his stack of money on one number. Right now the roulette wheel is turning and, if he’s wrong on a number of these, you’re going to see increasing defiance. “It’s almost certain that the growing sentiment among Republican leadership that Trump’s day has come and gone will be reinforced this year. He’s put his political capital on the line in so many races. A more seasoned politician would have been a little more judicious, a little more careful on these close races.” A string of primary losses for Trump’s picks could also puncture the aura of inevitability around him as party standard bearer in the race for the White House in 2024, encouraging potential rivals such as Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida. Jacobs added: “There are definitely some Republicans looking at the presidential nomination who are ready to take on Trump, particularly if they see him as weakening. That is the orientation of a lot of the Republican leaders. They would like to see Trump quietly drift off into the past. Like so much about Trump, he’s refusing to go along and wants to still be a player.” Never before has a US president left office only to continue barnstorming the country with campaign rallies and insert himself so aggressively into congressional elections. Why Trump is so willing to jeopardise his brand – and how he would respond to being given a bloody nose by Republican voters – remains a matter of conjecture. One evident motive is to install loyalists who pass the litmus test of supporting his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen by Joe Biden. Trump is laying the groundwork for purveyors of “the big lie” to take control of election machinery across the country. Allan Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University in Washington, said: “He’s interested in shaping the party, endorsing those who he thinks support him and his approach to politics, and he’s also trying to put into place in some key swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia folks that he thinks can help him steal the next election if he runs.” There are also financial incentives. Trump’s Save America group, responsible for countless fundraising events and emails, netted a massive $124m between November 2020 and March 2022 while spending only about $14m, or about 11%, to support midterm candidates, according to an analysis by the Reuters news agency. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “This has become a business for Trump. As his other businesses either get sold or dry up or are subject to lawsuits or criminal investigation, he’s still continuing to raise a lot of money and he gets to support his lifestyle through all of these activities.” She added: “Second, he’s trying to build local bases of support in swing states. If he does decide to run, these are all people who will be part of county and state political organisations. They’ll be people who are going to vote in those primaries in the Republican party, so the more contacts he makes at the local level, the better positioned he will be.” A procession of Republican aspirants have beaten a path to Trump’s luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in the hope of joining the anointed ones. They run the gamut from shoo-ins to too-close-to-call to genuine underdogs. On Friday evening, Trump announced his endorsement of JD Vance, author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy, for a fiercely competitive Senate primary in Ohio. “Like some others, JD Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,” the ex-president explained. He is also all-in for Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential nominee, who is far from guaranteed to win a vacant House seat in her home state. “Sarah shocked many when she endorsed me very early in 2016, and we won big,” Trump stated. “Now, it’s my turn!” But perhaps the climactic primary battle will come in Wyoming in August when congresswoman Liz Cheney, who has come to personify the party’s anti-Trump resistance, is challenged for a House seat by pro-Trump Harriet Hageman. Cheney has huge name recognition in the state and is raising vast sums of money. Some of Trump’s endorsements have already backfired. In the Pennsylvania Senate race – potentially critical to determining which party controls the chamber – he initially backed Sean Parnell, only for the candidate to drop out amid spousal abuse allegations. Trump’s subsequent decision to support Oz, reportedly encouraged by Trump’s wife, Melania, and Fox News host Sean Hannity, carries liabilities of its own. The host of the syndicated The Dr Oz Show is described by critics as a snake oil salesman. In 2014 he admitted to Congress that some of the products promoted on his show lacked “scientific muster”. Another setback occurred in Alabama, where Trump retracted his endorsement of congressman Mo Brooks in a Senate race, claiming that Brooks “made a horrible mistake” when he told supporters to put the 2020 election behind them. Most observers suspect the real reason was that polls show Brooks heading for defeat. Trump’s win-loss record is sure to be studied hard by pundits. Yet if past is prologue, it would not be hard to imagine him dismissing defeats in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wyoming and elsewhere as the fault of weak candidates or rigged elections, while claiming primary victories as his own. Frank Luntz, a pollster and political consultant, said, “I don’t think it’s risky for him because he doesn’t acknowledge losing: if they win, they win because of him; if they lose, they lost because of their own failure.” He added: “He’s not as popular today as he was a year ago. The sheen is not as bright but he’s still the most impactful Republican by far and his endorsement does mean something. I understand why candidates really want it, but they have to think about it: what gets you the nomination in Pennsylvania will cost you the election.” Trump has been written off countless times before. But at February’s Conservative Political Action Conference, he received more votes in a straw poll for the 2024 nomination than all other Republicans combined. So would a sprinkling of primary defeats truly break the fever? Reed Galen, cofounder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: “Some people will say that; more people might even want to believe it. The chattering class of both parties in Washington DC, starting with [Senator Mitch] McConnell on the Republican side, will read those tea leaves that way. “But it doesn’t make it true because, ultimately, Trump making an endorsement of someone versus Trump being on the ballot – the majority of those primary voters are going to come back to him if he decides to run again.” DeSantis and other would-be contenders should therefore not leap to conclusions, Galen added. “I would tend to agree with the idea that there would be a weakness perceived by potential challengers in 2024,” Galen said. “It may embolden them. I do not believe that equation adds up to them beating him in a primary.”",News/US news,Will Trump’s ‘reckless’ endorsements be a referendum on his political power?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/16/trump-endorsements-referendum-political-power
4/16/2022,"Each month, Mayra Del Toro counts every penny of the $403 she receives from the state of Pennsylvania. It is the majority of her income – but, with inflation at the highest level since 1981, more difficult to stretch than ever before. “I only have [what is] necessary for the kids,” said the 38-year-old mother of five. “Every single cent that I take, I just keep in the pocket for only the necessary – the bills, the gas and the stuff that my kids need.” Even for a naturally industrious woman like Del Toro – who worked 12 hours a day and six days week at a furniture manufacturing plant and earned the nickname “the monster” for her work ethic – making ends meet has become an all-consuming task. When the pandemic hit, she drove for DoorDash while nursing a newborn, but the work was boom and bust and she had to rely on her children to help with deliveries. So Del Toro joined a dwindling number of Americans reliant on the only national cash assistance program left in the US, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tanf), colloquially known as welfare. But, even before inflation reached an astronomical 8.5% in February 2022, decades of moderate price growth had eroded what Tanf payments could buy. Pennsylvania is a particularly good example of how lawmakers have allowed the program to languish. The maximum welfare payment of $403 – the amount that Del Toro receives – has not increased since 1990. Over that time, it has lost more than half its purchasing power to inflation, according to the Coalition for Low-Income Pennsylvanians. Now, families living in deep poverty face the fastest rise in prices seen in generations – with little or no support. The Childhood Tax Credit, part of pandemic relief measures, temporarily halved the US child poverty rate by distributing $3,600 tax credits in monthly installments, including to very low-income families, but Democrats were unable to agree on terms to renew it and the program lapsed at the beginning of 2022. “Tanf grants are, in most states, not adequate for people to meet their basic needs – [and] were inadequate before inflation started to be as big an issue as it is now,” said Donna Pavetti of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Recipients, she said, “are being asked to stretch dollars that were already stretched – and you can only stretch things so far.” Rent, gas and food prices are particularly volatile – but “basic necessities” such as clothes, shelter, energy and medical care were already rising faster than inflation, according to a 2014 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “We see our families not being able to get by on this amount of money, and it gets worse and worse and worse,” said Louise Hayes, supervising attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia (CLS). “Rental assistance programs in Philly have run out of money. There are no programs for diapers or sanitary products, [food stamps are] inadequate to pay for food.” Pandemic unemployment assistance, which provided an additional few hundred dollars a week, ran out last September. “Without this income families may be forced to stay with abusive men,” said Hayes, noting that Tanf recipients are overwhelmingly likely to be households headed by single women – a large proportion of whom are domestic violence survivors. CLS wants to increase welfare payments in Pennsylvania for the first time in 33 years. They have been fighting for decades, Hayes said, and recently joined a diverse group of direct aid organizations to push lawmakers. “This is a rock we’ve been pushing up a hill for a very long time.” The effort dates back almost to 1996, when President Bill Clinton created the Tanf program by totally restructuring welfare. States were given control over most aspects of cash assistance programs and, as a tradeoff, federal funds were changed from open-ended aid programs to fixed annual amounts, called block grants. The amount of federal aid has not changed since 1996 – in part because the program was never pegged to inflation. And state control meant the programs were vulnerable to the local political climate. This is evident in the conservative south, which has the most punitive and low-paying programs in the country. In Arkansas, for example, a family of three can receive a maximum of just $204 a month. The low payments and invasive eligibility criteria – including drug tests – have driven away applicants over the decades. Nationally, Tanf now reaches only 21 families with children for every 100 living in poverty, compared with its predecessor program, which reached 68 for every 100, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Some states don’t even spend the money they’re given. Pennsylvania, for example, has stashed away millions in unspent Tanf aid: as of 2020, Pennsylvania had $410m in unobligated Tanf reserves, according to the Congressional Research Service. “I have constituents that need these benefits, but this program has not modernized in a way that has allowed it to actually meet the needs people have right now,” said Democratic Pennsylvania state representative Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents parts of Philadelphia. “My family was one of the working poor families that would benefit from this program. I know in a very intimate way what would happen when the government doesn’t work – in an intimate way.” Kenyatta is sponsoring a bill to increase maximum Tanf grant amounts, tie them to inflation and release unspent dollars to those in need. Meanwhile, cash assistance has come under renewed attack by conservatives and at least one powerful Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin. Senator Rick Scott, the chair of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, has criticized government income supports while also promoting a tax increase for 80% of families earning less than $54,000 a year, the New York Times reported. Speaking to a recent Heritage Foundation event, Scott said, “I’m focused on the people that can go to work and decided to be on a government program and not participate in this,” wrongly arguing that most recipients of government benefits do not work. Cash aid programs have, in fact, had work requirements for decades. Del Toro is one of the rare recipients who has been allowed to attend school while receiving benefits. She is studying for a two-year degree in social work at a community college in Reading, Pennsylvania, and expects to graduate next year. Meanwhile, she encourages other people on Tanf. “Sometimes, they just cry, and don’t know what they can do,” she said. She tells them, “They can have anything that they want. Just wait and believe. Work for that.”",News/Politics,‘You can only stretch so far’: how inflation has gutted welfare,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/16/tanf-welfare-inflation-pennsylvania-us
