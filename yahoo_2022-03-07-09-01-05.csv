3/7/2022,"By Hallie Gu and Shivani Singh BEIJING (Reuters) -The condition of China's winter wheat crop could be the ""worst in history"", the agriculture minister said on Saturday, raising concerns about grain supplies in the world's biggest wheat consumer. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the country's annual parliament meeting, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said that rare heavy rainfall last year delayed the planting of about one-third of the normal wheat acreage. A survey of the winter wheat crop taken before the start of winter found that the amount of first- and second-grade crop was down by more than 20 percentage points, Tang said. ""Not long ago we went to the grassroots to do a survey and many farming experts and technicians told us that crop conditions this year could be the worst in history,"" he said. ""This year's grain production indeed faces huge difficulties."" The minister's comments underscore concerns about China's grain supply at the same time as the war between Russia and Ukraine, which together account for about 29% of global wheat exports, has disrupted supplies causing wheat prices to surge to 14-year highs. However, Tang is confident China can ensure a bumper harvest of summer grain thanks to strong policy and technical support and the improving crop condition for the grain. Fuelled by the Ukraine crisis, wheat prices in China soared to a record this week on existing domestic supply worries. Tang's comments also come as Beijing has refocused on food security, a long-standing priority for the central leadership that has become increasingly prominent in policy since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020. China's state planner said in its own report at the parliament meeting that grain supply remains tight, despite consecutive good harvests in recent years. To address the issue, the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) report said China will ensure that grain acreage for the year stays above 117.33 million hectares (289.93 million acres). China will also increase the production of soybeans and other oilseed crops, the NDRC said, reiterating top policy priorities in the farm sector. The country will also build up momentum to increase corn output, it said. China's corn imports surged to a record last year, amid soaring domestic prices and low inventories. China will guarantee the supply-demand balance of grain, edible oil, cotton, sugar and fertilisers through the effective use of reserves and imports, the NDRC said. China will allocate 41.639 billion yuan ($6.59 billion) in subsidies in 2022 for agricultural insurance premiums, up 30.8% from a year earlier, the finance ministry said in another report. At the start of the parliament meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said China will ensure key agricultural product supplies this year, including grains. Everyone must work together to ensure that the country’s ""rice bag"" and ""vegetable basket"" are well-filled, and that we have a secure food supply for the people, Li said. China will stop any attempts to use cropland for any purpose other than agriculture and specifically grain production, to safeguard the area of farmland, and revitalise the seed industry at a faster pace, Li said in the government work report. Li also said China will see that hog production is better regulated and ensure the production and supply of livestock, poultry and aquatic products and vegetables. China's massive pig herd was decimated by the deadly African swine fever disease, sending pork prices to record highs and increasing consumer prices. China quickly rebuilt its pig herd to normal levels since then, according to official data, but stabilizing production and prices has become a major focus for the government.

3/7/2022,"By Wayne Cole SYDNEY (Reuters) - Oil prices soared more than 10% in hectic trading on Monday as the risk of a U.S. and European ban on Russian product and delays in Iranian talks triggered what was shaping up as a major stagflationary shock for world markets. The euro extended its slide and commodities of all stripes were on the rise as the Russian-Ukraine conflict showed no sign of cooling. Russia calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation"", saying it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. Brent was quoted $12.73 higher at $130.84, while U.S. crude rose $9.92 to $125.60. The potential blow to global economic growth saw S&P 500 stock futures drop 1.1%, while Nasdaq futures shed 1.4%. Futures for Japan's Nikkei were trading around 300 points below the cash close on Friday, while U.S. Treasury futures jumped 10 ticks as investors sought safe-havens. Having climbed 21% last week, Brent crude was further energised by the risk of a ban of Russian oil by the United States and Europe. ""If the West cuts off most of Russia's energy exports it would be a major shock to global markets,"" said BofA chief economist Ethan Harris. He estimates the loss of Russia's 5 million barrels could see oil prices double to $200 a barrel and lower economic growth globally. And it is not just oil, with commodity prices having their strongest start to any year since 1915, says BofA. Among the many movers last week, nickel rose 19%, aluminium 15%, zinc 12%, and copper 8%, while wheat futures surged 60% and corn 15%. That will only add to the global inflationary pulse with U.S. consumer price data this week expected to show annual growth at a stratospheric 7.9%, and the core measure at 6.4%. All of which complicates the policy picture for the European Central Bank when it meets this week. ""Given the potential for stagflation is very real, the ECB is likely to maintain maximum flexibility with its asset purchase programme at 20 billion euros through Q2 and potentially beyond, thus effectively pushing out the timing of rate hikes,"" said Tapas Strickland, an economist at NAB. ""Higher CPI forecasts, though, mean rate hikes will be needed on the horizon."" The near-term prospect of a more dovish ECB combined with safe-haven flows to drive German 10-year bond yields down a huge 32 basis points last week, while U.S. yields dropped 23 basis points to 1.738%. With the outlook for European growth darkening, the single currency took a beating and fell 3% last week to its lowest since mid-2020. It was last down 0.6% at $1.0864 and risked testing its 2020 trough around $1.0635. The dollar was broadly firmer, supported in part by a strong payrolls report which only reaffirmed market expectations for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve this month. The dollar index was last at 98.812 having climbed 2.3% last week. Gold benefited from its status as one of the oldest of safe harbours and was last up 0.7% at $1,983 an ounce.

3/7/2022,"A financial research company has raised eyebrows by saying there is a 10pc chance of civilisation being destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse – while urging clients to keep buying shares regardless. BCA Research, a Canadian business, told clients to “stay bullish” on stocks and “largely ignore existential risk” as their investments will become “irrelevant” if the Ukraine crisis leads to nuclear armageddon.

It put the chance of a civilisation-destroying nuclear war in the next 12 months at an “uncomfortably high” one-in-10, as tensions between Russia and the West escalate.

Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA, wrote: “Despite the risk of nuclear war, it makes sense to stay constructive on stocks over the next 12 months.

“If an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] is heading your way, the size and composition of your portfolio becomes irrelevant. Thus, from a purely financial perspective, you should largely ignore existential risk.”

He concluded: “The risk of Armageddon has risen dramatically. Stay bullish on stocks over a 12-month horizon.”

The Kremlin has put Russia’s nuclear forces – the largest in the world – on “high alert” and has argued that Nato’s onslaught of financial sanctions are “akin to an act of war”.

Global stock markets tumbled last week as Vladimir Putin doubles down on the invasion of Ukraine.

The FTSE 100 suffered its worst week since March 2020, when the pandemic first struck with the rout wiping more than £130bn off the UK’s blue-chip shares. Mr Berezin said: “If Putin concludes that he has no future, the risk is that he will decide that no one else should have a future either.”

BCA warned that markets could experience a “freak-out moment” over the next few weeks even if World War III is ultimately avoided.

Defence secretary Ben Wallace has played down the threat of nuclear war, saying Mr Putin is touting his arsenal in a “battle of rhetoric”.

Mr Wallace said last week: “This is predominantly about Putin putting it on the table just to remind people, remind the world, that he has a deterrent.""",World/The Telegraph•13 hours ago,"One-in-10 chance of nuclear apocalypse ‘but keep buying shares’, says investment firm",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-10-chance-nuclear-apocalypse-112144416.html

3/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Equity markets have come round to the idea that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could have long-term consequences for the global economy. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: U.K. Premier Says More Pressure Needed on Putin Putin’s Ruble Workaround Still Leaves Bond Payments in Doubt Ukraine Update: Netflix, TikTok Join Exodus of Firms From Russia Putin Warns Ukraine as Safe-Passage Plans Descend Into Chaos The U.S. Can Turn Europe Into Putin's Nightmare European stocks slumped at the end of the week and are at the lowest in a year as the sweeping measures slapped on Russia disrupt trade with one of the world’s main suppliers of key commodities, especially energy. U.S. stocks also declined, though by far less, reflecting the more limited exposure to Russia. The latest moves mark a turnaround from the early reaction to the assault on Ukraine. An initial drop in stocks after the war started was followed by a rally, helped by a “buy the dip” mentality and speculation that central banks would back off on interest-rate hikes. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. pushed the idea of short-lived pain and that history pointed to the emergence of buying opportunities. The contrast between hopeful markets and the messages from politicians was stark, but any optimism is crumbling as the Russian attacks intensify. And far from being temporary, it’s more likely that sanctions will be sustained and possibly strengthened, exacerbating the pressure on countries already struggling to contain seemingly unstoppable inflation. “It is interesting that the market did not believe that the war would start a month ago, then we did not believe that it would escalate past Donetsk and Luhansk, so, it is a bit of a denial trade,” says Marija Veitmane, senior strategist at State Street Global Markets. Europe’s Stoxx 600 Index fell 3.6% on Friday, capping its worst week since the early days of the pandemic in 2020. The S&P 500 slipped 0.8%, a fourth decline in five days. The shock of the war -- Russia had repeatedly denied it would invade despite its troop build-up -- has catapulted commodity prices from gas and oil to wheat and aluminum to fresh records. That’s increasing a squeeze on companies and households, with damaging implications for investment, spending and growth. So great is the threat, particularly for Europe, that the specter of stagflation has re-emerged. “Beyond energy there is the risk of shocks to other commodities given global linkages for all types of input chemicals,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “So far, however, these issues remain contained and are likely to be manageable if the conflict and resultant production issues are short lived. If it stretches on, the ripple effects will be significant.” In addition, the conflict may signal the start of a fundamental decoupling between Russia, one of the world’s major energy and commodity producers, and Europe and the U.S. Diplomats and European Union officials in Brussels say that even if military operations in Ukraine conclude and Vladimir Putin’s armies prevail, this will only reinforce the sanctions targeting Russia’s central bank as well as its lenders and industrial champions. Sanctions will be eased only if Putin reaches a consensual compromise with the government of Ukraine, a scenario that appeared, as of Friday, unlikely. For Dimitris Valatsas, chief economist at Greenmantle, the best historical analogy is the oil rally, inflation spike and demand destruction that followed the collapse of Iranian production in the late 1970s. “With wholesale gas prices nearly 10 times higher than they were a year ago and crude oil prices nearly double, the European household will take a heavy hit to disposable income,” he said. “This will depress consumption more broadly and thus hurt companies with European consumer exposure.” By some measures, the gloom is more pronounced than it appears from the moves seen immediately after the outbreak of the war. Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, noted that euro-area stocks are now trading at a 25% discount to consensus analyst targets, “a level of distrust only previously seen in the U.S. sub-prime crisis, the euro debt crisis and the early days of the pandemic.” But not all sectors have suffered. European renewable energy stocks surged as much as 24% and the likes of Vestas Wind Systems A/S rallied amid expectations that the invasion will cement Europe’s political will to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Similarly, defense stocks soared as Germany reacted to Russia’s aggression with a pledge to reverse decades of restraint in military spending. Miners and energy are now the only sectors which have posted gains this year in the Stoxx 600, a wager that the commodities rally will continue. So where can investors put their money? “High quality companies that provide sustainable dividends,” says Peron at Janus Henderson. “While inflation is generally challenging for markets in that it compresses margins, lowers multiples, and elevates the risk of more aggressive central bank policy, on a relative basis, sectors with pricing power typically outperform.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The End of the Oligarch Era Nears With Putin’s Miscalculation in Ukraine Elite International Schools Have a Racism Problem The Bond King’s Genius Was No Match for His Ego Flight Routes Are Being Thrown Into Chaos With Closure of Russian Airspace A Billionaire’s Heir Hangs Up His Healing Crystal to Fix Capitalism ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Stock Market’s ‘Denial Trade’ on Russian Invasion Is Buckling,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-denial-trade-russian-073000265.html
3/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Every year over the past two decades, in the good times and the bad, there’s been one sure-fire trend in Wall Street money management: Vanguard tightens its grip on the ETF market. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: U.K. Premier Says More Pressure Needed on Putin Putin’s Ruble Workaround Still Leaves Bond Payments in Doubt Ukraine Update: Netflix, TikTok Join Exodus of Firms From Russia Putin Warns Ukraine as Safe-Passage Plans Descend Into Chaos The U.S. Can Turn Europe Into Putin's Nightmare But now the John Bogle-founded giant is squeezing the $6.8 trillion industry harder than ever, by ramping up the fee war across a line-up of funds that is already raking in most of the billions flowing into the market. Late last month, almost unnoticed, Vanguard said it had slashed charges on another 10 exchange-traded funds. That’s in a suite of 82 U.S.-listed ETFs, which have already absorbed about $58 billion this year -- more than all 2,817 competing funds combined. Coming on top of the firm’s record-shattering $328 billion haul in 2022, those flows put Vanguard on course to surpass Larry Fink’s BlackRock Inc. as the largest ETF manager within the next two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence -- upsetting a world order that has held since 2003. In the process the Malvern, Pennsylvania-based firm is accelerating the takeover of stock index funds -- a development Bogle himself warned created hidden dangers -- while driving smaller issuers to offer ever-more niche and risky strategies to survive. Vanguard “could put up a loss-leader because they have scale in other places,” said Jillian DelSignore, managing director and head of ETFs at FLX Distribution, a fintech platform for the asset-management industry. “If you are a one or two or even 10 ETF shop and you’re new, you can’t do that. You can’t have margins that look like that.” Of the record $900 billion poured into the U.S. ETF industry in 2021, roughly one-in-every-three dollars went to Vanguard’s mostly passive, dirt-cheap products. So far this year it’s more than one in two. In January, as rate fears drove an equity selloff, the firm lured $22 billion -- dragging the entire ETF industry to net inflows of $17 billion. Perhaps because it’s not yet the biggest issuer, or because it’s a champion of bringing low-cost investing to the masses, Vanguard’s rampant growth has received limited criticism. But regulators began fretting the size of firms like Vanguard and BlackRock -- which manage more than $17 trillion combined -- long before the latest growth spurt. Writing in 2018 shortly before his death, Bogle also warned that concentrated index-fund ownership of corporate America may not be in the national interest. The booming ETF market is feeding this process, with Vanguard increasingly leading the way. The firm’s share of U.S. ETF assets grew to 29.3% last year, the 20th straight year of growth. Industry incumbent BlackRock’s piece of the pie slipped to 34.6% -- its third consecutive year of losing ground. “Our intention is to reduce fees across the board -- much like we have in the past,” said Rich Powers, Vanguard’s head of ETF and index product management, in an interview. “How does that manifest in individual products? If you look at our history, we’ve been very consistent in doing that across our ETF lineup.” The average cost across Vanguard’s 82-fund lineup -- which spans both actively and passively managed funds across stocks and fixed income -- is only 9 basis points, meaning an investor would pay just $9 to invest $10,000 for a year. Its biggest product, the $278 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (ticker VTI), charges just 3 basis points. That compares to an average 53 basis points for all U.S. ETFs. Silver Lining There’s a silver lining, of sorts, for Vanguard’s rivals. The firm accounts for almost 30% of the market by assets and claimed a third of ETF flows last year. But it took just 5% of revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence calculations. That shows at least some competitors are generating outsized revenue compared to their market share. The ongoing Vanguard-driven fee war is driving down the absolute amount issuers can charge for each fund, however, which could be reducing profitability. Meanwhile, the relentless flow into big, established and dirt-cheap passive vehicles makes entering the market a challenging task. Around a quarter of all U.S. products launched in the past two years, but they command just 2.5% of assets. To survive, new and small issuers are launching active strategies, often chasing risky markets beloved by the day-trading army including Bitcoin and speculative technologies. Last year, for the first-time ever, active ETF launches outnumbered passive, and the trend has continued -- of the 29 ETFs that began trading in January, just nine were passive products. In a world where Vanguard and BlackRock firmly command the bulk of incoming cash to passive products, DelSignore expects indie issuers to dive ever deeper into the world of thematic and active funds. “The passive ship has largely sailed,” she said. Key to Vanguard’s flow success is a unique ownership structure that allows the index-fund champion to charge rock-bottom fees. Its ETFs are a share class of its mutual funds, where fund investors elect board members, who are in turn charged within making decisions about the company’s products. In a typical corporate ownership structure, any extra cash or assets generated by a firm might be returned to shareholders through dividend payments or the like. But for Vanguard, that money is typically funneled toward lowering fees, as there’s no “inherent tension between the owners and investors,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas. “The people who own the company are the funds’ investors, ultimately, and their goal is to keep more of the money,” senior ETF analyst Balchunas said. “No one’s copied this structure because there’s no incentive to, but the rest of the industry has to follow it.” That includes not only new issuers, but big, established players too. In December, Vanguard lowered fees across 17 products including almost a dozen ETFs, many in fixed-income. That countered a move from rival State Street Global Advisors, who went another notch lower in February. Charles Schwab and BlackRock followed suit with similar cuts. The composition of ETF assets explains why. Nearly 60% of the $6.8 trillion invested in U.S. ETFs is held in funds that charge 10 basis points or less, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Powers at Vanguard pushes back on the idea the firm is choking competitors, highlighting that its ETFs represent a tiny fraction of the total. “It just happens that we have great products that are core products in many portfolios,” he said. “There are countless new issuers in the market. There’s plenty of room for others to bring high-quality, viable products.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The End of the Oligarch Era Nears With Putin’s Miscalculation in Ukraine Elite International Schools Have a Racism Problem The Bond King’s Genius Was No Match for His Ego A Billionaire’s Heir Hangs Up His Healing Crystal to Fix Capitalism Flight Routes Are Being Thrown Into Chaos With Closure of Russian Airspace ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Flow-Monster Vanguard Tightens Grip on $6.8 Trillion ETF World,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flow-monster-vanguard-tightens-grip-152952720.html
