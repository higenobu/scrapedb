3/16/2022,"A former Radio 1 DJ has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for preying on children in the Philippines through his online dating profile.

British national Mark Page, 63, of Ingleby Barwick, Teesside, wasfound guilty by the Teesside Crown Court on Wednesday of four abuse charges for arranging the commission of a child sex offense, leading the judge to describe him as the “embodiment of depravity.”

 Page was convicted on two charges of abuse for using a webcam traced back to his home to talk to Filipino children in 2016 and another two for his visits to the Southeast Asian country in 2016 and 2019.

The court learned that the former Radio 1 host and Middlesbrough FC's stadium announcer had used the alias “Pancho” while looking for young Filipino girls on the website Find Your Filipino Beauty.

The court also learned that Page had attempted to negotiate a sexual encounter with a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy, arguing 3,000 Philippine pesos (approximately $57) was too expensive.

 

“The offenses of which you have been convicted involve the grotesque sexual abuse of young children for your own sexual gratification,” Judge Paul Watson QCsaid. “You took advantage of the poverty and deprivation in an underdeveloped country in which children are routinely forced, through economic and social deprivation, into acts of prostitution.”

Authorities were able to track down one of Page’s victims, a then-13-year-old waitress, who is now living in a safe location in the Philippines.

During his hearing, prosecutors heard Page had used his frequent business travels to the Philippines as a cover for his predatory agenda. Page purportedly traveled to the Southeast Asian country regularly as ""managing director of armed forces radio station Garrison FM.""

The father of three had his phone, tablet and laptop seized in 2020. Investigators reportedly checked his devices as well as his Skype activity and bank transfers before charging him. Authorities purportedly found graphic messages describing the sex acts he wanted the victims to perform in those devices.

During the hearings, Page claimed his accounts were hacked and that someone else used his phone during the incidents between 2016 and 2019. He reportedly did not mention this, however, in his original police interviews, instead stating he had “no comment.”

Speaking to reporters, Detective Sergeant Kevin Carter from the Paedophile Online Investigation Team said he was very pleased with the sentence, adding that Page “didn't want to take responsibility during the proceedings or the investigation.”

“Page attempted to present himself as a respectable and credible individual, yet his actions betrayed the trust and confidence of many people, not least his family and close friends,” Carter said.

3/16/2022,"Watch: Huge unexploded bomb removed from flat in Ukraine Ukraine's Emergency Service has shared a video showing an unexploded OFAB 500 air bomb being removed from a residential area in Chernihiv.
The Emergency Service said three such bombs have been removed in one day, requiring incredible precision to execute safely. This is the tense moment a large unexploded Russian bomb was delicately removed from a block of flats in a city in Ukraine. The discovery was made as Russian forces continue to strike residential areas of Ukraine as part of its ongoing invasion. The unexploded device landed in an apartment block in the city of Chernihiv. It was extracted by Ukrainian bomb disposal experts, who used a crane to carry the bomb out of the damaged building and on to the back of a lorry. Video footage of the operation was posted on Twitter by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (DSNS). In a tweet posted on Sunday, it said three OFAB-500 air bombs were removed “with precision and care” from residential areas in Chernihiv in one day. The city, 80 miles north of the capital Kyiv, has been a regular target for Russian bombings. Read more: What is a thermobaric 'vacuum' bomb and why is it so devastating? Last week, Russia admitted using a thermobaric “vacuum” bomb in the city, which has been under fire since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Ukraine claims that 47 civilians - some of them queuing for bread - were killed in a Russian strike in Chernihiv on 3 March. Meanwhile, at least two people died and 12 were injured following a Russian air strike on a residential building in the Obolon district of Kyiv, it was reported on Monday. At least 35 people were killed in a Russian air strike on a Ukrainian military base outside the city of Lviv, close to the Polish border, on Sunday. About 30 Russian cruise missiles were fired at the Yavoriv training base, Ukrainian officials claimed. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky warned it was “only a matter of time” before the Nato alliance was struck following the attack, less than 15 miles from the border with Nato member Poland. Watch: Ukraine president says Russia trying to create 'pseudo-republic' in his country's south Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against the formation of a “pseudo-republic” in the south of his country, much like those in Donetsk and Luhansk. On Monday, UK health secretary Sajid Javid said he believed a direct attack on a Nato member was still “very unlikely”, but warned it would trigger a response from the alliance, which has a policy of mutual defence. Javid told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve made it very clear to the Russians even before the start of this conflict. “Even if a single Russian toecap steps into Nato territory, then it will be considered an act of war.” The attack on the Yavoriv base, which has previously been used by Nato to train Ukrainian soldiers, was one of the western-most targets struck by Russia during the invasion.",World/Yahoo News UK,Huge unexploded bomb removed from Ukrainian flats destroyed by Russian forces,https://news.yahoo.com/unexploded-bomb-ukraine-block-of-flats-destroyed-by-russian-forces-110802526.html

3/16/2022,"A former U.S. Army general predicted Monday that the Russian military could soon run out of the manpower and weaponry needed to continue its invasion of Ukraine. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said recent moves by Russia to extend its campaign to western Ukraine and reports that the country had asked China for military supplies may mean the Kremlin is running out of steam. “Russia’s decision to transition to a war of attrition, where they’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road for fear of being murdered, they need three things to do this, and they don’t have those three things,” Hodges said on MSNBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower and I don’t think they have the ammunition.” Hodges’ comments were buoyed by evidence that Russia was running low on weaponry as Ukraine continued to mount a fiercer-than-expected resistance, notably around the capital of Kyiv. He said that if the West continued to support Ukrainians, it could be less than two weeks before the Russian military reached what he referred to as its culmination point. “Assuming that we, the West, not only continue but accelerate the delivery of the capabilities the Ukrainians need, I think within the next 10 days that Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further,” Hodges said. “So, it’s kind of a race, actually, if we give the Ukrainians enough so they can outlast Russia.” Hodges added that there was a big caveat to his prediction, a nod to Putin’s unpredictability during the invasion. “I’ve been wrong a lot,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball here.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/16/2022,"Researchers in Utah made a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" find last week, trapping a live wolverine that was suspected in 18 sheep deaths in the area. The reclusive carnivore was first spotted by U.S. Agriculture Department workers who were flying over Rich County on Thursday. They were conducting livestock protection surveillance when they saw the fearsome mammal eating a dead sheep. Traps with sheep meat were immediately put out in collaboration with biologists, wildlife personnel and local sheepherders. The elusive animal was found in a trap midmorning Friday, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources said. Biologists sedated the wolverine, a male about 3 or 4 years old, and performed a general exam. He was affixed with a GPS collar to allow wildlife personnel to monitor his movements and whereabouts. Officials had released him on public lands in the Uinta Mountains by Friday evening. Jim Christensen, the northern region wildlife manager for the Division of Wildlife Resources, called it a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" experience. ""Having a collar on this wolverine will teach us things about wolverines in Utah that would be impossible to learn any other way,"" Christensen said. ""Four different wolverine sightings were confirmed in Utah in 2021. Were we seeing the same animal or different animals last year? Having a collar on this animal will help us solve that riddle."" While wolverines look like small bears and share a seemingly similar name with a certain canine, they are actually a subspecies of the Mustelidae family, which includes weasels and otters. Wolverine populations in North America have been in relative decline in recent years, and they have been sighted only eight times in Utah since 1979. Typically, wolverines were seen in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico, according to the National Wildlife Federation. The federation, which estimates that 30 percent of the wolverines' habitat will be eradicated in the next 30 years because of climate change, says the species is under consideration for protection through the Endangered Species Act.",Science/NBC News,Rare wolverine captures in Utah is 'once-in-a-lifetime' find for researchers,https://news.yahoo.com/rare-wolverine-capture-utah-once-213017811.html
3/16/2022,"(Updates with more details from Xinhua) By Antonio Denti, Michael Martina and Andrea Shalal ROME/WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday raised concerns about China's alignment with Russia in a seven-hour meeting with Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi as Washington warned of the isolation and penalties Beijing will face if it helps Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. The meeting took place in Rome as Washington told allies in NATO and several Asian countries that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war, two U.S. officials said. The U.S. message, sent in a diplomatic cable, also noted China was expected to deny those plans, said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It's real, it's consequential, and it's really alarming,"" the second U.S. official said, although the U.S. government offered no public evidence to back its assertions of China's willingness to provide such aid to Russia. After talks ended, the White House issued a short statement, saying Sullivan raised a ""range of issues in U.S.-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine."" ""We have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" a senior administration official told reporters. Sullivan described to Yang ""the unity of the United States and its allies and partners ... in bringing costs on Russia for its actions,"" this official added. The official described the meeting as ""intense,"" reflecting ""the gravity of the moment,"" although it had long been planned, was not timed to events in Ukraine and covered other issues including North Korea, Taiwan and tense bilateral relations. The official said the exchanges had been ""candid"" but led to no specific outcomes. Before the talks, U.S. officials had said Sullivan planned to warn of the isolation China could face globally if it supported Russia. Officials of the United States and other countries have sought to emphasize in recent weeks that siding with Russia could carry consequences for trade flows, development of new technologies and expose China to secondary sanctions. Chinese companies defying U.S. restrictions on exports to Russia may be cut off from American equipment and software they need to make their products, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last week. ""We have communicated very clearly to Beijing that we will not stand by...(and) we will not allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular briefing in Washington. It was Sullivan's first-known meeting with Yang since closed-door sessions in Zurich in October that sought to calm tensions after an acrimonious public exchange between the two in Alaska a year ago. AVOID CONFLICT, CHINA SAYS China's official Xinhua news agency cited Yang as saying that Beijing was committed to promoting negotiations to resolve the Ukraine conflict. ""China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread false information and distort and smear China's position,"" Yang said, in an apparent oblique reference to Washington's claims about support for Russia. China and the United States should strengthen dialogue, properly manage differences, and avoid conflict and confrontation, he said. Ryan Hass of the Brookings Institution said Chinese support for Russia ""would considerably narrow its path for preserving non-hostile relations with the United States and the West"" and not likely alter the trajectory of the conflict. China is the world's-largest exporter, the European Union's largest trading partner and the top foreign supplier of goods to the United States. Any pressure on Chinese trade could have economic effects on the United States and its allies. U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday that Russia had asked China for military equipment after its invasion. Russia denied asking China for military assistance and said it has sufficient military clout to fulfill all of its aims in Ukraine. Sino-U.S. ties, already at their lowest point in decades, took a further plunge last month when leaders Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced an upgraded ""no limits"" strategic partnership just weeks before the Ukraine invasion. China, a key trading partner of Russia, has refused to call Moscow's actions an invasion, although Xi last week did call for ""maximum restraint"" and express concern about the impact of Western sanctions on the global economy, amid growing signs that they limit China's ability to buy Russian oil. Russia itself calls its moves into Ukraine a ""special military operation."" The United States and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia and banned its energy imports, while providing billions of dollars of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.

3/16/2022,"The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Vladimir Putin would destroy Elon Musk in a fight. It came after Musk challenged Russia's leader to ""single combat"" to decide Ukraine's fate. Kadyrov, a Putin loyalist, joined in the macho posturing in a lengthy Telegram post on Monday. The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov responded to Elon Musk's surreal offer to fight Russian President Vladimir Putin in single combat over the fate of Ukraine, saying that Musk would face swift defeat. Kadyrov, a top Putin ally who rules Russia's quasi-autonomous Chechnya region, said Putin would destroy Musk in a fight. ""I would not advise you to compete with Putin,"" he wrote in a lengthy Telegram post. It came after the Tesla CEO posted on Twitter Monday to challenge Putin to ""single combat"" over Ukraine. —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2022 Kadyrov seemed amused in his response and offered Musk some ways to get stronger before facing Putin. Both Ukrainian and Russian news sources have reported Chechen soldiers fighting in Ukraine, and Kadyrov has claimed to be on the battlefield himself. Kadyrov noted Putin's qualifications in judo but said this was not the main reason Musk would lose. He said Musk was merely a ""businessman and Twitter blogger"" compared with Putin, a ""world politician, strategist, a scourge of the West and the US."" Putin, he said, ""would look unsportsmanlike beating a weaker opponent."" Instead, he said, Musk should undergo training at one of Kadyrov's special-forces academies and at ""Fight Club Akhmat"" — a chain of Chechen boxing clubs he founded and named after his father, the former Chechen ruler Akhmat Kadyrov. Ramzan Kadyrov is one of Putin's firmest loyalists. Putin formally handed Kadyrov the leadership of Chechnya in 2011 after Kadyrov spent several years as the region's prime minister. His personal fighting units have earned a bloodthirsty reputation. While Putin has embraced that image for his own propaganda purposes, an analysis from the think tank New Lines Institute said: ""Their operational effectiveness has not lived up to the hype."" In the invasion of Ukraine, Kadyrov has repeatedly called for harsher attacks, frustrated by Russia's lumbering advance. On Sunday, he claimed to be near Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, with his soldiers, without providing evidence. Kadyrov's hypermasculine posturing is underpinned by brutal rule. According to Human Rights Watch, he has led a crackdown on LGBTQ rights and is known for extensive use of torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings, all tolerated by Putin.

3/16/2022,"By Maayan Lubell and David Gauthier-Villars JERUSALEM/ISTANBUL (Reuters) -A jet linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich arrived in Istanbul from Israel on Monday, shortly after he was seen in Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport. Abramovich was among seven Russian billionaires added to a British sanctions list last week to try to isolate President Vladimir Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European Union diplomats have embraced a similar move. The Russian oligarch, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, has denied having close ties to Putin. A photograph obtained by Reuters showed Abramovich, the owner of Britain's Chelsea soccer club, sitting in Tel Aviv airport's VIP lounge with a face mask pulled down over his chin. Reuters could not verify whether he boarded the flight. A person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the plane used by Abramovich flew into Ben Gurion late on Sunday from Moscow. Flight-tracking website FLIGHTRADAR24 said the aircraft, which has the tail number LX-RAY and is a large Gulfstream business jet, on Monday landed in Istanbul after leaving Israel. It was not scheduled to fly on from Istanbul after landing and remained there, according to a source citing flight plans. The plane had also been in Turkey last week, according to tracking data. Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, is the site of the head office of AB Grup Holding, a company run by Muhsin Bayrak, who has publicly expressed interest in buying Premier League club Chelsea from Abramovich. Bayrak has interests in construction, energy and real estate, and has said he was talking to Abramovich about the sale process. Abramovich said last week he was selling the London club, but that sale is now on hold with Chelsea operating under a special government licence, and the Premier League board has disqualified him as a club director. A British transport ministry source said on Friday that Britain was searching out helicopters and jets belonging to the sanctioned oligarchs. Multiple properties including opulent yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been seized by authorities in Europe in recent days. According to tracking sites Marine Traffic and Vessel Finder, Abramovich's $600 million yacht Solaris had been off Montenegro heading to Istanbul. But by 2030 GMT the vessel's status changed to ""awaiting orders"" and its destination was removed NATO member Turkey has close ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has balanced its criticism of the invasion of Ukraine with its opposition to Western sanctions on Moscow. Russia calls its movement of troops into Ukraine a ""special military operation"". CALL FOR SANCTIONS In an interview with Israel's Channel 12 on Friday, Victoria Nuland, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, said Washington was asking Israel to join in financial and export sanctions against Russia. Speaking in Slovakia, which borders Ukraine, visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Israel ""will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries"". Lapid did not say directly whether Israel was considering its own sanctions. But he said the foreign ministry was ""coordinating the issue together with partners including the Bank of Israel, the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry, the Airports Authority, the Energy Ministry, and others"". Asked for further details, the Bank of Israel said in a statement to Reuters that it was ""constantly monitoring developments in the payments systems, the markets, and the financial system."" Any Israeli sanctions could complicate efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to mediate the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. He held talks in Moscow with Putin on March 5 and has spoken several times by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A senior Israeli official said Abramovich was not involved in Israel's mediation efforts. Sympathy for Ukraine is strong in Israel. The country's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem said on Thursday that it had suspended a strategic partnership with Abramovich after Britain's move against him.
