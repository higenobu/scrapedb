3/6/2022,"Hundreds of women and girls marched through London on Saturday to demand an end to male violence against women and girls, misogyny and racism. Supporters of the Million Women Rise collective walked from Charing Cross police station to Scotland Yard. The police station is where officers were based whose violently racist, misogynist and homophobic WhatsApp messages were exposed in a report by the police watchdog last month. The attenders banged drums, chanted and carried signs saying “Women’s rights are human rights”, “Girls just wanna have equal rights” and “The future is female”. Many wore red, which they said symbolised the blood of women who have died at the hands of men. Sabrina Qureshi, the founder and coordinator of Million Women Rise, said: “Violence against women is widespread in our society, yet none of our political leaders are willing to truly take this on. “We need change. From the disproportionate number of police officers who are offenders against women, to the clear back-slapping culture of hate, evidenced from the locker room to social media. “Enough. We demand accountability. We demand a total overhaul and rethink of what and who the police are for.” The campaigners demanded a clear dialogue from police on tackling the issues raised. They highlighted the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by Metropolitan police firearms officer Wayne Couzens last March and the sharing of photographs of two murdered sisters, Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, by Met Police officers. In a video message played to the crowd, Mina Smallman, the mother of Nicole and Bibaa who were killed in June 2020, said: “It’s not on us to ensure our own safety, it’s up to the government legislation to ensure that we are kept safe and that we are believed when we come forward to say we have been attacked.” Other campaigns highlighted were Justice for Gaia in memory of Gaia Pope, 19, whose body was discovered 11 days after she went missing in Swanage, Dorset, in 2017. In November, Dorset police said it issued an officer with a “final warning” after concerns were raised by the police watchdog about the search. The Women’s Equality Party wrote on Twitter: “WE are protesting with @MillionWomen to unite and rise up against male violence. Together, we are saying #EnoughIsEnough on the inaction of political leaders over the persistent global oppression of women. We deserve to live free from the fear of male violence.” The rally outside New Scotland Yard was livestreamed on several online video platforms and came ahead of International Women’s Day on 8 March. Elsewhere, women’s safety campaigners said “more needs to be done” a year on from Everard’s murder as they joined local politicians to unveil a bench commemorating victims of male violence. Members of Reclaim Sutton’s Streets, an offshoot of the larger group Reclaim These Streets, demanded “fundamental change” as they spoke at the ribbon-cutting event in the town’s Trinity Square in south London. The bench, which features a brightly coloured mosaic with a motif of hearts and stars, was created by artists Samia Tossio and Hana Horack-Elyafi after campaigners received planning permission from Sutton council.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Women and girls march to urge end to male violence and misogyny,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/05/woman-and-girls-march-to-urge-end-to-male-violence-and-misogyny
3/6/2022,"More than 1.3 million Ukrainians have crossed borders since the Russian invasion started on the 24 February in what the United Nations is now calling Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of the second world war. Figures released today by the United Nation’s Refugee Agency (UNHCR) show that to date 1.37 million people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring European countries after the military offensive ordered by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “This is the fastest-moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of the second world war,” UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said. According to data from UNHCR, the speed of the exodus is already bigger than the migration crisis of 2015, when 1.3 million asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa, fleeing poverty and wars, entered Europe. Christine Pirovolakis, senior external relations officer for UNHCR in the UK, said: “Looking at the trends and latest data, it is highly possible that the number of people fleeing Ukraine may reach 1.5 million by tonight, the latest tomorrow.” Most Ukrainians (53%) are heading west into Poland, which has so far welcomed about 756,303 people, followed by Hungary, with 157,004. As the situation continues to unfold, an estimated 4 million people may flee Ukraine to escape the escalating violence. Grandi told Reuters that so far most refugees who have crossed into neighbouring countries are not staying at the borders but moving on to friends, family and other connections already living in Europe. Yet he warned that future waves expected in the coming weeks would be more difficult for European to manage. The village of Medyka in south-eastern Poland remains the main border crossing with Ukraine. Thousands of refugees are crossing the border by bus, car and on foot every day, mostly women and children, as Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are currently forbidden from leaving the country. The mass exodus is proving difficult to manage, with queues of waiting cars stretching over 14km and people waiting up to 40 hours to cross. Small children are standing all day in freezing temperatures to cross with their families. Alongside Ukrainian refugees are groups of foreign nationals from countries including Pakistan, Ghana, Morocco and Somalia, many of them students, but also workers and asylum seekers. There have been reports of foreign nationals being racially abused and discriminated against as they tried to cross to safety. Ukrainian nationals will be given the right to live and work in the European Union for up to three years without having to claim asylum after emergency measures were approved by European states. However, these rights have not been extended to people fleeing Ukraine from other countries, who will still have to claim asylum. It is currently unclear how they will be processed once they pass into neighbouring countries.",News/Global development,Ukraine: UN says more than 1.3 million have fled since Russian invasion began,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/05/ukraine-un-says-more-than-13-million-have-fled-since-russian-invasion-began
3/6/2022,"The outpouring of grief at the untimely death of Shane Warne has perhaps contained a partial lament at the passing of a golden age of Test cricket. At a time when career options for players are myriad and the shortest format is so lucrative, its primacy continues to be challenged. Yet the lure still remains for many. Just ask Ben Stokes, who after weighing up another unforgiving schedule this year has shouldered arms to the Indian Premier League – and a likely seven-figure pay day, going by the all-rounder’s previous value – to focus on his Test career and the vice-captaincy of an ailing England team. There is an element of atonement at play here also. Stokes departed Australia after this winter’s 4-0 Ashes defeat frustrated by his inability to rediscover the magic of 2019 and is now seeking to reassert himself during the three-match series against West Indies that begins at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Tuesday. “I had a chance to have a good look at things going forward and when it came down to it, the real thing that got me excited out of all three formats was Test cricket,” said Stokes, after England’s drawn four-day warm-up match against a CWI President’s XI at the Coolidge Cricket Ground on Friday. “That was a big decision to come out of the IPL, to make sure that I was able to give everything I possibly could to this Test team. There’s a massive summer ahead, a lot of cricket to play and you just have to look at the schedules at times and think what’s the most important thing – and Test cricket is the most important for me. “Looking back on Australia, we’ve had some honest reflections not only as a team but individuals as well. I personally felt I let the team down with more than just performances: I would have liked to have been in better physical shape. “When I look back on it I felt I let myself down but the thing that really grinds me the most and hurts me the most is that I let a lot of other people down and I never want to feel that way again. Everyone’s taken some good hard lessons from Australia.” The numbers for Stokes in Australia were not pretty, as he made 236 runs from 10 innings with the bat and claimed four wickets at 71 with the ball. But though he refused to make the excuse himself, they also followed a four-month break for injury and mental health reasons that left England praying superhero theory might prevail. Much has changed since, with a cull of both management and playing staff – most notably the contentious decision to drop Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – leaving precious little experience in a touring party that, however much they play it down, desperately needs a positive outcome in the Caribbean to right the listing captaincy of Joe Root. Stokes said: “It’s not all on the captain. Joe is 100% the man to lead this team forward and I’ll be right behind him every step of the way. There’s obviously been a big change with Stuart and Jimmy but with all due respect to them – and I mean this in the nicest way possible – they’re not here and what we can concentrate on are the guys who are and the opportunity they now have. “We have made a real effort to make sure that from the top, the most experienced guy, Joe, to the guys who haven’t even played yet, we are valued just as much as each other. When it comes to guys who are about to make their debut or haven’t played much, there is that extra responsibility on the senior guys to help them through that. “I don’t see it as a negative whatsoever. The only thing for us now is positive, because there were a lot of negatives in Australia and it was a shit place to be.” For all the recent talk of a “reset”, it may be that only one new cap is handed out this week. Durham’s Alex Lees is certain to open, but the leg-spin of Matt Parkinson went unused in the warm-up and the seamers Matt Fisher and Saqib Mahmood were used fleetingly (and only then after Ollie Robinson’s battle with back spasms re-emerged). But as has been the case for some time, the readiness of Stokes the bowler is key. Sending down five feisty overs on Friday was mildly encouraging for a player who finished the Ashes as a specialist batter after a side strain but Root and Paul Collingwood, the interim head coach, still face a tricky selection call. Robinson appears unlikely to feature – England were burned by his self-assessment on fitness in Hobart – leaving a likely first-choice attack of Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Mark Wood and Jack Leach. Yet Wood is light on overs after a stomach bug that has sapped his energy, while the spin of Leach has not previously been trusted as one of four. There is much to ponder in the next three days, not least a pitch that three years ago was prepared to be a volatile seamer’s paradise and helped the four-pronged West Indies pace attack complete a series win with a match to spare. Stokes may have slimmed down his own schedule and pay packet but his burden in the Test side remains a heavy one.",Sport/Sport,Stokes striving for atonement with England and focusing on Test career,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/ben-stokes-striving-for-atonement-england-west-indies-after-focusing-on-test-cricket
3/6/2022,"Mary-Frances O’Connor is an associate professor at the University of Arizona, where she leads the grief, loss and social stress (Glass) lab, investigating the effects of grief on the brain and the body. Why do humans grieve? One of the earliest things that we learn is that we’re all going to die, so when it happens, why is it such a shock?I think a lot of people historically have struggled to understand why there is grief, and in a funny sort of way, it is a byproduct of love. What I mean by that is, when we bond with another person, our spouse or our child, the way that gets encoded includes this belief that they will always be there for us and we will always be there for them. This is why we can kiss our partner goodbye in the morning and go on our separate ways to work, with the deep knowledge that we will come back together again at the end of the day. But in the very unusual, thank goodness, cases where that loved one dies, the brain is able to consult our memory of being there at the bedside or getting that terrible phone call, but those two streams of information conflict for a long time. This often leads people to saying things like: “I’m not crazy. I know they’ve died, but it really feels like they’re just going to walk through the door again.” So what is going on in the brain when people “see” their deceased loved one?They know it’s irrational and yet it is surprisingly real for them. There are lots of people who will believe in an afterlife, but as a neuroscientist, my take is that the brain is a prediction machine. The heart is there to pump blood around your body. Your brain is there to predict what’s about to happen so that you can prepare for it. Because of this, we are always living in our predicted world. We’re living in two worlds at the same time, our predicted world and the real world, and in some circumstances, those don’t match up. Grieving is very difficult to rationalise.In many ways, much like Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, often the places that human beings get tripped up are where our brain has biases or it has conflicting information and so we sort of make up the best story we can to make sense of that. I think grief is a situation where we’re in exactly this position, only it’s one that’s so universal that we don’t think of it that way. You draw a distinction between grief and grieving.You want to know exactly what it is that you’re studying. Are you studying this moment in time where grief just comes over you like a wave and it is just so intense, or are you studying the change in that experience over time? Early on, grief is so intense. People want to know, when will this be over? If you believe that there will come a time when you don’t have these waves of grief because your child has died, then you’ll be very disappointed and think there’s something wrong with you. When, months and years later, you do have that awareness that they’re gone again and that brings this wave of grief, but that doesn’t mean that you haven’t been grieving. You have begun to figure out how to live in the world with the absence of this person. You argue that the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief model is inaccurate and incomplete.I have an enormous amount of respect for Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. She really pioneered the idea that you could even talk about grief. She wrote On Death and Dying in 1969, and the part that was very accurate was when she was doing what all scientists do at first, when she was describing. She was describing the experience that people were relating to her, and those aspects are still true today. People experience depression, they experience denial, and acceptance. The difficulty is, she was describing grief, she wasn’t actually describing grieving, because she wasn’t interviewing the same person over a number of times to see the trajectory of what that looked like over time. What that means is, although all of those experiences are true, we know now they don’t happen in a linear, orderly way. She presented grieving as a trajectory, although her interviewing wasn’t done in that way.Right. In the late 1980s, 1990s, researchers at University of Michigan actually interviewed 1,500 people and then followed them for 10 years, and when their spouse died, went back and interviewed them again and again, and so they could actually see these trajectories of grief. She just didn’t have access to that kind of data. Even now, people believe in that model, and when they don’t experience that kind of trajectory, they feel, “Oh, what’s wrong with me? I’m not feeling angry, or my stages are in the wrong order.”Exactly, or they feel like, “Oh gosh, I had this period where I felt like I was in acceptance and now I feel depressed again, and so I must have done something wrong or there must be something wrong with me,” and that’s just actually pretty typical. One reason often given for buying a child a pet is that they’ll learn about death, while other parents will shield their children from dying relatives and funerals. Do those things actually make much difference later on in life?First of all, children do grieve, and although it looks different from the ways that adults grieve, it is still important for all of us to have experiences and learn. We often talk about teachable moments. You come across a dead bird in the park. What does that mean? And how we might feel when we see that? For a pet, who’s been a part of one’s life. What rituals does our family engage in? You have this history of how people before you, who are like you, have dealt with grief. It is important to have a view of life that incorporates death. That could be a religious view, but it could be a philosophical view or a spiritual view. People who have that tend to do better with the experience of a particular death, particularly a loved one who dies. Does the shift away from gravestones to cremations influence the way we grieve?Personally I think this is fascinating. In part because where our loved ones are is so important to us. Almost all religions have an answer to those questions. When will you see them next and where are they? In some ways having a location and times when you could go and visit them, to some degree solves some of that searching that continues. Even with cremation, we still have remains. Many people have urns in their home, and in lots of cultures, there are altars in the home where people can go and drop foods that they like or have a conversation, light a candle. I think to the degree that those are helpful to people, to have that when and where, I think it’s useful kind of regardless of how we go about it exactly. You write quite a lot about your own experience of grief after your parents’ deaths. Do you think being an expert helped you process their deaths, or were you just as bereft as everybody else?When my mother died, I was not an expert on grief yet. I was really at the early stages. Someone had recommended that I go see a counsellor and I said in the first session: “Well, she’s died. What is there to say?” Yet 20 years later I’ve written a whole book. When my father died, I did have more knowledge about myself, about grief, about how to accept the fact that your reactions are just going to happen and we have some say about how we handle the reactions. With my father, this is not a psychological term, but it felt cleaner. It was just grief, and it was moving through me, and as difficult as that was and painful as that was, it didn’t stick. It was something I could experience, see and tolerate. Many people feel guilty and conflicted about moving on in terms of relationships.Absolutely. My father took off his wedding ring in the days after my mother died and the neighbours were just so upset about it. We said to him, Look, took care of her every day in that last year of her life. This is where you are. This is how and who you are now. No one else gets to have commentary on that. But it’s a challenge to move on.We have invested in this relationship for such a long time and we have merged with this other person. You won’t replace that, and you won’t even develop it for quite some time, but doing the things that you might have done with your spouse with a new person is going to cue memories that will probably actually cause grief. I understand why it is so painful to even bother trying to connect again. Should the bereaved move home, get some new interests?There are people that do that. The challenge is, you carry the absence of that person no matter where you are. They come along with you, so it’s possibly more about really recognising this new person is different. This is going to be a different relationship. I tell the story in the book of an older gentleman who had married his high school sweetheart, and had the white picket fence and the two children and the dog, and he nursed her through breast cancer and her death. He got all teared up as he told me this, and then tells me about a woman he’s been spending time with, and she’s so different. She brings out different aspects in him that he sort of forgot were a part of him, maybe from even before high school. Yet, he says, the thing is, it was good then, and it’s good now. I think in some ways it’s about getting both, finding a way to accept both. Both, and not, instead of.

3/6/2022,"When the news broke of Shane Warne’s death on Friday, there was a common reaction from cricket fans around the world – not just shocked, but instantly bereft. Warne’s loss was unexpected and close on the heels of that of another Australian legend, former wicketkeeper Rod Marsh. Marsh was 74. Warne was just 52 and despite his easygoing attitude to diet and fitness, it never occurred that this ebullient commentator, coach, poker player and former world champion was in anything but the prime of life. Some of the sorrow was, naturally, the tragedy of a life left too early. We expected Warne to be part of our landscape for many years yet, sharing opinions on the game, joking with England players he used to humiliate on the field, managing teams in domestic tournaments and, who knows, perhaps one day taking the reins of an international team and transforming it into an all-conquering behemoth (please, God, let it be ours). But it was also about something far deeper. Every nation has its sporting heroes, but it is the rare and special talent who can appear to belong to all the world, beloved and feted by the countries whose downfall they engineered – in Warne’s case, to their enduring embarrassment. Many England fans spent more than a decade cursing Warne’s name. From the moment he bowled his first delivery in Ashes cricket – the “ball of the century” to Mike Gatting in 1993 – he was Nemesis. He took hundreds of wickets and humbled every Test side and the ones he took against your own always looked like the ones he most enjoyed. In England’s case, that was probably true. And it is in those fans’ lament that we perceive something about the man, perhaps even something about this life we live. Warne was a tormentor, both stealer of and laugher at our dreams. He was the completely unfair advantage on the other side of the team sheet. The Australian team of the 90s was intimidating enough without him; his presence made them the determined murderer in an Agatha Christie novel who chooses to poison and shoot their victims. Warne didn’t just best his opponents, he revelled in it. He baited, he sledged, he screamed appeals for lbws that weren’t even close, just to annoy and confuse. He did a complete number on England, neutering their only real assets of that period: a few stalwart batters who looked heroic taking bruises and broken jaws against the world’s most terrifying fast bowlers, but like incompetent fools against Warne’s indecipherable, unstoppable armoury of spin. Googlies, flippers, sliders, unnamed mystery balls that probably never existed and still scared batsmen out – for a long time we resented him for these. How could we not? We leapt on any apparent flaw – his weight, his dating history, his use of a diuretic pill that just happened to contain a masking agent. Only when England fans tasted victory against him, in 2005, could we finally unclench, to appreciate and celebrate what was there all along – a once-in-a-generation player and man whose exuberant personality was one with the extravagance of his gifts. Shane Warne was the greatest villain of many sporting fans’ lives – but only because we were on the other side. And, now he’s gone, we can only wish for him back and to watch him, to enjoy his life, all over again.

3/6/2022,"The Home Office was accused on Sunday of asking newly arrived Ukrainian refugees how long they plan to stay in the UK as the government came under mounting criticism for its response to the victims of the humanitarian crisis. The home secretary Priti Patel was, on Friday, again forced to change visa rules for Ukrainians with relatives in the UK. More family members will now be included – though many remain excluded – and length of stay is extended from one to up to three years. But critics said the policy fell significantly short of the UK’s international obligations and that it was ungenerous in comparison to the EU, which has pledged to welcome refugees with “open arms”. Continuing confusion over the Home Office’s latest response to the deepening humanitarian crisis yesterday prompted the UN to intervene, setting out a number of ways that the UK government should act to help those fleeing Ukraine. UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, urged the UK to immediately extend the visas of all Ukrainians living lawfully in the UK, a move that would protect tens of thousands at a stroke. Following analysis by the UNHCR’s legal protection team in London, spokesperson Christine Pirovolakis told the Observer that the UK should also allow all Ukrainians living in the UK lawfully to sponsor family members. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has promised a “humanitarian sponsor scheme” for Ukrainians with no UK ties, but details are yet to be announced. With almost 1.4 million people having already fled Ukraine, and projections that 4 million could leave if the conflict escalates, the UNHCR said that Johnson’s scheme may need to be rapidly “scaled up” to cope with the size of the crisis. In the meantime disquieting details over how the Home Office is welcoming some new Ukrainian arrivals are starting to emerge. Rustam Isayev, 45, received a call from the Home Office asking him how long his cousin and her two children planned to stay after he helped them make the fraught week-long journey from Kyiv to Luton via Kraków. “I don’t think this is the correct question to ask when people are running away [from war],” said the British construction company director from Essex. His cousin, Tarana Veliieva, 38, arrived in the UK with her children, aged 13 and 17, on Wednesday on a visitor visa, which is valid until the end of March. But the Home Office, Isayev said, “didn’t know what to do” with her, passing him from person to person on the phone: “Someone was saying: ‘How long is she going to stay here?’ I nearly went mad. I said: ‘What do you mean ‘how long is she going to stay here’? That’s a bit of an unfair question to ask right now, isn’t it?’” He said they did not appear to have been told how to respond to Ukrainians appropriately and that the British government should do more to help refugees. “If we are the ones who can give them a safe place and if we are the ones who can give them food and look after them while the fight is going on there, then why would the British government not let us do it?” Immigration experts continue to lament the UK’s restrictive visa policy. Immigration solicitor Vanessa Ganguin said she has been approached by Ukrainians who were completely baffled by the Home Office rules: “According to the current wording, an aunt can join a niece in Britain but not the other way round. Their British relative has to be an immediate family member of an extended family member, but an extended family member of an immediate member doesn’t count. Confused?” Ganguin said she had been talking to a former Home Office official who admitted even they weren’t sure how to interpret the rules. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “There needs to be greater flexibility so anyone who wants to come to the UK has a safe route to do so – and that would mean extending the visa routes.” Other cases uncovered by the Observer include that of Ivanna Shemeta, 41, a knowledge management specialist from Cambridgeshire who is married to a British national, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, but who is still unable to bring her elderly parents, who live in Kyiv, to the UK. Shemeta said it will be two-and-a-half years before she has settled status and is able to sponsor her parents to come to Britain. “I don’t have the right to bring them in because I haven’t lived in the UK enough. But what is enough? “I’m living here as a resident. I’m here – I have the domicile intention to live here because this is my new home, my daughter is going to school here and I’m intending to be here all the time … This is so unfair.” Maria Tymofienko spent the last week guiding her 69-year-old mother on a treacherous solo 500-mile car journey across Ukraine from Kyiv to the Romanian border remotely from her home in Horsham, West Sussex. The lawyer’s mother, Oksana, finally landed in the UK from Bucharest on Wednesday on a visitor visa, and her family greeted her with a Ukrainian flag. Tymofienko also wants to bring her aunt and cousins over from Ukraine but she is unsure whether she will be able to under the current rules. “Other countries – like Ireland, Portugal, EU countries – are opening their doors without any kind of ‘buts’. But the UK has different approach. It’s not straightforward.” A government spokesperson said: “We have been working at pace to launch the Ukraine family scheme – one of the first of its kind to become operational anywhere in the world. It is now open for extended family members to apply. “As well as immediate family members, British nationals and people of any nationality settled in the UK will be supported to bring parents, grandparents, grandchildren, adult children and siblings to the UK.” ",News/World news,"Britain’s Ukraine visa scheme is complex and unfair, say critics",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/britains-ukraine-visa-scheme-is-complex-and-unfair-say-critics
