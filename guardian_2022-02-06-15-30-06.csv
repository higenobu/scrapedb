2/6/2022,"It’s a contentious issue. The Hollywood age gap romance – the habitual casting of an older male actor and a much younger female actor, for so long accepted as the norm – is now meeting with increasing scrutiny and criticism from audiences. Some filmmakers, identifying a hot-button topic, have started to respond. At the Sundance film festival last month, age gaps in relationships were a recurring theme. But rather than the traditional approach, of hoping that people wouldn’t notice an age difference which could practically be measured on a geological time frame, filmmakers are instead emphasising and examining the issue.  Approaches include flipping the gender roles, as with Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, which starred Emma Thompson, who is 62, opposite 29-year-old Daryl McCormack, or the audience prize-winner Cha Cha Real Smooth, which explored the attraction between a young male college leaver and a thirty-something divorcee (played by Dakota Johnson). Other films, like the potent but gruelling Palm Trees and Power Lines and Lena Dunham’s Sharp Stick, delved into the realities of the power imbalance between a young woman and a much older man. One thing is certain: the debate about onscreen age differences is not about to die down. On the contrary, if the polarised reactions to Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza are anything to go by, the conversation, amplified perhaps by the fact that it frequently plays out on social media, is only set to grow more heated. Another film which flips the gender roles of the traditional age gap, Licorice Pizza is a defiantly unconventional picture. “Do you think it’s weird I hang out with Gary and his 15-year-old friends all the time?” asks Alana Haim’s 25-year-old character in Anderson’s loose-limbed, loping Californian coming of age comedy. Her sister shrugs, noncommittally. “I think it’s weird I hang out with Gary and his 15-year-old friends.” And a sizeable minority of the film’s audience would agree with her. At the heart of the film is, if not quite a romance between a 15-year-old boy and a woman at least 10 years his senior, then certainly a mutual attraction. An attraction which, depending on your reading of the fantasy vs reality question which hovers over the film’s final scenes, may or may not culminate in a kiss and a confession of love. Anderson, talking to the New York Times last year, downplayed the age gap aspect. “There’s no line that’s crossed, and there’s nothing but the right intentions. It would surprise me if there was some kind of kerfuffle about it … There isn’t a provocative bone in this film’s body.” That last statement rings a little hollow, given some of the more strident criticism that Licorice Pizza was little more than a handsomely photographed feature-length advert for paedophilia. One suspects that Anderson was being a touch disingenuous in his claims: surely the whole point of pushing the age gap to the front of the story was to create a degree of discomfort. Anderson is, after all, a filmmaker who has made a career out of getting under the skin of a series of broken screw-ups, of which Haim’s character is just the latest. That she is drawn to a 15-year-old wheeler dealer who plans to make a fortune selling waterbeds arguably says more about her mired future and lack of self esteem than it does of any great romantic impetus. Licorice Pizza is the latest of a number of films which have generated, to quote Anderson, a “kerfuffle”. Malcolm & Marie, a Netflix production written and directed by Sam Levinson, about a film director, played by John David Washington, 36, and his girlfriend, played by then a 24-year-old Zendaya, sparked criticism for the 12-year age gap between the two. This is in part, as Zendaya pointed out, because audiences were accustomed to seeing her in high school-age roles in films like the Spider-Man franchise. It was also perhaps because Levinson had already dipped his toe into teen girl fetishisation with his previous movie, Assassination Nation. Even so, the fact that the comparatively modest age difference between Zendaya and Washington drew complaints might be an indication that audience tolerance for multi-decade gaps is waning. Not before time. “Men on screen have a whole life, and women only have a shelf life,” says Nicky Clark, the founder of campaign group Acting Your Age, which lobbies for age-appropriate casting and representation for older women on screen. “Since the medium began, women were expected to retire at 40 and not do anything particularly interesting if they were working after that age. And that hasn’t really changed.” According to actor and co-founder of the ERA 50:50 campaign Polly Kemp, there’s no mystery behind the tendency to cast much younger women opposite older actors. “I think it’s to do with the fact that it was predominantly white, older men who commissioned, financed and produced. They were casting their preferences… I think things are changing slowly, certainly in terms of diversity. But certainly for middle-aged women it’s still a bit of a struggle. I don’t see myself [represented] because I’m middle-aged, I’m post-menopausal. I’m no longer regarded as sexy.” A-list status offers some protection to female actors being seen as a viable romantic lead over 30, but it’s by no means a certainty. At 37, Maggie Gyllenhaal was told she was too old to play the lover of a 55-year-old man. “It was astonishing to me,” she said at the time. “It made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh.” Meanwhile, in films such as Entrapment, the 39-year gap between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones was barely more credible than a plot which suggested the 68-year-old Connery could parachute down a ventilation shaft to escape pursuers. Then there’s Woody Allen, a repeat offender when it comes to dubious casting decisions, who assigned himself the then 26-year-old Charlize Theron as a love interest in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. When he shares the screen with her, he looks like a liver-spotted Galapagos tortoise trying to take a bite out of a peach. The film industry can be notoriously complacent and slow moving when it comes to enacting meaningful change. However, it does tend to respond to the threat of commercial failure. The Sundance trend for films which interrogate or disrupt the traditional age gap may be as much to do with the box office ramifications of a shift in audience appetites as to a reframing of female roles after #metoo. Still the fact that they exist at all is a step forward, surely? Kemp is cautiously positive. “I think it’s very interesting that there’s a number of films that are looking at that age gap and they’re not just producing films where there is very much a younger actress being paired up with an older man. Clearly the industry is taking some time to look at that. I suspect given what’s happened in the last few years, that there is a reluctance perhaps to have very young people in sexual relationships with older men on film.The type of films that Woody Allen did, I think people are finding that a little bit queasy.” Clark is not so sure. On Emma Thompson’s widely praised performance in Good Luck To You, Leo Grande, she says: “Depressingly, she’s being referred to as ‘brave’ for being either naked or featuring in sex scenes. We don’t hear Brad Pitt called brave when he takes his shirt off in Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. It’s making these steps forward, but with the caveat that the permission is being granted, and everybody knows that she’s older, and isn’t that quite charming and endearing, really? When no, it’s not charming and endearing. It’s an actress who’s still at the top of her game, performing brilliantly and telling a story that isn’t often told. So there are small steps, but then they’re pulled back again.”",Arts/Film,"Move over, silver foxes: Hollywood gets to grips with the age gap",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/move-over-silver-foxes-hollywood-gets-to-grips-with-the-age-gap
2/6/2022,"First, the good gardening news: UK sunrise should be 50 minutes earlier by the end of the month. Sunset almost an hour later, days nudging two hours longer by 28 February. Now, though, the weather. Temperatures can be fierce. They’re often lower than January with severe frosts, sometimes snow. So don’t rush to sow outside even on a bright sunny day. In contrast to TS Eliot, I find February to be the cruellest month. Less so April.  That said, there are a few things ready to go into the ground, unless your soil is soaked or frozen. If it is, stick to sowing in indoor pots for planting out later. Rhubarb sets, shallot sets, garlic and broad beans can all go in. As can bare-root fruit bushes and trees. Remember, too, to finish winter pruning fruit bushes while they’re dormant. They’ll be starting to stir around now. Seed potatoes can still be chitted in trays or egg boxes in a light cool room. Keep feeding birds if you can and think about nesting boxes, so they can familiarise themselves before breeding begins. Please, too, keep an eye on ponds. Take measures to stop them freezing over. Gently break through any ice. Warm water works well. There’s a long list of plants if you have propagators or a cool inside space. Tomatoes and aubergines can be sown in propagators, but aubergine needs more warmth. Radish, hardy salad, spinach, lettuce and leek seeds are good to go in indoor pots. Start early peas in guttering for transplanting to trenches later. If in doubt how best to do it, there are many instructional films online. We’re still in limbo at the allotments. We don’t know if the council will be gone by the end of the month as planned. So I’m practising patience – not with great success in truth, though I’m trying hard to be more Howard.

If you are wondering how Zoi is feeling. She has already uploaded to Instagram. pic.twitter.com/hjRcnDZabN Her family, watching from her home town of Wānaka, in New Zealand’s South Island, erupted into tearful jubilation when the results were announced. Her father, Sean, told Sky Sports, the win was “pretty frickin exciting, and the team of 5 million behind her has just been amazing”. “Thank you all for your support in the run-through into these games, the coverage from press and everything has been fantastic.” “I’m just ecstatic,” he added. “She pulled it out of the bag. She’s competitive obviously, and was under so much stress I guess after that fall, but she pulled it through.” Deputy prime minister Grant Robertson, who holds the portfolio for sport and recreation, said he was “so proud of this awesome woman”. “I had the honour to be there four years ago to see Zoi win bronze. Ever since, she has continually lifted her game to be one of the best snowboarders in the world. Our first ever Winter Olympic gold medal!” GOLD for ZOI!

On being mobbed by her rivals in the finish area following her win, the 20-year-old said: “That was a crazy moment and shows how special snowboarding is. You cheer more when your friends do well than yourself – it’s why I love it.” The 20-year-old, who became Olympic champion on Waitangi Day, put down the run of her life in the biggest competition of her career to overtake the American Julia Marino, who had taken the lead with her second of three attempts.

2/6/2022,"Statistician and Observer columnist Sir David Spiegelhalter has admitted he was “overly optimistic” at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The 68-year-old Cambridge University scientist has confessed he “didn’t take it seriously enough”. Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs on Sunday, Spiegelhalter says: “I think it’s very important that we have to acknowledge that we can never take an objective view about evidence. We always bring our, I think, personalities into it, and mine is unfortunately very optimistic and that’s why I’m very glad I’m not a government adviser. I don’t think I’d be very good at it because I do tend to hope for the best and sort of expect the best as well.”  But Spiegelhalter adds that his analysis has also shown that the pandemic has been a net lifesaver for younger people. “If you look at people between 15 and 30 in 2020, 300 fewer died than would normally have died, and that includes the 100 that died from Covid, sadly. “So that’s 300 fewer families mourning the death of a young person because young people were essentially locked up. They couldn’t go out driving fast, they couldn’t go out and get drunk, and they couldn’t get into fights and whatever, and so all these lives were saved. “I’m not saying this is a good thing because, on the flip side of that, you have a big increase in mental health problems and so on.” Spiegelhalter was knighted in 2014 for services to medical statistics, including his work with the public inquiry into serial killer Harold Shipman, who was jailed for life in 2000. Official predictions suggest he killed more than 200 people over a 23-year period. “We showed that Shipman could have been caught much earlier. If someone had been looking at the data and had blown the whistle, you might have been able to save 200 lives,” Spiegelhalter says. He also reveals a surprising love of Europop. Selecting his second disc, Dragostea Din Tei by Moldovan pop group O-Zone, he said: “I do quite like to have a drink and dance around to loud, raucous rock music, and I’ve got particular fondness for sort of Eurotrash and this is a prime example by a Moldovan group. I call it Numa Numa because I can’t pronounce its real name.”",News/Science,"I didn’t take Covid seriously, admits leading statistician",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/06/i-didnt-take-covid-seriously-admits-leading-statistician-david-spiegelhalter
2/6/2022,"Food House, 46 Gerrard Street, London W1D 5QH (020 7287 2818). Starters £5.80-£9.80; large dishes £9.80-£24.80; hot pot £18-£38.80; whole fish £36. Wines from £19.80 All parents will retain a deep affection for any restaurant where their once small children were happy, and the family therefore harmonious and nobody died and can we all go home now please? It’s why Pizza Express retains the love of a slab of the British middle classes, despite endless whining over the current quality of the pizzas, and the silliness of the one with the hole in the middle, and the blood-sucking endeavours of venture capital firms. They have managed to retain a culture that is welcoming to small kids, without infantilising their weary parents. It’s a neat trick. And if you still want to rant about why Pizza Express is terrible, please take it up over on Reddit. Someone there will be gagging for your hot take.  I have similar warm, fuzzy feelings about the premises at number 46 Gerrard Street in London’s Chinatown, with its arched marble frontage. For many years it was an extremely reliable Cantonese place called Harbour City. My boys loved the dim sum there when they were small, and so did I. The fluffy, cloud-like char siu buns had an uncommon citrus kick. The har gow were spot on. A Sunday lunchtime at Harbour City was always a good one. Recently the website Eater London, an offshoot of the US Eater empire, published a list of 38 “essential” London restaurants. If you don’t know Eater London, think of them as the cool boys on the back seat of the school bus of the food journalism world; the ones who listen to those bands you’ve never heard of and yes, they’ve got a girlfriend, she just goes to another school. But the thing with the cool boys is, secretly you always wanted to listen to those bands to find out what was so great about them. Because maybe that would make you cool, too. Included in that essentials list alongside reliable bangers like Mangal 2, Trullo and, er, the River Café was a Sichuan restaurant called Food House, which they said was “the trendiest restaurant in central London”. In keeping with the whole back-seat-of-the-bus thing, it was so trendy, so cool, I’d never heard of it. I squinted at the address. Blow me: it occupies the location of what was once Harbour City. Naturally, I booked. Going by the carpets I’d say little has been done to the joint in years. But this is a very different type of restaurant from the one I knew. It is all the grand, jumpy, thrilling, chilli and numbing peppercorn hullabaloo that those of us addicted to the Sichuan repertoire just adore. I believe you’re meant to say that Sichuan food is not just about chilli heat, it’s about flavour. And, of course, it’s not just about chilli heat. But actually, it also is. There’s even a samovar-style decanter of bright red oil, full of chillies, on the bar so they can dispense it at the turn of a tap, like absinthe. If I had brought my boys here when they were small, they would, faced by all this, have tugged at the sleeves of strangers and asked to be taken to a place of safety. Or perhaps a plate of safety. Food House is full on, in a very good way. One of the dishes regularly talked up online is the fearsome sounding red chilli oil noodles. It’s actually one of the more soothing platefuls: broad, ragged-edged ribbons of noodle the colour of a baby’s teeth, come slicked with just enough of the crimson oil to remind you where you are. We have it topped by friable pieces of long braised lamb. It’s comfort food for when you’re caught in a winter storm, or like to imagine you might be. Before we get to that there are other thrills. There is the barbecue menu of things on skewers, roughed up with cumin, salt, chilli and the occasional dab of sugar. Often, these can be mimsy affairs, delivering seized up pebbles of hard matter. Here, the red willow twig lamb skewers are solid, chunky pieces of still smoking baby sheep. There are also skewers of lamb kidney which, arriving with a cloak of crispy fat, must be eaten while still hot. I understand that offal and its fat may not be everybody’s thing. They are my thing. We have king prawns which, under the heavy hand from the spice mix, seem to become even sweeter. Alongside this there are silky-skinned, pan-fried pork and cabbage dumplings that leak their juices down my chin. It is an attractive look. We have Yu Xiang aubergine (eggplant, on this menu) in a deep glossy gravy and, from the broad selection of offal dishes, a heaving plateful of more kidney in a hot and sour sauce. When I called to book, I was asked if I wanted the hot pot. It’s a big thing here. I’ve tried them elsewhere and never quite enjoyed them as much as I think I should. This is partly because, however varied a list of ingredients you get to drop in the boiling stock or oil, it all ends up tasting rather similar to me. It’s also down to incompetence. I usually end up sticking a chilli-dipped finger in one eye or the other. Instead, we have another of their big statement dishes: a whole seabass to share, first roasted so the skin and the flesh along the tail where it narrows, is crispy. It has then been plunged into a bath of chilli oil, bobbing with dried chillies and slices of lotus root, sprigs of coriander, halved cloves of garlic and so much more. It is magnificent to behold, as if it has its own stage lighting system, and justifies its price of £36 on those dashing looks alone. It is not, however, simple to eat. We get in there together, working our way around the bones to get at the prized flesh. But it is very much worth it: there is a sweetness to the soft fish, stained red by its vigorous liquor. It can get messy. Either wear a bib, or don’t wear a white shirt. Perhaps don’t bother with clothes at all. It’s a pretty laid-back place. Drink bottles of Yanjing beer to soften the burn. I shall have to take the word of the cool boys on the bus that this is a very trendy restaurant. I long ago mislaid the ability to recognise what is fashionable and what is not. But I can say it’s an awful lot of fun. I have a great reason at last to return to 46 Gerrard Street. In the January edition of OFM I featured six chefs worth watching in 2022, among them Helen Graham of the lovely Middle Eastern vegetarian restaurant Bubala, in London’s Spitalfields. She and her business partner Marc Summers have just announced a second Bubala, this time in Soho on the site of what was the venerable Italian Vasco & Piero’s Pavilion. The 50-cover restaurant will open in April (bubala.co.uk). Per Diem is a new food and household goods delivery service which, in its own words, sets out to do the boring things ‘really very well’. It offers only the very basics – dry pasta, flour, sugar, rice, cleaning materials and so on – but only one good example of each, sourced from independent suppliers. Right now, therefore, there are just 50 items on the site. Products can be ordered as needed or on a monthly basis and they also offer a packaging-free re-fill service (getperdiem.com). Rosa’s Thai, which has branches nationwide, is attempting to tackle the hospitality industry skills shortage by launching its own chef training programme.

2/6/2022,"Classics California Zinfandel, USA 2020 (£8, Marks & Spencer) A fun fact about California wine for your next quiz night: if the region were a country (as a small and somewhat ambitious independence movement in the state would like it to be), it would be the world’s fourth-largest wine producer after the big three of Italy, France and Spain. It is, therefore, easily the biggest non-European wine “country”, and is on its own responsible for 81% of the US’s total wine production, and a considerably higher proportion of its exports. And yet, for all its scale, I’ve never quite had the feeling its wines are treated with the same respect and affection afforded to the wines of Australia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa – let alone that shown to the big Europeans – on this side of the Pond. Much of the problem is down to the quality and style of the state’s cheaper, sickly sweet and artificial-tasting big-name brands. Indeed, sub-£10 pleasure is very thin on the ground, with M&S’s juicy bramble-jam-and-tea zinfandel a rare exception. Le P’tit Paysan P’tit Pape, Central Coast, California, USA 2018 (£30.82, nekterwines.com) If the starting point, price-wise, for good California wine is higher than any other wine country, it is at least somewhat lower than it used to be – and the standard of wines once you get to that point is very much comparable with the best of the rest of the world. Tasting a range of about 70 California wines available in the UK’s independent wine merchants recently, I was struck by the quality – and diversity – of California wines in the £20 to £30 bracket. That’s nobody’s idea of cheap, I realise, but then the luminous complexity of Alma de Cattleya Chardonnay, Sonoma County 2019 (£27.95, jeroboams.co.uk); the fragrant ripe red fruits of Varner Foxglove Pinot Noir, Central Coast 2017 (£19.25, bowlandforestvintners.co.uk); the spicy-berry succulence of Qupé Syrah, Central Coast 2018 (£22, thewinesociety.com); and the meaty-peppery savouriness of Le P’tit Paysan P’tit Pape are all at least as good if not better than comparably priced wines made from the same grape varieties in Burgundy or the Rhône Valley.  Chateau Montelena Calistoga Zinfandel, Napa Valley, USA 2016 (£42, grapesmith.co.uk) California’s other problem in the UK is that we tend to treat it (as, indeed, I have done here so far) as a viticultural monolith, when, as you would expect from a state of this scale, there’s at least as much geological and climatic variation as there is from region to region in France or Spain. Officially, there are now 142 American Viticultural Areas (the slightly less proscriptive US equivalent of French appellations d’origine contrôlées), in California, covering around 800miles from the deep southern San Pasqual Valley near San Diego to Willow Creek in far northern Humboldt County. Increasingly, over the past decade some of my favourite California wines have come from Pacific coastal and/or high elevation sites between those poles (see above). But my recent tastings showed there is still plenty of interest in the classic and best-known California region, the Napa Valley, where, in among some of the world’s more ludicrous overblown lifestyle products, are distinctive, complex, food-friendly wines such as Chateau Montelena’s Italian-esque zinfandel.

We went away and I spoilt things by starting fights and, consequently, he decided to end it. Up until this episode, I was a friendly, easy-going, non-confrontational person. The problem is that I don’t recognise myself any more. When the relationship finished, I was out of control. I had created so much drama and upset, mostly drink-fuelled.  I made accusations against him at his work and he nearly lost his job. I didn’t stop there. Overwhelmed by a compulsion and driven by anger, I messaged his friends and slated him on social media so much that he threatened legal action. I am scared about my unpredictability and lack of control. How can I be so full of hatred, vengeance and spite? My mother, who is dead, was a difficult person and it is her unpredictability that I think I am playing out. I don’t want to become her. I want it to stop. I could end up in court. I let such a good thing go and I will never find that again. Philippa’s answer I have hope because you have clarity about your situation. You are not blaming your ex and want to examine your own behaviour and impulses. This is commendable. You are on the right track. We want our children to lead their own lives, but that doesn’t mean we don’t feel deserted when they leave home. This may be a contributing factor to your recent behaviour change. You say: “I don’t recognise myself any more.” First, you need to rule out anything medical. Make an appointment with your GP and tell them exactly what has happened. It could be that a sudden drop in oestrogen, which happens during the menopause, has made you debilitatingly intolerant. Or perhaps you are on medication that is affecting you badly. It’s unlikely, but you may even have suffered some sort of brain damage so that your impulse control is shot. Perhaps alcohol is also causing you to lose control. Or it could be something else, or a combination of the above… so make that appointment. They can also refer you to a psychiatrist or mental health team. You mention insecurities. I expect this means you have a deep fear you will be abandoned and might need more reassurance than most, which can be experienced by others as overly demanding and may lead to arguments. When you do not get this extra reassurance, the desperation you feel can drive you to lash out. Alcohol may be fuelling this, too. You may have felt that your ex was the sole cause of your suffering. Your behaviour seems to say: “I hate you, don’t leave me.” You cannot manipulate or bully your way into a healthy relationship and, when the red mist clears, you know that. Maybe, when you were an infant or a child, it was only through extreme tantrums that you got the attention you craved, with negative attention feeling better than none – and recent events may have triggered this regression in you. Or, triggered by insecurity, as you say, you may feel compelled to act like your mother. Parents’ habits and reactions are often the blueprint for our own. You had nowhere to go to escape conflict with your mother but, of course, another adult can withdraw, and so your mother’s blueprint for close relationships fails you. When you start therapy, and I think you must, you may get angry that the therapist is only available to you at set times. You will probably want to punish them for not being there for you whenever you want, but with them you can work through this and find better ways of self-soothing and comforting yourself when you feel as though you are in danger of being rejected. It is one thing to feel vengeful and fantasise about vengeful acts and it is quite another to carry them out, and I’m afraid you crossed that line. I am, of course, sorry for your victim – you must for his sake delete him and his friends from your contacts and leave him to live his life in peace. But I am sorry for you, too. I think this episode has possibly reignited a very old wound of yours, maybe emotional abandonment by your parents? I strongly recommend forming a good working alliance with a therapist, but first visit your doctor. I would like you to know that I know of many psychotherapy clients who had a “I-hate-you-don’t-leave-me” pattern in relationships who went on to break that pattern and form great relationships. We have more than one chance to get our lives on the right track.

2/6/2022,"The Bank of England last week published a set of grim economic forecasts that project inflation will peak at over 7% this year and real household incomes will fall by an average of £1,000 by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, the energy price cap will have risen by hundreds of pounds over the same period. Without another Covid wave, it is the cost of living crisis and particularly its impact on families already struggling to meet their rent, put food on the table and pay their heating bills that will dominate people’s lives in the next two years. Yet Boris Johnson remains mired in the depths of political crisis, debilitated in his role as prime minister, while his potential successors are more concerned with their campaigns to succeed him than addressing the challenges faced by the country. Westminster politics reached a new nadir when, in order to try to shift focus from his own woes, he falsely accused Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute the child abuser Jimmy Savile, a made-up allegation with no grounds in reality. Savile’s victims have spoken out about their distress at seeing their abuse politicised by the prime minister in this way and the unfounded slur prompted the resignation of his long-serving policy chief, Munira Mirza, who accused him of “scurrilous” behaviour.  Johnson is no stranger to misinformation. He has made liberal use of it in the past – the Leave campaign he chaired made claims that the UK Statistics Authority later ruled “a clear misuse of official statistics”, while as prime minister he has repeatedly spread false information, lying about the implications of his Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. The UK Statistics Authority said his claim made in the House of Commons last Monday that crime had fallen by 14% was wrong. But for the prime minister to try to mislead the country about why the victims of a paedophile never saw justice for his own political advantage is despicable and shames the whole nation. Johnson’s behaviour has been met with a renewed sense of anger among ministers and his parliamentary party. Several senior aides resigned, to be replaced last night by hastily assembled replacements. And his relationship with the truth is now so loose that it is unclear how voters are supposed to distinguish between government announcements that are true or false statements designed to distract from the disintegration of his premiership. The government’s measures to address the rising cost of energy bills go nowhere near far enough. Low-income families have been at the sharp end of tax credit cuts and benefit freezes over the last decade, with many low-paid parents losing thousands of pounds a year as a result. The savings paid for income tax cuts that disproportionately benefited better-off households; they were a political choice made by successive Conservative chancellors, supported between 2010 and 2015 by the Liberal Democrats. The cuts have left less affluent households particularly vulnerable to this cost-of-living squeeze and are a large part of why child poverty rates have risen and growing numbers of people are using food banks. Government support to help with rising energy bills should be targeted at those who need it most, through the tax credit and benefit system. Instead, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has chosen to prioritise Conservative voters – and hence his own leadership prospects – by distributing it through a flat-rate, poorly targeted council tax rebate that 80% of households will benefit from; more than 40% of its value will go to households in the top half of the income distribution, while more than 600,000 low-income households will miss out. The £200 rebate for all households will be taxed back through a £40-a-year surcharge for the next five years, which will push today’s cost pressures into the future. This assumes rosier economic times are just around the corner. Yet Brexit, the great unacknowledged economic dampener, will continue to depress economic growth in the coming years, whether or not voters associate these costs with leaving the EU. Worse still, Brexit is very likely to widen the gap in economic performance between London and the south-east and the rest of the country. This will only further accentuate the impact of cuts in government grants that fund local services, which have hit the least affluent areas of the country much harder than areas that enjoy higher council tax and business rates revenues. The incremental measures in the government’s “levelling up” plan published last week will do very little to close the gap in investment and productivity; in 2021, the equivalent of just £32 per person was awarded from the Levelling Up Fund for the north of England, which pales in comparison with the £413 per person drop in council spending since 2011. This is the parlous situation in which the country now finds itself just over five years after a referendum that paved the way for Boris Johnson to become prime minister and irrevocably damage standards in public life. Whether he is forced out tomorrow or in a few months, a weakened Conservative party will remain consumed by its own internal politics while many already hard-pressed families face the worst threat to their economic wellbeing for many years.

2/6/2022,"The article based on an interview with Kenneth Branagh’s cousin ended with a touching remembrance of his ethnically cleansed Catholic neighbours, his final comment being “Northern Ireland can be a great place if they’d just leave us alone” (“‘I grew up with Branagh in Belfast: our childhoods haunt his new film’”, News). That is the kind of sentiment often heard from this country that sounds significant but is actually meaningless. Who is “they” and who is “us”? Was it all someone else’s fault? The “they” who put his Catholic neighbours out were his fellow Northern Irish Protestants. As the article makes clear, some of those Protestants could have in their turn been put out by Catholics. Notwithstanding the involvement of the British army, indigenous tit-for-tat violence was at the core of the Troubles and the reason it went on for so long. If “they” implies some outside influence, it was only the intervention of British, Irish and US politicians in support of home-grown peacemakers that eventually ended the Troubles in 1998. Northern Ireland can be a “great wee place” (as the saying goes) but only if we Northern Irish make it so. There is no “they”.Stephen ButcherTullaghgarley, Ballymena, Co Antrim  I’ve found that the worst workplaces for backstabbing and destructive forms of competitiveness are those where a trade union is weak or non-existent (“Are you a jerk at work?”, Magazine). A strong workplace union with a good union rep is still the best defence against malpractice, whether from colleagues or the boss. Working atmospheres improve dramatically where grievances are aired and taken forward collectively. People are then less likely to blame and undermine each other for things that are really the employer’s or government’s fault. If you’re being bullied or discriminated against, there’s someone who can provide advice and effective support. So join a union and get involved in the fight for a better deal. It could improve your workplace relationships no end.Lin ClarkBristol The interview with the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting (New Review) was interesting, but his dismissal of “the left” as “a bunch of people who were relatively recent joiners to the Labour party who didn’t understand its history or traditions or how you win elections” reveals his woeful (or wilful?) ignorance of politics outside England. He seems unaware that the Labour party in Wales has proved very successful in winning elections while adopting leftwing policies and viewpoints. There has been a Labour government in Wales since devolution. It is disappointing yet again for a senior English Labour politician to dismiss what has happened and is happening elsewhere in the UK, one reason why Welsh Labour party members increasingly feel the UK party is out of touch with them and their country. Such views are aiding the growing calls for independence, which, if achieved, would ensure perpetual Conservative governments in England. The Labour leadership in England would do well to think on this.Melanie LloydThree Crosses, Swansea In your critical survey of Boris Johnson’s claims of success on Covid and other issues (“We got the big calls right”, News), you rather downplayed the crucial point in relation to his purported Covid “success” – the number of Covid-related deaths, which are higher than any other country in Europe. Even today, although France has many more daily Covid cases, its daily death rate is still surpassed by the UK. Yes, the UK got off the mark quickly with the vaccination programme, which should have been a way of keeping our Covid deaths low, but this lead was frittered away by all the other mistakes the government made, some of which are detailed in your article. Journalists should be hitting Johnson with this fact, and the related statistics, at every opportunity, not letting him get away with his spurious Covid “success” claims.Carl GardnerLondon EC1 My thanks and support to Holly Williams for her clear, sensible analysis of whether or not to have children (“Why assume it’s a problem if a woman is child-free at thirty?”, Comment). I’m in my late 70s and among my friends are eight older women who, like me, have no children by choice. Only two have never been in a long partnership or marriage. We are happy with our choice, made for a range of reasons. We’re not selfish, child-haters, lonely or weird. We just have chosen not to have children.Paula JonesLondon SW20 Thank you, Nick Cohen, for your article on the disgrace that is the prison system in the UK (“How many more Charlie Todds must there be before our prison system is reformed?”, Comment). The way in which those in custody are treated, at whatever stage in their judicial process, is a stain on our society. Severe overcrowding and the self-defeating effect of short sentencing exacerbate the problem and vastly more could be done in the fields of education and training. Having volunteered for 10 years as a teaching assistant in a London prison, a role that Covid has made impossible with the abandonment of class teaching and 23-hour confinement, I have seen how dedicated, compassionate and expert educators have struggled in the wake of the pitiful lack of resources and managerial imagination to offer the teaching and personal support that can make such a difference to an inmate’s prison life and future after release. It is highly regrettable that so much prison education is provided by private companies that are more concerned with getting paid for filling seats and ticking boxes than for providing opportunities for inmates. It is high time that the public recognised the stupidity and the human and financial cost of our self-perpetuating blunt regime of punishment without care or vision.Steve St ClairPotters Bar, Hertfordshire The insightful article by Nick Cohen makes the point that the prison service is an unpopular posting for civil servants. It is, too, low in the estimation of politicians. Since the general election of 2010, there have been no fewer than eight ministers of justice. The incumbent reportedly had to be bribed with the mantle of deputy prime minister before he would take the job. In that time, there have been even more prisons ministers, some of whom have shown signs of understanding the need for major reform, but have not stayed in post long enough to do anything about it. The prison service is conspicuously lacking in stability and political leadership, and the chronic state of our prisons reflects this.Gordon CropperBarnet While I agree with the selection of the 10 places in the UK to make the most of a spectacular sunset (“The sky’s the limit”, Magazine), readers may be tempted to visit Hunstanton on the north Norfolk coast whose beach surprisingly faces west and therefore offers many glorious sunsets.Toby WoodPeterborough",News/From the Observer,There is no ‘they’ in Northern Ireland | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/letters-there-is-no-they-in-northern-ireland
2/6/2022,"The January jobs report from the US labor department is heightening fears that a so-called “tight” labor market is fueling inflation, and therefore the Fed must put on the brakes by raising interest rates. This line of reasoning is totally wrong.  Among the biggest job gains in January were workers who are normally temporary and paid low wages: leisure and hospitality, retail, transport and warehousing. In January, employers cut fewer of these workers than in most years because of rising customer demand combined with Omicron’s negative effect on the supply of workers. Due to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ “seasonal adjustment”, cutting fewer workers than usual for this time of year appears as “adding lots of jobs”. Fed policymakers are poised to raise interest rates at their March meeting and then continue raising them, in order to slow the economy. They fear that a labor shortage is pushing up wages, which in turn are pushing up prices – and that this wage-price spiral could get out of control. It’s a huge mistake. Higher interest rates will harm millions of workers who will be involuntarily drafted into the inflation fight by losing jobs or long-overdue pay raises. There’s no “labor shortage” pushing up wages. There’s a shortage of good jobs paying adequate wages to support working families. Raising interest rates will worsen this shortage. There’s no “wage-price spiral” either, even though Fed chief Jerome Powell has expressed concern about wage hikes pushing up prices. To the contrary, workers’ real wages have dropped because of inflation. Even though overall wages have climbed, they’ve failed to keep up with price increases – making most workers worse off in terms of the purchasing power of their dollars. Wage-price spirals used to be a problem. Remember when John F Kennedy “jawboned” steel executives and the United Steel Workers to keep a lid on wages and prices? But such spirals are no longer a problem. That’s because the typical worker today has little or no bargaining power. Only 6% of private-sector workers are unionized. A half-century ago, more than a third were. Today, corporations can increase output by outsourcing just about anything anywhere because capital is global. A half-century ago, corporations needing more output had to bargain with their own workers to get it. These changes have shifted power from labor to capital – increasing the share of the economic pie going to profits and shrinking the share going to wages. This power shift ended wage-price spirals. Slowing the economy won’t remedy either of the two real causes of today’s inflation – continuing worldwide bottlenecks in the supply of goods and the ease with which big corporations (with record profits) pass these costs to customers in higher prices. Supply bottlenecks are all around us. Just take a look at all the ships with billions of dollars of cargo idling outside the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, through which 40% of all US seaborne imports flow. Big corporations have no incentive to absorb the rising costs of such supplies – even with profit margins at their highest level in 70 years. They have enough market power to pass these costs on to consumers, sometimes using inflation to justify even bigger price hikes. “A little bit of inflation is always good in our business,” the chief executive of Kroger said last June. “What we are very good at is pricing,” the chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive said in October. In fact, the Fed’s plan to slow the economy is the opposite of what’s needed now or in the foreseeable future. Covid is still with us. Even in its wake, we’ll be dealing with its damaging consequences for years: everything from long-term Covid to school children months or years behind. Friday’s jobs report shows that the economy is still 2.9m jobs below what it had in February 2020. Given the growth of the US population, it’s 4.5m short of what it would have by now had there been no pandemic. Consumers are almost tapped out. Not only are real (inflation-adjusted) incomes down but pandemic assistance has ended. Extra jobless benefits are gone. Child tax credits have expired. Rent moratoriums are over. Small wonder consumer spending fell 0.6% in December, the first decrease since last February. Many people are understandably gloomy about the future. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey plummeted in January to its lowest level since late 2011, back when the economy was trying to recover from the global financial crisis. The Conference Board’s index of confidence also dropped in January. Given all this, the last thing average working people need is for the Fed to raise interest rates and slow the economy further. The problem most people face isn’t inflation. It’s a lack of good jobs.

2/6/2022,"The Australian soap Neighbours, which launched the international careers of countless local stars including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Margot Robbie and Guy Pearce, has been axed in the UK in a move likely to sound the death knell for the iconic show. The UK’s Channel 5 announced it would no longer air the program and unless it is picked up by another UK broadcaster the show will end its record-breaking 36-year run in August.  Australian broadcaster Network Ten says it is determined to save the show but it needs a new backer. Since 2008 the sun-soaked drama about the residents of the fictional cul-de-sac of Ramsay Street has been largely paid for by the UK broadcaster after it was no longer commercially viable for the Ten network to fund the Fremantle Media production alone. After a speculative story ran in UK tabloid The Sun over the weekend, Channel 5 said “Neighbours will no longer air on Channel 5 beyond this summer”. “It’s been a much-loved part of our schedule for more than a decade, and we’d like to thank the cast, Fremantle and all of the production team for their fantastic work on this iconic series,” a spokesperson said. “We’d also of course like to thank the fans for their loyal support of Neighbours across the years. “We recognise that there will be disappointment about this decision, however our current focus is on increasing our investment in original UK drama, which has strong appeal for our viewers.” Network Ten told the show’s cast and crew on Sunday that filming will be paused on Monday for a meeting and that they were looking for another broadcast partner. “As outlined in the email to Neighbours cast and crew, it is our intention to continue our association with Neighbours if another broadcast partner comes forward,” a Ten spokesperson said. “Network 10 has an ongoing commitment to the show, the cast and crew and is hopeful that Fremantle will find a new production partner. We will provide further updates as they become available.” The decision came as a surprise as the lives of the Ramsay Street characters still attracts 1.5 million UK viewers a day. First broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985, the network famously axed it before it went on to be a worldwide hit for Ten, which picked it up the following year. It is the longest-running drama series on Australian television and in 2005 it was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. Production company Fremantle has been approached for comment.",Arts/Television & radio,Neighbours needs good friends to survive after UK network axes iconic soap,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/06/neighbours-needs-good-friends-to-survive-after-uk-network-axes-iconic-soap
2/6/2022,"Australia strolled to victory in the second one-day international of the women’s Ashes, winning the overall series with a game to spare having retained the trophy in the previous outing. Until this point England had provided a good contest, but on Sunday were rolled for a paltry 129 after being sent in to bat at Melbourne’s Junction Oval and bowled out in 42.5 overs. Australia chased the score five wickets down in with nearly 15 overs to spare.  This was Australia’s first Ashes win at home in the multi-format style that combines 50-over, 20-over and Test cricket. Charlotte Edwards led England to a win in 2013/14, and Heather Knight’s 2017 team tied: the Australians went large on celebrations after retaining the trophy, only for England to win the final two matches. The same scenario was possible this time, England trailing 4-8 on points with two games to play, but none of the Australian players or staff from last time had forgotten that frustration. History never looked a chance to repeat. England began well enough, scoring at four runs an over through the first 10 and only losing Tammy Beaumont after edging Ellyse Perry. That wicket fell to a blinder, too – keeper Alyssa Healy diving to her right to have the ball nestle in the very tip of her glove webbing, turning mid-air to land on her left arm and protect the right, and stopping the catch jarring free. But new leg-spinner Alana King again had influence belying her experience, taking her first ODI wicket when trapping Lauren Winfield-Hill for 28 with a straight ball in the 11th over. Through King and left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen, the scoring dried up, 17 run in seven overs before Sciver lost patience and tried to launch Jonassen. Not to the pitch, she aimed at midwicket but delivered a top edge to cover. England’s most damaging striker had made 8 from 25 balls. Knight followed two overs later, leg before to Jonassen for 18, and as the innings went on England players remained mired at the crease. On a slower pitch that made the ball stick and grip, big shots were rarely viable, and nobody made the adjustment to drop the ball into gaps and run as required. Australia’s bowlers relentlessly hit a good length, preying on a lack of confidence from their targets. Out of 272 deliveries, England scored runs off the bat from 80 of them. Three wickets fell in successive overs from the 24th to the 26th: Perry hit Sophia Dunkley in front of middle stump and had Charlie Dean glove a short ball behind, while Danni Wyatt’s flying edge from Sutherland allowed Lanning at slip to take a diving one-hander that may have been better than Healy’s. Four balls past the halfway mark, England had laboured to 68 for 7. England keeper Amy Jones made 28 and spinner Sophie Ecclestone top-scored with 32, starting very slowly but gradually expanding their range, Jones most notably with the pull shot and Ecclestone running at Jonassen to loft a six. The pair put on 39 to at least take the innings from the abyss up to perhaps the middle bathypelagic zone. But Australia’s all-rounder Tahlia McGrath has the golden bat and the golden arm this season, and having been held back with the ball until the 40th over, she made up for the delay. She had Jones lbw third ball, Kate Cross the same sixth ball, albeit missing leg stump with England having used both their reviews, and Anya Shrubsole edging behind: McGrath had three wickets for four runs in 3.2 overs. King’s 10 overs returned 1 for 23, Perry took 3 for 12 from seven, and Jonassen 2 for 25 from nine. Perry with the bat is made for games like this, anchoring the innings with a fluent 40. One positive for England was the work of Kate Cross, who bowled Lanning after beating her with seam movement for the second match running, and who used a similar ball to dismiss McGrath. Cross also bent her right wrist horribly while diving in the field, but eventually carried on bowling and produced a direct hit to run out Perry. But even though five Australian wickets fell, so modest was the chase that this was never a concern. Again, England are left to wonder what their bowlers might have achieved had their batters come to the party. This time around, the Australians can celebrate without reservation.",Sport/Sport,Australia win Women’s Ashes series after miserable England batting display,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/australia-win-womens-ashes-series-after-miserable-england-batting-display
