3/9/2022,"The idea that the Coalition can borrow money to build car parks in marginal seats but must “save up” money to build up an emergency relief fund is absurd. It’s not based on any sound principle of economics, finance or even politics. It’s purely driven by the prime minister’s need for a regular flow of “announceables”. While the PM is in Lismore on Wednesday to declare a national emergency, and announce flood funding, Australians – and in particular disaster-stricken communities – are growing tired of his “announce early, announce often” modus operandi. Scott Morrison’s latest problem is that his rhetorical support for small government has crashed into the climate changed reality of what communities like Lismore need in the days after their unprecedented floods, and what those in places like Bega are still waiting for years after their unprecedented bushfires. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world, but while there’s no shortage of money to fund the $16bn-a-year stage three tax cuts for our highest income earners, when it comes to helping families and businesses recover from the complete devastation of record floods and fires, apparently we need to hasten slowly. Rather than rushing jobkeeper money out the door the way they did to help the likes of Harvey Norman, when it comes to climate-induced disasters it seems the Coalition thinks we need to save for a rainy day. The problem is that it’s already pouring. Like the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the IPCC and the Australian insurance industry, the Morrison government knows that cyclones, storms, floods and fires have already become more common, more intense and more expensive. That’s why they announced a $10bn insurance fund to help subsidise the cost of insurance in politically powerful far north Queensland. The National party may house most of the climate sceptics in the federal parliament, but it doesn’t stop them demanding public cash to help their constituents deal with climate impacts. There is no economic reason the Australian government needs to “save up” billions of dollars in a disaster relief fund. Even if it had wanted to prepare, the time to start saving was back when John Howard was prime minister. If the Coalition knew the disasters were coming (which they did) and thought balancing the budget was important (which they do) then they should have started scrapping fossil fuel subsidies and stockpiling our pennies in their “special funds” decades ago. But now, like firefighters trying to save water during a bushfire, we have a government telling people who are still homeless after the 2020 bushfires to keep waiting. Things are only going to get worse. Climate change isn’t caused by accident, it takes decades of careful planning and more than $10bn a year in Australian fossil fuel subsidies. While a carbon price raised a lot of money and reduced a lot of emissions, such economic orthodoxy remains too radical for Australian debate. However, removing the billions of dollars Australia spends on oil, gas and coal subsidies would provide a big price signal and an enormous flow of annual revenue needed for a genuine climate adaptation fund. That is, if we really wanted one.

Qatar, the second biggest exporter of LNG behind Australia, collects 20 times as much tax from their gas exports than we do ours. Australia Institute research estimated that a measly $1 a tonne levy on the carbon dioxide embodied in our fossil fuel exports would raise over $1.5bn a year. Although the Coalition’s subsidies largesse wasn’t enough to drive a “gas-led recovery”, Putin’s war against Ukraine has certainly filled gas industry coffers. The people of Ukraine and Russia bear the cost of war and sanctions. Companies around the world are walking away from their Russian investments; and yet the share price of Australian frackers has surged. There is little the Australian government can do to prevent the price of imported petrol from rising, but there’s no reason that our gas exporters need to hang on to the profits that have fallen in their lap. A windfall gains tax on the Australian gas industry is yet another source of revenue that a government that belatedly wants to “stockpile emergency relief funds” could tap. But it won’t. Just as there is no shortage of money for car parks and income tax cuts, there is no actual shortage of money to help those who have lost everything in recent bushfires or floods. Who we elect determines what problems we solve. The Coalition has made it clear it believes the “burden” of income tax on those earning over $200,000 a year is more pressing than the burden of whole communities being destroyed. Likewise, it believes that subsidies to prop up the fossil fuel industry are more pressing than subsidies for renewables or climate adaptation. While some bookies have suggested that the voters of Lismore agree with the Coalition’s priorities, time will tell if recent events change their minds.

3/9/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s invoking of the Churchillian legend to appeal for British help in repelling the Russian invasion of Ukraine was irresistible for most of the front pages on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president’s unprecedented video vow to “fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets” brought MPs to their feet to applaud – an equally unprecedented ovation in the Commons chamber where Britian’s wartime leader made his some of his most acclaimed orations. The Mail declares him a “Commons hero” and uses one of his most defiant lines as the headline: “We will fight until the end”. The Express also salutes Zelenskiy’s “inspirational” and “historic” Commons speech with the headline: “We’ll fight in forests, fields and on shores”. Tomorrow's front page: We'll fight in forests, fields, and on shores#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/hn4XKRnHFD The Guardian carries a picture of the packed chamber on its front pages and the headline “We will fight until the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost”, although it leads with “‘Blow to Putin’: Britain and US ban Russian oil”.

You become so used to politics as theatre, and suddenly the actors are also devastated, also mystified as to what comes next.” The FT also likes the economic warfare angle and has the headline “US bans Russian oil as shelling forces Ukraine to halt fresh evacuation bid”. The Mirror’s headline is “We will never surrender”, although that is one famous Churchill line that Zelenskiy didn’t actually use. The Times uses a picture of the Commons chamber but leads with the suggestion by Poland – since quashed by the Americans – that Zelenskiy’s government could be given its old Soviet-era MiG jets. “Ukraine to get Nato jets”, its splash head reads. The Telegraph also leads with that story – “Poland offers fighter jets for Ukraine” – and inside has a sketch saying that “in a Parliament full of wannabe Winstons, it was humbling to encounter the real thing”.

3/9/2022,"The Australian energy minister, Angus Taylor, has criticised “activists” for opposing new oil and gas development in the Beetaloo Basin, declaring European nations are now regretting not pursuing a “gas-fired recovery”. After the United States banned Russian oil imports in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and the United Kingdom said it would phase them out by year’s end, Taylor told Sky News Australia that Australia had been correct to continue expanding fossil fuel development. Noting there had been an underinvestment in new supply of oil and gas around the world, Taylor said Australia had “kept our foot on the accelerator”. “We’re investing in new supply for gas and oil in places like the Beetaloo Basin, where there is enormous potential – we’ve kept our foot on the accelerator here in Australia because we know that is the right thing,” Taylor said on Wednesday. “I tell you what, I bet a number of countries in Europe right now wish they’d had a gas-fired recovery.” Taylor said developing the Beetaloo would put “Australia back to a position of having more upstream oil as we traditionally had from the Bass Strait”. “You know, there’s been a lot of people trying to block the Beetaloo Basin from being developed … we’ve had lots of activists trying to stop it. They are getting in the way of a sensible pathway for energy which delivers affordable reliable energy as we bring our emissions down.” Because of the climate risks associated with the development, last year more than 60 leading climate scientists issued a dire warning over the plan to frack the Beetaloo Basin, saying it must be halted if the Northern Territory government cannot meet a promise to fully offset emissions. Days of driving rain has resulted in catastrophic floods in the south-east of Queensland, northern New South Wales and in Sydney suburbs. The current disaster has reopened a national debate about the adequacy of Australia’s climate policies and the level of resourcing committed to mitigation and adaptation, given scientists have warned repeatedly some of the effects of climate change are now likely irreversible. During a visit to the disaster zone in the north of NSW on Wednesday, Scott Morrison declared a national emergency. Last year, the world’s leading energy organisation warned that exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop, and no new coal-fired power stations can be built if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The latest assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released only last week, warned of “cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts on cities, settlements, infrastructure, supply-chains and services due to wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea level rise”. As flood waters surged in south-east Queensland and down the coast of NSW, the IPCC noted the socio-economic costs arising from climate variability and change were continuing to increase. “Extreme heat has led to excess deaths and increased rates of many illnesses.” It said nuisance and “extreme coastal flooding” had increased due to sea level rise, high tides and storm surges”. The Climate Council has also called on the Morrison government and other political parties to acknowledge the climate crisis is driving worsening disasters, including the current “megafloods”. Oil prices had already risen sharply before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the geo-strategic tensions has created additional price shocks for key commodities. The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, told a business summit on Wednesday the price of gas in Europe had doubled since the start of February, and oil prices were up by 40% as were thermal coal prices. Taylor was asked on Wednesday whether Australia would join the boycott of Russian oil by the United States and the United Kingdom. He said “practically speaking” Australia was already part of the boycott because of the purchasing decisions by global oil giants. He said only 1.5% of Australia’s crude oil stocks came from Russia, so the boycott would not have a significant impact on Australian bowser prices. The government has been criticised for failing to secure a substantial local standby supply of fuel to ensure continuity of consumer and business activity during global crises. But Taylor insisted Australia had sufficient local fuel reserves. He said Australia had 89 days of stock “according to the definition we use”.",News/Australia news,Angus Taylor attacks Beetaloo Basin activists and says Australia right to expand fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/angus-taylor-attacks-beetaloo-basin-activists-and-says-australia-right-to-expand-fossil-fuels
3/9/2022,"The de-facto leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have declined to arrange calls with US president Joe Biden in recent weeks as the US and it allies have sought to contain a surge in energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the Wall Street Journal, citing Middle East and US officials, both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan have been unavailable to Biden after US requests were made for discussions. “There was some expectation of a phone call, but it didn’t happen,“ a US official said of a plan for Saudi Prince Mohammed and Biden to speak. “It was part of turning on the spigot [of Saudi oil].” Last week, OPEC+, which includes Russia, declined to increase oil production despite western entreaties. But reports of frigid communications come as the Biden administration seeks to increase oil supply after formally banning Russian oil imports on Tuesday, pushing oil prices to $130 a barrel, the highest level in 14 years. Relations between the US and Saudi Arabia have chilled during the Biden administration over American policy in the Gulf region. Issues include the revival of the Iran nuclear deal; lack of US support for Saudi intervention in Yemen’s civil war and its refusal to add Houthis to its list of terrorist groups; US help with a Saudi civilian nuclear program; and legal immunity for Prince Mohammed, who is facing lawsuits over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit-team in its Istanbul consulate four years ago. During Biden’s election campaign he vowed to treat the kingdom as a “pariah” state, saying there is “very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.” Earlier this week, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said there were no plans for the Biden and Prince Mohammed to talk soon, and no plans for the president to travel to Riyadh. Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the US, confirmed strained relations between the two countries. “Today, we’re going through a stress test, but I am confident that we will get out of it and get to a better place,” Al Otaiba predicted. The two Gulf nations are regarded as the only global suppliers with capacity to pump more oil to ease the price surge. Senior US officials with the national security council and state department had reported travelled to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in recent weeks to make direct US representations. The Journal, however, reported that Biden had spoken with Prince Mohammed’s 86-year-old father, King Salman, on 9 February. On the call they affirmed their countries’ strategic and economic partnership. The UAE’s ministry of foreign affairs said Biden and Sheikh Mohammed call would be rescheduled.",News/US news,Saudi Arabia and UAE leaders ‘decline calls with Biden’ amid fears of oil price spike,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/saudi-arabia-and-uae-leaders-decline-calls-with-biden-amid-fears-of-oil-price-spike
