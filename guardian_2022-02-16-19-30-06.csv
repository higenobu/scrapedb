2/16/2022,"Prince Andrew is facing fresh calls to be stripped of his Duke of York title after agreeing an undisclosed financial settlement with a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17. The surprise out-of-court agreement means Prince Andrew makes no admission of guilt over the claims made by Virginia Giuffre, which he had repeatedly denied and only weeks ago vowed to fight in a US civil trial.  The Queen last month stripped Andrew of his military affiliations and royal patronages in an attempt to distance the royal family from the allegations. However, he has kept his Duke of York title. The duke, 61, has held the title since the day of his former marriage to Sarah Ferguson, on 23 July 1986, and it is a role traditionally created for the monarch’s second son and held for life. But there were growing calls on Wednesday for him to be stripped of the title. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, said Andrew’s involvement in the sexual assault allegations had been a “source of deep hurt and embarrassment” for many people in the city. She said: “Although it is a relief that Prince Andrew has finally acknowledged and expressed regret for his close association with a convicted sex offender and sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, his long delay in doing so and initial response to the charges and Ms Giuffre have been a source of deep hurt and embarrassment to many people across the city. “Carrying a title does create an ambassadorial relationship with that place, and for somewhere with a global reputation, such as York, this is extremely important. It is to be welcomed that he has now pledged to support the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and its victims. “To demonstrate his seriousness in this endeavour, and his respect for those affected by abuse and the people of our city, I would ask that his first act of contrition is to confirm his support for the withdrawal of his ducal title.” The Queen alone cannot remove titles of peerage. Any attempt to remove the title would have to be led by parliament, through a statute passed by both the House of Commons and the Lords. The city’s council also said it would write to MPs to express its concern and discuss “any possible ways of ending Prince Andrew’s connection to York”. A poll by the local newspaper the Press last month found that 88% of the 460 respondents wanted the Duke of York to relinquish his mantle. Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor and the city council’s executive member for culture, leisure and communities, said after the out-of-court settlement: “Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, this should be the end of his direct link with our great city. “York’s unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city’s legacy, history and a great source of pride. Buckingham Palace and the government must consider the implications of the troubling allegations moving forward.” Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said on Wednesday the decision on Andrew’s titles “rests obviously with the palace in the future”. Asked if the Duke of York should be allowed to represent military regiments, he told Sky News: “Well I don’t think he represents any of them at the moment, I think the palace took a decision that those titles were to be removed from him, so I think he is effectively acting now as a private citizen in so far as both addressing the challenges and the allegations.” He added: “There’s been a, obviously, a payment and I think that is where he currently remains, that the decision on titles rests obviously with the palace in the future, but I think it’s been pretty clear that this settlement is a recognition that he wants to bring this to a close and also recognise as his statement says the suffering and the challenges that the victims have been through as a result of their allegations and their stand against the exploitation by [Jeffrey] Epstein.”",News/UK news,Prince Andrew facing fresh calls to be stripped of Duke of York title,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/prince-andrew-facing-fresh-calls-stripped-duke-of-york-title-virginia-giuffre
2/16/2022,"The intimate auditorium of the Seven Dials Playhouse becomes the Manhattan branch of the theatre-crowd hangout Joe Allen, complete with audience members seated at tables on stage, for Mark Gerrard’s ode to the lives and loves of Broadway fanatics. Steve will be catnip for anyone who ever used show tunes to cope with – or distract from – a crisis. “What sort of God could allow the movie version of Mame?” demands Steven (David Ames), over-the-hill at 47 as he downs vodka stingers à la The Ladies Who Lunch. Namesakes abound, from his possibly unfaithful partner, Stephen (Joe Aaron Reid), with whom he has a child, to the waiter Esteban (Nico Conde), who materialises to dispense wisdom and twinkle charmingly. A framed picture of another Stephen – the late Sondheim – watches over them like a guardian angel; this production is dedicated to him, and his lyrics are the lingua franca of a group that extends to Carrie (Jenna Russell), who is delighted to find that her cancer blog has been optioned by Hollywood.  The six-strong ensemble hit convincing notes of strain and struggle as the friends doing what they can to pretend they are still young: sleeping around, sexting, conducting an experiment in throuple-dom. Aside from one clunky scene showing Stephen juggling multiple texts and phone calls, the staging and writing zing nicely. It’s just a pity that Gerrard never quite breaches his characters’ defences as, say, Terrence McNally might have done. Andrew Keates’s production is smooth: a rotating disc within the stage provides views of the action from every angle during Steven’s fraught birthday dinner. Like the play, it goes around in circles entertainingly even if it never quite arrives anywhere new.

2/16/2022,"The settlement agreed between Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew over alleged sexual assault will leave the public to decide who they believe, according to a top US lawyer working with several victims of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The settlement draws to a close the civil lawsuit filed in the US in August last year by Giuffre against the Queen’s second son, in which she accused the prince of sexually abusing her after she was trafficked by his friend Epstein when she was 17.  Andrew has consistently denied the allegations. Although the move is seen as a remarkable turnaround, Gloria Allred said the statement outlining the settlement did not constitute an admission of guilt and would have been “carefully negotiated by both sides”. Andrew acknowledged only that Giuffre was “a victim of abuse”, but did not state who perpetrated the abuse, what it entailed or when it took place, she said. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This case will be dismissed and each will go their own way and he’ll never end up testifying under oath and the public will just have to decide who they believe. “Lawsuits are war, but a settlement means both sides are seeking peace. There will be peace now but this case will be remembered for many years to come.” Allred, who is representing 20 of Epstein’s victims, said settling meant that the only way Giuffre would be able to talk about what happened in future would be by filing a police report, or if criminal charges were brought she could publicly testify in a court of law. “Short of that we won’t hear Virginia being able to make statements about her allegations with Prince Andrew; that ship has sailed,” she said. She added that the terms of the settlement remained unclear, since although Andrew pledges to make a “substantial donation” to Giuffre’s charity, he doesn’t say how much or how it will be funded, or whether she will personally receive compensation. She speculated that Andrew may have had to pay more in order to avoid apologising. Giuffre and her legal team were likely to see a substantial settlement as vindication and sending a signal that her claim was legitimate, as is customary in such cases, but it also left the defendant with the opportunity to deny culpability, Allred said. “A defendant could say: ‘It’s not a vindication at all, I just wanted to get rid of the case, I don’t need this in my life, but I’m not admitting anything.’” She also claimed that the fact Andrew’s lawyers had echoed Giuffre’s demand for a jury trial last month had been to secure “better PR” rather than a sign of confidence in his case, since “he didn’t have a choice” in the matter: in the US, if one side requests a jury trial this is usually accepted. Other US attorneys representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein have hailed the settlement as a “victory” for survivors, with one claiming the royal’s “arrogance” stood in the way of settling sooner. Robert Lewis, a New York-based lawyer for Sarah Ransome, who was abused at the age of 22 and settled a lawsuit with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2018, told the Guardian he felt the victims were empowered by the settlement, which showed they had “been heard, and were no longer silenced”. He said that defendants such as Andrew “think the law on some level applies only to everybody else”, and was surprised that the prince and his legal team hadn’t settled earlier. Lisa Bloom, an attorney for several of Epstein’s victims, said the settlement was likely to amount to millions of dollars and represented a “monumental victory” for Giuffre.",News/UK news,"Prince Andrew lawsuit: public will have to decide who to believe, says US lawyer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/prince-andrew-lawsuit-virginia-guiffre-public-will-have-to-decide-who-to-believe-says-us-lawyer
2/16/2022,"One day in 1958, Brion Gysin had a transcendental experience on the way to Marseille. The flickering of sunlight through avenues of trees along the roadside and the speed of the bus he was riding proved optimal, or so he thought, to put him in a hallucinatory dreamlike state. “An overwhelming flood of intensely bright patterns in supernatural colours exploded behind my eyelids: a multidimensional kaleidoscope whirling out through space,” Gysin recalled. “I was swept out of time. I was out in a world of infinite number. The vision stopped abruptly as we left the trees.”  Gysin, an avant-garde artist and poet perhaps best known for the textual cut-up method that inspired David Bowie to creatively randomise his lyrics, was determined to create a gizmo that could induce others to experience what he had during his bus trip – namely vivid illus­ions of moving patterns when flickering lights shone through closed eyelids. After conversations with the novelist William Burroughs and Cambridge maths student Ian Sommerville, Gysin devised a cylindrical device he named the Dreamachine, which he described as the “the first art object to be seen with the eyes closed”. The Dreamachine would awaken humanity, Gysin hoped, from cultural stupefaction and liberate us from being passive consumers of mass-produced imagery. Gysin hoped it would replace every TV in every home in the US and make us creators of our own cinematic experiences. You may have noticed that didn’t happen. Sixty-four years later, Jennifer Crook, an art producer and director of Collective Act, which specialises in delivering challenging events in public spaces (she built – and burned – a 72ft (22 metre) community-built temple in a zone between Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, and catalysed a re-enactment of the largest rebellion of enslaved people in US history) has updated the Dreamachine for a our age. Thanks to Netflix and social media timelines, we risk becoming more screen-fixated and experientially passive than Gysin imagined in his worst nightmares. Collaborating with neuroscientists, philosophers, Turner prize-winning artists and trance musicians, among others, Crook has created a 21st-century Dreamachine that, later this year, will be offering visitors free transcendental experiences without the need for illegal hallucinogenic drugs. Visitors to the machine will enter a room and sit in a circle before closing their eyes. Crook invited architecture collective Assemble to create an environment optimal for inducing transcendental experiences, but one where the technology was hidden and the potential for inducing mind-bending hallucinatory states optimal. Serendipitously, Anthony Engi Meacock from Assemble did his master’s thesis on Gysin’s Dreamachine, so knew where Crook was coming from. Moreover, Assemble specialises in discreet interventions, winning the Turner prize in 2015 for their project in Liverpool’s Four Streets community, refurbishing and beautifying run-down houses. The success of that project in Toxteth was marked by the very near invisibility of their signature contribution. Meacock estimates he has spent 40 hours inside various iterations of Dreamachine and that the nature and intensity of the experiences he has had are altered by the environment. “Levels of comfort, whether you were lying or sitting, how visitors were located to the light source, all of these completely changed the nature of the experience generated by the strobing effects.” While Gysin’s Dreamachine, rather like Wilhelm Reich’s near-contemporaneous “orgone accumulator”, was designed to stimulate intense, subjective experiences, Crook’s Dreamachine is a collective version. “Gysin created an object, I wanted to create an experience,” says Crook. “Both an intensely subjective one, rather like the transcendental one he had on the bus, but also a collective one.” In this, she was inspired by going to a 2014 Royal Festival Hall gig by Jon Hopkins, an electronic musician who has collaborated with Brian Eno and Coldplay, and who has supplied a musical soundscape for the new Dreamachine. “It’s hard to describe what happened,” she recalls, “but one guy in our row started dancing, and then everybody seemed to be dancing in the aisles. It just felt like this transcendental moment.” Hopkins, whose latest album, Music for Psychedelic Therapy, gives a sense of his lifelong interest in accessing alternative states through music, yoga and meditation, stresses the value of undergoing such transcendental experiences in group settings. “It’s like the difference between singing solo and in a choir. There’s an exponential improvement to the experience in the collective.” But what is the value of achieving these alternative states? “The important thing about these practices is the loss of ego and the beginning of shared experience,” says Hopkins. “These are alternatives to our problem-solving, scientific consciousness of reality. I think we evolved to have other forms of consciousness. For indigenous tribes in the Amazon, those alternative consciousness states become part of the shared experience of everyday life. We live in a society that doesn’t believe in that.” Hopkins believes that, after the past two years, we yearn for collective experiences and deeper personal ones: the Dreamachine may provide both. “There has been a decline in general mental health and a yearning to live differently. In my opinion, looking inside ourselves is where we find the answer.” Anil Seth, professor of computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, hopes the Dreamachine project will highlight for the British public the hard problem of consciousness and the rich inner diversity of human mental lives. “We’re used to, as it were, external diversity – skin colour, different belief systems. When people report what they have experienced in the Dreamachine, it shows us something that has obsessed me for years: internal diversity. Your experience of blue may be different from mine, but language suggests they are the same. In fact, maybe language works because it papers over these differences.” Seth has become involved to stimulate public interest in what consciousness is and how perception works, and to invite an audience to take part in one of Britain’s biggest scientific research projects. A “perception census” compiled from visitor questionnaire responses is aimed at shining a light on our inner perceptual inner worlds. “It will be citizen science on an unprecedented scale,” says Seth. He hopes that 100,000 or more visitors will be involved when Dreamachine tours to London, Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh this year as part of Unboxed – the £120m festival commissioned by Theresa May’s government to celebrate British ingenuity. Dreamachine will also be involved in A New Direction, the schools project that resulted in Steve McQueen’s Year 3, an exhibition of photographic portraits of every year-three London schoolchild, which resulted in more primary school pupils than ever before thronging Tate Britain. Pupils will be invited to reflect on the issues the Dreamachine raises. “Seven year olds naturally ask profound questions about consciousness and perception, so I anticipate they will find Dreamachine really engaging,” says Seth. But what is going on when flickering lights induce the hallucinatory, even psychedelic, experiences that Gysin described? “Normally we see with the visual cortex,” says Seth. “The geometric and kaleidoscopic images that people see might be the visual cortex revealing its structure to us. These flickering light effects may be inducing us to see the cortex. It’s not by any means certain, but computational models suggest as much.” Like Gysin, Crook hopes her Dreamachine can revolutionise humanity. Eyes wide shut, we might open the portals of perception wider than ever. “We have this big organ that’s capable of so much and we’re using so little of it. My dream is that Dreamachine could be a new kind of secular temple. I really want it to change the world.” Dreamachine will tour to Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London as part of the Unboxed festival.

2/16/2022,"On the Night of Power, the holiest night of Ramadan, the grandiose solemnity of al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem acquires an atmosphere of spiritual fervour, as hundreds of thousands of Muslim worshippers congregate at this revered site. The sound of prayers hums among the gorgeous walls of the multiple mosques within the complex, all richly decorated with mosaics and marble. Shot on this special occasion, Abrar Hussain’s documentary interweaves awe-inspiring aerial footage of al-Aqsa with intimate shots of the faithful. Many of them are Palestinians from the West Bank who endure numerous Israeli security checkpoints, adding excruciatingly long hours to their journey. Indeed, the omnipresence of the Israeli occupation looms large over the convivial and moving scenes of worshippers praying or breaking bread at the end of their fast. Efforts to construct more washroom facilities around the site have been thwarted by Israeli authorities, creating health risks for those in attendance.  Nevertheless, a touching sense of solidarity arises from the sections dedicated to the countless volunteers who work tirelessly to ensure the safety of the evening. Considering the dynamism of their testimonials, Hussain’s documentary could perhaps have taken a more observational approach; instead, it relies on a booming, old-fashioned voiceover that describes everything that happens on-screen. Given how the landscape of contemporary film-making has changed, it feels especially outdated to use the narration to force feed viewers instead of letting the images speak for themselves. However, in spite of its pedestrian style, this documentary is a valuable window into the lengths that Palestinians have to go to simply to celebrate their faith.

2/16/2022,"No one is especially shy about the anger they feel about the partygate shambles in Downing Street, nor should they be. We are all a bit more discreet, though, about how enjoyable it is to watch the prime minister’s downfall. It hits every base of funny, from the slapstick to the surreal; a comedy home run. But there is something delicious here that is richer than humour. To see a chancer unmasked is a very particular pleasure. Likewise, I would happily give you my thoughts on the international tennis elite and their stance on vaccination. But why it was so droll to see Novak Djokovic detained in and then deported from Australia I would struggle to say; I never had anything against the man.  Such is schadenfreude, the piquant German compound at once so broad and so precise. It is usually defined as the taking of pleasure in another’s misfortune. You don’t have to know them personally; indeed, sometimes it is better not to. The unfortunate object doesn’t have to deserve their lot, although it is so much more enjoyable when they do that we will often reverse-engineer our perceptions to make them deserve it. The most similar words in English are probably “gloating” and “crowing”, but those convey a vocalised delight. Schadenfreude is more of a private pleasure, which we would prefer not to admit. Presently, of course, we don’t have to say it out loud, since we are all feeling the same thing at the same time. Welcome to the age of collective schadenfreude – the global in-joke. On the one hand, this is a wonderful thing, the first green shoots of social harmony. On the other, “it is a kind of sadistic joy”, says Dr Aaron Balick, a psychoanalyst and the author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking. “If you allow yourself enough empathy and compassion, you’re not going to be able to enjoy it.” So, can anything positive come out of our basest instincts? The most recent thinking about schadenfreude is distilled in a 2019 paper by the academic psychologists Shensheng Wang, Scott Lilienfeld and Philippe Rochat. They argue that there is not one force at play here, but three. The first element is social comparison, rooted in what Balick describes as “the way people manage their own egos, how they wish to perceive themselves as good enough or sometimes better than others … it is a reward experience, that feeling of superiority when someone else fails”. This is the schadenfreude that is rooted in envy or resentment, the kind you would be likely to feel towards a friend who was also a rival. It is more intense than the kind you might feel towards someone you don’t know. Using Boris Johnson as an example, his tribulations excite no satisfaction of envy in me, since I don’t use him as a benchmark, either morally or in terms of achievement. This pleasure is an individual one – it would be hard to build any collectivity around resentment, driven as it is by ego. Plus, we wouldn’t readily admit it – even to ourselves. Second, schadenfreude is motivated by the establishment of intergroup dynamics. This is broadly characterised as aggression – enjoying someone’s failure as a way of placing them outside your group, thereby strengthening the bonds within your group. Again, this sounds like one of the uglier faces of human nature, but it depends on what values you are clustering around. If you are uniting on the side of integrity and humanity, then there is a lot of galvanising joy to be had from collectively identifying people who are dishonest and inhumane and placing them outside your group. Alex Andreou, the co-host of the podcast Oh God, What Now? (formerly Remainiacs), draws a lot of optimism from this moment. “Just as Brexit went beyond traditional tribes, I think partygate is doing the same thing: it redefines the alignment. My only concern is that I don’t know that Labour is responding in a way that meets the mood and captures the feeling.” If that is true, it may be because you need a heightened sense of the absurd, and of self-parody, to fully enjoy the aggressive element of schadenfreude. Basically, you need to be able to say: “I, too, am a bit of an arsehole, but, come on, isn’t this intoxicating?” That kind of bubble-bursting self-criticism isn’t the Labour leader’s forte, but few politicians can claim that it is theirs, either. You have to go deep into Ken Clarke or Jess Phillips territory. It is also volatile, since the pleasure is extinguished immediately if there is a trace of compassion for the person at the centre. Take Allegra Stratton’s tearful resignation over the video in which she joked about a Downing Street party. “That didn’t make me happy in any way,” says Andreou. “I thought she was genuinely distressed. I can’t bring myself to celebrate that.” If you want to enjoy seeing someone in pain, they must come to represent something larger than themself. Stratton, having been the prime minister’s spokesperson (although not at the time of her resignation), worked as a symbol of the whole, but you had to determinedly avert your eyes from the fact that she was also a breathing, feeling human. Similarly, when news of the nth Downing Street party broke – the prime minister’s birthdaygate, when he was “ambushed” by cake – I experienced the totally unwanted emotion of sympathy. Not for him, obviously, but for Lulu Lytle, who has been immortalised as the purveyor of the most vulgar, post-imperialist fantasia, whose wallpaper will never again be considered except as a joke, who now has cake attached for the full Marie Antoinette (even though she had nothing to do with the baked goods). The scale of her public disaster is out of whack with her “crime”, which was merely to bod about being posh, meeting the strange demands of other posh people. This brings us to the third element of schadenfreude, the delicious twist that makes it disclosable to others, so that we can cluster around it like a log fire: cosmic justice. “When you get a homophobic preacher found in bed with a rent boy, or a religious moralist caught having an affair, it becomes: ‘See, everyone? We were right about those people,’” says Balick. “And then it elevates the in-group into something more righteous, more justice-oriented.” The external politics provide the requisite symmetry: if you want to believe the universe is steadily, invisibly working towards righting wrongs, then it has to look neat. The Johnsonian context was, as Andreou describes, “this strong feeling that the referendum was won with lies, and so we instinctively rejoice at lies becoming the instrument of his destruction. Exactly the same nexus of behaviour that was rewarded in 2016, and then rewarded again in 2019, has brought him down.” It is irrational in the sense that the universe doesn’t really do justice; there is no such thing as karma. Yet it is rational on a more basic level, what Andreou calls “legitimate gratification at the bad guy not winning all the time”. The punishment has to fit the crime not just in scale, but also thematically. There was no great buzz when Matt Hancock was busted for having an affair with an adviser; infinitely preferable would have been an affair with one of the PPE providers he had fast-tracked into multimillion-pound government contracts. We were cheated of our dramatic arc. The thirst for justice or fairness is a human trait, visible in babies of six months old. So, it is unsurprising to be satisfied by it, but what makes it so funny? The standup comedian Kate Smurthwaite explains: “Comedy, generally, is when something happens that we didn’t expect, but which does make sense. The great joy of schadenfreude is that we didn’t expect it, but it makes sense because they deserved it. It’s almost like a moment when we wonder if we actually can control things with our mind.” So, there is an element of self-mockery buried within – we are enjoying a sense of power that we know we don’t have in a well-ordered universe that we know doesn’t exist. But comedy can tip easily into cruelty – and the line between them can be blurred by your mood. “As a general rule, we can laugh if someone’s pride or ego is hurt,” says Smurthwaite. “If it’s their head, then either don’t laugh or wait till the ambulance has left.” It is a burning necessity, for the full schadenfreude experience, that the person starts out with very high status. There is no joy in watching the punctured pride of a no-mark. They need to be punished for something about which you are passionate, too, or at least something you can claim to believe in. “You get all your elements in one with Djokovic,” Balick says. “The collective witnessing of a person who is high status, getting their just deserts in the service of the vaccination argument that you care about.” But how productive is it, politically speaking? The political sociologist Paula Surridge counsels that we shouldn’t get too excited. “There is a body of literature, especially in the US, about ‘negative partisanship’. Voters aren’t motivated so much by love of their own side as dislike of the other. However, in our voting system, that doesn’t lead to a positive expression for another party. A strong anti-Conservative feeling will quite often lead that vote to segment.” Surridge argues that we are not all enjoying this moment for the same reasons – and many aren’t enjoying it at all. “People who voted Conservative in 2019 did so because they thought their areas were going to get better. I imagine some of them feel like they’ve been taken for fools and they won’t be delighting in the present moment. I don’t think it’s a good place for democracy, for them to feel like that.” For this moment to exist, we needed social media. In the first instance, to evidence our case. Then, Balick says, “there’s this added element of creativity – you can always find the perfect quote, or an old picture that’s directly related to the downfall. Once you have your meme behind you, you can really nail it.” There is much focus on the negative aspects of Twitter or Facebook, their echo chambers and rabbit holes, the brittle, raging impulses they seem to unleash in previously civilised people. While that is true, our (mistaken) sense that these communications are ephemeral unleashes a playful self‑disclosure, a readiness to admit ignoble feelings. That combination of openness, humour and self-deprecation on one side, and a shared quest for justice and fairness on the other, creates a sense of unity that is almost explosive. The only risk is that we enjoy it so much, and it is so ludic, that it goes the way of satire: the negative consequences we were enjoying so much evaporate as we sink, giggling, into the sea.",News/Science,‘The pleasure of a chancer unmasked’: why we are living in the age of schadenfreude,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/16/the-pleasure-of-a-chancer-unmasked-why-we-are-living-in-the-age-of-schadenfreude

2/16/2022,"“The visitors had played some shots unworthy of a Test side. In the tabloid versions, England’s performance was ‘shocking … inexcusable, almost beyond belief’ and ‘miserable … appalling … pathetic … awful.” Not a summary of England’s recent Ashes disaster, nor even a throwback to the not-so-nicey-90s: for this particular instance of English collapsibility you have to cast back to 1953-54 when an all-star MCC team was facing West Indies in what was supposed to be cricket’s unofficial world championship. It turned into a series as controversial and downright unpleasant as cricket has seen. Some who played in it – including Tom Graveney and Clyde Walcott – have argued it was more acrimonious than Bodyline. Curious, then, that so little has ever been written about it. Its legend was passed down by the increasingly unreliable memories of its leading players – by the club-circuit anecdotes of Fred Trueman or the scrupulously diplomatic memoirs of Sir Everton Weekes. It deserves to be more widely known and far better understood – not least because some of its most discordant notes still resonate in our current sporting and political climates. Today, players taking the knee before a game can cause conniptions; in 1954, a Guyanese cinema audience refusing to stand for the national anthem would have had the same effect.  David Woodhouse, who has just published an authoritative history of the tour, became hooked by the story from reading Len Hutton’s autobiography. “It was a typically dry telling, but something happened at every turn,” he says. Hutton got the tour off to a bad start when he announced there would be no fraternising with the opposition – after their pioneering series victory of 1950, the West Indies players considered this a mortal insult – “and ill will just built up from there. Charles Palmer, MCC’s player-manager, told me that there was an arrow coming every five minutes. He never knew where it was coming from, but he knew it was coming.” On the field there were bouncer wars, bowlers no-balled for chucking and batting collapses as thick and slick as mudslides. There was such animus towards the umpires (on the part of players and locals) that one was physically attacked, and two were summarily replaced – in one case, by the groundsman. Off the field, MCC’s players were accused of bad language and poor behaviour and chafed under their captain’s restrictive policies; while the West Indies’ selection policies set island against island and turned their own captain, Jeff Stollmeyer, into such a hate figure that at one point he requested a helicopter stand by to get him safely away from the ground. While the Englishcentric record of events has always concentrated primarily on the “who said what to whom” and who was most to blame, Woodhouse aims for a far more balanced and expansive view, foregrounding Caribbean voices and revisiting complex and even contradictory characters, like Stollmeyer. Seven years of research and writing allowed him to place the full gamut of detail within a rich social, racial and political history. “When you read in Wisden about the crowd rioting at the third Test in Guyana you wouldn’t know that the constitution had been suspended, that’s never alluded to,” says Woodhouse. Nor that on the first day of the Test Guyana’s elected nationalist leader, Cheddi Jagan, had returned home for the first time since British troops had removed him from office. As for the cricket, while it wasn’t pretty, the five-Test series was fought to the last gasp even after England went two-nil down. Within the canon of West Indies cricket, it has become something of a lost tour, says Santokie Nagulendran, host of the Caribbean Cricket Podcast. “There are two reasons why it’s not remembered vividly,” he says. “First, West Indies blew a 2-0 lead, which led to a decline in results after the euphoria of 1950. “But there’s also the issue that communication between the islands was so sparse that providing an overall narrative of tours that took place across numerous locations was difficult back then. And West Indies cricketing history is often fragmented into different viewpoints depending on what island or nation or race the storyteller is from.” Nagulendran is impressed with Woodhouse’s effort, particularly the number of sources he has drawn from. For Vaneisa Baksh, the Trinidadian cricket writer currently working on a biography of Frank Worrell, the book brings a welcome opportunity for a more “nuanced understanding” of what went on on the tour. “In the section where he details each day’s play, I found myself hanging on to the events as if I were a live spectator,” she says, laughing. She hopes to see more retelling of Caribbean cricketing narratives like this. “In the past histories have often been excavated by only one kind of shovel,” says Baksh. “Even when West Indians attempted to tell their stories, they did it through mainly English ghost writers and I have seen some narratives that used language and observations that seemed alien to the people supposedly expressing them.” Baksh and Nagulendran extol the multi-volume history From Ranji to Rohan in which Prof Clem Seecharan chronicles the game in Guyana. The work of Hilary Beckles should also be on the reading list of anyone searching for a decentred view of Caribbean cricket. Woodhouse admits he feels very conscious of the observation of Gordon Lewis, the great neo-Marxist historian, that it has been “part of the colonial burden” for West Indians to read about themselves in books written by outsiders. As he points out, one of the messages of the 1953-54 tour is that we all have a bias. “Sometimes we don’t see it,” he says, “and sometimes it’s one we’re very proud of.” Spin readers can get a discount for David Woodhouse’s Who Only Cricket Know at thenightwatchman.net for £19 + p&p (RRP £25) when they use coupon code SPINWOCK Good things come to those who wait. Last year, Mark Wood passed up the opportunity to compete in the IPL because of the time he’d miss with his young son. This week, he was the big-money-buy for Lucknow Super Giants, netting £735,000 in an auction where pace bowling stood out as the premium commodity. Last month, Wood was still considering pulling out of the IPL, unsure whether he wanted to submit himself to another round of biosecure bubbles. He has joked before that it’s substitute cuddles with Chris Woakes that has kept him going when he’s away from his family, so perhaps his new Giants teammate Jason Holder (bought for £855,000) should bear that in mind. But it was Liam Livingstone who – perhaps unsurprisingly – became the auction’s most expensive overseas player, joining Punjab Kings for £1.125m. His stock has risen faster than a Silicon Valley IPO – Rajasthan Royals got him for a bargain basement £75k last year. Not bad for someone who’s still yet to score an England contract. In other happy news the Women’s T20 Challenge, the three-team tournament with which we must be satisfied until a fully fledged women’s IPL emerges, is back in May, having been called off in 2021 (not because of Covid, but because India were touring Australia). While fixtures and venues are yet to be announced, we do know that the games will run alongside the men’s play-offs, in the hopes of copying the Hundred’s success in boosting viewership. “We want to build a long-term sustainable foundation for women’s cricket and that is about more than just prize money” – ICC chief executive Manu Sawhney wears his sensible shoes as he announces an increase of 75% in prize money for the 2022 Women’s Cricket World Cup, with eight teams taking home a share of $3.5m.

2/16/2022,"Rental prices across America have soared over the past year, with some cities experiencing average price hikes of up to 40%, leaving many renters stunned and grappling with either having to move to be able to afford rent or pay significantly more of their income to remain in their homes. Joshua Beadle of Sarasota, Florida, lived in a 950 sq ft loft apartment for four years for about $900 a month until about one year ago when the owner sold the building and he was forced to move.  He found a smaller, more expensive 700 sq ft apartment for $1,500 a month. After living there for one year, he recently received a lease renewal letter stating his monthly rent would be increased to $1,947. “Over the course of one year my rent has increased 116%. How does someone who works gigs and is making the same amount of money afford a price increase of $1,050 a month?” said Beadle. “Every month that I pay my rent I breathe a sigh of relief knowing I can live one more month, but I know that I am one emergency away from not being able to afford living expenses.” According to an analysis conducted by RedFin, rents in the US jumped 14% in December 2021 to $1,877 a month, the largest rise in more than two years. Some of the most affected cities included Austin, Texas, with a 40% increase in rental prices compared with a year previous, New York City at a 35% increase, and several metro areas in Florida exceeding over 30% increases in rental prices. There is less housing available for rent or sale now than anytime in the past 30 years, with supply shortages worsening, contributing to rising rental costs, inflation, and making home ownership more unattainable. For Beadle, his situation is now untenable. His $1,500-a-month rent was already a struggle for him to pay, and if late on rent payments he incurs a $100 fee. With the latest rental increase of nearly $450, he worries about his future in Sarasota, a community he’s lived in and helped build as a promoter and organizer for LGBTQ events over the years. “Now, I can’t even afford to live in the community that I helped to create,” added Beadle. “This is not OK, There needs to be an answer for the young, single people who are trying to survive and thrive. We can’t just be happy with being able to pay rent one more month not knowing if we will have a place to live next month.” Though rental prices in the US initially dropped due to the Covid-19 pandemic, prices rebounded in 2021 and increases quickly began to outpace pre-pandemic growth trends. These soaring costs – coupled with a broader surge in inflation – have wiped out any wage gains experienced by low-income Americans, as rental prices were already far outpacing wage increases in the US. Between 2001 to 2018, renter incomes grew by 0.5% while rental prices increased by 13%, leaving 20.4 million households, nearly half of all renters in the US, burdened by the cost of rent with more than one-third of their income going toward rent and utility bills. A report published by the Roosevelt Institute in November 2021 emphasized solutions for these soaring rent prices, including increasing the supply of affordable housing and expanding rights for tenants who are currently at the mercy of landlords and real estate developers without rent control and rent stabilization policies in place. “If we think that rent is a really core part of our inflation problem right now, which it is, then we really do need a more comprehensive approach,” said Dr Lindsay Owens, co-author of the report and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. Owens argued against solutions put forth by some economists seeking to rely on contractionary monetary policies such as raising interest rates through the Federal Reserve. “We advocate for an aggressive increase in supply and for the federal funding required to get that done,” said Owens. “But because we’re not going to see that happen quickly, and because when you have a supply shortage, landowners and landlords really have quite a bit of power because you don’t have a lot of options, we think rent control should be on the table to really take the edge off of those annual increases.” Without these comprehensive actions, the report notes, landlords, especially in markets where affordable housing supply shortages yield them significant power, will continue to hike rental prices, further burdening the incomes of renters and expanding their profits without any capital improvements to housing One week before his wedding in January 2022, Joey Texeira and his partner received a lease renewal from their landlord in New York City, with a 30% increase to rent of $750 a month for a one-year lease renewal or a 41% rent increase of $1,050 a month for a two-year lease renewal for an apartment they have lived in since December 2020. The lease renewal would start on 1 May. “We’re very stressed and don’t know exactly what we plan to do yet,” said Texeira. His husband was also unexpectedly laid off recently and their neighbors downstairs were recently priced out of the apartment building with a rental increase of $250 to $500 added to their monthly rent. “It’s criminal,” said Texeira. “Renters are completely unprotected. The only thing a landlord has to do is give proper notice in proportion to the percentage increase. Technically my landlord could have increased my rent 100% and there would have been nothing I could do. Renters need help and better protections.” Sabrina Marie DeAngelis, a tutor in Austin, Texas, recently experienced her rent increase from $920 to $1,440 a month for an apartment she has been living in since 2014, which she first rented for $675 a month. She was forced to accept the renewal with a monthly rental increase of $520, as she suffers from a disability that makes moving difficult and doesn’t have any family living nearby to help. DeAngelis tried applying for rental assistance benefits, but she didn’t qualify for assistance and Covid-19 rental relief funds in her area were already depleted by the time she applied. During the pandemic, DeAngelis decided to return to school to complete her master’s degree in hopes of increasing her income in the long term, taking a short-term cut in her income to attend school. “Now I’m forced to increase my work hours while going to school,” said DeAngelis. “My productivity at work and school has been terrible because I’m stretched thin on time. On top of that, almost all my income is going toward rent and bills.”",News/US news,Renters across US face sharp increases – averaging up to 40% in some cities,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/renters-rent-increases-us-lease
2/16/2022,"I’m going to let you into a little secret here. Whenever I’m feeling blue, one thing that will cheer me up without fail is looking at Tara Reid’s IMDb page. Not necessarily for the films that she’s made, but for the films that she’s about to make. Like Eric Roberts before her, Reid’s IMDb page contains a long, long list of movies in pre-production. And while Roberts might have her purely on numbers (he currently has some 70 films that are either filming or in pre- or post-production), Reid arguably has him on choices. She has a comparably piffling 18 titles in pre-production, almost all of them seem precision-designed to stretch the limits of plausibility to their very limits.  There isn’t room to go through a blow-by-blow of Reid’s upcoming work, but the ones I’m most looking forward to seeing are Bloodthirst (where she plays a vampire queen), Mayday 2 (where she plays an air marshal on a flight that becomes overrun with zombies), Aquatic Siege (“In the future, laws skyrocket. Without room, the government deports convicts into the ocean”), and Air Force Z (where there are also zombies, and also Tara Reid is the president). There is also a film called Ghostkiller, which has a plot far too convoluted to get into now, but needless to say the lead character is called Kyle Ghostkiller. However, the newest addition to Reid’s slate of forthcoming films is arguably the best. As revealed by Variety, Tara Reid has just signed on to play a British MI6 agent in a film called Cold Sun. Billed as “Cagney and Lacey with a difference”, Cold Sun will see Reid playing an inexperienced spy called Marsha Ravencourt, who teams up with an equally inexperienced Interpol agent to take down an international gang of murderous criminals. It’s obviously too early to say who this gang of murderous criminals will be, but the cast does include Vicki Michelle from ’Allo ’Allo and three different former EastEnders actors, one of whom is Shaun Williamson. Call it wishful thinking if you like, but this does make it sound as if Cold Sun will contain a scene where Tara Reid will fistfight Barry from EastEnders, and if that isn’t going to get bums on seats then I don’t know what will. And, while Cold Sun does have the potential to be utterly preposterous, I do genuinely hope it succeeds. Tara Reid will never be an A-list star, but you cannot for a moment question her work ethic. Her movies might not be classics, but the woman is knuckling down and making a living. Will I ever watch Baby Bulldog, the film she made in 2020 with Dean Cain? No. Will I ever watch Party Bus to Hell, the 2017 horror film about a coach that becomes overrun with satanic worshippers? No. Will I ever watch Andy the Talking Hedgehog, where she plays a fairy that befriends a talking hedgehog? Actually, I might, because I need to know that it really exists. The point is, Tara Reid isn’t afraid to do the work. And while she might currently find herself caught in a spiral of endless zero-budget zombie films and things that contain characters called Kyle Ghostkiller, it will only take one movie to break her out. And, who knows, that movie may well be Cold Sun. Especially if she gets to punch Barry from EastEnders in the face in it.",Arts/Film,Credit due: Tara Reid’s amazing work ethic is a talent we can all admire,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/16/credit-due-tara-reids-amazing-work-ethic-is-a-talent-we-can-all-admire
2/16/2022,"Every month the story is the same. The annual inflation rate goes up and the chancellor puts out a statement saying he understands life is tough for the British public. The only real difference between this month and last was that, in the interim, Rishi Sunak announced his package of measures to soften – but by no means fully offset – the blow from the huge increase in energy costs households are facing in April.  The whopping 54% increase to the average domestic bill will alone add 1.6 percentage points to the annual inflation rate, making the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics for the cost of living in January something of a temporary respite. Even so, there was still a rise in the annual rate – as measured by the consumer prices index – from 5.4% in December to 5.5% last month. The figure was actually a bit worse than it looked because without a temporary fall in petrol prices it would have been higher. Elsewhere, the January sales were less generous than a year ago. As usual, clothing and footwear retailers and shops selling household goods dropped their prices in the new year but the bargains on offer were less generous this January. Clothing and footwear inflation rose from 4.2% to 6.3% because outlets dropped their prices by 4.9% in January 2021 but by only 2.9% last month. Inflation will go still higher in the coming months. As motorists are now discovering, January’s drop in petrol prices has been reversed. The temporary reduced VAT rate of 12.5% for the hospitality sector will expire in April, the same month energy bills go up. Two other things will concern Bank of England policymakers. The first is that core inflation – the increase in the cost of living excluding volatile elements such as food and fuel – has continued to rise, hitting 4.4% in January. The second is that producer prices – which provide a guide to inflationary pressures at an early stage in the pipeline – rose at an annual rate of 9.9% in January, up from 9.3% in December. Inflation is already running at its highest level in almost 30 years. Even on the assumption that there is no more bad news in the meantime, it will peak at between 7% and 8% in the spring. There will be more “I feel your pain” messages from the chancellor. And pressure on him to offer more tangible support.",News/Business,Warm words from Rishi Sunak won’t help fix cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/16/warm-words-from-rishi-sunak-wont-help-fix-cost-of-living-crisis-inflation-uk
