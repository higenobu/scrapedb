5/3/2022,"The writer Wallace Stegner once called the national parks “America’s best idea”, but the second half of that quote is more resonant today: “They reflect us at our best rather than our worst.” In these challenging times, we must look for decisions that reflect us at our best. National parks like the Grand Canyon in Arizona, Yellowstone and Acadia provide the closest thing we have to experiencing unbridled nature. They also represent our collective decision not to do something in special places that can harm their environment, like cutting down the forest, mining for minerals or hunting wildlife. Over time our understanding of what is the right thing not to do has grown and matured. One of those right things not to do is provide single-use plastics in our national parks. Plastic trash does not belong in these special places. Yet single-use plastic products are being sold and distributed in our national parks. Believe it or not, plastic was not used in everyday products until the 1940s. Society functioned without plastic bags, utensils, water bottles and condiment packets before this point. Since then, companies have turned to plastic to create and package just about everything. Think of all the plastic you touch in a day: your toothpaste tube, shampoo bottle, the packaging on your grocery purchases, maybe a takeout coffee cup or food container. Industry has rapidly created a throwaway culture in which convenience, and plastic producers’ bottom lines, are prioritized above all else. But that does come with a price. Plastic has now been found everywhere – not just in your neighborhood’s streets or along coastlines, but also in the most unexpected of places: in Arctic sea ice, in the absolute deepest part of the ocean, in the air of extremely remote mountains, and in the rain falling on our national parks. It’s even been found in most of your food, from fruits and vegetables to seafood, meat, honey, beer, salt, and more. Plastic is made to last forever, despite much of it being used for only a moment before it’s discarded. So all the plastic accumulating in our environment is not going anywhere for a long time. It will probably exist far longer than America’s earliest national park, Yellowstone, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year. No part of our world deserves to be polluted with plastic, but national parks may be one of the most obviously unsuitable places for a problem that has escalated into one of the planet’s top environmental threats. Americans agree. According to a recent Oceana poll, 82% of American voters would support a decision by the National Park Service to stop selling and distributing single-use plastic at national parks. The National Park Service was created to conserve the natural and cultural resources of these treasured areas. To maintain that commitment, the service and its contractors must stop selling and distributing single-use plastic products and offer refillable and reusable alternatives. It’s not just that plastic pollution is an eyesore for visitors; it’s also a threat to the wildlife that’s meant to be protected in these sanctuaries. Everything from birds and bears to sea turtles and manatees can swallow or become entangled in the remnants of single-use plastic. Even if it is not discovered by wildlife, plastic eventually breaks up into smaller pieces that can end up in the air we breathe and the water we drink. Scientists are still learning about how this is affecting human health. Alternatives exist. Plenty of people and organizations have adopted reusable water bottles as a simple solution to the single-use plastic problem. When Jonathan, the co-author of this piece, was the director of the National Park Service, he issued a policy in 2011 that national parks would install water-bottle refill stations, sell inexpensive reusable water bottles, and ban the sale of single-use plastic water bottles. By 2017, 23 national parks had adopted this program – but it was reversed in 2017 by the Trump administration under pressure from the plastics industry. It is time to address plastic water bottles and go further, ensuring parks also don’t sell food that requires plastic packaging or utensils, or hand visitors disposable plastic bags for their purchases. All of this saves money for visitors and the parks themselves, which would not have to manage the immense amount of waste that comes from providing these products. The National Park Service recently confirmed its 19th director, Charles F Sams III. He and Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland have an opportunity to make history by curbing the amount of unnecessary single-use plastic that’s polluting our nation and contaminating our greatest resources. Hundreds of millions of people visit America’s 423 national parks every year. Imagine how many plastic bags, beverage bottles, cups, plates, bowls and utensils could be avoided if these attractions stopped selling and distributing them. On top of reducing plastic pollution, Sams and Secretary Haaland would be helping to combat the climate crisis, as plastic has become one of its primary contributors. In fact, it is expected to outpace coal’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Our parks are meant to offer a rare glimpse into landscapes that once covered all of North America. And the National Park Service has a commitment to conserve these precious areas and the wildlife that inhabit them. It’s time they passed on plastic so we can enjoy our national parks, unspoiled, well into the future.

5/3/2022,"The future tends not to wait for the past to pack its bags. It certainly feels that way in English domestic rugby where the winds of change are once again howling around some creaking old institutions. Ask any club below the Premiership where they see themselves in five years’ time and just about all of them shrug their shoulders and say they are in limbo awaiting some clarity from Twickenham. Everything is relative, of course, and all connected with the game send their best wishes to Bill Sweeney, the RFU chief executive, who is currently in hospital being treated for pulmonary embolism. His anticipated absence from work for several weeks, though, comes at a delicate time with increasing disquiet up and down the country among those who cherish the game below the top tier. The decision not to allow the Championship winners Ealing Trailfinders to be promoted to the Premiership, ostensibly because their stadium does not meet the league’s minimum standards, was merely the latest psychological blow to be felt by every ambitious Championship club. Nor does it help to watch one or two Premiership sides seemingly down tools with several weeks of the competition still to play. Was Bath’s abject 64-0 defeat at Gloucester on Saturday just a blip or a depressing glimpse of a new Premiership trend? And, for all the breathless action elsewhere, how is a crumbling post-Covid second tier supposed to enhance the development of English-qualified players, coaches and referees? Given adult male participation numbers are falling across the recreational game and funding is already squeezed, few would describe the outlook as massively rosy. With a moratorium in place on relegation from the Premiership until the 2023-24 season, the official line is that negotiations over the Championship’s future are continuing. There may yet be a cup competition involving Premiership and Championship clubs from the 2023-24 season. But how many thriving professional outfits will the second tier contain by then? And are clubs below the elite really going to prosper on a forced diet of additional here-today gone-tomorrow loan players or whatever other top table crumbs fall their way? Take Plymouth Albion in National One. They need to find £15,000 every month simply to keep their Brickfields facility going and have occasionally struggled to field a full 20-man squad this season. Rugby, though, remains a prominent local sport and, with a bit of extra help, happier days could conceivably lie ahead. When the Breakdown visited at the end of April, there were almost 3,000 happy patrons partying in the ground following the local “derby” with Taunton Titans, with the atmosphere and matchday hospitality both excellent. But how can you plan for a future which remains so uncertain? And what should clubs like Albion aspire to be? Feeder clubs? Proud local institutions in their own right? Semi-pro or mostly amateur? “For me there’s an embarrassment of riches at the top end while everyone else is starving,” says Plymouth’s commercial manager, Chris Bentley, currently doing his best to steer the club through increasingly choppy financial waters. “What do we want rugby union to be? Maybe we should just stop calling it ‘union’ and simply call it ‘rugby.’ Because there’s no unity at the moment.” No-one ultimately benefits from Premiership clubs stockpiling players who, in the absence of a reserve league, either seldom play or end up on loan to clubs with whom they have little affinity. “It has a negative impact on everyone beneath them,” says another club insider. “My feeling is that all the clubs outside the Premiership should say to the Premiership clubs: ‘You keep your players, we’ll do it ourselves.’ If every club did that we wouldn’t have clubs going bust and we’d have a much more thriving and vibrant community game. I feel we would be in a much better position. It would be the best lads from your region playing the best lads from another region, not some players you’ve shipped in.” Instead, perhaps, up-and-coming players could prove themselves in a properly marketed, semi-pro Championship or via the increasingly popular BUCS Super Rugby. The latter, along with the Women’s National League, has been a major success story over the past five years and is spawning rising numbers of men’s and women’s international players. Student rugby also seems to be capturing the public imagination: last months’s men’s final between Exeter and Durham attracted a live stream audience of 40,000 people and the men’s and women’s competitions have had more than 620,000 views this season on YouTube. “There’s a following there and we need to start shouting about it,” says Jenny Morris, BUCS director of delivery. No-one is yet drawing direct comparisons with US college football but closer links between universities and clubs seem an ideal way to nurture late developers. Ealing are in the vanguard, having established an academy connection with Brunel University, and so are Exeter. As things stand, though, the RFU covers some administrative costs but leaves the universities to fund everything else. “There’s definite scope for us to be properly integrated and embedded and to be that complimentary offer alongside the existing academy system,” says Morris, who used to share a house with England’s Natasha ‘Mo’ Hunt’ at Bath University. “Let the universities take the weight rather than them being seen as a challenge to what the clubs are doing.” There are also calls for the BUCS champions to play an annual play off against the winners of the Oxford v Cambridge Varsity match, with many convinced the Oxbridge teams would lose heavily. It is another good example of how English rugby could update itself and attract fresh audiences. Last week 11,000 tickets were sold for the annual Swansea v Cardiff varsity fixture and, mostly partygoers or not, there are hopes for another significant attendance at Headingley on Wednesday when Leeds University face their city neighbours Leeds Beckett. It all boils down to priorities but talk of an NFL-style schism, with non-pros effectively walking away by the age of 21, chills the blood of many. “The issue is there is no clear direction from above,” says another club source. “We’re meant to be looking after all of our clubs. If we took away a few of the top brass from the elite tier of the England set-up you could give each of the Championship clubs another £100,00 per season and still have change. That’s got to be wrong.” The club season may be almost done but the debate over English club rugby’s future is intensifying. The scores are in and they make eye-catching reading. No fewer than 57 tries were scored in the weekend’s Gallagher Premiership matches, the most the competition has seen this century. In total there were 409 points registered, the highest since 1999-2000. Wasps’ 42-42 thriller at London Irish – the visitors had been leading 39-14 approaching the final quarter – was the highest scoring draw the league has ever seen. Which is causing some to ask whether mountains of points are the way ahead for rugby or whether almost 10 tries per game is too much of a good thing? Clearly the figures were skewed by the Gloucester v Bath game when the visitors from Somerset were comprehensively smashed but even so. It does underline the difference that firm underfoot conditions can make to a contest, which will also not go unnoticed by those seeking to spread rugby to new audiences. Either way, it has exploded the old notion that 30 points is pretty much certain to win you a game. That theory has now disappeared the way of slide rules and blackboard dusters. As long as the contest for possession remains a fundamental tenet of rugby, there is no harm in blistering attack trumping defence occasionally. The quarter-final weekend of Europe is always fascinating and this year is no exception. If Leinster, the United Rugby Championship leaders, can beat the Premiership front runners Leicester at Welford Road it will certainly be seen as confirmation that the Irish province are the team to beat in this year’s Heineken Champions Cup. Johnny Sexton v George Ford, Tadhg Furlong v Ellis Genge, Stuart Lancaster v Steve Borthwick? It has all the makings of a Test-level fixture and could be a season-defining contest for both teams. After a triumphant Women’s Six Nations, England’s attentions now turn to New Zealand’s challenge, writes Gerard Meagher, while Sarah Rendell picks over the strengths and flaws of the grand slam winners. Some eye-catching weekend Premiership action included a sensational London Irish come back against Wasps and Gloucester putting 64 points on Bath.

5/3/2022,"There’s an old African proverb that states: “When you leave your shoes at the doorstep, you leave your troubles behind.” And if you – like me – can’t stand the thought of people traipsing through your house with their filthy outside shoes, then you probably take this adage quite literally. Well, if you’re tired of being shamed for being a stickler about these things, then I’ve got good news for you. A group of environmental chemists who study what kinds of contaminants people are exposed to in their own homes weighed in on the great shoe debate – and it turns out we were right: wearing your outside shoes inside won’t just mess up your carpet; it is, in fact, scientifically gross. Shoes worn outside can be vectors for all kinds of dirt and microbes – we already know this – but just how dangerous is it? According to the experts, about one-third of the matter building up inside your home comes from outside, much of it being tracked in on the soles of our shoes. And on those shoes, they have found “a high prevalence of microbiological pathogens”. Now let me stop here and say not all dirt is bad dirt. Some household germs can actually be useful in helping build up a child’s immune system, for example. But the real issue is that some of the disease-causing organisms found on our shoes and floors are drug-resistant, causing illnesses that are difficult to treat. “Add in cancer-causing toxins from asphalt road residue,” scientists say, “and endocrine-disrupting lawn chemicals, and you might view the filth on your shoes in a new light.” In plain speak? “It is best to leave your filth outside the door.” But did we really need professionals to tell us that? I mean think about just how much visible dirt we carry with us on the soles of our shoes – mud, dog poop, sand and gravel, debris from outdoor parks and all the other filthy places that our shoes end up in the course of a day. For many households, the pandemic has greatly reduced the number of places we go to. But even at that, all it takes is one walk down the street or a few minutes at the park to make you bring something nasty back home. Germs and pathogens aside though, it’s important to note that not wearing shoes inside is more than just a hygiene thing. In many cultures around the world, leaving your shoes at the door is a sign of respect, a nod to superstition and it may even be in service of good health. Reflexologists say that walking around barefoot can help boost your circulation, improve your sleep quality and stimulate the reflexes on the soles of your feet, reducing inflammation, pain and tension. But despite all the great reasons there are for you to be barefoot inside, there’s also some legitimate pushback around this topic. Some people don’t want to take off their shoes, because doing so means being completely barefoot in someone else’s home, which even I can agree is not the most appealing idea. Whether it’s fear of picking up dirt on your actual feet or just being shy about your toes, not everyone is eager to rip their shoes off in someone else’s home. So what’s to be done? If you’ve already been wearing your shoes inside, chemical disinfectants are a great way to restore the cleanliness of your floors and carpets, and make you feel a bit better about the no-shoes-inside rule. And after doing your part, it’s time to convince your friends to join in. Making your guests feel more comfortable with having their shoes off is a great first step toward ensuring they’re as committed to your new house rules as you are. Give them indoor slippers so they don’t have to be completely barefoot, keep your floors visibly clean, and you can even try shoe covers for the people who are not quite ready for your new barefoot lifestyle. All of these can allay some of the squeamishness about walking around someone else’s house barefoot, and help you keep those nasty pathogens on the other side of your front door.

5/3/2022,"Reach For The Moon, the Queen’s main contender for the Derby at Epsom on Platinum Jubilee weekend, will miss the Classic after failing to recover in time from an injury sustained on the gallops last autumn. John Gosden’s colt was installed as one of the favourites for the Derby on 4 June after winning the Solario Stakes at Sandown Park last August. He then went down to a narrow defeat in the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in September, and was reported to have sustained an injury on 29 September that would rule him out for the remainder of 2021 but was not thought likely to prevent him running in 2022. Reach For The Moon was due to go on trial for Epsom in the Dante Stakes at York next Thursday but will now be aimed towards a race at Royal Ascot in mid-June. The son of the Derby-winner Sea The Stars was quoted at around 9-1 on Tuesday morning to emulate his sire in next month’s Classic and the possibility that the Queen would have a runner with a serious chance in the Derby – the only British Classic she has yet to win – had been much-anticipated as a potentially huge PR coup for racing. The Queen still has two entries in this year’s race – Educator and General Idea – but both are priced up as big outsiders, at 40-1 and 66-1 respectively. With Reach For The Moon now a non-runner, Aidan O’Brien’s Luxembourg, third home in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket on Saturday, is 9-4 (from 5-2) to give the trainer a ninth win in the race, while New London, a runner in the Chester Vase on Wednesday, is 5-1.",Sport/Sport,Queen’s horse Reach For The Moon ruled out of Derby with injury,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/queens-horse-reach-for-the-moon-ruled-out-of-derby-with-injury
5/3/2022,"Canadian police have shot and killed a polar bear that wandered into a Quebec community hundreds of kilometres south of the species’ normal territory, in an incident that experts warn could become more common as sea ice coverage becomes more unpredictable thanks to global heating. The Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police service, warned residents this weekend that a polar had been spotted near the town of Madeleine-Centre – the first time the Arctic’s apex predator had been spotted in the community. The bear is believed to have wandered in from sea ice north of the community, but would have needed to swim portions of the St Lawrence River to reach the northern tip of the Gaspé Peninsula. It was shot dead on Sunday morning – an outcome experts say was inevitable. “The moment I heard about where this bear was, I thought, ‘this is a dead bear,’” said Andrew Derocher, a professor of biology at the University of Alberta. “I worried it was going to show up someplace where it shouldn’t be, cause a problem, and it’s going to get shot.” Officials dispatched drones and a helicopter to help locate the bear. “We work with a lot of things, we work with moose, with deer, with black bears, with everything, but we never dealt with a polar bear,” Sylvain Marois, a district commander at Quebec’s wildlife protection agency, told the Canadian Press. Derocher, who has spent the last few weeks tracking polar bears over sea ice in the Hudson Bay with his research team, said encounters like this are exceedingly rare and difficult to plan for. “These bears have never been there before in modern history, so this is not something that I think wildlife agencies can be prepared for.” In recent years, sea ice levels across the Arctic have become increasingly erratic and unpredictable – a challenging reality for polar bears, which rely on the vast expanse of ice for their winter and spring feeding. “We’re seeing more bears spend more time on land – including places where they haven’t been seen before,” said Geoff York, senior director at Polar Bears International. “The deck is really being reshuffled for polar bears – they have less consistency and variability. Things that may have worked for them in the past aren’t working for them today.” Bears spending more time on the land means the likelihood of encounters with communities only increase, said Derocher. “I can’t draw a straight line between climate change and events like this. But in general … these events are occurring more and more often. And we predict that they’re going to become more common.” But successfully capturing and relocating a bear can cost tens of thousands of dollars and requires the right equipment, which officials in Madeleine-Centre didn’t have access to. While the shooting made headlines across the country, Derocher points out that Inuit and First Nations hunters harvest more than 500 polars bears each year. “It’s a sustainable harvest and we don’t really bat an eye about that. It may sound a bit callous, but this is a bear that got into a place where it couldn’t stay. There were too many risk issues.” Conservation officers could have waited hours for the necessary equipment – but the risk to the community was too great, said York. “The last thing one of these conservation officers wanted to do is put down a bear,” he said. “They’re just trying to keep people safe, and ideally trying to keep wildlife safe when they can.",News/World news,Canadian police fatally shoot polar bear that wandered into Quebec community,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/canada-polar-bear-quebec-police
5/3/2022,"As abortion bans proliferate in states around the US, some state legislatures are likely to go even further than just ending abortion in their jurisdictions – taking aim at the growing numbers of people seeking procedures and medications out of state, experts warn. If the supreme court weakens or overturns Roe v Wade – the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion – in an upcoming decision on Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, states will be left with a confusing patchwork of laws that will likely lead to legal challenges. A fresh wave of restrictions will probably center around patients who leave their state to obtain legal abortions in other states, or who order medications to manage their abortions at home. Lawmakers in Missouri weighed legislation early this year that would allow individuals to sue anyone helping a patient cross state lines for an abortion. The law was ultimately blocked in the state’s legislature, but experts expect such legislation to gain more support if Roe is weakened or overturned. “I think states are not going to rest with just saying ‘there won’t be abortions in our state.’ I think they’re going to want to ban abortion for their citizens as much as they can, which would mean stopping them from traveling,” said David Cohen, professor at Drexel University’s Kline School of Law and lead author of a forthcoming article on cross-state legal issues that could arise in the abortion context. “We’re going to see state-against-state battles that are really going to divide this country even deeper on this issue,” he said. If the Supreme Court overturns abortion protections, such travel bans might also be permitted to stand, Cohen said. “The Supreme Court does not have well-developed case law regarding extraterritorial application of state law,” he added in an email. A court that has gone so far as to overturn Roe, he said, “would likely take that unclear precedent in the direction that is most anti-abortion.” But banning travel would go against “basic American principles”, he said. “You have freedom of travel in this country, and as long as you’re following the law in the state where you are, you are legally OK” under current law. For instance, adults can gamble in states where it’s legal, even if they’re from states where it’s not allowed. If the constitutional right to abortion is reversed, more than half of states are likely to prohibit abortions, according to separate analyses by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Guttmacher Institute. Several states have recently passed abortion bans that would be unconstitutional under Roe, but could stand if the landmark ruling is overturned by the supreme court. Some have passed laws similar to Texas’s ban on abortions at six weeks of pregnancy – around four weeks after conception, when most people don’t know they’re pregnant – while others are advancing legislation similar to the 15-week ban at the center of the supreme court case. On Thursday, Oklahoma lawmakers passed a Texas-style ban that will take effect immediately after Governor Kevin Stitt signs it, expected to occur within days. Stitt signed another bill earlier this year that would make abortion illegal in nearly all circumstances, but that law would not take effect until August. As state-based restrictions proliferate, traveling out of state for reproductive healthcare has become common. After the Texas law took effect last year, Planned Parenthood clinics in neighboring states saw an almost 800% increase in patients. If Roe is weakened or overturned, “a lot of the states that are likely to lose access are surrounded by other states that are likely to lose access”, said Mikaela Smith, a research scientist at the Ohio State University’s College of Public Health and the lead author of new research on out-of-state abortion travel. That means patients may need to travel across several states to receive care. That would also exacerbate existing inequities in healthcare, she said. “Folks who have the resources and have the financial means will be able to do the extra work to cross state lines and folks who don’t, or don’t have the connections or know how to access the care they need, just won’t be able to.” States are also likely to crack down on other efforts to access care. In Texas, a law passed last year made it illegal to ship medication for self-managed abortion, including across state lines – another potential template for copycat legislation. Since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced last year that it would continue its pandemic-era policy to allow medication abortion, also known as the “abortion pill”, to be prescribed via telemedicine, the drugs have become a greater target from anti-abortion advocates. Medication abortion now accounts for the majority of abortions in the US. “Pills are going to be a major part of how people continue to get abortions after the supreme court rules, so I think that we’ll see states trying to ban pills in all sorts of different ways,” Cohen said. Blue states are preparing for the upcoming decision by shoring up reproductive rights for patients and protections for providers. Soon after Idaho passed a contested Texas-style ban, neighboring Washington enacted the first law to prevent lawsuits on performing or aiding an out-of-state abortion. Bills are progressing through the Connecticut and Illinois legislatures to protect patients traveling from out of state and the providers who care for them, and a dozen bills are moving through the California legislature to make reproductive rights stronger and more accessible.",News/World news,"US states could ban people from traveling for abortions, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/us-abortions-travel-wave-of-restrictions
5/3/2022,"Mostly featuring a single performer on screen, Kd Amond’s cabin fever horror unspools as one long monologue. The formal gambit has a literary, theatrical feel – which is appropriate enough as the plot revolves around Faye (Sarah Zanotti), a popular self-help author suffering from a grievous writer’s block. Yet, this is no simple case of procrastination: sent by her publisher to a remote lodge for a writing retreat, Faye is forced to confront her mental turmoil following the loss of her husband Jacob. What follows are live Instagram rantings, one-sided conversations with her deceased partner, and even drunken taunting of unseen evil spirits. For a genre that depends primarily on atmosphere and mood, this is an unusually talky horror: Faye’s psychological spiral in the cabin is intercut with her sitting on stage and recalling various life chapters, information served up to flesh out her relationship with Jacob. The film is divided into chapters as well, with each title card sporting supposedly witty aphorisms such as, “tonight’s special: deja vu … with a side of depression”. These headings may be playful digs at the twee prose of self-help literature, yet they also inadvertently reflect the relentless wordiness of the script, which is occasionally funny and mostly trite. Zanotti, who also co-writes the script, manages to deliver jabs at influencer culture with a self-deprecating viciousness, but she falters during the more dramatic moments where the film shifts gear into an intense exorcism of grief. The sloppy visuals, typified by the harsh and ugly colour grading, is very much to the film’s detriment. With Zanotti’s comedic chops, Faye might have actually worked better as a satire on the cult of wellness; as a horror film, it is woefully ineffective.  Faye is released on 9 May on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Faye review – single-performer horror show jabs at influencer culture,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/faye-review-single-performer-horror-show-jabs-at-influencer-culture
5/3/2022,"Boris Johnson has joined the lobbying effort to convince the British-based chip designer Arm to float in London, as the government fears the damage of losing out to New York in the battle to attract high-profile tech companies looking to list. After the collapse of the $66bn sale of the Cambridge-based business to US-based Nvidia earlier this year, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of Arm’s Japanese parent company Softbank, immediately snubbed the UK for a flotation. “We think that the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US, which is at the centre of global hi-tech, would be most suitable,” he said in February. Johnson has joined the lobbying efforts already under way by London Stock Exchange executives and a number of government departments and senior officials, writing a letter to Softbank executives, according to the Financial Times. The effort includes the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Treasury, the business department as well as Downing Street. The digital minister Chris Philp and Gerry Grimstone, the former Barclays chair who now heads the UK’s Office for Investment, are leading the lobbying efforts. While the chances of changing SoftBank’s mind are considered slim, Arm has previously had a dual listing on both sides of the Atlantic, before it was acquired by the Japanese company for £24.6bn in 2016. Arm had been a member of the FTSE 100 for 18 years and winning it back would be a huge boost for the capital’s longer-term ambitions to have more tech flotations, while losing it would be a big blow to that goal. Analysts are estimating that Arm would float with a market value of $30bn to $40bn, which would make it the largest tech company on the London Stock Exchange, more than twice the size of the current leader, Ocado. At that scale, Arm would also rank between the 19th and 24th largest listed company in the UK. A government spokesperson said: “We want to make the UK the most attractive place for innovative businesses to grow and raise capital.” SoftBank, Arm and the LSE declined to comment. In December, Paul Marshall, the chairman of the investment manager Marshall Wallace, said the UK and European stock markets were becoming the “Jurassic Park” of global stock exchanges. He wrote in the Financial Times: “The UK stock market is becoming a global backwater as US and Chinese markets forge ahead. It has largely failed to take part in the global rally that began in 2015. We are reaching the point where companies may decide we should simply all agree on a single global exchange, trading 24 hours and located in New York.” Last year new rules were introduced to try to make London more attractive to tech companies, including allowing dual share class structures, which give founders more control after they float a business, and reducing the amount of shares required to be offered to the public to 10%.",News/Business,Boris Johnson joins lobbying for UK chip designer Arm to list in London,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/boris-johnson-uk-chip-designer-arm-list-london
5/3/2022,"A draft supreme court opinion, apparently by the conservative justice Samuel Alito, was leaked to Politico for a story published late on Monday. It appears to show that the court is preparing to rule in favour of Mississippi in a case over whether the state can outlaw nearly all abortions at and after 15 weeks gestation – a direct challenge to the guarantee of abortion rights enshrined in Roe v Wade. The 98-page document, which includes 118 footnotes and a 31-page appendix on historical state abortion laws, was published in full. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” it says. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.” It says Roe v Wade “must be overruled” and goes on: “It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” Roe v Wade is the court decision that protects the right to an abortion in the US up to the point a foetus can survive outside the womb, widely regarded as 24 weeks gestation. A full-term pregnancy is 39 weeks gestation. The 1973 ruling is among the most controversial in American history and has been subjected to many legal challenges over the year – but has survived until now. For more details on the challenge to the law currently under consideration, take a look at Jessica Glenza’s explainer from December. While the opinion is purportedly a draft, it would have been written after a vote on the question at hand by the court – and indicates that a majority of justices reached the same view as Alito. Politico reported that four other Republican-appointed justices supported the decision, meaning a total of at least five votes on the nine-member court. After such a vote, a justice is assigned the majority opinion and then writes a draft, which is then circulated and subject to edits. It is possible for changes to be made to the opinion, or even for votes to change, before the court’s final ruling, which is expected in the next couple of months. The Guardian’s Washington correspondent David Smith called the leak “stunning and unprecedented” and said it would be “the worst security breach” in the court’s history. Theories abounded over the possible source of the leak, from a clerk for a liberal justice hoping to raise public pressure on the court before it publishes its decision to a conservative who wants to soften the impact of the decision when it comes – in other words, nobody knows. A tweet from Scotusblog, a respected news and analysis site, said it was “impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the justices and staff. This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable sin.” With fury. A BuzzFeed reporter posted a video of about 200 protesters outside the court chanting slogans such as “abortion is healthcare” and “my body, my choice”. Another video showed somebody urging attenders: “If you feel like fucking screaming, then just scream.” Democrats said overturning Roe v Wade would be a catastrophe. They were led by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who issued a joint statement saying such a move would be “an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history”. They also immediately sought to make Roe v Wade an issue for crucial upcoming midterm elections. Christie Roberts, the Democratic senatorial campaign executive director, said: “At this critical moment, we must protect and expand Democrats’ Senate majority with the power to confirm or reject supreme court justices.” Republicans by turns praised the apparent vote and condemned the leak itself. It is worth reiterating that it is still possible that votes could change and mean that the apparent draft opinion remains just that – a draft. But if the supreme court does rule along the lines suggested by the leaked document, the consequences will be rapid and hugely consequential. Because the US Congress has never enshrined the right to terminate a pregnancy, the overturning of Roe v Wade would mean individual states could immediately make their own decisions over the way forward. Twenty-six of them would be expected to move quickly to do so, with many having “trigger” laws on the books, which would automatically come into effect in those circumstances. That means that women in those states would immediately face severe restrictions on their ability to have an abortion, and the US would become one of only four countries to curtail that right in nearly 30 years.",News/World news,Supreme court abortion law leak: what happened and why does it matter?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/supreme-court-abortion-law-leak-roe-v-wade
5/3/2022,"One of José Vásquez Chogue’s enduring childhood memories is that of his grandfather on the doorstep of his home in the Chilean capital, Santiago, staring at the night sky. “He would always face south,” Vásquez recalled. “He would point out the Southern Cross and show me the stars which represent our ancestors.” The older man had grown up on a frozen and remote island in Patagonia and was a member of the Selk’nam tribe. But Chilean history books had declared the people extinct. When José, captivated by the anthropological displays of Chile’s National History Museum, tried to explain his bloodline to a member of staff he was met with derision. “I told him that they were my people, but he didn’t believe me. We were taught at school that all our brothers were all dead.” The redrafting of Chile’s constitution has created the opportunity to set the history books straight. After Vásquez made an impassioned intervention at the constitutional convention in August, the government released funds for an anthropological, historiographic and archeological study of the Selk’nam. The results of that study, released earlier this month, acknowledged the continued existence of the people and called for their legal recognition. “The Selk’nam people are not extinct, they are currently in a process of cultural reappropriation and recreation, and they have the right to reconstruct their own [historical] memory,” said Karla Rubilar, the minister of social development. If, in the months ahead, the government of Gabriel Boric legally recognizes the Selk’nam, they could be eligible for land and legislative representation. But more important for Vásquez would be the recognition of the crimes committed against his ancestors. “It’s important that the history of our people and the truth come to light, so people know what happened to the Selk’nam and the other Indigenous peoples in Chile,” he says. When Ferdinand Magellan rounded the southern tip of South America in 1520, it was the campfires of Indigenous tribes, burning on the hillside, that gave the region its name: Tierra del Fuego (Land of Fire). The main island – now split between Chile and Argentina – and the surrounding archipelago had been inhabited for over 10,000 years by hunter-gatherer peoples feeding on shellfish, berries and guanaco, a relative of the llama. Subsequent European exploration left a legacy of bleak place names – Port Famine, Useless Bay, Tortuous Passage – but the newcomers had limited contact with Indigenous people. In November 1886 Ramón Lista, an Argentinian explorer landed on the windswept and barren shores of the Bay of San Sebastián in Tierra del Fuego. By his own account, lacking the resources to take them prisoner, he ordered his accompanying soldiers to shoot 28 Selk’nam, including women and children, that they encountered there. In the following 40 years Argentinian and Chilean ranchers and miners would exterminate thousands of Selk’nam, dispatch others to German human zoos, and send many more to Salesian Christian missions where they frequently succumbed to disease. The last known full-blood Selk’nam died in 1974. On the Argentinian side of Tierra del Fuego, the mixed-blood descendants of the Selk’nam have been recognized by law since 1992 and 36,000 hectares provided to the community as ancestral lands. Last year 25 November was recognized as the Day of the Selk’nam Genocide and flags were flown at half-mast. “The Argentinian state came to exterminate, it was a genocide and now it is a day of mourning” says Vanina Ojeda, a fifth-generation Selk’nam who is now secretary of Original Peoples for Tierra del Fuego. “For years the state tried to make invisible the crimes of the past, now it has a duty of historical reparation.” In 1993 Chile enacted its Indigenous law, recognizing eight peoples, including the Mapuche – who make up 12% of Chile’s population – and the Rapa Nui of Easter Island. In some cases land titles and limited legislative representation have been offered, but the continued expansion of timber, mining and agricultural projects – combined with heavy-handed policing – has led to rising social tensions in the south of the country. Mapuche flags were a prominent symbol of Chile’s 2019 protest movements that coalesced around the goal of changing the constitution. In Chile’s 2017 census 1,144 respondents self-identified as Selk’nam but they were dispersed across the country. In 2018 Vásquez attended a cultural event for Selk’nam that he had seen posted on Facebook. “We hugged and we cried because it was the first time we had met people from our community, our brothers and sisters,” he says. With the help of the community he was able to gather further details of the life of his grandfather, Carmelo Chogue, who had spent his childhood in the Salesian mission on Isla Dawson, a remote island so inhospitable it was later used to intern political prisoners during the Pinochet dictatorship. In October 2020 Vásquez was able to visit Tierra del Fuego for the first time. When he crossed the Strait of Magellan, emotion overcame him. “I saw the land where my father had come from, I saw Isla Dawson and when I got off the boat the first thing I did was to take a handful of earth and grasp it tightly with my hand. Then I started to cry and cry.”",News/World news,‘We were told our brothers were dead’: Chile’s lost tribe reclaims identity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/chile-indigenous-selknam-not-extinct-constitution
5/3/2022,"Labor has seized on the Reserve Bank’s decision to lift the cash rate by 25 basis points to argue the prime minister’s economic credentials are “shredded”, while Scott Morrison says the hike reflects Australia’s “journey out of the pandemic”. Following the bank’s decision to lift the official rate from a record low 0.1% to 0.35%, the opposition treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said on Tuesday afternoon that Morrison had overseen a “triple whammy” of cost of living pressures: higher interest rates, soaring inflation and stagnant wage growth. “This is a full-blown cost of living crisis on Scott Morrison’s watch and now interest rate rises are about to be part of the pain,” Chalmers said. “This is a crisis. Families who were already finding it hard enough to get ahead – now they are finding it that much harder.” The Reserve Bank governor, Phillip Lowe, said the rate hike was needed to address rising inflation. He said it was “the right time to begin withdrawing some of the extraordinary monetary support that was put in place to help the Australian economy during the pandemic”. “The economy has proven to be resilient and inflation has picked up more quickly, and to a higher level, than was expected,” he said. “There is also evidence that wages growth is picking up. Given this, and the very low level of interest rates, it is appropriate to start the process of normalising monetary conditions.” Lowe flagged further rate increases to reduce inflation further with hopes the latter would moderate at about 3% by 2024. The lift in the market interest rate was the first increase since 2010 and the first rate hike during a campaign since 2007 when John Howard lost office to Kevin Rudd. At that time, the cash rate was raised 25 basis points to 6.75%, prompting Howard to apologise to voters for the additional “burden” being faced by households. Speaking in Melbourne on Tuesday afternoon, Morrison would not repeat the apology but said he sympathised with families who would face an average increase on repayments on a $600,000 mortgage of about $80 a month. “I sympathise with Australians as they face higher cost of living pressures,” he said. “I sympathise with Australians when they face higher repayments on their homes, of course I do, and that’s why we’ve provided the relief in the budget that is the function of our strong economic plan.” Morrison said “Australia’s economic policy shield” had protected voters from financial pain during the pandemic and he pointed to Australia’s low jobless rate as the most important factor to ensure people were able to continue paying their mortgages. “You know what banks look at most of all when they’re assessing someone for a home loan?” he said. “A job.” Morrison said on Tuesday the Reserve Bank had “made a very important statement about where we are now in our journey out of this pandemic”. “Australians have been preparing for this for some time. Throughout the course of the pandemic, we have seen them double their buffers on their mortgages and we have seen them move from variable rates to fixed rates,” he said. But Chalmers said Morrison needed to take responsibility for the economic hardship the rate rise would cause. He suggested the government had spent too much on pandemic stimulus which had contributed to high inflation. “The only shield that Scott Morrison is interested in is to shield himself from the blame and to shield himself from people who are doing it tough,” he said. “If only you could pay your mortgage with Scott Morrison’s excuses.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chalmers acknowledged there would be more interest rate rises to come and he said an Albanese government would focus on growing the economy without adding to inflationary pressures. “It’s about easing the cost of living. It’s about getting real wages growing again and it’s about having something to show for a budget which is absolutely heaving with a trillion dollars in Liberal and National debt.” With less than three weeks left of the election campaign, Chalmers said the rate increase had crystallised the choice facing voters. “This election is a contest between a Labor party with a plan for a stronger economy and a better future, versus a Liberal party promising nothing but three more years of the same falling real wages, the same skyrocketing cost of living and the same pressure on families which is making it harder and harder for them to get ahead,” Chalmers said. Morrison used the decision to pivot back to the Coalition’s key campaign message on risk – saying the uncertain economic environment was a reason to stick with the government. “At a time like this, as we get close to this election, why risk it? Why go in another direction? Now is not the time to turn back,” the prime minister said. The government has been on the back foot over its handling of the economy with last week’s inflation figures coming in higher than expected. Morrison has been pointing to the war in Ukraine and supply pressures out of locked-down China as the largest contributing factors and has defended the temporary nature of the cost of living measures included in the March budget that Labor has attacked as a short-term fix. The Coalition is seen to have a traditional advantage on the question of economic management but a Guardian Essential poll has found Labor is viewed as better trusted to manage cost of living pressures.",News/Australia news,Labor says rate rise highlights PM’s shredded credentials but Morrison insists it’s part of pandemic journey,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/labor-says-rate-rise-highlights-pms-shredded-credentials-but-morrison-insists-its-part-of-pandemic-journey
5/3/2022,"Deanne Rose may be living more than 3,000 miles from home, after being signed by Reading last July, but that hasn’t dented her plans to give back to the community she grew up in. In June, she will hold her first soccer camp in her hometown of Alliston in Ontario, Canada, for girls aged between eight and 14. “I thought it was the perfect opportunity when I come back home to be able to give them something,” she says of her plans. “Representation and role models just matter so much in sports and for young kids growing up … I want [the camp] to be really enjoyable and set the platform and the landscape for what it could be in the future.” That her family and community is what drives her is clear to see: when she helped Canada become Olympic champions in Tokyo last year, scoring a pivotal penalty during a shootout against Sweden in the final. “They couldn’t be in Tokyo but I felt them the entire way,” she wrote on Instagram afterwards, alongside a photo of her with her medal, alongside family and friends, in Alliston. “To my support system and the countless people not seen in this picture, this gold is ours.” Her hometown is clearly proud of her, throwing a parade for her on her return, with residents lining the streets. Rose describes growing up in a “Jamaican-Canadian household”: she was born in Alliston to Jamaican parents and has three siblings. She tried out various sports with her brothers growing up, but settled on football – her mum signed her up to a local side when she was just four. “My mum has been there from literally day one,” she says. “She was the one that was driving me from practice after work and rushing me to all these places. She definitely would be the number one person that has had the biggest hand in my football career.” Rose’s career is already impressive. For example, she’s a world record holder, as the youngest ever Olympic women’s football goalscorer, which she achieved by scoring in Canada’s 2-1 bronze medal victory over Brazil in 2016. But, only a couple of years earlier, she considered giving up football altogether. After being called up to a national camp, she ultimately didn’t make the under 15s squad. “In Canada, 14 to 16 is around the age where a lot of females stop playing football,” she explains. “So, it was hard for me, because I was going through a period where you don’t know where you’re going. So you’re like, ‘Should I continue? I just got cut from the national team’…it was a really big setback for me.” Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! But she kept going. Around a year-and-half later, Rose got another break when she received an invite to train with the under-17s squad. Very quickly, things exploded: aged just 16, she earned her first cap for Canada’s senior squad. She is proud of her national side, too, with her team releasing a statement in Black History Month last year, where the squad made a “commitment to educate and enhance our awareness on the experiences and realities that our black teammates and black people face everyday”. This was, in part, due to Rose’s own conversations with her teammates. “It was a conversation that we had had last year in camp, whether we wanted to do that, and I said my piece in terms of explaining that racism isn’t just in the States,” she explains. “I think, because we’re so close to the US, we get put in the shadow a little bit and that type of thing. But I wanted to explain to my team what it’s like growing up in Canada being a black female athlete … it meant a lot to me to see my teammates get behind, not only me, but the other girls.” Rose was signed by Reading fresh out of the University of Florida, where she majored in sociology, the deal struck a month before she graduated. While studying there, she battled a recurring hamstring injury and, tragically, her best friend, a teammate for college side Florida Gators, was diagnosed with leukaemia, aged 18. Thankfully, she is now four years in remission. “It taught me a lot about loyalty and friendship, and what matters the most in life,” she says of that time. “It really humbles your experience to see someone that you’re so close to go through something so traumatic.” Still less than a year into her two-year contract with Reading, her first professional deal, Rose has already made a big impact, playing in 19 out of 20 games so far. In December, she was the goalscorer in Reading’s surprise 1-0 victory over current WSL champions Chelsea. It wasn’t just any goal: Rose dribbled from just outside Reading’s box to the other end of the pitch, before striking into the net after a one-two with teammate Emma Harries. “That was definitely a highlight of my pro career so far,” says a smiling Rose. Of her teammates, she adds: “They were super welcoming from the moment that I came to the UK.” While she says that being away from home is challenging (“I’m a family girl,” she adds), she is slowly acclimatising to British culture – with the help of some Netflix favourites. “I just finished Bridgerton…I thought when I was coming to the UK, I would be getting an element of that, which, obviously, I’m not,” she laughs. What does she mean? “I thought everyone would be super posh, I was surprised!” Looking ahead, Rose hopes to represent her country at the Women’s World Cup next year in Australia and New Zealand. “Winning the World Cup would just mean the world to the team, and me, and the country,” she says. “So that’s my next big goal.” With Rose on Canada’s side, they’re in for a shot.
