4/24/2022,"None of us expected Angela to become a killer. Much too nice. Much too sweet. Much too likely to follow the rules and not take matters into her own hands. Then again, none of us expected to end up on an island where the spectre of death can drive the nicest, sweetest woman to do just that. The island was Lady Musgrave, an uninhabited coral cay almost 100km north-east of Bundaberg and our home for the best part of a week. Five nights, six days, eight adults, 11 children, one tropical paradise. They call it one of the most magical places in the world and they’re not telling a lie. It’s a tiny strip of land nestled in a World Heritage-listed marine park that even David Attenborough’s high-definition cameras and highly distinctive voice would struggle to do justice. Each day we spent hours snorkelling on a reef teeming with aquatic wonders. Each night we watched with breathless silence as dozens of turtles trekked up the sand to lay their eggs. As the only group camping on the island, we were starring in our very own nature documentary. At least we were until Angela turned it into a horror movie. We had been warned about the birds. Thousands of them flock to the island each summer, many of them nesting in the trees above the camping area. We had been told to bring tarps to protect our tents from the aerial assault that awaited us. We had been warned to brace ourselves for the odour. One friend was particularly blunt: “You will be shat on.” She was proven correct within minutes of us setting foot on the island. What no one had mentioned was the killing field, a 450-metre walking track that links the camping area with Lady Musgrave’s spectacular, protected lagoon where day trippers snorkel off the back of a three-level pontoon and luxury boats anchor for days on end. Each day we would make the trek across the island to explore the lagoon’s reef wall and each day we would do so while trying not to step on the birds dying the cruellest of deaths at the hands of a callous soul called Mother Nature. The birds were black noddy terns and they had arrived on the island after flying non-stop from the warmer climes of Papua New Guinea. It is estimated that from late August until May a colony of about 40,000 visit, nest and fish around the island group to which Lady Musgrave belongs. A lot of them, though, weren’t going to be making the return trip because they were being massacred by the very trees they had come in search of. Pisonia trees are the primary vegetation on Lady Musgrave Island and share the most messed-up of relationships with the birds that use them as holiday accommodation. The trees flower twice a year, producing pods that grow in clusters and contain black seeds covered in a thick mucous that sticks to almost anything it brushes against. In an ideal world the trees would drop their seeds when the black noddies are hanging out in Papua New Guinea, but centuries of evolution have resulted in them doing so at the worst possible time for a bird not keen on becoming entangled in a sticky bunch of seed pods – migration season. No words can do justice to the carnage that is Lady Musgrave Island’s lagoon walk. Every day countless black noddies living the good life brush up against sticky seed pods. They try to shake the annoyances loose, only to add another one … and another … and another. Before long they are covered in so many seed pods they can’t move their wings. Soon enough they can’t even move. Eventually they become mummified, wrapped in a macabre blanket of seeds and twigs and dirt, slowly starving to death or, in what may be more humane, being picked off by scavengers. I wasn’t alone the first time I ventured into the killing field. It was the first morning of our stay and a group of us decided to cross the island to see Lady Musgrave’s famous lagoon with our own eyes. A national parks sign warned us of what lay ahead, an illustrated explanation of how the pisonia trees drop their seed pods, the seed pods entrap the birds, the birds’ remains fertilise the soil and the soil replenishes the trees. The message was clear – this is flora and fauna working in unison, the circle of life, and you’re not helping by trying to help the birds. And still Angela could not help herself. As our eyes widened and jaws dropped at the sight of bird after bird in various stages of the entombing process – some a little hobbled, others barely able to turn their heads – our kind-hearted friend’s attention was caught by a black noddy with only the most minor of seeds stuck to its breast. We watched as she reached down and did what we had told our children not to do. Spooked by the human hand trying to remove the seeds, the bird stumbled and collected another cluster. “That’s not good,” someone said, but Angela was nothing if not optimistic. She doubled-down and tried to pull the new sticky seeds away, prompting the bird to flap its wings and add even more to its feathers. “Oh, no!” exclaimed Angela’s six-year-old, a suitable response for a young boy watching his always gentle, always caring mother expedite a bird’s death. When the black noddy released a distressed cry, we had seen enough and left Angela and her hubby to ruminate on how it feels to morph from angel of mercy to angel of death in less than 30 seconds. “It was only a little bit,” she sighed, her tone befitting a woman who carries a bird-watching book on her travels. “I just wanted to help it.” Angela soon followed us to the lagoon and when it came time to return to camp, she was spared the guilt of encountering the black noddy she knew better than any other. The reason? There were so many birds in the vicinity consigned to a similar fate that there was no telling which one was hers, and that must surely have come as a relief. After all, she may have failed to follow the rules but, unlike the trees shading her from the midday sun, at least she was no serial killer. Lady Musgrave Island is in the Capricornia Cays national park, 96km north-east of Bundaberg and 59km east-north-east of the town of 1770. Camping is permitted on the island from the Queensland Easter school holidays until Australia Day. The camping area is closed at other times due to bird and turtle-hatching season, although people can still visit during the day. Up to 40 people can camp on the island at any one time, for a maximum of 21 nights. The camping area is for tents only, with limited facilities including composting toilets, emergency radio, fuel storage and compressor bunker. Campers must be self-sufficient (ie bring all their own food and drinking water) and all rubbish must be removed upon departure. Campers can reach the island by private boat or commercial vessel, while day tour operators also offer camping transfers. The nearest departure points are Bundaberg and 1770. The best time to witness the sticky seed phenomenon is mid-to-late October to late December, which coincides with the main turtle-nesting season from late November to January.

4/24/2022,"One of the ironies of David Seymour, the Act party leader who’s insisting on a referendum on “co-governance” between the crown and iwi, is that one of his own ancestors was a signatory to Te Titiri o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi). That doesn’t quite make Seymour a hypocrite, and nor does it necessarily make him a disloyal descendant, instead it reveals one of the contradictions at the heart of New Zealand politics: that few politicians can agree on quite what our founding document means. At one end, Te Pāti Māori (the Māori party) and the Greens pursue the textual meaning of Te Tiriti, the Māori language version reaffirming Māori sovereignty while carving out modest powers for the crown. At the other end, Act and the National party pursue the textual meaning of the English language treaty where the chiefs who sign apparently surrender their sovereignty to Her Majesty. What Act and parts of the National party ignore, of course, is that few chiefs signed the English language version, rendering “the Treaty of Waitangi” a dead document. The courts deal with that fact in an admirably centrist manner, choosing to ignore both language texts in favour of extracting “principles” like “partnership” – which is an approximation of co-governance – and “active protection”. But the academic and activist consensus is increasingly critical of that compromise. Few historians and legal scholars would disagree that the relevant language version is the Māori Te Tiriti. Fewer still would disagree on what that text means. “Rangatiratanga”, or sovereignty for iwi (tribes) and hapū (subtribes), and a subordinate power, or “kāwanatanga” (governorship), for the crown. On this reading, Te Tiriti o Waitangi promises nothing short of a constitutional revolution. That probably alarms David Seymour and the 5 or so percent of New Zealanders he represents – the exhausted rearguard of New Zealand conservatism. But, in truth, that constitutional revolution is already in motion with the force of more than 30 years of changes. Co-governance, to take Seymour’s own example, is an orthodox policy under both Labour and National governments. Under former prime ministers John Key and Bill English co-governance arrangements were made with iwi over Te Urewera national park, the Waikato and Waipā rivers, and the Whanganui river (which is also a legal person). Instead of ripping apart the fabric of New Zealand society, these arrangements passed without much notice, and none of its opponents can point to a single governance failure in the years since. Which is telling. And perhaps it suggests that the source of opposition to co-governance isn’t some fidelity to good public policy but simply an opposition to Māori. In the years after former National party leader Don Brash’s Orewa speech, where the then leader of the opposition launched an undisguised attack against Māori “privilege”, gaining 17 points in the polls and overtaking the governing Labour party, opposition politicians from Phil Goff to Seymour have sought out that last refuge of the scoundrel: anti-Māori rhetoric. What Goff, Seymour, and former National party Judith Collins forgot, though, is that Brash lost the election a year later. Re-reading the Orewa speech is to inspect a loser’s score sheet. As one example, on “Māori wards” Brash lost the argument with 27 councils and counting implementing dedicated representation for Māori in local government. And the same is surely true for Seymour – on co-governance, he’ll lose. It’s possible to argue he might have already lost. The Labour government is taking tentative steps toward acknowledging that the Māori text of Te Tiriti matters with Te Arawhiti, the agency for Māori-crown relations, releasing a cabinet circular in 2019 centring both the principles and the text. This is a tentative departure from the last Labour government where the principles were taken as the relevant standard. And it’s a step further than the last National government where Key and English preferred negotiated outcomes with iwi rather than a rigid adherence to the meaning of the principles or the text. It’s worth pausing to note, though, that “negotiated outcomes”, often with pan-iwi institutions like the Iwi Leaders Forum over issues like freshwater management, arguably constitute a moderate form of co-governance anyway. The momentum, then, is against Seymour and his 5 %. He might find a temporary friend in National party leader Chris Luxon, who delivered an embarrassing lesson on the Treaty of Waitangi on Māori TV, but the safer bet is National eventually returns to form and negotiates outcomes with iwi on an issue-by-issue basis. Luxon is likely a pragmatist and won’t fancy fighting Māori on his left and right flank. Why? Because as governments from the British warlord George Grey’s administration to John Key’s know, Māori aren’t going anywhere. And Te Tiriti isn’t either. Seymour might get his referendum. But he won’t get his win.

4/24/2022,"The Australian government has missed a deadline to decide on compensation for victims of alleged war crimes in Afghanistan, potentially leaving the thorny issue to be sorted out after the election. Defence blamed the delay on “legal, practical and logistical issues”, while Labor accused the Coalition of breaking a promise to keep parliament informed of progress on reforms sparked by the “damning” Brereton inquiry. The inquiry found “credible” information to implicate 25 current or former Australian defence force personnel in the alleged unlawful killing of 39 individuals and the cruel treatment of two others, with criminal allegations to be considered by the new Office of the Special Investigator. The inquiry report by Maj Gen Paul Brereton said Australia should not wait for a court to establish criminal liability in order to compensate affected families. If there was credible information of an unlawful killing, Brereton wrote, compensation should be paid swiftly because that would help restore “Australia’s standing” and was “simply the morally right thing to do”. Releasing the report in November 2020, the chief of the ADF, Gen Angus Campbell, said: “I very much support Justice Brereton’s recommendation.” A reform plan approved by the defence minister, Peter Dutton, and released last July set a deadline of “end-2021” for the government to decide on an approach to compensation. The plan originally said further information on compensation “will be available by end-2021”. But the Department of Defence confirmed this week the work was not finished. A spokesperson said the department was still consulting with a range of government agencies regarding the compensation recommendations. “Further information will be available following advice/consultation and consideration by government,” the spokesperson said. “The issue of compensation is complex and comes with a number of legal, practical and logistical issues.” It is understood there is no new indicative deadline, meaning it is possible this could be left for a government decision after the election. Caretaker conventions discourage major policy decisions during the campaign unless the opposition is consulted. Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last August after the withdrawal of US and allied forces – a development that may also pose challenges to criminal investigations. The delay will disappoint Afghan and Australian human rights groups, which have previously acknowledged the situation in Afghanistan had “deteriorated dramatically” but argued this must not be allowed to disrupt Australia’s plan to compensate families of victims of alleged war crimes. “This will likely complicate the task of involving people from Afghanistan in the process of reckoning with this dark chapter in Australia’s history,” 13 rights group said in a joint statement in November. “Yet it remains an essential part of the path forward.” The Australian government created an Afghanistan Inquiry Implementation Oversight Panel to ensure lasting cultural reforms within the ADF. The then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said she would get an official report every three months from the panel, led by former Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, Vivienne Thom. Reynolds made a commitment to updating the public via the parliament. “I will be reporting regularly to the parliament on their reports to me,” she said in November 2020. However, a search of Hansard since early 2021 shows the panel has been mentioned twice in passing in Senate estimates hearings. That included when Marise Payne, then the acting defence minister, advised a hearing in March 2021 that she had met with the panel chaired by Thom. The parliamentary record indicates Dutton addressed the lower house several times about the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the subsequent evacuation operations, but not about progress on the reform plans. Dutton’s office has not responded to previous questions from Guardian Australia about whether he intended to report regularly to parliament on the oversight and implementation process. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, said the lack of updates to parliament represented “another broken promise by the government”. In an interview this week, O’Connor said it appeared the government had “sat on its hands in relation to this inquiry”. “It’s a damning report. We support the creation of the Office of the Special Investigator,” he said. “We expect the Special Investigator to do their job – we know that it’s a complicated and complex area and we know it’ll take a considerable amount of time, but we should allow that to happen.” O’Connor noted that when the report was released, the prime minister and the defence minister left it to the chief of the ADF to respond, including answering questions from the media. He characterised this as “a lack of political leadership”. Shortly after assuming the defence portfolio, Dutton overruled Campbell on plans to strip the meritorious unit citation from about 3,000 special forces soldiers and said his top priority was to reassure servicemen and women that “the government has their back”. Labor voiced support for that decision by Dutton, but maintained that the Coalition had failed to show leadership and transparency. Defence said it had so far taken action to close 101 of the 143 inquiry recommendations. Campbell and the secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, said last year they were “committed both to addressing the failures and wrongdoing of the past and undertaking deep and enduring reform across the organisation”. But action to hold individual military commanders accountable for cultural failings is being delayed to avoid affecting the ongoing work of the Office of the Special Investigator. At the same time, aid groups have sounded the alarm about the “desperately heartbreaking” situation in Afghanistan, including poverty and famine. At least six people were killed and 11 wounded in two bomb blasts at a boys’ school in a Hazara Shia neighbourhood of Kabul on Tuesday.",News/Australia news,Australian government misses compensation deadline for victims of alleged war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/24/australian-government-misses-compensation-deadline-for-victims-of-alleged-war-crimes
4/24/2022,"For two weeks, moderates within the New South Wales Liberal party have been asking the same question: why did the prime minister pick lightning rod candidate Katherine Deves in Warringah? To be crystal clear, no one in the party thought Warringah was winnable. The Liberals went through a laundry list of potential candidates, including two former state premiers – Gladys Berejiklian and Mike Baird – in a bid to find a star to unseat independent Zali Steggall. None of them wanted it. Amid the chaos of the NSW preselection saga, their original preferred candidate, the Sydney barrister Jane Buncle, also pulled out. In the end, Warringah was an afterthought. Prior to the federal intervention that saw Scott Morrison, Dominic Perrottet and former state party president Christine McDiven take control of nominations, the factions in NSW had sought to carve out a deal which would keep everyone happy-ish and avoid a takeover. The moderates had pushed for disability advocate David Brady, while the right wanted defence analyst Lincoln Parker. But this wasn’t a hill anyone outside the seat was interested in dying on. As sources from both the left and the right of the party told Guardian Australia this week, neither candidate was likely to trouble Steggall, but nor would they have caused any headaches. In hindsight, that quality is particularly important for the moderates, who find themselves in a tough fight against independents in two demographically similar seats in Sydney. Both the Wentworth MP, Dave Sharma, and North Sydney’s Trent Zimmerman need an inflammatory debate about trans issues about as much as they need a campaign visit from Morrison right now. The most generous interpretation of Deves’ preselection is that the prime minister wanted to boost his credentials with female voters by picking a slew of female candidates. On the same day Deves was announced as the Warringah candidate, the Liberal party also confirmed Jenny Ware in Hughes and Maria Kovacic in Parramatta. A more cynical interpretation might be that, in a tough re-election campaign, elements of the Liberal party saw an electoral advantage in whistling to certain parts of the electorate through the misleadingly benign prism of integrity in women’s sport. The second option raises some interesting questions. If Morrison had decided, for example, that he could use Deves’ candidacy to shore up votes in more socially conservative parts of the country, the natural extension of that equation is that he has given up on the moderates who are fighting off the teal independents. Even if it wasn’t the initial plan, Morrison’s comments since have certainly created that dynamic. By seeking to move the conversation on from what it actually was – Deves’ history of highly offensive and transphobic comments – to a culture war about “cancelling” her, the prime minister, with the help of the conservative press, has moved the election into murky territory for the NSW moderates. Which is why they’re now on the warpath. Matt Kean’s intervention into the debate – calling for Deves to be disendorsed – was motivated by moral conviction, but it was also a warning: if the prime minister wanted this to be the conversation, he’d better be prepared for pushback. Hence, the fascinating dynamic playing out in the NSW government. After Kean’s intervention, the Australian reported that Perrottet had expressed support for the prime minister’s position on Deves via text message. It also claimed sources had called for Kean to be booted from the party for his “radical-left views”. Perrottet says he wasn’t the leaker, but was quick to say that while he wanted a “sensitive” debate and that he believed “girls should play sport against girls”. Such a public divide between the premier and treasurer would usually warrant a torrent of headlines, but has been lost somewhat in the broader debate. Leaving aside independent Sydney MP Alex Greenwich’s threat to withdraw supply from the NSW government on the back of Perrottet’s comments, it is the latest demonstration of how the decade-old Liberal government in NSW is slowly losing its discipline. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition in NSW has been successful for the most part by avoiding fractious culture warring in favour of a moderate Liberal agenda. In short, they’ve privatised a lot of public assets to fund big infrastructure projects. Since becoming premier, Perrottet, a conservative, has mostly stuck to that playbook, but there are signs of infighting. In March the centre-right transport minister David Elliott was happy to publicly slam his colleagues for pursuing what he called “woke” issues. The new planning minister, Anthony Roberts, who is also from the right, has unpicked sustainability measures introduced by his predecessor, the moderate Rob Stokes. On the other side, Stokes has publicly called on his government to reconsider the “illusory and ephemeral benefits” of casinos in the wake of revelations about money laundering and criminal activity at The Star in Sydney. With a number of senior ministers eyeing the exits ahead of the state election in March, the lack of discipline is perhaps not surprising. But the divisions exposed within the NSW Liberal party by the federal election suggest that it could be a difficult 12 months ahead.",News/Australia news,The moderates in the NSW Liberals are in a fight they never wanted over Katherine Deves,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/24/the-moderates-in-the-nsw-liberals-are-in-a-fight-they-never-wanted-over-katherine-deves
4/24/2022,"Every time he see’s one of Scott Morrison’s infamous “curry night” selfies, Khushaal Vyas can’t help but feel cynical. Like many in the Indian-Australian community, Vyas initially welcomed the selfies, taking pride in a prime minister that appeared to respect Indian culture. But over time Vyas, became “irked” at the sense the selfies were the beginning and end of engagement with his community. “Part of me, of course, loves that the leader of the country that I live in, loves Indian food or loves celebrating that culture,” he says. “But the other half of me knows that the kind of engagement that I really needed from the government or from that leader didn’t happen when it mattered most.” To Vyas, when it mattered most was during the pandemic, when the India travel ban was implemented in the lead-up to the Delta outbreak, and when tougher lockdown restrictions were biting western Sydney, where a majority of his community live. The travel ban still rankles many in the community. Vyas says people were “horrified” by the policy, which put in place criminal sanctions for Australians seeking to return home from India. “I don’t think I’d ever seen the level of outrage and hurt, than I saw during that time, in the days and weeks that passed after the policy was announced. It felt like our identity was on trial.” “You can’t really sweep that under the rug,” he adds. Vyas, a lawyer working at a clinic at Western Sydney University, is part of the changing face of the Indian-Australian community, as the generation of young people who were born in Australia to parents who migrated from India, come of age. And while he laments the lack of genuine engagement, there is no denying the energy both major parties have injected into campaigning for Indian-Australian voters. Apart from his “curry night” selfies, Morrison has made many trips to temples and community gatherings, photographers in tow. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has also been courting the community, telling a gathering of worshippers at a temple in Blacktown in November that Australia is “unimaginable” without them. “Bringing your culture, your faith, your celebrations and activities here enriches all of us.” And with a skyrocketing Indian migrant population, including in essential marginal seats in New South Wales, their votes will help decide who wins in May. In the seat of Parramatta alone, which Labor holds by a 3.5% margin, over 26% of residents come from an Indian background and in Greenway, again held by Labor by a 2.8% margin, over 11% of residents are from an Indian background. Those are numbers from the 2016 census, with the community likely much larger now. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the Indian-born community now numbers 721,000 – making it larger than the community of residents born in China . And that number does not count those born in Australia, with some estimating the actual size of the community is closer to a million people. But Vyas says the approach by both parties to the community is shallow, one that doesn’t take his community seriously, and built on outdated understandings of how to engage with minority voters. He explained many concerns he’s hearing from his community mirror many of the challenges facing wider Australia, such as the rising costs of living, climate change, and housing affordability. But instead, they face a campaign of “gestures”, where the community is assumed to be spoken for by religious and business groups, placing undue focus on cultural expressions, such as food, over listening to political concerns. And many young people have a word for this kind of surface-level engagement: Samosaplomacy. Sandeep Varma, CEO at South-Asian advocacy group Saari Collective, chuckles when he mentions it, explaining how reductive the approach is. “It’s taking their engagement with a vast country, a vast economy, a vast community that spans the political spectrum, and reducing it down to a samosa.” “It’s meant to be a symbolic gesture, but what does it really symbolise? It’s a symbol of consumption. We’re being consumed for their benefit.” He says the parties have approached the Indian-Australian community with a traditional “playbook” in mind, with a focus on religious leaders or community events. “The playbook plays to established patterns and a hierarchy that we all experienced within our own community, that if you go to our uncles or our parents, business leaders or diplomats, if you appeal to them that there’ll be a trickle-down effect. And and I don’t think that’s the case.” “And that’s the disappointing thing,” he continues “It feels like the playbook was written decades ago.” Varma says a new, savvy generation of Indian Australians is emerging, one that no longer swayed by these cultural gestures. “They’re the young, scrappy, up-and-coming entrepreneurs, they’re content creators and influencers, and usually, the more progressive elements in the community. They don’t own temples or big businesses, and are often ignored,” he said. To Varma, a large part of the problem is the homogenous state of Australian politics. According to a 2018 report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, only 4.1% of MPs in Australia had a non-European background. And it has been a struggle to change that, best reflected by two Labor candidates, Kristina Keneally and Andrew Charlton, being parachuted into multicultural electorates over more representative locals. “We look at Australian politics, and we still don’t see ourselves, it’s still very white,” Varma says. Essentially, this new generation of voters want a seat at the table, and a sense of agency over policies that directly affect their community. Dr Sukhmani Khorana, a senior research fellow at Western Sydney University, says the lack of agency has resulted in an “infantilising” approach adopted by the major parties. “It doesn’t really extend to trying to reflect that community in the decision-making process.” “It’s the same way you might feel that you can shape a child. It feels like they think that wearing a sari to a festival or cooking a curry will result in the community liking them.” Khorana herself as part of “generation 1.5”, having migrated to Australia at a young age, and thinks that a more nuanced approach that considers the differing priorities for different generations of migrants is necessary. “The first generation are broadly working families, who want to see housing affordability, infrastructure, childcare costs, and also long-term parent visas addressed.” “But the second generation is more concerned with being recognised and understood as Australians, and given a fair chance at leadership.” “In saying that, I think both will be cognisant of recent instances where the community hasn’t felt like they’re treated like Australian citizens.” How this dynamic plays out at the ballot is yet to be seen, but what is certain is the influence the Indian-Australian community will have on the result of the election, with Khorana saying many remain undecided. “Many of them don’t have the kind of ideological leaning one way or the other. So they’re up for grabs, if you like.” “But when a community is addressed condescendingly over a period of time, that will have an impact on the ballot box.”",News/Australia news,"‘We still don’t see ourselves’: as leaders court Indian-Australians, a new generation wants more than empty gestures",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/24/we-still-dont-see-ourselves-as-leaders-court-indian-australians-a-new-generation-wants-more-than-empty-gestures
4/24/2022,"Our long and entirely unnecessary national nightmare is over. Kalyn Ponga has extended his deal with the Knights. After a seemingly never-ending drama full of plot twists and secret meetings, press conference storm-outs and outright lies, contract clauses and unaccredited advisors, the star fullback has inked to stay in the Hunter until the end of the 2027 season. This protracted soap opera has finally reached a conclusion nearly all expected, that conclusion being that a club that has struggled to attract big-name stars is willing to do anything to appease their big-name star to keep him. The Knights beat out the Dolphins for Ponga’s signature as the latest addition to the league missed out on yet another target. While winners and losers out of contracts are rarely decided in the immediate aftermath, the Dolphins have come out of this both disappointed and red-faced. The NRL’s newest outfit have yet to land a marquee player despite publicly setting their sites on plenty of key playmakers. Ponga was the closest the Dolphins came. The 24-year-old met secretly with Wayne Bennett, who himself was signed as the new franchise’s coach, to lure the big names. It certainly hasn’t worked to date. Newcastle are certainly pleased with themselves, thrilled they have managed to keep their gun custodian. The red flags this whole saga has thrown up though should suggest any public declaration of unmitigated success should be tempered. The story out of Redcliffe, if it is to be believed, is that Ponga did not respond well to a challenge from Wayne Bennett to become an even better player, apparently expecting to be lauded and enticed rather than have a grim picture painted for him. The inclusion of a clause that allowed him to look at outside deals while still under contract was foolish from the Knights to include but it says plenty. Ponga may have signed a long-term big-money deal with Newcastle but his heart seems a long way from the place. Ponga was incredibly close to walking. He would have if the conditions were right. This was not some light flirting to get a little extra out of his club. This was boxes packed, removalist van booked, note for the family on the kitchen table. The influence Ponga’s father Andre has had over the latest contract negotiation and also over the Knights has proven problematic. Andre now works with the Knights’ NRLW team as the club continues to try and appease a father firmly attached to his son’s business. While Andre Ponga is the central figure in negotiating Kalyn’s contract, he is not an accredited agency. Yet NRL HQ have allowed this to go on in every one of Ponga’s negotiations including this one. Threats that the silky-skilled playmaker may defect to AFL or rugby union seemingly has the NRL willing to overlook some of its key principles and rules. The NRL has not attracted a lot of scrutiny over their role in this tiresome and unsavoury display. But they should be scrutinised. It has been the NRL’s inaction when it comes to the framework around player movement that has allowed this. There is no quick solution to the player transfer framework but it is quite apparent the NRL has put it in the ‘too hard’ basket and is more than happy to let embarrassments like this continue. It is hard to forget Villiame Kikau wearing a 2023 Bulldogs jersey before spending the 2021-22 seasons with Penrith. The NRL is seemingly the only major sport in the world where players can sign with a club and publicly announce it, yet continue to play for their previous club for an extended period. That is utterly absurd. James Harden didn’t finish out the season with the Nets after he was traded to the 76ers. Aaron Rodgers was not allowed to discuss future deals while he was still playing for the Packers. It was often couched as a binary issue. We would have players negotiate in secret with an announcement after June 30 allowed. Or we could have the system where honesty and transparency are prized above all else including loyalty and reputation. The argument for the June 30 deadline is that it allows players time to organise any potential moves. But this is 2022 and the NRL is a professional sport. That should play no role. The NRL has never had a transfer window and has few provisions for clubs to trade players. Little effort is made to constrain clubs. Player management accreditation is seemingly optional if you control the affairs of a family member. There is no silver bullet but the NRL needs to show some leadership. Players cannot be allowed to announce moves well into the future, particularly with different clubs. Clubs cannot crow about future signings either. A transfer window needs to be installed and supported by heavy penalties for tampering and a system that more readily facilitates trading players. The Ponga deal is done and dusted. At least for now. But the NRL needs to heed some very important lessons.",Sport/Sport,Kalyn Ponga deal is done but NRL must fix absurd player transfer issues,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/kalyn-ponga-deal-is-done-but-nrl-must-fix-absurd-player-transfer-issues
4/24/2022,"It’s a few hours from the Goldfields, where I live, to Rye, where my boyfriend Frank lives, but also a few decades. For a Brit like me, this coastal Victorian town is like wandering into the pages of Puberty Blues – and exactly how I imagined Australia to be, back before I actually moved here. Most of the Mornington Peninsula (or Ninch, to locals) might be undergoing one long facelift, but Rye – in particular the back beach area – is an enclave that has held fast to its wild and woolly roots. Tradies who moved here in the 1990s for the surfing lifestyle are now sitting on properties worth a million-plus, but most aren’t budging – and neither are their kids. Serving the area is one short retail strip, including a milk bar, a bottle shop and a surfboard shop. Dundas Street Milk Bar is an institution for its hot chips and gravy, but also for its resident one-legged seagull, Lefty. Inside, you can buy fishing bait (mainly for the benefit of co-owner Mark Watkins), Point Break merch and surf wax. They do sell Big M flavoured milk, but they’ve also gone progressive with Soy Boy. On a whiteboard there are printouts of the top surf months, the data Watkins has been collating for 20 years, and which causes many arguments among customers. “We all have an idea of when the surf’s good, and I would have said February, but it’s nowhere near the best,” Watkins says. The formidable surf breaks have names like Gumboots, Snatches, Head Injuries and Spooks. Watkins says few are secret these days, but some are too fickle for non-locals to master. And even he’s warned off if he strays from his usual territory. “There are a couple I go to, west of my spot, and in a jokey way I’ll get: ‘What are you doing here? Got your visa?’” he says. “If you’re a stranger, good luck.” There is some intense localism around here – diehards sport “3941” postcode tattoos, others “Rye or Die”. You might also spot the odd “Fuck off, touros” sign at beach tracks, but then localism isn’t confined to Rye. Frank points out he had a similar greeting written in surfboard wax on his car window once in Portland. There are seemingly so few coastal towns that haven’t had their barefoot culture diluted by gentrification, that those living in these pockets can get protective. “It’s not that easy to get to know people here,” Watkins admits. “I’ve seen people move in and then move back to Melbourne because, basically, if you don’t play golf, surf or fish, you’re going to struggle.” Watkins estimates seven out of 10 houses on his road are holiday homes, but he finds the new builds inoffensive. They’re not volume-builder constructions and they tend to be set back, concealed by the tea trees. Plus, the local tradies get to work on them. While a recent Guardian article detailed the huge rent hikes in the Mornington Peninsula, people I talk to here say their kids often move back in, or pile into open-door share houses, or build on one end of their parents’ block. For me, growing up in a boring satellite town of London, the goal was to leave home fast and never return. It was the same for Frank, growing up in Vermont in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. But here, kids tend to boomerang back. Frank’s 20-year-old daughter, Stella, went to WA for two years and has noticed some subtle differences upon her return. “Every car on the road used to be a beaten-up tradie car,” she says. “Now you park at carry and there are $100,000 cars everywhere and wedding photo shoots.” I should explain “carry”. It’s a car park behind Rye Ocean Beach where locals often back up and cook snags. As 19-year-old pro skateboarder Zepp Heyes tells me, “It’s almost like if our generation didn’t have phones. No one says, ‘We’re going to carry’ – everyone just rocks up. If someone’s not at the carpark they’ll be at the Dundas Street Milk Bar.” Zepp moved to Noosa a few months ago, but he’s already returned to Rye twice; once for his dad Drew’s legendary Ninch Fest, a music festival in its sixth year that has a distinctly uncorporate vibe. “It’s a reunion party, the sickest time,” Zepp says. “My girlfriend had never experienced anything like it and she absolutely frothed it.” During lockdowns, the then-Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Despi O’Connor petitioned for the region to be annexed from metropolitan Melbourne, but the pandemic barely affected socialising in Rye. With only one bar that’s deemed worth frequenting, and the city too far to bother, socialising instead centres around house-hopping and beach doofs. And it tends to be intergenerational. “It’s like we’re all the same age,” Zepp tells me. “Dad sends us a different song he’s discovered each week. We’ll be like, ‘That’s sick!’ and send him one back.” His dad adds, “We tend to put a lot of effort into our music and surfing and partying, because that’s the lifestyle we chose over career.” Heyes Sr, a glazier, bought his block in 1998. The house is an ever-morphing construction of recycled windows, pier timber and mosaic panels, with a water treatment plant and solar power system. “A lot of people are like-minded in that way,” he says. “We will always go to protests about the blowing up of the heads and so forth. You’re really conscious of your local environment, and the greater environment as well.” For some, though, Rye has become too mainstream. Amy Hackett first hitched here to surf in 1980, aged 15, when the demographic was largely Italian, but has moved to Phillip Island. Back then, she befriended the legendary surfers and surfboard shapers of the area – many immortalised on podcast Salt of the Peninsula – and joined the Peninsula Board Riders at a time when women’s surfing competitions were an afterthought. “There weren’t a lot of women surfing because it wasn’t accessible like now. It was raw,” she says. “In the water I became renowned for a drop-in because if I didn’t stake my place I’d be out the door.” Every girl has a surfboard these days, and she’s noticed the 80s and 90s fashions resurfacing. “It’s funny to see them embrace it like they’ve invented it; I crack up laughing,” she says. But the kids are all right. As Frank points out, with such a small friendship and dating pool, etiquette is vital. “Everyone parties hard down here, but inside that looseness there is an order,” he says. “The minute someone crosses a line here they get pulled up by young and old.” His 22-year-old son Luca lives at home at the moment, but has done stints working at the snow and in Byron Bay, and is soon off to Spain (all with mates from the Ninch), which Frank thinks is a good thing: “At least for a bit,” he says, “because it is a bit [of an] insular peninsula, and there’s a big wide world out there.”",Lifestyle/Travel,‘Got your visa?’: Victoria’s coastal enclave of Rye is holding fast to its barefoot roots,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/24/got-your-visa-victorias-coastal-enclave-of-rye-is-holding-fast-to-its-barefoot-roots
4/24/2022,"On 14 March 1977, a Rolls-Royce carrying the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh swept through the working-class Sydney suburb of Waterloo to visit a new inner-city high-rise housing commission development. Reports from the day note the royal couple were “quickly whisked up to the 29th floor to the one-bedroom home of 83-year-old Mr Vyvyan Smith, [where] the Duke gazed out over Botany Bay and the west to the Blue Mountains. ‘Absolutely splendid,’ he said.” It has been a long time since Australia’s public housing stock was anything to be proud of. The 1980s brought the beginnings of a shameful decline in the availability and quality of public housing for the poorest Australians. Between about 1950 and 1970, the New South Wales public housing commission built about a sixth of all houses in the state and then sold a third of everything they built to the tenants, helping to fuel rising rates of home ownership in the postwar period. But these days, the elderly pensioner the Queen met in 1977, who paid $8.80 a week for a single housing commission unit, would struggle to afford to rent in the private market. While pensioners might well be entitled to commonwealth rent assistance, which increases in line with official inflation, over the past two decades the real increases in actual rents in Australia far outstrip the CPI. And the situation is only getting worse. Despite a public housing building boom in many states and territories, so many derelict properties need to be destroyed that the $10bn being spent to build 23,000 dwellings over the next three years will only end up adding about 15,500 dwellings to the available pool of public housing. In Tasmania – which is making a big push to build public housing – the waiting list for public housing has blown out from 2,100 in June 2013 to 4,707 in February 2022 and the estimated wait time for “priority applicants” to be housed in Tasmania was almost five years. By the mid-2030s, it’s estimated 731,000 new public housing units will be needed to house homeless and low-income Australians facing unaffordable private rents. But of course, there are two housing crises in Australia. The other is housing affordability. Middle class Australians grasping for the great Australian dream of home ownership now spend up to a decade saving to raise a deposit while they too compete for private rental housing. Scott Morrison has told these renters that the best way the government can support them is to help them buy a home. But what if the best solution for them was not to buy a house? And what if by encouraging these people not to buy a house, we could solve both our national housing crises at the same time? Recently on ABC TV’s The Drum, we explored a notion that for decades has preoccupied housing researchers like Chris Martin, senior research fellow in the City Futures Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. Martin is convinced by the idea of a massively expanded public housing sector, which could at once wipe out the waiting list and expand the eligibility criteria. “What if you could provide for a range of tenants, from the neediest Australians to essential workers who couldn’t otherwise afford to live close to where they work, right through to middle income earners, unable to afford their own home but able to pay more substantial rents, which would help subsidise the whole system?” he wonders. Expanding the eligibility in this way would help end the problem of a marginalised, shrunken public housing system, wasting away on what Martin calls “starvation rations”. “At the moment it’s a catch-22. Very low-income people can afford only very low rent. The gap between what they can pay and the cost of a reasonable housing sector is not being met by [government]. Therefore, maintenance of existing housing stock becomes a huge problem. So with fewer suitable units available due to the maintenance crisis, priority occupancy is given to those in the most dire need, who naturally can’t pay much in rent. That further reduces the funding available for maintenance and to develop new stock so that public housing sector shrinks further.” But why would Australians be persuaded to abandon their cultural aspirations around home ownership – or, as another researcher puts it, their “unerring belief that home ownership is the only way to ‘get ahead’” in this country? Economic modelling by EY Sweeney challenges the notion that renting is dead money. Their research compares the fortunes of two Sydney home seekers with the same starting capital, in any one of 43 local government areas in Sydney between 1994 and 2017. One invests in a house or unit. The other rents and invests instead in an ASX200 index fund, pouring all the additional money they would otherwise have spent on a mortgage, utility and maintenance costs into that fund. Ten years on, the result? 62% of the time the renters were better off than home owners living in the same area.

In a black and white newsreel from 1944 called “Design for Living Post-War”, an announcer – in that slightly shouty newsreel cadence of the day – reports on a similar housing crisis which faced Australia through the Depression and into the 1940s: “The Department of Post-War Reconstruction estimates Australia will need 750,000 homes.” Oddly enough, that’s almost precisely the public housing deficit facing modern Australia. The narrator continues: “Most of these will need to be homes low enough in cost for the average wage earner to be able to live in. Everything depends on the plan we make today for tomorrow’s housing in postwar Australia. We planned ‘all in’ to win the war and we’re winning. We have to plan as a nation and not just for ourselves if we are to win the peace.” What if in post-Covid Australia we went “all in” to solve the housing crisis?

4/24/2022,"The feeling from community sports clubs in the midst of the political debate about trans athletes competing in women’s sport over the last week is not relief. It’s anxiety: how can we protect our trans players from this completely unwarranted attack on their right to play? The prime minister has been attempting to characterise this as an issue of concern for ordinary mums and dads “who just want common sense to apply”. But in my experience, grassroots sport and the community more generally are way ahead of this political debate, just as they were on the issue of marriage equality. Here’s what I know as the vice-president of Elsternwick, one of Victoria’s oldest amateur football clubs. Our trajectory at Elsternwick is a really common one: a club that for more than a century was only for cis men has performed an incredible gear-shift in just the last few years. From the moment it started a women’s team in 2019, it committed to being inclusive; to welcoming people of all backgrounds and identities – those with excellent skills honed over a lifetime and those who’ve never picked up a ball in their life. Active steps towards trans inclusion are a necessary part of that process. When I went looking for guidance on the best ways for the club to do that, I found a wealth of resources. The idea that sports are in uncharted waters on this is simply untrue. The most high level guidance comes from Sport Australia. In partnership with the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports, it published extensive guidelines for sports in 2019 on how to be trans-inclusive and fair, and also explained the reasons why it was not only necessary but ideal. The Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission published its own specific guidelines even earlier, in 2017. In 2020, the AFL released a policy for its community clubs that allows players to play for the team that aligns with their gender identity, and non-binary players to play in the team in which they feel most comfortable. Trans players are under no obligation to “confirm” their gender identity or disclose that they are trans in any way. These things are really important. As hockey player Emily Dwyer wrote for Guardian Australia: “For some trans and gender diverse people experiences or fears of discrimination – deliberate, subtle, unintentional – are barriers to participation that remain too high. Isolation and depression are crisis issues for trans and gender-diverse people; participation in sporting and social activities can be one part of the solution.” For some sports, there are rules around therapeutic use of testosterone, as competitive sports generally follow the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) Anti-Doping Code, in which exogenous testosterone is a banned substance. But Prof Kate Henne, at the School of Regulation and Global Governance at Australian National University, says that the focus on testosterone thresholds as a marker for male or femaleness is just the latest flawed method in a long line of different ways sport has tried to “test” for sex difference, stretching back almost a century. “This concern about men participating in women’s sport has paralleled the growth of women’s sport, and it’s been a preoccupation of elite administrators more than anything,” says Henne. The earliest tests were inspections of women’s actual genitalia. After there was backlash against this and regulators decided they were violating athletes’ human rights, there was a move towards scientific procedures. “To see politicians evoke archaic ideas about gender and women’s sport – it really sets us back in terms of participation in sport when we’ve made such great progress. It’s really out of step,” says Henne. Not all clubs put their own trans-inclusion policies in writing. Evan Lloyd, president of West Brunswick Amateur Football Club, which currently fields six teams, says their strategy has simply been “to be nice”. “It’s worked out really well so far. Our main focus was always just to remove barriers to players. We just wanted to make it easier for people to come and play footy,” said Lloyd. “The clubs with a good culture are the ones that attract people and grow.” Inclusivity begets inclusivity. Since West Brunswick started its first team in the women’s division in 2016, it has grown to three women’s teams and has had numerous trans players, in part due to the fact that many women who play football are more connected to the LGBTQI+ community. “It’s really improved the culture on the men’s side of things, and the whole experience of the club is better for everyone,” said Lloyd. “There are more families, people bring their kids down, people volunteer from outside of the playing group more often. I can’t speak enough about how much it has improved the mood at the club. When all sides are going well, that’s when it really hums.” One of the best gender diversity in sports policies I’ve seen committed to paper comes from the Flying Bats Football Club (that’s the round-ball sport) in Sydney. Established in 1985 as a safe space for lesbians to play soccer and socialise, it evolved over the years and now welcomes “all women – lesbian, queer, bi, straight, cis, trans, intersex – to come and play football and socialise”. Jen Peden, president of the Bats, says inclusion policies at a community sport level are about “actually allowing people to play under the competition that suits them best”. “We had no official policies pre-2016, but there had been trans and gender diverse players for years,” Peden says. “What we wanted to do though was make it more explicit, to make it feel safer for trans and gender diverse players. We took a stance as a club, to make sure they felt welcome and also to put a flag in the ground to say we weren’t here for trans-exclusionary stuff.” Peden despairs about the state of the current debate, noting there are many things that could be done – such as better facilities, more opportunities, more financial support – to help women’s sport, that are being lost. “From a community to an elite level there are so many things that would materially improve women’s sport generally but they take money and effort, and it’s not an opportunity to punch down on a marginalised group in a culture war,” Peden says. Lloyd agrees. “To say that what women’s footy needs is to have trans people excluded, it just misses the mark so far.” Henne’s work supports this, as does research out of Monash showing most women who play sport are not concerned about the inclusion of trans women and girls. One of the many things I’ve learned from playing and volunteering at Elsternwick is that there’s so much reason to have faith in the basic decency of people. Most mums and dads these days have a trans person in their lives, whether through their kids, their work, their family, their community, or their sport. They might not always use the right words and they might need to ask a lot of awkward questions, but they know cruel vilification of an already marginalised group when they see it. One trans player I spoke to put it simply: “I just want to play football.” Community sport just wants to get on with making that happen. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

4/24/2022,"I’m floating in a communal pool that’s heated to a balmy 34C and I couldn’t give a stuff about anything. All the usual stressors like deadlines, bills and traffic jams melt away under the mineral-enriched jets pummelling my lower back at Soak Bathhouse on the Gold Coast. But I vowed to try everything during my 90-minute “soak and sip” session – and that includes the icy cold plunge pool. I brace myself. It’s like leaping into Antarctica. Catching my breath, I hastily retreat to the steam room, where the more sensible bathers are breathing in warm, eucalyptus-scented mist. In this time of contagion, it might seem odd that public bathhouses are back – but they’re booming. Despite Delta and Omicron’s best efforts, at least four major new facilities opened in Australia last year, including Queensland’s Soak, the Bathhouse and Talaroo Hot Springs and Melbourne’s Sense of Self. This year, another communal bathing facility, also called the Bathhouse, opened in Douglas Park, south-west of Sydney. Operators including Soak’s CEO, Alexis Dyson, claim that after 18 months of wearing masks, dodging hugs and handshakes and hunkering down at home, people are yearning to get up close and personal with others. “We’re seeing a huge focus on wellness and mental health generally,” she says. “In particular, people are feeling the need to connect with others.” Communal bathing dates back to Neolithic times, when nomadic tribes sloughed off the strains of the hunt in natural hot springs. This time-honoured tradition finds contemporary expression in many different cultures – think Turkish hammams, Japanese onsen, South Korean jjimjilbang and Finnish saunas. For many Australians, though, the closest we’ve come to communal bathing is sharing the childhood tub with a sibling, or standing under beachside showers to banish sand and salt. For the most part, bathing is a solitary, functional activity, often performed under time pressure, as we prepare for something more important – a date, a meeting, a day at work. But what if bathing was the main event? Melbourne’s Sense of Self co-founder Mary Minas still recalls the wonderment she felt as a 20-year-old entering a hammam at a Paris mosque with a French-Tunisian friend. “We did a ritual that she would do with her mum weekly as a kid growing up,” Minas says. It stretched over six hours instead of the one Minas had banked on, and aspects of it were confronting. “My friend’s telling me ‘It’s nude’ and I was like ‘Oh shit’.” But seeing unapologetically unclad bodies in all shapes and sizes was a revelation, and Minas was hooked. “I thought to myself, ‘Wow, this is the first time I’ve felt really OK about my body,’ having grown up surrounded by diet culture.” Beyond the benefits of relaxation, social connection and body positivity, research suggests there are other reasons to take the plunge. A study published in the BMJ in 2020 found that tub bathing has preventative effects against cardiovascular disease; other studies have credited heat therapy with antidepressant effects and a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. A 2020 review published in the Physiology of Thermal Therapy found that regular sauna or hot tub bathing had comparable health benefits to low or moderate intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging and cycling. However, co-author Charles Steward warned couch potatoes against complacency. “Regular saunas or baths are unable to replicate all the health benefits of exercise training, such as promoting fat loss and increasing muscle mass,” he wrote in the Conversation. As someone who wears flip-flops at the public pool and around shared campground facilities for fear of contracting plantar warts, I wonder what hazards hide amid the bubbles. According to Edith Cowan University’s environmental health leader, Dr Edmore Masaka, water-holding environments may harbour pathogens such as legionella and pseudomonas – opportunistic bacteria that cause disease mainly in people with underlying health conditions. “Combine that with warmer temperatures and you actually increase the potential for the growth of certain types of bacteria,” he says. However, Masaka points out that the Australian standards that apply to the design of public facilities, along with the filtration, disinfection and monitoring requirements imposed by state governments and implemented by local authorities, go a long way in controlling outbreaks of pathogen-caused disease. He is unaware of any outbreaks of illness arising from bathhouses in Australia. Public pools and splash parks, on the other hand, have been linked with cryptosporidium and other infections. Covid transmission is possible in communal bathhouses, as with any other indoor gathering space, but whether higher humidity changes the risk profile is uncertain. “No specific research with Covid-19 has determined whether this makes a significant difference when compared with other environments,” Masaka says. Both Dyson and Minas say they have extensive hygiene protocols. As for finicky wart-fearing folk like me, we can either wear our own footwear (Soak) or slip on a provided pair of slides (Sense of Self). “It’s just to keep everyone safe,” Minas says, adding that changing shoes is also “part of the ritual”. Minas cautions that high temperatures make bathhouses unsuitable for pregnant people, but most others can partake. As for the reason to do so, she says: “Even if it gets you to stop thinking for a few moments … that’s a win.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,The allure of communal bathing: ‘This is the first time I’ve felt really OK about my body’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/24/the-allure-of-communal-bathing-this-is-the-first-time-ive-felt-really-ok-about-my-body
4/24/2022,"When the Queen visited St Vincent and the Grenadines in 1985, she was met with a jamboree, the prime minister presented her with a commemorative gold coin and residents lined the streets waving flags. During a trip to the Caribbean island nation on Saturday, her son and daughter in law have received a somewhat frostier welcome. After a red carpet arrival in the capital Kingstown, to a steel band playing One Love by Bob Marley, the Earl and Countess of Wessex were confronted by protesters calling for slave trade reparations. Idesha Jackson, 47, was among a crowd of about 20 in the farming village of Diamond, where Prince Edward had travelled to watch athletes training for the Commonwealth Games. She said she was there to show her “disgust and disappointment” for those who “over 400 years, had to suffer the slave master’s whip”. “This wrong was done against a sector of the human race by another and this wrong must be compensated,” Jackson said. Theo Thomas, 69, who travelled to the protest from the Lowmans Hill community on the other side of the country criticised his government for permitting the visit. “It’s a shame that a so-called progressive government would be using our people as props to entertain members of the royal family and there has been no conversation about reparations,” he said. Jomo Thomas, a former chair of the St Vincent and the Grenadines National Reparations Committee, was also among protesters. He called for reparations from Britain. “They hunted us down, they kidnapped us, they stole us, they worked us. They owe us and they must now pay us,” he said. The protests are the latest controversy to mar recent Royal visits to the area. Last month the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge faced demonstrations in Jamaica and the Bahamas. And last week Prince Edward and Sophie’s visit to Grenada was abruptly called off. Grenada’s Reparations Commission on slavery had wished to meet the couple. The next leg of the Wessexes’ tour will take them to Antigua and Barbuda, where things could become even bumpier. The local Reparations Support Commission chairman Dorbrene O’Marde has warned more protests are likely. In an open letter, the commission accused the royal family and British government of coming to the Caribbean to “lament that slavery was an ‘appalling atrocity’, that it was ‘abhorrent’, that ‘it should not have happened’.” “We hear the phoney sanctimony of those who came before you that these crimes are a ‘stain on your history’,” the letter said. “For us, they are the source of genocide and of continuing deep international injury, injustice and racism. We hope you will respect us by not repeating the mantra. We are not simpletons.” In the UK, the National Council of St Vincent and the Grenadines urged the royals to rethink future visits to the Caribbean. “We as a community feel that the royal family and Buckingham Palace must rethink the future of royal tours following previous visits, given their involvement in the treatment of people of colour,” a spokesperson said. “Feelings were running very high after the last visit to the Caribbean. What’s changed?”",News/World news,Slavery protesters target royal tour in St Vincent,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/slavery-protesters-target-royal-tour-in-st-vincent
4/24/2022,"Plans to ditch Boris Johnson as Tory leader and prime minister “sooner rather than later”, without waiting for a clear and obvious successor to emerge, are being advanced by a growing number of senior Conservatives. Amid mounting alarm at the effects the Partygate scandal could have on their electoral chances, high-ranking MPs are urging wavering colleagues not to dither because of worries about the succession, or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but rather to strike before it is too late. One former minister told the Observer: “Things have changed. There is now a feeling that we can’t defend what is going on and that we can’t delay any longer because of the succession or Ukraine. If we don’t act well before the party conference in October, it will be too late.” After another disastrous week for Johnson, during which MPs of all parties agreed to set up their own investigation into whether he deliberately misled parliament, MPs say several potential successors are stepping up campaign preparations and canvassing support – including Liz Truss, Penny Mordaunt and Jeremy Hunt. Last night Mark Harper, the former Tory chief whip, who last week called for Johnson to go, told the Observer he understood why some colleagues wanted to delay acting until after Partygate investigations were complete, or for other reasons. But he urged them to have confidence that an excellent successor would emerge during the process to elect a new leader, even if it was unclear now who that would be. “I have seen enough to reach a conclusion that the prime minister needs to go,” Harper said. “My colleagues can be confident that we have very talented people and a very robust process for selecting a new leader that will ensure we get a capable, credible successor who can set out an attractive proposition and ensure we can win the next election.” He added: “I think the facts will mean that a majority of Conservative MPs will reach the conclusion that the prime minister needs to go.” Another former cabinet minister said doubts over the succession were now irrelevant, such was the urgency of the situation. “A broomstick would be better than what we have at the moment,” he said. The mood swung dramatically against Johnson last week after he was forced to apologise to the Commons for being fined for attending a lockdown birthday party in 2020, and then appeared to back attempts to order his own MPs to block an investigation into whether he had deliberately misled parliament by previously denying parties had taken place. Many Tory MPs are waiting until the results of the 5 May local elections before deciding whether to send a formal letter of no confidence in Johnson to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. If Brady receives 54 or more such letters, a vote of confidence has to be held, and if Johnson loses he must step down. The problems that have recently engulfed the previous favourite to succeed Johnson, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – over his wife’s tax affairs, and the fact that he, too, was fined for breaking lockdown rules – are seen as having destroyed his chances of following Johnson into No 10. The Tory peer Lord Hayward agreed that the mood had changed and succession issues were less likely to hold MPs back. “I get the impression that because people have moved from whatever position they were in to a more sceptical position, they now believe it’s just got to happen – and we’ll have the conversation about ‘who next’ when it happens. There are people moving, reaching the point of no return, even though they’re not sure who the alternative would be. It’s only a question of judging when the moment arrives.” Another senior Tory MP said: “Lots of colleagues who have local elections going on have been hearing, ‘I like what you’re doing as our new MP, but we can’t vote for you while that blithering idiot is in office’. I spoke to several MPs this week who had all taken their seats from Labour. They all said the situation was terrible. They’re starting to say, it’s not whether but when – and it doesn’t matter who, as long as it’s not him.” Johnson insisted during a two-day trade trip to India that he would lead his party into the next general election. But the Partygate scandal dogged him throughout the visit. Shortly before his return to London on Friday, it emerged that the Metropolitan police had started to issue fines for another party he attended – in this case a “bring your own booze” garden event on 20 May 2020. No 10 said Johnson had not been fined for attending the event, though it was impossible to say whether he would be in the future. Opposition party leaders said it would be unacceptable for the prime minister to hold back information about whether he had been fined ahead of the local elections. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “There can be no hiding place for law breaking, and that includes in Downing Street. Boris Johnson must keep his promise and declare without hesitation if he is given another fine for breaking his own lockdown law. He has withheld the truth from the British public for far too long.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson should go sooner rather than later, say top Tory MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/boris-johnson-should-go-sooner-rather-than-later-say-top-tory-mps
