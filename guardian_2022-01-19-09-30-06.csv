1/19/2022,"As we barrel towards what’s sure to be an unedifying federal election campaign with more of us long-term unemployed and facing entrenched poverty than ever before, poor people are bracing ourselves. We know we’re about to be assaulted with opinions from wealthy people about what we need and what we don’t, with higher income support payments placed firmly in the latter category.  Those of us who rely on welfare are so used to having offensive commentary foisted on us by people who’vespent most of their working lives in politics you’d think we’d be inured to it. And yet, here I am, reeling from another poverty polemic. This week, Labor MP Patrick Gorman wrote in an opinion piece titled Labor leads the war on poverty: “Poverty is not simply being low income.” So who do politicians want you to sympathise with when they talk like this? Gorman writes: “Homeless, women in abusive relationships, people with multiple jobs but no job security, Indigenous Australians still experiencing centuries-long discrimination, and [an] increasing number of pensioners, especially single women, living in poverty” should be at the centre of government decision making. “Lifting Australians out of poverty does not mean reducing enterprise or aspiration. It simply means expanding opportunity” he writes, adding that Labor’s plan “will ensure those who work hard have secure jobs, secure housing and a secure retirement after a lifetime of work.” This rhetoric leaves harmful stereotypes about unemployed people intact – and weaponises us. It implies there is a class of “undeserving” poor who have no aspirations. It erases the unpaid labour done by hundreds of thousands of people on poverty payments, and the 550,000 people on unemployment payments who are disabled. It ignores that the vast majority of people living in poverty aren’t in these situations – we’re simply subsisting on obscenely low Centrelink payments set by the government. It’s unthinkable that someone could expect to credibly write hundreds of words about poverty without mentioning this. At first I thought it was a joke, mocked up by a jaded poor person in response to Monday’s commitment that Labor may boost defence spending to more than 2% of gross domestic product if they form government. That’s more than double what’s needed to lift unemployment payments above the Henderson poverty line. But the message was deadly serious, and it’s a deeply harmful one we’ve heard ad nauseam from both major parties. It repeats the same old tropes: secure jobs, housing and retirement, but only for those who “work hard”. These, apparently, are not rights owed to those of us who deliver the government’s desired 4–5% unemployment rate. Never mind that people on welfare payments do work, unpaid and underpaid. Not that the brutal social security system got a mention in the article ostensibly about poverty. Probably because the government-inflicted poverty from obscenely low welfare payments is bipartisan policy. Gorman is right to point out the dire circumstances facing some folks in paid work, but it’s no excuse for ignoring the 2.5 million people and their kids surviving on working-age payments as low as half the poverty line. It’s time to dispel the myths being peddled about what poverty actually means. It’s not some arbitrary figure. It’s not a necessary evil. It’s not immaterial. And it’s certainly not something that only affects people who have a job. It is measurable and it is a political choice. Powerful people who make decisions about precisely how much poverty we should be expected to endure continually approach the issue as a mere academic one. They can only do so because they have never felt what it’s like to be on the verge of missing rent every fortnight, or eating one meal a day, or having the bills get further and further behind, anxiety increasing as the late fees pile up. Poverty means you can’t feed yourself or your kids. It means feeling hungry and being able to do nothing about it. It means when there are supply shortages, as everyone else scrambles to grab as much as they can of whatever they can many of us are left with nothing, because we can’t afford to adapt. We can’t afford to stock up, or buy a more expensive brand if the cheap one sells out, or pay extra to have groceries delivered. There’s no money or energy to traipse around to different stores. There is no room to breathe. All this misery causes long-term damage. It leads to stress and exhaustion and bad teeth and chronic illness and mental ill health. We know from countless stories it leads to suicide, but governments refuse to make that data available, presumably for fear of what it shows. So to the politicians who parcel out meagre sums to so-called poverty alleviation and mental health programs, I have one message: yes, poverty is simply being low income. No amount of charity, psychological bandaids or “place-based initiatives” will change this. All poverty is ultimately income poverty. And its number one cause in this country is abhorrently low welfare payments. We don’t need more food banks, more rebates, more niche supports that are impossible to find out about, let alone access. We need money. To see a politician handwringing about poverty while ignoring welfare recipients this week was too much. Put up or shut up. When Labor were last in government, the gap between the poverty line and unemployment payments grew faster than at any time under Howard or the recent series of Liberal prime ministers since 2013. Labor have refused to say they will increase jobseeker if they win government. It’s even less likely the Coalition will, having increased the rate by $25 a week in April 2021. We’re long overdue for a new measure of poverty in this country. Until then, the best we have is the Henderson poverty line, dating back to the 60s. When people on jobseeker lived at this level temporarily in 2020 because of Covid-19 supports, we heard of the relief it brought, and also how many people still went without (more than a third still regularly skipped meals, medication and healthcare). This is the rate unemployed people and advocates have been pleading to have brought back urgently while the long-term work of better understanding poverty and rebuilding public investment in housing, healthcare and education is done. Both major parties are committed to tax cuts for the rich, negative gearing and capital gains tax policies that fuel astronomical house price growth – and pouring good money after bad on farcical defence projects. Yet they have the audacity to lecture us on careful spending. Both have staunchly ignored every shred of evidence about how government-inflicted poverty and “mutual” obligations are destroying lives and killing people. They have constantly sought to make budget savings off the backs of the poorest people, whether it’s single parents, disabled people, or just the unemployed in general through unlawful schemes like robodebt. So no, whether Liberal or Labor, you’re not for the poor. You’re at war with us.

1/19/2022,"More than 100 members of the global super-rich called on Wednesday for governments around the world to “tax us now” to help pay for the pandemic response and tackle the gulf between rich and poor. The group of 102 millionaires and billionaires, including Disney heiress Abigail Disney, said the current tax system is rigged in their favour and needs to be rewritten to make taxation fairer for hard-working people and restore trust in politics.  “As millionaires, we know that the current tax system is not fair,” they said in an open letter published on Wednesday. “Most of us can say that, while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic – yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes.” The super-rich signatories, who brand themselves as “patriotic millionaires”, called for the introduction of “permanent wealth taxes on the richest to help reduce extreme inequality and raise revenue for sustained, long-term increases in public services like healthcare”. “Restoring trust requires taxing the rich,” they said in the letter, published as world leaders and business executives meet for a virtual Davos World Economic Forum. “The world – every country in it – must demand the rich pay their fair share. Tax us, the rich, and tax us now.” The group, which also includes Nick Hanauer, a venture capitalist who made an almost $1bn fortune from an early bet on Amazon, said an annual “wealth tax” on those with fortunes of more than $5m (£3.7m) could raise more than $2.52tr. That would be enough, they said, to “lift 2.3 billion people out of poverty; make enough vaccines for the world and deliver universal healthcare and social protection for all the citizens of low and lower-middle-income countries (3.6 billion people).” The proposed tax would see those with more than $5m pay 2%, rising to 3% for those with more than $50m and a 5% rate for dollar billionaires. Taxing the UK’s wealthiest 119,000 people at these rates would raise an estimated £43.7bn, a year, according to an analysis by campaign groups Fight Inequality Alliance, Institute for Policy Studies, Oxfam and the Patriotic Millionaires. The signatories said this would be enough to: Pay for the Health and Social Care Levy twice over every year – eliminating the need to raise national insurance on working people. Cover the salaries of an additional 50,000 new nurses. Pay for the permanent increase of universal credit. Build 35,000 affordable houses and retrofit the UK’s draughtiest homes to reduce the cost of energy bills and help fight the climate crisis. Gemma McGough, a British entrepreneur and founding member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, said: “At a time when simply living will cost the average household a further £1,200 a year, our government cannot expect to be trusted if it would rather tax working people than wealthy people. If they do anything in the next few months, they should do this: rather than raising national insurance, tax the rich – tax us – instead.” Jenny Ricks, global convenor at the Fight Inequality Alliance, said: “The insane reality is that while billions face a daily struggle to survive during this pandemic, billionaire-wealth is spiralling out of control. This cannot be right. The multiple crises we face from vaccine inequality to climate breakdown have a vice-like grip on people’s lives that is not letting up. For years Davos has shown us the elites cannot and will not end the virus of inequality they have helped to create and built their fortunes on the back of.”",News/Business,Millionaires call on governments worldwide to ‘tax us now’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/millionaires-call-on-governments-worldwide-to-tax-us-now
1/19/2022,"Boris Johnson’s promise to “level up” the nation by providing next-generation-speed broadband to most homes by 2025 is under threat as rural dwellers are left behind in the internet revolution, according to a report by parliament’s spending watchdog. The report by the public accounts committee found that the government is relying too heavily on companies, most notably BT Openreach and Virgin Media O2, to achieve Johnson’s key election manifesto pledge of addressing the UK’s status as a global laggard in broadband speeds.  These companies are focused on the less costly, easier to reach urban conurbations across the UK. The government plan, developed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, is failing to deliver on a promise to find affordable solutions to connect those living in rural areas and remote towns and villages. “What DCMS does know full well is it can’t rely on the private sector to get fast broadband to the hardest to reach, excluded and rural areas,” said Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC. “And despite its repeated promises to do exactly that, we are apparently little nearer to closing ‘the great digital divide’ developing across the UK nor addressing the social and economic inequality it brings with it.” At the end of last year, 47% of UK homes and premises had the potential to sign up for next-generation-speed broadband. While the rollout plan means half of all urban dwellers can get these speeds, only a quarter of those in rural areas have the opportunity. The huge demand for reliable, high-speed internet connections as millions moved to home, remote and flexible working and schooling during the pandemic has increased pressure on and scrutiny of the government’s plans. An initial promise by Johnson to deliver full-fibre broadband to every UK home by 2025 was subsequently expanded to include gigabit technology, which provides equally fast connections but the PAC said is “not as future proof”, in order to achieve the target. The promise to reach every home was then reduced to 85% of homes and premises, with the government making only £1.2bn of a £5bn fund created to connect rural homes available until one year before its 2025 deadline, which the PAC is not convinced will be achieved. “DCMS’s planning and project management show all the signs of the previous rollout – the focus will continue to be on the easier to reach areas and there is still no plan for the hardest to reach communities,” Hillier said. “It couldn’t really explain how broadband has got as far as it has in this critical national strategy. And incredibly it still doesn’t have a real plan for getting the rest of the way to its downgraded targets.” The PAC pointed out that the longer-term goal of every household getting access by 2030 still excludes about 134,000 premises in the hardest to reach areas that are not commercially viable. These “forgotten homes” are still unable to get even the 10Mbps speed connection deemed the bare minimum to meet a modern family’s needs. The prohibitive cost of reaching these premises through conventional methods means the government is considering alternative technology such as satellite broadband to connect them. “It is misleading to suggest we are reliant on the commercial sector to hit our target, which we remain on track to meet,” said a spokesperson for the DCMS. “We are investing £5bn so hard-to-reach areas can get gigabit speeds. Our policies and investment also mean 97% of premises can access superfast broadband which meets people’s current needs and helped us through the pandemic.”",News/Business,"Boris Johnson’s faster broadband promise is being broken, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/boris-johnsons-faster-broadband-promise-is-being-broken-say-mps
1/19/2022,"Think of “the north” and images that come to mind include Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North, the sculpture of Henry Moore and Manchester’s music scene. But now a rare show of cross-party unity has called for all of the cultural icons of northern England to be a catalyst to rebuild the region and rebalance it with the rest of the UK.  Ministers will join Labour council leaders and mayors to launch the first report of its kind on Wednesday, which sets out in detail how culture could and should be a central part of the region’s post-pandemic recovery. Recommendations in a ten-point action plan include devolving funding decisions to a regional level from London; encouraging more strategic partnerships and less competition between different areas; and greater investment in next-generation creative talents. It calls for culture to be “embedded” in the government’s levelling-up white paper, expected in the next week. Prof Katy Shaw, lead writer of the Case for Culture report, said she thought many people were fed up with “hearing about the value of the north only in terms of things like technology or business. “For the first time what this report is doing is evidencing, not just asserting, why and how culture is possibly the quickest and also the most underused lever for levelling up,” she said. “We’re sick, really, of hearing how much change is needed in the north to rebalance and rebuild and how we are always at the bottom of the snakes and ladders board. “The north is really well positioned coming out of the pandemic to think about how we can work on what we are good at – and that includes culture. We can use culture as a catalyst to boost our region and to boost our position in the UK to have genuine levelling up.” Dan Jarvis, the Labour mayor of South Yorkshire, will be at the launch. He said levelling up had to be more than an economic mission. “It’s got to be about improving how people feel about the places where they live,” he said. “Culture does this … it adds colours to people’s lives and makes a place somewhere that we want to live, study, work and invest in. No one deserves to live in black and white. There is a real opportunity now to level up the north and culture must be central to that.” Other expected speakers include the arts minister, the Conservative peer Stephen Parkinson; the levelling up minister, Neil O’Brien; and the shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell. A key theme of the report is encouraging more collaboration. Tracy Brabin, the mayor of West Yorkshire, said funding cannot carry on being a “beauty contest where we’re all pitching against each other. “The money and time spent in these bids is unfortunately so draining and then when you don’t win there’s nothing.” Organisations who gave evidence for the report argue that funding decisions made in London are not always fair. They are not, said one, “based on a current understanding of our cultural map, challenges or opportunities.” The report has been prepared for the northern culture all-party parliamentary group jointly chaired by James Daly, Conservative MP for Bury North, and Julie Elliott, Labour MP for Sunderland Central. In a joint statement they said this was the first time the “north has come together as one, to champion the north’s rich cultural tapestry.” They added: “We know that northern culture makes a huge contribution to the UK economy but now is the time for the north to seize this ‘once in a generation’ opportunity to increase diversity, sustainability, accessibility and resilience in its talent pipeline.” Shaw, director of cultural partnerships at Northumbria University, said culture had not played a big enough role in the wider levelling-up debate but that was changing. She said she had been going to “northern powerhouse” conferences for five years “and this was the first year there’s ever been a panel on culture. “It’s because, coming out of the pandemic, people can see this huge opportunity with culture that delivers on everything from wellbeing to education to decarbonisation. Like all of these things the government will say: ‘Where’s the evidence’? That’s really what our report has been able to do for the first time.”",News/UK news,Northern leaders to put culture at centre of region’s post-pandemic recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/northern-leaders-to-put-culture-at-centre-of-regions-post-pandemic-recovery

1/19/2022,"Rooftop solar took a hit in 2021 with the industry growing a third less than expected thanks to lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, despite still showing strong growth overall. More than 3m households and small businesses across the country now have solar panel systems installed, with the milestone reached in November.  According to registration data provided by solar consultancy company SunWiz, 3.24GW of new solar capacity was added across the country last year, representing 10% growth on the previous year. These figures include small rooftop systems of less than 100MW registered by homeowners and small businesses, and do not include large, industrial-scale solar installations. Queensland now has the most installed capacity, with 4,483MW, closely followed by New South Wales (4,256MW) and Victoria (3,839MW). Australia continues to lead the world for solar installations with a total installed capacity of just under 17GW nationwide. The growth rate was lower than in previous years, with 2021 bookended by a surge in installations in March and December, and a drop off in between. Warwick Johnston, managing director at SunWiz, said the third-quarter slump was caused by the pandemic as lockdowns stopped installers from entering people’s homes, while supply chain problems meant wait times and shipping costs grew. He expected these issues to continue in 2022 but for demand to remain strong, as people sought to upgrade their old solar systems to generate enough capacity to support an electric vehicle in the future. “There’s 8.5m dwellings in Australia and we’re reaching a significant fraction of them already,” Johnston said. “Even in economically uncertain times people find that solar is as good an investment they can make. “It’s a safer bet than betting on crypto.” Separate data provided by Tristan Edis, an analyst with Green Energy Markets, showed photovoltaic solar upgrades were much stronger in 2021, and were anticipated to grow through to 2025. Edis said while previous forecasts had anticipated 3,600MW of installed capacity in 2021, roughly a 15% increase compared with 2020, he agreed lockdowns had “put a big dampener on the market”. Despite these short-term constraints, he said it was possible there was an “underlying slowdown” at work as states wound back solar feed-in tariffs that pay people for electricity fed into the grid. “The economics for solar systems have deteriorated across most states over the past two years as feed-in tariffs have been dropping at a faster rate than the purchase cost of a solar system, plus retail electricity prices have begun declining as well,” Edis said. “We have been expecting this would eventually flow through to reduced demand for solar systems, although this slowdown has not come as quickly as we had originally expected, but there are signs that it is now taking place.” Edis said while supply chain issues and a bump in the price of solar panels from manufacturers in China may dent sales in 2022, this was only a “temporary phenomenon” that “shouldn’t affect things beyond this year”. John Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, said the industry was still bullish about its prospects. While the anticipated 15% growth rate seen in previous years may continue to be throttled by supply chain issues in 2022, he said demand remained strong. “People trust in solar now. There’s no question about whether it works, or ‘will it cut my power bill?’ – those things have been resolved. The industry’s mature,” Grimes said.
