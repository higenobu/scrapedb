3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak has said more financial support could be announced later this year to tackle spiralling energy bills but stressed he could not solve “every problem”, after criticism of the mini budget designed to tackle the cost of living crisis. In a terse defence of the measures revealed on Wednesday, which critics said would fail to stem the biggest fall in living standards on record, the chancellor insisted that a 5p cut to fuel duty, a rise in the national insurance threshold and the promise of an income tax cut in two years’ time “will make a difference”. “They will put money in the pockets of hardworking British families because this government wants to support them through these challenging months ahead,” he said. After facing criticism for announcing no further support for those on universal credit, who will see their benefits rise by just 3% while inflation leaps to nearly 8%, Sunak retorted that “we can’t do everything”. Pressed on why he did not reinstate the £20 uplift put in place when the Covid outbreak began, Sunak said that the government “did some things temporarily in the pandemic, which have ended” but those were “not the right and appropriate interventions now”. With energy bills expected to grow by up to 54% when the price cap is raised next month, Sunak suggested he could intervene again to help those struggling to heat their homes by the time the cap is reviewed again in October. Asked if he may be forced to provide more financial support, Sunak told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Yes: of course, we’ll have to see where we are by the autumn and it’s it’s right for people to recognise that they are protected between now and the autumn because of the price cap. “I always keep everything under review and the government – as it’s shown over the past few years – is always responsive to what’s happening. “But I would say with energy prices, they are very volatile. And I don’t think you, I or anyone else has any certainty about what will happen in October right now.” Sunak was asked why he was so uncertain about what help may be needed in six months’ time when he also announced yesterday that the basic rate of income tax would be cut from 20p to 19p in 2024. “Because we’re dealing right now with a situation, particularly with Ukraine and Russia, which is highly volatile, there’s a very high degree of uncertainty about the near term because it’s unclear how that situation is going to play out,” he said. “Over a longer period of time, you can find alternative sources of energy and be much less reliant on gas that’s coming from Russia.” Sunak said he understood many people “across the country are struggling with prices going up” but added he could not help everyone. “I wish I could solve every problem and sadly, I can’t and have tried to be honest about that,” he said. He said the UK was “not alone” in facing what he called global pressures, and blamed “global inflationary challenges” as well as the cost of weaning the west off Russian imported energy. Labour has urged Sunak to abandon the national insurance rise, and use a windfall tax on offshore oil and gas companies to try to raise £3bn. Rachel Reeves said it was a disaster that living standards had been forecast to fall to their lowest point since the 1950s, when records began. She told BBC Breakfast on Thursday: “The tax burden is the highest it’s been since the 1940s … by the end of the parliament, seven out of eight will be paying more in tax, only one in eight will be paying less in tax.” Reeves also told LBC: “Rishi Sunak can say he’s a tax-cutting chancellor but it’s a bit like a kid in his bedroom playing air guitar: he’s not a rockstar.”",News/UK news,Sunak says he ‘can’t do everything’ after spring statement criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/sunak-says-he-cant-do-everything-after-spring-statement-criticism
3/24/2022,"What should have been a historic moment for the first Black woman to be nominated to the US supreme court, has become a scene of childish political theatre, thanks to Senate Republicans. And as President Joe Biden’s nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson makes her way through the last round of questioning by the Senate judiciary committee, one thing is clear: she deserves better. As the world watches the hearings unfold, the image from day one of Brown Jackson being grilled relentlessly by a group of old white men still sticks out vividly to me. Not only is she already being held up to far more scrutiny than any white man in her position would be, but the line of questioning from across the aisle has devolved into the absolutely ridiculous. Picture this: a successful attorney and judge with a decade on the bench and more judicial experience than 43 of the last 58 justices who took the bench, being questioned on whether or not she knows what a “woman” is, and whether or not babies are racist. Brown Jackson was also asked whether she is an “activist judge”, implying that she could come into the role with her own political and presumably racial agenda, and questioned about her faith. Every Black woman on earth can relate to the cringing, soul-crushing feeling of having to answer – with grace and a smile – questions that your white counterparts would never be asked. And Brown Jackson is no exception, as she’s held her composure in the face of intense and often ludicrous lines of inquiry. But even if she was able to navigate the absurd queries and gotcha questions designed to trip her up, Republicans had another strategy; outrightly discrediting her, including an accusation from Senator Josh Hawley that she “has a pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook” (that claim that was quickly disproven). In one of the more absurd turns on the first day, Republicans also made sure to center themselves, by calling back to current justice Brett Kavanaugh’s contentious 2018 hearings and “assuring” Brown Jackson that she wouldn’t get the same treatment. “You’re the beneficiary of Republican nominees having their lives turned upside down,” said the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham. “Most of us couldn’t go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on.” The Texas senator Ted Cruz also promised her that her “dating habits” wouldn’t be scrutinized either (because what is the Republican party if not the picture of graciousness and integrity, right?). The pushback here is obvious – Brown Jackson hasn’t been credibly accused of sexual misconduct, so why would she be queried in the same way? Still, it’s impossible to overstate just how terrible the optics of this are. Using a Black woman’s confirmation hearing as an opportunity to martyrise a white man accused of sexual assault is objectively horrible. But as Paul Waldman notes in the Washington Post, the move wasn’t just an embarrassing new low for the party, it was another intentional gesture. The sense of victimhood they are invoking through Kavanaugh is a sentiment that has tied the Republican party to its base, and one that will no doubt help secure continued support for them. All of it – the bad faith questions, the baseless accusations, the time wasting – makes it clear that Brown Jackson’s interrogators do not see her as an equal, and are determined to undermine her however they can. And despite being promised a “respectful” hearing, Brown Jackson was met with and forced into the middle of old political squabbles. Still, the hearings are just one small part of this. And if Brown Jackson is confirmed (which will most likely be the case), her appointment will no doubt pave new paths for people who look like her, paths that will hopefully be much smoother than the one she had to take.

3/24/2022,"Independent testing of more than 100 packaging products from US restaurant and grocery chains identified PFAS chemicals in many of the wrappers, a Consumer Reports investigation has found. The potentially dangerous “forever chemicals“were found in food packaging including paper bags for french fries, wrappers for hamburgers, molded fiber salad bowls and single-use paper plates. They were found in the packaging from every retailer CR looked at, including fast-food chains – such as Burger King and McDonald’s – and places that promote healthier fare, such as Cava and Trader Joe’s. CR tested multiple samples of 118 food packaging products and found evidence of PFAS in more than half of those tested, while almost a third had levels beyond a threshold supported by CR experts and others. In recent decades, PFAS exposure has been linked to a growing list of health problems, including immune system suppression, lower birth weight and increased risk for some cancers. PFAS can be found not only in nonstick pans and waterproof gear but also in the grease-resistant packaging that holds food from takeout chains and supermarkets. A seemingly virtuous alternative to plastic, packaging made with PFAS often resembles paper or cardboard but salad dressing and fry oil do not leak through. “We know that these substances migrate into food you eat,” said Justin Boucher, an environmental engineer at the Food Packaging Forum, a non-profit research organization based in Switzerland. “It’s clear, direct exposure.” That’s especially likely when food is fatty, salty or acidic, according to a 2021 review in the journal Foods. Some research even suggests that PFAS levels are higher in people who regularly eat out. Another concern: when packaging is tossed into the trash it can end up in landfills, and PFAS can contaminate water and soil, or it is incinerated, and PFAS can spread through the air. Health and environmental advocates have been pushing for PFAS use to be restricted, especially in items such as food packaging. In response, some fast-food and fast-casual restaurants, as well as several grocery stores, say that they have taken steps to limit PFAS in their food packaging or that they plan to phase it out. In CR’s tests the chemicals were also found in packaging from places that claimed to be moving away from PFAS, though those levels were often lower than at other retailers. “We know from our testing that it is feasible for retailers to use packaging with very low PFAS levels,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at CR. “So the good news is there are steps that companies can take now to reduce their use of these dangerous chemicals.” The first known PFAS in the US was accidentally discovered in 1938 by a 27-year-old chemist named Roy Plunkett and in the decades since it and related chemicals have been added to a wide variety of products to make them resistant to heat, water, oil and corrosion. Today, these practically unbreakable compounds, created when the elements carbon and fluorine are fused, can be found in the air and the water, as well as in our bodies, our food, and our homes. Identifying the exact type of PFAS in a product is complex: there are more than 9,000 known PFAS, yet common testing methods can identify only a couple dozen. So CR tested products for their total organic fluorine content, which is considered the simplest way to assess a material’s total PFAS content. That’s because all PFAS contain organic fluorine, and there are few other sources of the compound, says Graham Peaslee, PhD, a professor of physics, chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, who has studied PFAS in food packaging. Another complication: PFAS is used so widely – found in ink on food containers, recycled paper, machines that make packaging and more – that it often shows up in products unintentionally. Scientists and regulators are still debating what level of organic fluorine indicates intentional use. California has banned intentionally added PFAS; starting in January 2023, paper food packaging must have less than 100 parts per million organic fluorine. Denmark has settled on 20ppm as that threshold, a limit supported by CR’s experts as well. “If they can get to 100ppm, they should be able to get to 20ppm,” Peaslee says. “Lower is always the ultimate goal.” CR tested multiple samples of 118 products and calculated average organic fluorine levels for each. Overall, CR detected that element in more than half the food packaging tested. Almost a third – 37 products – had organic fluorine levels above 20ppm, and 22 were above 100ppm. Among the 24 retailers CR looked at, nearly half had at least one product above that level, and most had one or more above 20ppm. But almost all also had products below that amount. For example, while the two products with the highest average levels came from Nathan’s, the chain also had four products below 20ppm. Nathan’s told CR that it was redoing its packaging and had eliminated the high-level items, as did Chick-fil-A, which had the item with the next highest level in CR’s tests. The results of the tests are not representative of all the packaging from a retailer, and packaging may have changed since CR conducted them. CR looked at retailers that claimed to be phasing out PFAS, including Cava, Chipotle, Panera Bread, Sweetgreen, and Whole Foods Market. All 13 of the products the companies said had reduced PFAS still had some detectable organic fluorine, and seven were above 20ppm. They ranged from a Whole Foods soup container with 21ppm organic fluorine – the only Whole Foods item to exceed the 20ppm limit – to a paper bag for pita chips from Cava with 260ppm. In response to questions from CR, companies stressed that with PFAS so common in the environment, it’s almost impossible to eliminate them entirely. Sweetgreen, for example, said, “We may have trace amounts of fluorine in our bowls. Unfortunately, PFAS are a widespread problem and are present in everyday life from tap water to air to soil.” Whole Foods said the company “does not make PFAS-free claims but has strived to prevent intentionally added PFAS in packaging.” Panera and Chipotle also said their goal was to avoid packaging with intentionally added PFAS. Cava said that supply chain problems had slowed its “transition to eliminating added PFAS.” The company said that it hoped to complete that process by the end of 2022 and that it had updated its public statements to reflect the new timeline. Michael Hansen, senior scientist at CR, acknowledges that trace amounts of PFAS in food packaging may be inevitable. And that’s why he says that “no company should tell consumers that their products are 100% free of PFAS.” But he also says CR’s tests show that getting to very low levels is possible and should be a goal for every company. Tips on reducing exposure to 'forever chemicals' Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at CR, and others say the federal government should regulate PFAS as a group. “Trying to ban individual PFAS is an impossible game of whack-a-mole,” he says. “As soon as one is addressed, industry comes up with another.” The Environmental Protection Agency now has guidance levels on just two PFAS – PFOS and PFOA – and just in drinking water. And even those are too high, says Philippe Grandjean, a professor of Environmental Medicine at the University of Southern Denmark and an expert on PFAS health risks. In addition, research from the EPA and elsewhere confirms that many newer PFAS chemicals, like their older cousins, will probably remain in the environment almost indefinitely and will pose health risks, especially to infants. “The next generation is being exposed to these toxic compounds at the most vulnerable time period in their development,” Grandjean says. Says Ronholm: “It’s long past time we got PFAS out of products, our water, and our food.” Read Consumer Reports’ full investigation.

Starting next year, California will ban food packaging that exceeds that level. Products with one red square have 20ppm organic fluorine or more, a stricter standard for food packaging set by Denmark.

3/24/2022,"War in Ukraine will present a “major claim” for the insurance market this year, Lloyd’s of London has warned, adding that it was working with governments and regulators to implement complex sanctions on Russia. Announcing a swing back to an annual profit as it recovers from the pandemic, the insurer said aviation, marine, trade credit and political risk lines of business would be most affected by Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The firm did not quantify the impact, but said it was “in close dialogue with market partners to understand exposures”. Some of those losses are likely to include unrecoverable aircraft, after Moscow passed laws to impound $10bn (£7.6bn) of jets leased to Aeroflot and other Russian airlines by western organisations. John Neal, the insurance market’s chief executive, said: “As we announce these results today, our thoughts are first and foremost with the people of Ukraine. In a world buffeted by increasingly complex and connected risks – from the pandemic to a geopolitical conflict – the Lloyd’s market is standing by its customers and supporting their recovery when things go wrong.” The company added: “We are currently living through a period of heightened risk, not seen or experienced for 75 years. Insurance has a critical role to play.” However, business underwritten by the Lloyd’s market in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus represents less than 1% of the global total, and it stressed: “Direct and indirect claims are expected to fall within manageable tolerances and will not create solvency challenges.” As part of sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s aerospace and aviation sectors were blocked from accessing insurance through the UK insurance market in early March. This prevents UK-based insurance or reinsurance firms from offering contracts linked to Russia. The sanctions targeted two industries in which London, and Lloyd’s in particular, are considered global leaders, while shipping – Lloyd’s is also a leader in maritime insurance – was not included. However, many businesses have moved away from exposure to Russian entities, while war risk premiums hit $300,000 for some tankers operating in the Black Sea, the journal Lloyd’s List reported. The number of ships leaving Russian ports is down 35% since the start of the invasion a month ago. Lloyd’s reported a profit before tax of £2.3bn for 2021, compared with a loss of £900m the year before, when it was hit by pandemic-related claims, such as for business interruption and event cancellations. Higher premiums and reduced losses from the Covid-19 pandemic outweighed costly claims for natural catastrophes. Lloyd’s also managed to increase premium rates by nearly 11%. The group paid £19.9bn of gross claims, including £2.9bn to customers impacted by the pandemic, the vast majority (86%) of claims it has received.",News/Business,"Ukraine war will present major insurance claims, warns Lloyd’s of London",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/ukraine-war-will-present-major-insurance-claims-warns-lloyds-of-london
3/24/2022,"There’s a scene in the final episode of Our Friends in the North that poignantly captures what, for me, the show is all about – the endless tension that so many feel between political hope and frustration, youthful romanticism and resigned pragmatism. Nicky, one of the group of four friends we follow from youth to middle age, takes his jaded father, Felix, to a Yorkshire village that he stopped at on the Jarrow march about 60 years earlier. There, a woman who, as a young girl, saw those 200 men on their way to London in protest at the high unemployment that was crippling their shipbuilding town, remembers the words of her own late father. “It made you realise,” she recalls him saying, “that you had a choice in life. You could be downtrodden, or you could stand up for yourself.” First broadcast in 1996, the series has now returned with a remake on BBC Radio 4, which brings the show’s sweeping narrative to the present day – there will be a new 10th episode to be set in the year 2020, 25 years after the setting of the original series finale. On revisiting this TV classic today, what’s still striking is its ambition. Never didactic, the show is a rich portrait of four, intersecting working-class lives that charts the long arc of British politics, both locally and nationally, over 30 pivotal years. If it has filmic siblings then they are less the usual prestige TV fare of The Wire or The Sopranos than Edgar Reitz’s Brechtian epic of German history, Heimat, or Ken Loach’s 1975 BBC series about Britain in the early 20th century, Days of Hope. Equally striking is its stridently political tone and its deeply felt portrayal of a region that is so often misunderstood. The series follows four friends from the north-east of England between 1964 and 1995. There’s idealistic Nicky, who spends his life between leftwing groups before reaching middle-aged disillusionment. Tosker, who goes from wannabe pop star to archetypical 80s upstart. Geordie, who glows brightly in the seedy world of 1960s Soho, before stints in prison and on the streets. And pragmatic Mary, who, after years of being mistreated by the men in her life, rises through the ranks of the Labour party machinery and into parliament. The most central character outside the friends is Austin Donohue, the former Labour radical who, in the first episode, is leader of Newcastle council. Based closely on the disgraced former Labour politician T Dan Smith and his ambition to turn Newcastle into the “Brasília of the North”, Donohue soon quits frontline politics for a PR agency that represents a dodgy developer peddling “systems-built” apartment blocks. The buildings are shoddily made and blighted by damp, and the scheme that Donohue constructs to sell them to councils is based on kickbacks and bribes. But Donohue is an ambiguous figure. He’s driven as much by a messianic fervour as a lust for power. As he later says when confronted about the poorly built flats constructed in his name: “At least I tried, Nicky!” Other public figures get off no less lightly. In the wake of contemporary scandals that have rocked institutions such as the Metropolitan police, the show’s portrayal of a British establishment riddled with corruption and greed more than resonates: it feels prophetic. Geordie, who flees the north-east for London after getting a local girl pregnant, is soon caught up with menacing Soho porn impresario Benny Barratt, whose empire of strip clubs, sex shops and brothels is maintained by a network of bent coppers that stretches all the way to the top of the force. (A storyline closely follows the Met’s Obscene Publications division, known, appropriately, as “the Dirty Squad”.) If there’s anything like a winner in all of this, it’s the Thatcherite everyman Tosker, who rises from the factory floor to become a minor clubland kingpin. But while the show’s vision of British history is a pessimistic one, it’s not one without hope. The final episode was aired in January 1996, just a year before Labour’s landslide election victory following 18 years of Conservative government – and playing as the show’s final episode fades out is Don’t Look Back in Anger, an anthem from what would become the defining Cool Britannia band. But any residual pro-New Labourism this might suggest is undercut by the earlier scene in which Mary’s son, Anthony, chides his mother for her political compromises. “If you and your New Labour party sound any more like the Tories,” he tells her, “they’ll sue you for plagiarism.” Any observer of Keir Starmer’s Labour party will recognise such compromises well. These echoes prove Our Friends in the North to be no mere period piece. None of the issues the show mines so brilliantly – from inequality, deindustrialisation and the parlous state of Britain’s housing to homelessness and the corruption of our public officials – have gone away. If anything, they’ve only grown more acute. The north of England, when it is thought of at all, is flattened and mythologised. This fabled land of the “red wall” is so often seen as a monolithic bloc of disgruntled proles, not the complex region full of people who have seen decades of managed decline, often from both main political parties. Revisiting Our Friends in the North, with its nuanced and beautifully drawn vision of the region and its people, will not solve this in itself. But it’s a good start.

3/24/2022,"Michael Gove was secretly involved in the process through which a PPE company linked to the Tory peer Michelle Mone secured huge government contracts, according to newly released documents that show private emails being used for government business. The correspondence threatens to embroil Gove in the deepening controversy surrounding PPE Medpro, the company awarded government contracts worth £203m after it was referred to the “high-priority lane” for well connected companies. They will also add to the growing scepticism over Lady Mone’s repeated insistence that she was not involved with the company, and cast further doubt on statements made on her behalf by her lawyers. Her relationship to PPE Medpro is under investigation by the House of Lords commissioner for standards. In one key email, sent on 8 May 2020, Mone proposed supplying large quantities of PPE face masks to the government, saying they could be sourced through “my team in Hong Kong”. The email was sent to Theodore Agnew, a fellow Tory peer who was at the time a Cabinet Office minister responsible for procurement. Mone copied Gove in to the email, telling Agnew that Gove had asked her to “urgently” contact him. Mone used her private email address, writing to Agnew at his private email address linked to his Norfolk private estate. She copied in Gove via his private Gmail account. The Guardian was only able to establish that non-government emails had been used because of an apparent administrative error by the Cabinet Office, which failed to properly redact documents released after a freedom of information request (FoI) from the Guardian. The information commissioner, John Edwards, is investigating the use of private emails at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) during the pandemic, including by then ministers Matt Hancock and Lord Bethell. While it is not in itself unlawful for ministers to use private emails, there is strict guidance on ensuring it is done in accordance with transparency laws, and Edwards’s predecessor, Elizabeth Denham, expressed “concern” and “worry” at the practice. The emails released under FoI reveal how Mone laid out a sales pitch to Agnew for the supply of PPE. The government had by then suspended normal competitive tendering processes and, it would later emerge, was fast-tracking to a “VIP” lane offers of PPE referred by politically connected people. “I hope this email finds you well,” Mone wrote to Agnew, copying in Gove. “Michael Gove has asked to urgently contact you [sic]. We have managed to source PPE masks though [sic] my team in Hong Kong. They have managed to secure 100,000pcs per day of KN95 [face masks] which is equivalent to N95 or FFP2. In order to commit to this 100,000pcs per day could you please get back to me asap as freight will also need to be secured. Hope to see you in the House of Lords when we get out of lockdown. Kindest Regards, Michelle.” Agnew replied from his personal email address, copying in the government email address of his private secretary. “Michelle, Thank you for your kind offer. I am forwarding this into the appropriate PPE workstream with Dept of Health. They will ask you some basic questions on the details of the offer and then hopefully progress it from there. Best wishes Theodore.” One of his staff then emailed a Covid PPE “priority appraisals” mailbox, asking them to “pick up with Baroness Mone”. The staff member added the words “VIA LORD AGNEW” and “VIP” to the subject field. Within weeks, PPE Medpro was awarded two government contracts worth £203m to supply millions of face masks and sterile surgical gowns. Mone has repeatedly distanced herself from PPE Medpro, despite leaked documents and WhatsApp messages, seen by the Guardian, appearing to suggest that she and her husband, Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in the company. Lawyers representing Mone have repeatedly said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”, had no “association” with the company and “never had any role or function” in the process by which contracts were awarded to the firm. Barrowman’s lawyers have similarly distanced him from the firm, but they have not denied that he benefited financially from PPE Medpro’s business. The Lords standards commissioner, Martin Jelley, is investigating Mone for “alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro, leading to potential breaches” of three provisions of the Lords code, which requires peers to publicly register “all relevant interests” and prohibits them from lobbying for a company or a person in which a peer “has a financial interest”. Mone denies she broke any rules. The newly released emails, in which Mone offered PPE sourced by “my team”, raise several new questions for the peer, who was previously involved in the lingerie company Ultimo before David Cameron appointed her to the House of Lords in 2015. Her lawyers have previously said her involvement in PPE Medpro did not extend beyond a “very simple, solitary and brief step” of referring the company to “the office of Lord Agnew”. However, the emails suggest that it was not a solitary step, because she had already made contact with Gove , and she did not refer the company to Agnew’s office, but to his personal email address. She also did not technically refer PPE Medpro – which, at the time of the email, had not been incorporated as a company. Instead she referred to PPE that would be supplied by “my team”. Agnew declined to respond to questions about the issue, explaining that he had recently been interviewed by the Lords commissioner on the matter and had been asked to keep his evidence confidential. Gove also declined to answer several questions from the Guardian, including about why he was Mone’s first point of contact. A government spokesperson said all emails were dealt with appropriately because they were passed on to officials, and contracts were awarded “in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines, and there are robust rules and processes in place to prevent conflicts of interest”. A lawyer for Mone said there was “nothing new” or “sinister” in the new emails and accused the Guardian of having a “deliberate and vexatious interpretation of them, characterising them in a wholly negative manner”. The lawyer did not respond directly to questions about the newly released emails, or about a previously disclosed civil servant’s email that appears to show that Mone was still lobbying government officials nine months after she first made contact. The email was sent to colleagues by Jacqui Rock, the chief commercial officer for NHS test and trace, in February 2021. She revealed that Mone had been contacting officials on behalf of PPE Medpro, which appears to have been seeking government contracts for the provision of Covid tests. In the email, published by the government last month, Rock told fellow civil servants: “Baroness Mone is going to Michael Gove and Matt Hancock today as she is incandescent with rage on the way she believes Medpro have been treating [sic].”",News/Politics,Private emails reveal Michael Gove’s role in Tory-linked firm’s PPE deals,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/michael-gove-private-emails-ppe-deals-tory-linked-firms
3/24/2022,"The vegan chef Alexis Gauthier is weaning himself off milk: “I drink black coffee, black tea; I don’t eat cereal. When else would you use it?” But at his plant-based restaurant in London, Gauthier Soho, he can’t ignore our craving for the satisfying richness that milk lends to many foods. “Part of my USP is French gastronomy. I get why people expect the classics, without animal fats. We use a variety of mainly nut-based plant milks.” Clearly, milk is going nowhere, even if the milk we drink is changing. Last year, the research agency Mintel found that almost one-third of Britons drink non-dairy milks. Sales of plant milks at Waitrose rose 18% between 2019 and 2021. Oat milk is the supermarket’s biggest seller, as it is nationally, followed by almond, soya and coconut. “It’s better to make your own,” advises James Lowe, the chef-owner at Lyle’s in London. Simple recipes abound online. “You can control flavour, strength, texture and sugar content.” Plant milks also run the gamut from thin to abundantly creamy, from recognisably nutty (almond, coconut) to neutral (soya, potato milk). Picking the right one for each kitchen task can be tricky, so we asked some experts for help. Which plant milks work where? And are there times when only dairy will do? Historically, non-dairy milks were notorious for splitting in hot drinks, with almond and soya guilty of coagulating unattractively in acidic coffees. Today, stabilisers minimise that problem. Plant-milk producers make “barista” milks that can be steamed, heated and smoothly combined. For Dave Wolinski, the co-owner of the Manchester coffee shop Idle Hands, oat milk is the most convincing dairy substitute, although he also namechecks Bonsoy (£4.15 a litre, Ocado) as a notably silky soya. The Oatly milk used at Idle Hands is stable, creamy and, despite its cereal edge, comparatively neutral in flavour: “It steams well and we’re about tasting coffee, not milk.” While some prefer the distinctive flavour of coconut or almond in coffee – those flavours could be considered natural partners – such milks can be more challenging in tea. Judging from a quick taste test at home, oat and soya are fine, while Dug’s barista-version potato milk will suit those who like sweeter tea. Generally, though, plant milks produce a brew that feels “thin”. Without a coffee machine’s steam wand to stretch and foam them, they lack dairy’s creamy fullness. Juliet Sampson’s vegan cafe in London, Copperhouse Chocolate, uses oat milk as standard. “But I have milks I like with different flavoured chocolates,” she says. “Almond milk goes really well with cinnamon.” That intuitive matching of traditionally complementary flavours is not a bad rule of thumb when using plant milks. Sampson has not found a potato milk she likes in hot drinks, but “we made nice oat bread with it”. Like oat, potato milk tends to have an earthy backnote that is useful in savoury dishes. Tinned coconut milk is “one of the best dairy alternatives in the bar, where dairy is used to add thickness,” says Giulia Cuccurullo, the head bartender at Artesian in London. Rice and almond milk are “quite watery”, but coconut milk, whipped for two minutes, will add lusciousness to a milk punch. For a white Russian, she advises mixing 40ml each of vodka and coffee liqueur over ice, adding a “finger-thick” layer of coconut milk. Béchamel, or white sauce, is one of cooking’s building blocks. Alex Rushmer, a chef at the plant-focused restaurant Vanderlyle in Cambridge, argues that it is best made with oat milk: “Its toasted, bready, savoury nature works. Combined with vegan cheese, it makes a more than passable sauce for macaroni cheese or lasagne.” To prepare 500ml, melt 65g of Naturli’ vegan block (“by far the best butter alternative”) in a pan over a gentle heat, stir in two tablespoons of flour and cook “until it smells like shortbread”. Slowly whisk in 500ml of oat milk, gradually bringing it to a simmer until thickened. Season and flavour as you wish (mustard, mushrooms, herbs). “Fats mute flavour,” says Andrew Dargue, the chef-owner at the meat-free cookery school Vanilla Black. Consequently, the fat-rich tinned coconut milk often used in vegan ice-creams can be a bully. Try low‑fat, relatively neutral soya milk: “We once made a quite bland avocado ice-cream, but replacing dairy with soya allowed the avocado to come through.” “Pancakes are very forgiving,” says Patricia Trijbits, whose pair of London restaurants, Where The Pancakes Are, serve a vegan, wheat-free pancake. These are made with organic rice, buckwheat flour and soya milk, swapping eggs for aquafaba (chickpea water) to achieve a US-style fluffiness. However, you can make a far more basic vegan pancake. Whisking 300g of self-raising flour with about double the amount of any plant milk (sugar optional) should produce decent crepes for four people. “Almond milk is great in pancakes,” says Bettina Campolucci Bordi, the author of Celebrate: Plant-based Recipes for Every Occasion. Upping the proportion of flour will make fluffier pancakes, as will adding a teaspoon of baking powder. Alternatively, says Campolucci Bordi: “Blitz the mixture in a blender to aerate it, which gives you fluffy pancakes without using baking powder or bicarb.” Hemp milk has its fans (“Oats with hemp milk, cinnamon and apple is really comforting, like apple pie,” says Kimberly Lin, the pastry chef at Lilly’s Cafe in London), but oat milk is the porridge go-to. At 26 Grains in London, they soak mixed grains overnight in water, then cook them with oat milk for about seven minutes, over a medium heat, to release the beta-glucans that make porridge oats creamy. “Lots of people put the hob on high and eat once the liquid is warm,” says Alex Hely-Hutchinson, the owner. Be patient. “Non-dairy milks can add great flavour,” says Ruth Hansom, the chef at The Princess of Shoreditch. “Nutty hazelnut or almond work in cauliflower or celeriac soups.” Kamil Witek, the chef-owner at Aurora in Edinburgh, does something similar. After caramelising shallot, garlic, celery and leek, he gently poaches cubed jerusalem artichoke in pea milk, or celeriac in almond milk, on a low heat, before blitzing them into clean, light purees and soups. “Pea milk doesn’t cover up artichoke’s subtle flavour like single cream would,” he says. Akwasi Brenya-Mensa, the owner of the west African caterer and forthcoming London restaurant Tatale, uses soya milk, as it is “the least sweet”, to loosen the already-sweet roasted plantain puree in his eto tarts: “Its higher protein content also works best for allowing the puree to retain its shape.” Sarah Brion, the pastry chef at the North Berwick hotel Marine, recommends soya milk as a dairy substitute in sponge cakes or scones. “Scientifically, it’s the non-dairy milk with the highest protein, which enhances the effect of raising agents such as baking powder.” The seven-branch Edinburgh bakery Twelve Triangles uses oat milk in its vegan options. Plant milks behave in a broadly familiar way, says its co-owner, Emily Cuddeford, but their sugars take longer to react with yeast. The dough needs “slightly longer to prove and a bit more yeast than with cow’s milk”, she says. Plant-based cream alternatives exist, but whipping them into a dairy doppelganger is tricky. One expert refuses to share their secret. Dargue agrees it is difficult: “Some products can’t quite replace dairy. Whipped dairy-free cream doesn’t have the melting quality or flavour.” Brion favours tinned coconut milk for whipping, but says: “Its strong coconut taste can’t be used in every dish.” To concentrate coconut milk, refrigerate it, so the fat and water separate, then use the fat to create sweetened, flavoured, Chantilly-style creams. Aurora’s Witek mixes light Cullisse rapeseed oil and a 50:50 mix of oat double cream and oat milk into spuds to create a dairy-free mash that “is the same, if not better”, than its dairy equivalent. “We’ve found soya milk – its natural sweetness and texture – works best for either pouring or setting custard,” says Vanderlyle’s Rushmer. Use cornflour or – “even better” – Bird’s custard powder to thicken it. (Bird’s powder is not made with animal products, but it is manufactured where they are present. Consequently, it is not labelled as vegan. Some vegans eat it, some don’t.) To make the custard, scrape vanilla pod seeds into one litre of soya milk and heat gently for 30 minutes. In a second pan, mix two tablespoons each of cornflour and sugar, add a little warm soya milk and stir into a paste. Gradually add the infused milk to the paste, whisking it over a medium heat, until simmering and thickened.",Lifestyle/Food,The perfect milk alternatives for every purpose – from cocktails to custard,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/24/the-perfect-milk-alternatives-for-every-purpose-from-cocktails-to-custard

3/24/2022,"Over the last few months, an attack on democracy has slowly escalated in Wisconsin. A group of Republicans in the state legislature, encouraged by Donald Trump, is pushing an illegal effort to undo the 2020 election. They want to rescind Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes for Joe Biden – something that is not legally possible. The GOP-controlled state assembly appointed a special counsel to review the 2020 election, who has encouraged the decertification effort, embraced conspiracy theories, and produced a 136-page report filled with misleading information. He has also suggested jailing mayors of some of the largest cities and employees of the state elections commission for opposing his investigation. And like their counterparts in many other states, Wisconsin lawmakers have advanced a series of measures that would make it harder to vote. But this fall, those promoting these anti-democratic measures are likely to face few, if any, consequences at the polls. Republicans will probably easily hold control of the Wisconsin legislature. It’s a result made possible by extreme partisan gerrymandering. A decade ago, Republicans won control of the state legislature as part of a state-by-state national effort to win control of legislative bodies that control the redistricting process. They subsequently drew district lines that gave them a severe advantage for the next decade. The districts are so distorted that Republicans can hold a majority in the state assembly, the lower legislative chamber, even if they don’t win a majority of the statewide vote. For the past decade, Republicans have held nearly two-thirds of the seats in the assembly, including in 2018 when Democrats won the governor’s race and every other statewide office. “The Wisconsin maps were very clearly among the most gerrymandered in the country last decade no matter what metric you pick,” said Chris Warshaw, a political science professor at George Washington University. The remarkable Republican legislative advantage is even more notable because Wisconsin is just about as politically competitive as a state can be. It narrowly voted for Trump in 2016 before voting for Biden in 2020. Its Senate seats are split between Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and Ron Johnson, a far-right Republican. Voters elected Scott Walker, one of the most conservative Republicans in the country, three times before replacing him with Democrat Tony Evers in 2018. “It’s a purple state, as purple as you get. The Republican party has managed to lock in a very large and durable majority in the state legislature that is unmovable,” said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. That guaranteed control has enabled Republicans in the state legislature to pursue more extreme policies. When a legislative body is narrowly split and one party fears losing its majority, there’s pressure on the majority party “to be responsible and cohesive”, Burden said. Because of gerrymandering, that does not exist in the state assembly. “Republicans in the assembly face really no risk of losing their majority. So the members are going in all kinds of different directions because they have the ability to do that,” he said. While there’s intense scrutiny on congressional gerrymandering, many of the most extreme pieces of legislation, including unprecedented efforts to restrict abortion, voting, and what can be taught in public schools are being passed through state levels. “The gerrymandering of the state legislative maps – it’s actually more important than even the congressional gerrymandering,” said David Pepper, a former chair of the Ohio Democratic party, who has written about the importance of state legislatures. “The heart of the attack on democracy is coming from states and they’re able to do it repeatedly because they themselves are in these sort of fortresses of statehouses where there’s no accountability.” In the decade since the successful GOP effort to take control of state legislatures, voting rights groups and other reformers say there is now greater awareness than ever of gerrymandering – an issue that long went overlooked. Even so, getting people to look beyond congressional gerrymandering and at distortions for state legislative districts can be a challenge, said Suzanne Almedia, redistricting and representation counsel at Common Cause, a government watchdog group. “Particularly, given the polarized nature of the US Congress, it’s a lot more straightforward to tell a story of Democrats versus Republicans on the national level than it is to think through the nuances of what happens on the state level,” she said. The policies that most directly affect people’s lives, she added – school funding, public health policy and voting rights among them – are all decided by state legislatures. One recent survey found that Republicans are more likely to identify state legislatures as an important forum for driving policy decisions. Anti-gerrymandering reforms in places like Michigan, and aggressive efforts to use the courts to curb GOP gerrymandering, have made state legislative districts overall slightly less biased in favor of Republicans. Still, not many districts were competitive last decade and it doesn’t look like many will be for the next one, entrenching another decade of GOP-control. Warshaw estimated 17.5% of state legislative districts would be competitive, compared with 18.5% on the old maps. “Most of the plans are pretty uncompetitive and most are biased in favor of one of the two parties. So I don’t think we’re likely to see many state legislatures flip control over the next decade,” Warshaw said. “If you gerrymander a state legislature, that gives you the ability in the future to gerrymander Congress as well and it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle.” In Wisconsin, Democrats had hoped they might break that cycle this year. Their victory in the 2018 gubernatorial race gave them a seat at the redistricting table because both the legislature and the governor must agree on a map. But after negotiations last year fell into a stalemate, the state supreme court, where Republicans have a 4-3 majority, took over. In late November, the court gave Republicans a huge victory. It said that as a guiding principle it would adopt maps that made as little change as possible from the current ones, continuing the GOP advantage for the next decade. Earlier this month, the state supreme court selected maps drawn by Evers, the Democratic governor, as the ones Wisconsin will use for the next decade. The maps are expected to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature, but will still allow Republicans to keep majorities in both chambers. The Republicans had proposed maps that would have skewed representation even more dramatically to their advantage. “It is going to be nearly impossible for Democrats to ever win back control of the Wisconsin state assembly,” said Amanda Litman, who runs the group Run for Something, which focuses on state legislative as well as other down-ballot races. “That in and of itself means that Republicans can have compounding interest in terms of power.” Even so, Evers, the Wisconsin governor, said that the court ruling would move Wisconsin “in the right direction”. “We’re hopeful that we will begin to narrow that gap enough that people on the other side of the aisle will feel more of a need to think through these major issues and hopefully the will of the people will start to be re-established,” he said. “But it’s difficult.” That difficulty was on display on Wednesday. In what one expert called a “bizarre” ruling, the US supreme court threw out Evers’ legislative map and instructed the state supreme court to look again.",News/US news,How gerrymandering allows a purple state to promote Trump’s big lie,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/gerrymandering-wisconsin-purple-state-rightwing-measures

3/24/2022,"You may know Jason Isaacs best for playing Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series – the Slytherin Hogwarts ex-governor and bad dad to Harry’s nemesis, Draco Malfoy. He’s been in plenty of other films, though: as Captain Hook in 2003’s Peter Pan as well as co-starring with Matt Damon in 2010’s Green Zone and Bryan Cranston in 2016’s The Infiltrator. He was extraordinary as Zhukov in The Death of Stalin and as the father of a school shooter in Mass, released earlier this year, and has done sterling work on stage, notably in the first London production of Angels in America. All in spite of having one of those faces that Isaacs himself says lets him travel unnoticed on the Tube to film premieres but still has people “screaming and screaming as soon as I get on the red carpet.” Isaacs says that his upbringing prepared him “to become a specialist in unattractive characters”. He was born in Liverpool to Jewish parents and says he was often bullied at the Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ school in Hertfordshire. He nearly became a lawyer, and has been outspoken of the Labour party’s 2003 invasion of Iraq and antisemitism in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, which – along with some battles with drink and drugs – is all very serious. He’s good in Disney Pixar’s Cars 2, as well. Now Isaacs is back in the soon-to-be-released war drama Operation Mincemeat with Colin Firth and Kelly Macdonald, playing the character that inspired M from James Bond. He also stars in a new Australian swimming drama Streamline, produced by Ian Thorpe. And – as ever with our reader interview – what we ask him is all down to you.

3/24/2022,"It’ll be OK in the end. Won’t it? With three rounds of Concacaf matches remaining, squeezed into only seven days, there is the potential for things to go wrong in a hurry as the US conclude their qualifying campaign for this year’s World Cup. Of course, they might go right! And they probably will. But there is some negativity bias seared into the American psyche after the shock of 2017, when the US failed to qualify for the 2018 tournament. Bruce Arena’s side needed only a point from their final match against Trinidad and Tobago yet contrived to lose 2-1 as other results went against them. The most unlikely scenario was the one that transpired. Phrases such as “the odds are very much in the Americans’ favor” no longer contain much comfort value now that, post Trinidad, they can always be answered with: “Yeah, but…” The way to cauterize that wound is to qualify for Qatar. Victory in the Azteca Stadium on Thursday could achieve that, depending on results elsewhere, but the Americans have only won once in the thin air of Mexico City, in a friendly in 2012. “Our record here is horrendous,” US head coach Gregg Berhalter conceded in a press conference on Wednesday. The Americans’ position in the standings reflects the team’s overall performances: decent rather than dominant. It has not been an imperious march towards Qatar, a decisive shift from the previous campaign’s convulsions. That was an unrealistic hope given the rebuilding required under new management and the emergence of Canada as a force. All but qualified, Canada lead by four points ahead of the US and Mexico, with Panama four points below them and fifth-placed Costa Rica another point back. The top trio qualify automatically while the fourth-placed nation earns a single-match playoff in Qatar in June against a team from Oceania, expected to be New Zealand. There is none of the complacency from the past cycle. “Of course we use [missing out] as motivation. We were extremely upset and now we want to qualify,” forward Christian Pulisic told reporters. “We definitely don’t want to go through that again.” Still, the schedule invites a dramatic climax. With Panama likely to win at home to hapless Honduras on Thursday, it’s plausible that the US lose to Mexico and drop to third, only a point ahead of Panama. The two meet in Orlando on Sunday and Panama beat the US last October. Should Mexico defeat the US and Panama win while Costa Rica surprise Canada and move two points behind Berhalter’s men, the calamitous scenario of a fifth-place finish would loom larger. As it happens, the US conclude their campaign on 30 March with a visit to Costa Rica, another place where they have never won a World Cup qualifier. The fixtures crunch gives Berhalter a selection dilemma. Avoiding defeat in Mexico would be a boost ahead of the clash with Panama. The US beat an unexceptional Mexico squad three times in 2021, so getting a draw, even a win, is not a quixotic notion. However, the importance of Sunday’s game means that Berhalter may decide to save the legs of key players, while five are on a yellow card and facing a one-match suspension if they collect another. He said that he had discussed fielding a “B team” with his coaching staff: “We came out with our answer, and you’ll see”. Injuries give the young roster a shallow aspect in some positions. Gio Reyna returns but the US are without Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest, Matt Turner and the only American ever-present in qualifying, Brenden Aaronson. McKennie, a tone-setting fireball in midfield, is an especially significant loss. “It’s how you respond when you don’t have your guys that’s important,” Berhalter said. “Everyone we have on this roster, all 26 of them, can compete, and that’s what it’s going to take.” Last autumn’s apparent solution at striker is now more of a question than an answer: Ricardo Pepi is without a goal in five months for club and country. Tim Weah is a brisk winger but the onus is on Pulisic to carry the team’s attack – much like the last campaign. “I’m feeling very good and I’m feeling in a good rhythm at the moment,” the Chelsea forward said. “This is a really hungry team who is going to give absolutely everything to make sure we have a spot in the World Cup.” Meanwhile, while Berhalter has rotated and ruminated, carefree Canada, undefeated and guided lucidly by John Herdman, have emerged as probably the best – and definitely the most fun – team in Concacaf. A detailed dissection of the region’s northwards power shift can wait for a few more days, though. Berhalter gathered his staff ahead of the trip to the Azteca and told them: “This is probably the biggest week of our lives as professional coaches.” It is unlikely to be serene. But in the end, it will probably also be the best.",Sport/Football,‘Biggest week of our lives’: USA try to clinch World Cup spot at Azteca,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/usa-mexico-world-cup-qualifying-preview
