1/12/2022,"On Hannity Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) pointed the finger at President Biden after an FBI official didn’t adequately answer all of his questions at a hearing earlier in the day. Cruz’s line of questioning was pushing a conspiratorial narrative about the FBI being involved in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, a narrative that Fox News opinion host Tucker Carlson has been pushing for months. “Unfortunately, under Joe Biden we have seen an incredibly partisan Department of Justice,” Cruz said. “And both the Department of Justice and the FBI have an arrogance that they are not accountable to anyone, that they can stonewall.” Much of what Cruz had to say was debunked earlier in the day in a series of tweets by Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL). And though the supposed transgressions on the part of the FBI would have occurred while Donald Trump was still president, Cruz believes it’s up to Biden to answer for it. “There needs to be transparency and the Biden administration needs to fess up,” Cruz said. “Is this a politicized law enforcement operation that is targeting the enemies of the president, and did they actively encourage and solicit illegal conduct?”",Politics/Yahoo Entertainment,Ted Cruz calls for Biden WH to ‘fess up’ about FBI’s supposed role in Trump-era insurrection,https://news.yahoo.com/ted-cruz-calls-biden-wh-085253110.html
