1/11/2022,"Less than a third of Post Office workers who applied for compensation under a government scheme in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal have received a payout offer, almost 17 months after it closed, MPs have been told. The Horizon IT system installed by the Post Office and supplied by Fujitsu falsely suggested there were cash shortfalls, leading to 736 unsafe convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.  The historical shortfall scheme (HSS) was set up in 2020, with a closing date for applications in August of that year, to compensate Post Office workers who had not been convicted but who had instead been forced to replace missing funds from their own pocket. Appearing before the House of Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee on Tuesday, the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, said that there had been 2,500 applications to the HSS but only 777 offers had been made. He said the size of the panel dealing with claims was doubled in October and was bullish about future progress. “From my perspective, we will get to 50% by the end of March and we will get to in excess of 95% by the end of the calendar year … I hope therefore that we will ensure that as many of those individuals who have come forward will be compensated and/or their families if not the individuals themselves.” Separately, those who have had a criminal conviction overturned are entitled to an interim compensation payment of £100,000, but Read said only 57 people had received the sum so far. He explained that this was because only 72 of the 736 people whom the Post Office acknowledges as having an unsafe conviction have had them overturned so far, despite attempts to contact them all. Read told the committee that the Post Office had not managed to contact 126 of the 736, while 214 had not responded to letters. Asked why they might not have responded, Read replied: “There will be many individuals who will want to put it behind them and won’t want to revisit it.” The postal affairs minister, Paul Scully, went further in his evidence to the committee. “There is a mistrust in this entire process, not just with the Post Office but with government, with everybody, because they’ve had 20 years of absolute hell,” he said. “So why would they trust authority in general?”",News/Business,Payout offers over Post Office IT scandal sent to less than third of applicants,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/payout-offers-compensation-post-office-horizon-it-scandal
1/11/2022,"Boris Johnson faces a crisis over the latest revelations following weeks of reports about alleged lockdown-flouting parties at Downing Street and elsewhere in government – and he is now at the centre of them with reports that he and his wife, Carrie, attended one such event on 20 May 2020. Here are some of the questions facing the prime minister.  An email leaked to ITV’s Paul Brand that has sparked the latest questions does make this seem likely. From Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary, it told No 10 staff: “We thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening.” The use of “we” is notable – Reynolds is a civil servant rather than a political appointee, and it would seem curious if he made the arrangement without at least Johnson’s tacit acceptance – not least because it was being held in a space which is, among other uses, Boris and Carrie Johnson’s personal garden. Reports say Reynolds’ email went out to about 100 Downing Street staff, with between 30 and 40 people attending in the end. People who were there told the BBC that the event involved a long table being placed in the garden, holding drinks and snacks, including crisps and sausage rolls. This appears, without any ambiguity, to be a social event – Johnson will need to say how this could happen. Witnesses have told the BBC and others that both the Johnsons were there. The prime minister will be asked repeatedly about this, and how long they stayed. One of the curiosities of the case is that, because the garden forms part of their official residence, the couple would not have broken any Covid rules by having a social drink there – were it not for the 30 or so others also attending. The invitation appears to have been sent only to No 10 staff. However, Downing Street has previously confirmed that at the event featuring wine and cheese five days earlier, Matt Hancock, the then health secretary, was present. No 10 insists that the gathering was a work-based meeting following a press conference led by Hancock. One minister particularly in the frame in terms of knowing about the 20 May event could be Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, given his official residence is also inside Downing Street. If he was at home that evening, he would be expected to have at least noticed several dozen people drinking in the garden. So far, we don’t know. Johnson has not been sighted since the new revelations emerged, and the only line from ministers and the prime minister’s official spokesperson is that people should wait for the investigation into the wider issue of parties, which is being led by a senior civil servant, Sue Gray. There is, in truth, little in the way of a credible defence if the narrative implied by the email is correct. At the time of the alleged party there were no specific regulations against distanced, outdoor work meetings, hence Downing Street’s argument that the 15 May event, later shown in a photograph sent to the Guardian, was colleagues gathering for professional reasons. Reynolds’ email would seem to demolish such a defence this time. Labour certainly believes so. After the news about the Reynolds email, the party sent out a list of times when Johnson told MPs in the Commons, amid earlier allegations, that he had been assured that all Covid rules were followed. If it was known that Johnson attended the 20 May event, and that it was as described in the email, then the prime minister would appear to have been deliberately untruthful.",News/Politics,Questions Boris Johnson must answer over No 10 party claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/questions-boris-johnson-must-answer-over-no-10-party-claims
1/11/2022,"Two Los Angeles police officers were fired for ignoring a robbery call so they could attempt to catch a character in a game of Pokémon Go, according to court documents.  Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell were asked to respond to a robbery in progress with “multiple suspects” at a Macy’s in south-west LA, but failed to respond to radio calls. An investigation revealed that Lozano and Mitchell heard the call but chose to ignore it in favor of pursuing a nearby Snorlax, a Pokémon character. A video system in the pair’s car revealed that Mitchell managed to capture the Snorlax before the pair drove to a location where the Togetic character had been spotted. On arrival, both Lozano and Mitchell managed to capture the Togetic. The incident occurred in April 2017 but details were revealed by an appeals court on Friday. Vice first reported on the case. Lozano and Mitchell were fired following an investigation, but appealed. The court upheld their dismissal. The recording from Lozano and Mitchell’s car captured the pair discussing Pokémon Go, an augmented reality mobile game where users travel to different locations. According to court documents, minutes after the officers were asked to respond to the Macy’s robbery, “Officer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax ‘just popped up’ at ‘46th and Leimert’.” The court reported: “After Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax – exclaiming, ‘Got ‘em’ – petitioners agreed to ‘[g]o get the Togetic’ and drove off. “When their car stopped again, the [digital in-car video system] recorded Mitchell saying, ‘Don’t run away. Don’t run away,’ while Lozano described how he ‘buried it and ultra-balled’ the Togetic before announcing, ‘Got him.’ “Mitchell advised he was ‘[s]till trying to catch it,’ adding, ‘Holy crap, man. This thing is fighting the crap out of me.’ Eventually Mitchell exclaimed, ‘Holy Crap. Finally,’ apparently in reference to capturing the Togetic.” The video system recorded Mitchell adding: “The […] guys are going to be so jealous.” The officers argued that the recording should not have been used in their disciplinary proceeding, and said they had been denied the protections of the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act. The court disagreed. Bulbapedia.net, a community-sourced Pokémon encyclopedia, describes Snorlax as a “huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet”. Togetic, Bulbapedia says, is a small flying Pokémon that can “sense the kindness in other people”.",News/US news,Two Los Angeles officers fired for ignoring robbery to play Pokémon Go,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/lapd-officers-pokemon-go-robbery-fired
1/11/2022,"What’s a good, easy winter breakfast that isn’t porridge?Sarah, Ludlow This sounds like a job for Guardian perfectionist Felicity Cloake, who has been working her way through a buffet of breakfasts in the name of research for her latest book, Red Sauce, Brown Sauce: A British Breakfast Odyssey (out this summer). “Beans on toast, obviously,” she says. “Quick, filling and delicious.” Cloake might customise the tinned stuff with Worcestershire or chilli sauce, or smoked paprika or wilt in a handful of baby spinach. “Or make your own baked beans from tinned beans [eg, haricot] with a glug of extra-virgin olive oil, a spritz of lemon juice and some chilli flakes or chopped herbs.”  If oats float Sarah’s boat, but porridge doesn’t, Cloake suggests stirring in some spiced stewed apples or rye flakes the night before. Alternatively, use oats (plus chopped nuts and cinnamon, say) in pancake batter, or sprinkled over morning muffins. Guardian baker-in-residence Benjamina Ebuehi is partial to an apple, cardamom and buckwheat number, for which she sifts 130g buckwheat flour, 75g caster sugar, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of bicarb and a pinch of salt into a bowl. In a separate bowl, she whisks an egg, 60g melted unsalted butter, 100ml milk, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a half-teaspoon of crushed green cardamom pods and a grated peeled apple. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry, then dollop into a muffin tray lined with paper cases. “Top each one with a cube of apple, pushing it into the batter a little, and add a sprinkling of oats, pumpkin seeds and demerara sugar.” Bake at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for eight minutes, then turn down to 180C (160 fan)/350F/gas 4 and bake for eight to 10 minutes until risen. You’ll then have breakfast sorted for days. It’s a truth universally acknowledged that most breakfast binds can be solved with eggs. Omelettes, Cloake says, are “quicker than porridge, and infinitely customisable”, while chef Josh Katz favours shakshuka. “It’s a dish rooted in simplicity, but you can play around with it,” says the chef-owner of Carmel in London. “At its core are lots of garlic, onions, peppers and spices [paprika or cumin, say] softened in olive oil, then [add] tomatoes, be that puree, tinned or fresh. Reduce, then balance with sugar and season.” Make some wells, crack in your eggs, then pop a lid on the pan and, once cooked, top with chopped coriander, spring onions, yoghurt, tahini or whatever else you fancy and have got to hand. Alternatively, turn dinner into breakfast. If you’ve got any leftover mash knocking about (and didn’t overdose at Christmas), there’s bubble and squeak, which should be topped with an obligatory fried egg. “Or cook extra rice when you’re making dinner and turn it into fried rice the next morning with an egg and some chopped veg,” Cloake adds. “All of these things feel like a big hassle, but actually can be on the table in 10 minutes, and – bonus! – a frying pan is a lot easier to wash up than a porridge pot!”  Got a culinary dilemma?

1/11/2022,"Bruce Willis continues his campaign of reputation self-ruin – not that he has that far to fall – with this cruddy, derivative action thriller that pits two cops – one being Willis, the other Swen Temmel – and a bereaved war veteran played by Chad Michael Murray, against an eclectic assortment of drug smuggling miscreants. In a semi-tropical rural locale somewhere in the southern US (Puerto Rico served as the actual location), cops David (Willis) and Cal (Temmel) make a mess of busting some drug dealers. Although David gets injured and caught by the miscreants, Cal hares off after Violet (Kate Katzman, ripping off Margot Robbie’s bleached foundation and dark lipstick look from The Suicide Squad) and her super-violent bottle-blond boyfriend (Zack Ward). They end up at the farmhouse of Eric (Murray), who recently managed to kill his wife and young daughter in a car crash by not keeping his eyes on the road. Although obviously a terrible driver, Eric isn’t such a bad shot and soon he teams up with Cal to save David by taking down the bad guys, whose numbers keep increasing for the first half of the film, and then decreasing in the second as they’re picked off.  Willis does a lot of sitting around being handcuffed while bleeding, which nevertheless fails to wipe that permanent smug sneer off his face. The endless bouts of fisticuffs and gunplay are interspersed with fitful plot padding and grim attempts at banter between assorted groups of characters – but never more than five at once because that would presumably have been too expensive.

1/11/2022,"Burke Shelley, founder, frontman and bassist with Welsh rock trio Budgie, has died aged 71. His daughter Ela Shelley announced the news, saying he died in his sleep at a Cardiff hospital, with no cause of death stated. Born John Burke Shelley in Cardiff in 1950, Shelley formed Budgie in 1967 with guitarist Tony Bourge and drummer Ray Phillips. They released their debut album in 1971, and by 1974 they had reached the UK Top 30 with their fourth album In for the Kill!  Powered by Shelley’s remarkable, high-pitched singing voice, the band married blues to a galloping heavy rock sound alongside peers such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, and helped to pioneer the heavy metal that flourished in the 70s and 80s – though they were also given to quieter moments of pristine beauty. Their most celebrated song Breadfan, from 1973’s Never Turn Your Back on a Friend, combined both moods in one song – it was frequently covered by Metallica in live shows, with a version included on their compilation Garage Inc. Soundgarden, Van Halen, Megadeth and Iron Maiden would also go on to cover Budgie songs. Budgie were also known for humorous and vivid song titles such as You’re the Biggest Thing Since Powdered Milk and In the Grip of a Tyrefitter’s Hand, and equally striking album art, with fantastical vistas by Roger Dean (also known for his sleeves for Yes and others). The band saw their success wane somewhat in the late 70s as their lineup – always featuring Shelley – frequently changed, but they had a second flush of fame in the early 1980s as the new wave of British heavy metal they helped to inspire came to fruition. The albums Nightflight and Deliver Us from Evil returned them to the UK charts, and they supported Ozzy Osbourne’s debut solo tour across Europe in 1980. Their career waned again in the mid-80s and the band only occasionally toured during the next two decades, but re-formed to record a final album, You’re All Living in Cuckooland, in 2006. Shelley suffered from a number of health conditions in later life. As well as having connective tissue disorder Stickler syndrome, an emergency heart operation in 2010 damaged his singing voice, and his right leg was injured during surgery.",Arts/Music,"Burke Shelley, frontman with Welsh rock band Budgie, dies aged 71",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/11/burke-shelley-frontman-with-welsh-rock-band-budgie-dies-aged-71
1/11/2022,"Coronavirus loses 90% of its ability to infect us within five minutes of becoming airborne, the world’s first simulations of how the virus survives in exhaled air suggest. The findings re-emphasise the importance of short-range Covid transmission, with physical distancing and mask-wearing likely to be the most effective means of preventing infection. Ventilation, though still worthwhile, is likely to have a lesser impact.  “People have been focused on poorly ventilated spaces and thinking about airborne transmission over metres or across a room. I’m not saying that doesn’t happen, but I think still, the greatest risk of exposure is when you’re close to someone,” said Prof Jonathan Reid, director of the University of Bristol’s Aerosol Research Centre and the study’s lead author. “When you move further away, not only is the aerosol diluted down, there’s also less infectious virus because the virus has lost infectivity [as a result of time].” Until now, our assumptions about how long the virus survives in tiny airborne droplets have been based on studies that involved spraying virus into sealed vessels called Goldberg drums, which rotate to keep the droplets airborne. Using this method, US researchers found that infectious virus could still be detected after three hours. Yet such experiments do not accurately replicate what happens when we cough or breathe. Instead, researchers from the University of Bristol developed apparatus that allowed them to generate any number of tiny, virus-containing particles and gently levitate them between two electric rings for anywhere between five seconds to 20 minutes, while tightly controlling the temperature, humidity and UV light intensity of their surroundings. “This is the first time anyone has been able to actually simulate what happens to the aerosol during the exhalation process,” Reid said. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggested that as the viral particles leave the relatively moist and carbon dioxide-rich conditions of the lungs, they rapidly lose water and dry out, while the transition to lower levels of carbon dioxide is associated with a rapid increase in pH. Both of these factors disrupt the virus’ ability to infect human cells, but the speed at which the particles dry out varies according to the relative humidity of the surrounding air. When this was lower than 50% – similar to the relatively dry air found in many offices – the virus had lost half of its infectivity within 10 seconds, after which the decline was slower and more steady. At 90% humidity – roughly equivalent to a steam or shower room – the decline in infectivity was more gradual, with 52% of particles remaining infectious after five minutes, dropping to about 10% after 20 minutes. However, the temperature of the air made no difference to viral infectivity, contradicting the widely held belief that viral transmission is lower during warm weather. “It means that if I’m meeting friends for lunch in a pub today, the primary [risk] is likely to be me transmitting it to my friends, or my friends transmitting it to me, rather than it being transmitted from someone on the other side of the room,” said Reid. This highlights the importance of wearing a mask in situations where people cannot physically distance, he added. The same effects were seen across all three Sars-CoV-2 variants the team has tested so far, including Alpha. They hopes to start experiments with the Omicron variant in the coming weeks.",News/World news,Covid loses 90% of ability to infect within five minutes in air – study,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/covid-loses-90-of-ability-to-infect-within-five-minutes-in-air-study
1/11/2022,"As a lot of people in Boris Johnson’s life have discovered, there is a point where he has simply broken too many things for the relationship to be put functionally back together again. Is he at that point with the British public, or even with the Conservative party? Many are getting a really addled whiff of Humpty Dumpty off the latest revelations, that the prime minister himself attended a “mass gathering” in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown. This May 2020 BYOB drinks party, to which more than 100 people were invited, kicked off a mere 55 minutes after that day’s designated cabinet minister had given a national press conference insisting that people in England could only meet one person from another household outdoors, so … what was the party theme? Let them eat cheese and wine? Come as the last scene in Animal Farm?  Spellbindingly, Johnson yesterday refused to even admit he’d been at the drinks party, his smile twitching and his eyes swivelling as he cowered in some vaccination centre and gibbered: “All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray.” Had he been interviewed by Sue Gray? “All that is a subject for investigation by Sue Gray.” I’m afraid the only sane response to this is: what?! What are you even talking about? Did you or didn’t you go to a big party in your garden, you smirking fibreglass toby jug? Or do you also have to wait for some veteran civil servant to tell you whether or not you put your pants on the right way round this morning? Honestly mate, just MAN UP. Johnson’s turn as “prime minister” seems to have moved past the sarcastic air quotes phase. This feels a lot like government by the crazy-face emoji, tongue lolling out and one eye boggling bigger than the other. Any Tory MP who voted for this galaxy-class liar to become leader should remember they were wrong on probably the biggest call of their career, and consider resigning before the next election to go and work for a charity/arms dealer. Speaking of manning up, I wonder if the organisers managed to find any ladies to attend this 20 May party? I mean, I’m not saying that people who do well under Johnson are mainly guys who spent a significant part of the past decade masturbating to Game of Thrones. No wait – I am. But one of my favourite things about the one Downing Street cheese-and-wine “work meeting” that we have an actual photo of is that the only two women I can see in it are Carrie Johnson and Gina Coladangelo. Remember, girls: if you want to work at the heart of government, you need to be either a man, or in a relationship with a man who does. If you can dream it, you can do it! Back to the BYOB party, though – sorry, I know you need flashcards to keep your rule-breaking Downing Street pandemic bashes in order – which was organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Apparently Reynolds now wants to get back to the diplomatic service, and perhaps the Middle East, and there is some talk about him being made an ambassador. You know, like when you or I break the rules and mess up spectacularly at work, and they make us an ambassador. Two days after the May BYOB party, the story of Dominic Cummings’ rule-breaking trips to Durham and Barnard Castle broke, which you’d think would have given these people a lifelong unforgettable lesson in just how incandescent the public were about elite rule-breaking. (And yet, given all the Downing Street parties which followed that Christmas, they somehow forgot it.) But in May 2020, who could have predicted that a potential 100-person boozy gathering could piss the general public off? Who could have predicted that people who’d watched their family members die on an iPad then buried them with only permitted numbers of mourners at graveside funerals would have an issue with it? No one at the party, apparently. In which case, every single one of them is in the wrong job and should resign and go and work for a thinktank/be our man in Havana. Incredibly, even the Met are finally “in contact” with the Cabinet Office over the latest party revelation. So do settle down to another episode of this farce, which might be entitled NO RUSH, PLOD. Yet again we have to ask: where were the multiple police officers who were stationed in and around the Downing Street complex when this BYOB party was happening? Did they notice at least 30 people having a booze-up, three hours after their force’s official social media account was reminding people of the rules? If not, maybe they could consider their positions/go on the sick for two years then retire at 53 with a full pension. Smartphones mean most people can check photos to see what they were doing on 20 May that year. I note this party occurred fairly soon after a Met officer told me to stop playing cricket in the park with my children, on the basis that cricket is “sport but not exercise”. Admittedly, I don’t care to run singles (I see myself as the Chris Gayle of Kensington Gardens), but let’s not forget how officious police forces up and down the land were at the time. What so many hundreds of thousands of us will also never forget, alas, are our own darker stories: graveside funerals; Zoom funerals; funerals after which no gathering was allowed by law. Just weeks before 20 May, a 13-year-old boy had died alone in a London hospital, separated from his family, who were also unable to attend his funeral because they were adhering to isolation regulations. Every single person at the Downing Street party would have known that story. But I am afraid this goes even further than shame and deceit. It is increasingly unignorable that these serial exposés of No 10 culture are taking place against a backdrop of growing conspiracism in this country. Significant numbers of people turned to online misinformation over the pandemic, and a lot of previously soft conspiracism is now calcifying in deeply concerning ways. More are being sucked down those rabbit holes all the time. I say sucked; but every one-rule-for-them revelation amounts to a push. After all, when people repeatedly see the duplicity and double standards of those in command, is conspiracism really such an irrational response? The tragedy is that we will all end up paying for the breakdown in trust, both in ways which are already obvious, such as rising anti-vax sentiment, and in ways we cannot yet predict. But they are coming, and Boris Johnson’s way of doing business has hastened them. How can we counter some people’s conviction that “The Man” is lying to them, when the man is so often shown to be lying?

1/11/2022,"Rough sleepers in England can be offered cash and food vouchers if they agree to having a Covid jab, the government has confirmed. Eddie Hughes, the minister for rough sleeping, said councils could use part of the government’s £28m protect and vaccinate scheme to incentivise vaccinations for those on the streets, in the first scheme of its kind in the UK.  The disclosure, first reported in the Local Government Chronicle, comes amid growing impatience within government circles with people refusing to take up the Covid vaccine offers. While the UK has one of the highest vaccine uptakes in the world – with more than 85%t of adults double-jabbed, according to government data – millions are yet to have a full vaccine course. The homeless population has been especially hard hit by Covid-19, with one in 50 deaths among this group related to coronavirus in 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The government’s suggestion of possible incentives was described by Hughes at a ministerial webinar with council leaders and ministers on 17 December. Speaking after the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, Hughes said people who slept rough were a group with very low levels of vaccination and there was likely to be a degree of vaccine hesitancy. “So we’re making an additional pot of money available to incentivise vaccinations for this group. This funding will help local authorities and their partners to use their understanding of the needs of rough sleepers to increase the vaccination take-up. “Incentivisation will be at the discretion of local authorities but could include transport, subsistence, childcare and support workers’ costs. So I want to be clear, you will have considerable support to do this,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “The discretion given to councils include[s] the ability to offer cash or food vouchers as incentives for vaccination.” Many people who are homeless or sleeping rough are likely to have underlying health conditions. These are likely to be under-diagnosed or not properly reflected in GP records. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised in March that local teams consider a universal offer to adults experiencing homelessness and rough sleeping alongside those in priority group 6. They should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration. At the webinar, Hughes said the protect and vaccinate scheme was a further development of ‘Everyone In’, the March 2020 initiative providing safe accommodation for rough sleepers. “We’ll be building on the success of that programme, which gave us the opportunity to work with people that we haven’t previously been able to reach. Hopefully, this will now allow us to provide accommodation to those particularly vulnerable people, but the pre-eminent element is getting people vaccinated,” he said.",News/Society,"English councils can offer cash for rough sleepers to get Covid jabs, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/11/councils-offer-cash-rough-sleepers-get-covid-jabs-england
1/11/2022,"A Home Office accommodation provider is making urgent improvements to flats for asylum seekers in the prime minister’s constituency after the Guardian exposed poor conditions there. Eighteen flats in Uxbridge, west London, housing dozens of asylum seekers, were found to be rife with damp, mould, water leaks and pest infestations. The Home Office admitted that the conditions “clearly fall short of the high standards we expect from our contractors”. Hillingdon council said conditions in the properties were under investigation.  The Guardian has also received complaints about asylum accommodation in a central London hotel used by the Home Office to house asylum seeker families. Problems reported there includs severe bed bug infestations, water leaking through the ceiling, electricity faults, and a fire in a ground-floor annexe last month that caused the evacuation of the hotel. Both of these sites are managed by a private firm, Clearsprings, on behalf of the Home Office. As more complaints are made about conditions in some of the asylum seeker accommodation run by Clearsprings, it has emerged that the company’s three directors were paid increased dividends last year of £7m between them. The previous year the dividend was £1m, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The accounts show that the company’s operating profit increased from £796,304 in January 2020 to £4.4m in January 2021. Along with its Home Office work – the 10-year accommodation contract runs until 2029 – the company also has a five-year contract with Kent county council until 2023. Clearsprings declined to comment on the dividend payout. Hillingdon council carried out urgent inspections of the Uxbridge flats on 22 December. The asylum seekers told the Guardian that a flurry of activity followed the article, with contractors sent round to deep clean and redecorate some of the accommodation. Some of the asylum seekers received an undated note from Clearsprings after the article, which stated: “We will be vacating everyone … urgently. Once we find suitable accommodation. This might possibly happen next week. I advise you pack your belongings.” Some have now been offered alternative housing in east London and Yorkshire. Stuart McDonald, the MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, condemned Clearsprings. He said: “Outsourced asylum accommodation has been a total disaster from the outset. Clearsprings’ accounts suggest that the ‘new’ contracts awarded in 2019 have simply proved to be a goldmine for the owners of Clearsprings and others – despite the fact that the asylum seekers they accommodate have continued to endure totally unacceptable conditions. The scandal of outsourced accommodation must be stopped.” Hannah Marwood, of the charity Care4Calais, which is providing support to asylum seekers in the Uxbridge flats and the central London hotel, said: “These are not isolated incidents. Supporting thousands of asylum seekers across the country, we see the conditions some are forced to live in and the huge toll living in these conditions takes on people who have suffered painful and traumatic past experiences. The government should treat every life with respect and dignity, not allow its contractors to cut corners, seemingly for profit.” A Clearsprings spokesperson said about the Uxbridge flats: “We can confirm that work to the property is ongoing and it is hoped this will be concluded as soon as possible.” Commenting on the problems at the central London hotel, the spokesperson said: “Clearsprings Ready Homes works closely with its delivery partners to ensure that safe, habitable and correctly equipped accommodation is provided. Whenever issues are raised, or defects are identified, Ready Homes will undertake a full investigation and ensure that those issues are addressed.” A Hillingdon council spokesperson said: “This is a live case being investigated by our private sector housing enforcement team, so we can’t disclose further information at this stage.” A Home Office spokesperson said in response to complaints about conditions in the central London hotel: “We are dealing with unprecedented pressures on the asylum system, but despite this, we continue to ensure the accommodation provided is safe, comfortable and secure.” Home Office sources acknowledged there had been bed bug infestations and electrical problems at the hotel, which the sources said had now been resolved.",News/UK news,Home Office housing provider to make urgent repairs to flats for asylum seekers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/home-office-housing-provider-to-make-urgent-repairs-to-asylum-seeker-flats
