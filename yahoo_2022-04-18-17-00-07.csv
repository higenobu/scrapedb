4/18/2022,"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., expressed outrage over a video of Christians singing on a plane, leading many Republicans to attack her for what they suggested was anti-Christian bigotry. Omar shared a video Saturday evening in which a worship leader with a guitar sings Christian worship music on an airplane. ""I think my family and I should have a prayer session next time I am on a plane,"" Omar, who is Muslim, wrote with the video. ""How do you think it will end?"" ILHAN OMAR'S HUSBAND'S FIRM QUIETLY RAKING IN PAYMENTS AGAIN FROM COMMITTEE LINKED TO ‘SQUAD’ MEMBER Many Republican candidates responded, suggesting that Omar had expressed hatred or bigotry against Christians. ""Why do you hate Christians, Ilhan?"" Vernon Jones, a Black pro-Trump former Democrat who is running to represent Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives, asked. ""If the freedom of religion we enjoy here in America disturbs you, feel free to pack your bags and head back to Somalia, Sudan, or wherever you’re from. Take your brother with you."" ""In America, Muslims can & do pray in public,"" Jose Castillo, a Republican candidate running for Congress in Florida's 9th Congressional District, tweeted. ""If she wants a country where Christians aren’t allowed to do the same [Omar] should go back to her own country,"" he added, presumably referring to Somalia, where she was born. (Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.) ""Qatar - a country you’re very familiar with - plays Islamic prayers on the intercom before takeoff on their planes,"" Cicely Davis, a candidate in the GOP primary in Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, which Omar represents, tweeted in response to her opponent. ""They have a designated prayer area & coordinates for Mecca are posted on the screens. It’s no problem. The issue is you hate Christians & Jews & lots of Muslims."" Royce White, another candidate in the GOP primary for Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, also chimed in. ""I’m coming for your seat,"" White tweeted in response to Omar. ""Don’t disrespect Christianity! You’re a globalist fraud. You can’t pray in Pelosi’s office! The Democrats you serve don’t believe in God. Their platform is openly anti-God. Minneapolis will not become Mogadishu. We will not bend the knee."" The original context for the video remains unclear. Omar took it from the Twitter account @davenewworld_2, which has the name ""Fifty Shades of Whey."" Reports claim the video had been shot by Jack Jensz Jr., who leads a group called Kingdom Realm Ministries. The original posting appears to have been deleted, however. Neither Omar's campaign office nor her spokesman immediately responded to an after-hours media request from Fox News Digital, but Omar did retweet Deadspin sportswriter Chuck Modi, who shot back at the responses Omar received on social media. ""Ilhan Omar: Makes very valid point,"" Modi wrote. ""Right-wingers who hate Ilhan Omar: ‘You are ‘attacking Christianity’ because I am stupid or dishonest or just pandering to my bigoted base.’""",Politics/Fox News,Ilhan Omar mocked for voicing outrage over Easter worship on plane: 'Why do you hate Christians?',https://news.yahoo.com/ilhan-omar-mocked-voicing-outrage-043149849.html
4/18/2022,"LONDON — Britain’s defense ministry says the continuing siege of Mariupol is tying up Russian forces and slowing its advance ahead of a planned major offensive in eastern Ukraine. In a daily intelligence update, Britain’s military says “concerted Ukrainian resistance has severely tested Russian forces and diverted men and materiel, slowing Russia’s advance elsewhere.” The Sea of Azov port city has been devastated in weeks of Russian pummeling. Britain says “large areas of infrastructure have been destroyed” and there are “significant” civilian casualties. Britain accuses Russia of using similar tactics of all-out war on civilian areas that it deployed in Chechnya and Syria, despite Russian claims at the start of its invasion “that Russia would neither strike cities nor threaten the Ukrainian population.” ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — 'No surrender’: Ukrainians fight on in Mariupol steel plant — Russia renews strikes on Ukraine capital, hits other cities — Mother, grandmother weep over 15-year-old killed in shelling of Kharkiv Follow all AP stories on Russia's war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine. ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: KYIV, Ukraine — Multiple explosions believed to be caused by missiles have struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, according to witnesses there. Lviv and the rest of western Ukraine has been less affected by the fighting than other parts of the country, and is considered to be a relatively safe haven. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on Facebook that five missiles struck the city and that emergency services were responding to the blasts. He said more details would follow. ___ LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops in southern Ukraine have been carrying out torture and kidnappings, and he called on the world Sunday to respond. “Torture chambers are built there,” Zelenskyy said in an evening address to the nation. “They abduct representatives of local governments and anyone deemed visible to local communities.” Zelenskyy said humanitarian aid has been stolen, creating famine. In occupied parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, he said, the Russians are creating separatist states and introducing Russian currency, the ruble. Intensified Russian shelling of Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, has killed 18 people and wounded 106 in the last four days alone, Zelenskyy said. “This is nothing but deliberate terror. Mortars, artillery against ordinary residential neighborhoods, against ordinary civilians,” he said. He said a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine “will begin in the near future.” Zelensky again called for increased sanctions against Russia, including its entire banking sector and oil industry. “Everyone in Europe and America already sees Russia openly using energy to destabilize Western societies,” Zelenskyy said. “All of this requires greater speed from Western countries in preparing a new, powerful package of sanctions.” ___ WASHINGTON — Ukraine’s foreign minister is describing the situation in Mariupol as dire and heartbreaking and says Russia’s continued attacks there could be a “red line” that ends all efforts to reach peace through negotiation. Dmytro Kuleba tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the remaining Ukrainian military personnel and civilians in the port city are basically encircled by Russian forces. He says the Ukrainians “continue their struggle” but that the city effectively doesn’t exist anymore because of massive destruction. Kuleba says his country has been keeping up “expert level” talks with Russia in recent weeks in hopes of reaching a political solution for peace. But citing the significance of Mariupol, he echoed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in saying the elimination of Ukrainian forces there could be a “red line” that stops peace efforts. ___ WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says he’s praying on Easter for those living in the “dark shadow” of war, persecution and poverty. Biden released an Easter message Sunday in which he says he’s also praying for peace, freedom and basic dignity and respect for all of God’s children. Biden didn’t say which war he had in mind, but the president has been deeply involved in trying to force an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The American president says he’s grateful that the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed many people around the world to celebrate by attending religious services and in-person family gatherings. He also acknowledges that the holiest day on the Christian calendar “falls on heavy hearts for those who have lost loved ones and those among us living in the dark shadow of war, persecution and poverty.”",World/Associated Press,Live Updates | UK: Mariupol resistance hinders Russian plans,https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-lviv-mayor-says-061144377.html
