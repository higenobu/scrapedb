5/7/2022,"Iwas in a secondary school last week, asked in to talk about how books and writing help with developing a sense of empathy. Before the session, I went through my books looking for pieces that might suggest to the students how they were being invited to put themselves in someone else’s shoes. I started with something personal: when I was 11, I came across a photo of my mother with a baby on her lap. I asked my father whether this was me or my brother. He looked and said it wasn’t either of us, it was the baby who died, called Alan. As I explained in my poem “Going through the old photos”, this was the first time that I had ever heard about this baby brother. The piece ends with a question about my parents: though my father mentioned Alan several times down the years, my mother never did; I ask myself who was the more upset about it. I put that to the students. From that personal story, I moved into other mysteries of childhood and teenage life, such as when my father referred mysteriously to two French uncles who were in France at the beginning of the war but not there at the end. I invited the students to think about what that may have felt like. Or how my father’s cousin had been put on a train by his parents when he was 17 and he never saw them again. What would that feel like? I knew that in the audience there were students who were refugees, or whose parents were, and the experience of lost relatives may be only too familiar. Then I told them how I found out what did happen to those uncles: they were put on lists. One was arrested with his wife in Nice, just as they thought they were going to sail to freedom in north Africa, and the other was rounded up at 2.30am and deported. I showed them the police report written the morning after my father’s Uncle Martin was arrested. I invited the students to think about what state of mind those police were in when they wrote down the details of what Martin was wearing – his cotton shirt and trousers (pyjamas?), flat shoes, a beret. They also wrote down his height (1m 62), mentioned the scar on his face, the shape of his nose and that he was of “Jewish race”. It was all “official” and “legal”, I said. At one point in the session, the question of lists and deportations came up. One student talked about the difficulties of arriving in a new country. I suddenly thought of the people arriving in Britain who may face being deported by our own government to Rwanda. I found myself running forwards and backwards in my mind between events in my family’s story in 1943 and ’44 and what is happening now. What made it possible for those four gendarmes to arrest someone who had committed no offence? What makes it possible for a government right now to instruct its officials to do something similar … and what mindset would enable those officials to do the job of arresting people and putting them into buses and on planes? Would it help them to do this work if they thought the people they were guarding were of some “race” other than their own? There seems to be a different view being expressed towards the desperate people of Ukraine. Why is that? I’m telling you this story because the words and actions of your government may sometimes seem to be in a sphere separate from education, schools and students and yet in this session, what the government says and does was very much of the moment. On the way home, I wondered how the students see what goes on in Westminster while teachers and parents try to convey social ideas to them: things such as honesty, the rule of law, respect, economic fairness, and sexual equality. The scandals are piling up, aren’t they? Partygate, Tractorgate, PPE contracts, fuel bills … Sessions like the one I was involved in go on in schools all over the UK all the time, and parents are having the same discussions with their children. The last thing we teachers or parents want to sound like is hypocrites, advising young people to behave in ways that the country’s lawmakers cannot manage themselves. This is where you come in, Mr Zahawi. I realise you’re not the archbishop of Canterbury and no one expects you to be some kind of moral arbiter, but I put it to you: don’t you think it’s any part of your job to indicate to teachers and parents that, at the very least, you realise how difficult our work has become recently, talking to young people about empathy and social values? It’s a question of empathy, really.

5/7/2022,"The video was a terrible way for Vadim Yevdokimenko to find out that his father had been murdered. Alexei had been missing for weeks, since he went out in early March to scavenge firewood for cooking in their shattered, Russian-occupied town of Bucha. Yevdokimenko and his mother, Lilia, clung to a fading hope that he might have been captured and taken across the border, and that he would return in a prisoner exchange – the fate of some Ukrainian men. But this week the 20-year-old student barber spotted his father’s face in footage of Ukrainians tortured and murdered during the occupation. The only solace the family can reach for now is giving Alexei a decent burial, but they cannot find his body. So they had come to wait outside a white tent set up in the grounds of Bucha hospital, where French forensic investigators were swabbing a queue of quietly desperate people for their DNA, to see if any of them have relatives lying in the nearby morgue. After weeks of exhumations, the morgue holds more than 200 bodies that have not been identified. Some were buried without documents and are waiting to be claimed, but many are too disfigured by their deaths, or their treatment after death, to be identified by sight. “This is the first time we have done this. At first we didn’t know how many people would come,” said Andrei Turbar, the deputy prosecutor for Bucha district, as dozens of relatives filled in forms and waited for their tests. The crowd underlined how many people are missing in just one small suburban town outside Kyiv. Ukrainians who saw their loved ones killed or have collected their bodies for burial are grappling with terrible grief. But thousands more are dealing with a loss compounded by the agony of uncertainty. Some are searching for children or parents, a spouse or siblings who went missing when the Russians were slaughtering civilians. Others got bad news from a friend or an image online, but have not been able to find the remains of the person they loved. So everyone lining up outside the tent in Bucha has come with the bleakest of hopes – to continue in limbo, confirm a death, or find a body they will be able to bury but not recognise. The UN’s top human rights envoy, Michelle Bachelet, highlighted the torment of those with missing relatives “desperate to know where they are, if they are alive, and how they can get them back”, in a speech to the security council on Thursday. Vera Kunayeva and Olga Zaetz are friends whose sons were neighbours and went missing together in early March. The two women are praying their DNA will not match any of the bodies, so they can carry on believing the missing men may be prisoners somewhere in Russia, as Yevdokimenko and his mother did until a couple of days earlier. “We came to do the DNA tests but we hope it is useless, and shows they are alive,” said Kunayeva, whose 40-year-old son, Vadim, is her only child, a family man with two teenagers. Zaetz’s missing son Maxim is a factory worker and at 33 still her baby, the youngest of three brothers. The men went out at 5pm, neighbours said, and were never seen again. “They started volunteering the first day when the Russians arrived, taking aid to older and vulnerable people,” Zaetz said. “I wasn’t worried because they were always doing it, they were used to helping.” The area was isolated by Russian troops, half-destroyed by shelling and then occupied, so residents who were hungry and reduced to cooking on open fires had to rely on each other for aid. Kunayeva’s eyes filled with tears as she described what the village had been through, and remembered Vadim. “We want this over, we want victory and the Russians destroyed.” The number of unidentified bodies in this small suburban town goes up and down daily, said Turbar. Even as some victims are identified by tattoos, scars or other marks, Bucha’s sandy soil is still giving up more grim evidence of Russian brutality. “In the beginning it was 40 or 50 people exhumed a day. It is going down now. Yesterday we had seven, today four,” Turbar said. Volunteers are helping retrieve bodies from shallow graves, because authorities cannot keep up. Many are only discovered when residents who fled return. “People are coming back to find a grave in their garden,” Turbar said. “Perhaps a person driving in a car was stopped by Russians at a checkpoint and they shot him there. Later they let local people bury the body in a nearby house. That wasn’t a single incident, it was systematic.” Some of the bodies that cannot be identified were burned, some partly destroyed by the force of explosions that killed them. Russian soldiers intentionally disfigured the faces of some victims. Other corpses were left in cars or on the street so long that decomposition rendered them unrecognisable, after locals were banned from burying them or too afraid to attempt it as fighting raged. The overwhelming scale of atrocities has led to cruel confusion and bureaucratic layering of pain on top of terrible grief. At the morgue where Yevdokimenko went after seeing the video, he was presented with a single severed leg that workers insisted was all that remained of his father for burial. “They were trying to push a body on me. [Dad’s] cards were in the pocket but I think someone must have taken them,” he said. The trousers and shoe did not belong to his father, he said. When he challenged the workers they admitted that chaos often engulfed their efforts and confided that one body bag they opened this week contained three legs. A small town police force, government and hospital used to dealing with alcoholics, petty thieves and a few dozen deaths a year before Russia’s invasion could hardly have been adequately prepared to handle one of the biggest war crimes investigations of the century. “I am still afraid to walk around because I remember there was a Russian tank here or here. At the very end when they knew that they were leaving, they went street to street just killing everyone, grannies, grandpas, someone who was just sitting outside smoking,” Yevdokimenko said, adding that most of the victims were men. “My classmate, who was 20, was shot because the Russians didn’t like his trousers. There are only women left in my circle [so many of the men were killed].” Despite the scale of the challenge, Turbar says the town is determined to seek justice for the dead, and warn Russian forces still fighting in Ukraine – and reportedly committing fresh atrocities – that they cannot brutalise and murder with impunity. “Emotionally it is very hard to look at these people, some of them I knew before, all the buildings that have been destroyed,” he said. “But I feel an extreme responsibility to the people of Ukraine to collect evidence so we can take [the Russians] to court. “What is happening here is nothing compared to Kharkiv and Mariupol, [the number of atrocities uncovered] are going to get even worse. For Bucha, it is over, but there it is still going on, civilians are still dying.”",News/World news,Agony of uncertainty: Ukrainians take DNA tests to identify Bucha’s dead,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/ukrainians-take-dna-tests-identify-bucha-dead

Fill a medium, high-sided saucepan a third of the way up with neutral cooking oil and heat to 180C (use a digital thermometer, or test by dropping in a small cube of bread – it should sizzle and turn brown and crisp within 30 seconds). Dip the blanched cauliflower in the batter and, working in batches of two or three pieces at a time, carefully drop into the hot oil – it will sizzle. Fry for about one and half to two minutes, until crisp and golden, then lift out with a slotted spoon or spider and drain on kitchen paper.

5/7/2022,"The formation of a new executive at the Northern Ireland assembly could take up to six months, under laws designed to keep Stormont functioning in the event of a further crisis over Brexit. However, there could be another election in early winter after the DUP made clear after the election results on Friday that it would not re-enter the executive without changes to the Northern Ireland protocol even if the final outcome were to put it top of the polls. Amendments made to the Northern Ireland Act in February this year are aimed at preventing the assembly collapsing as it did in 2017 after a rift between Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist party. They give the elected representatives up to four six-week windows, 24 weeks in all, to select an executive, which sits like the cabinet at the top of the assembly. Senior sources in the DUP say it cannot re-enter Stormont with checks on goods in the Irish Sea remaining and Boris Johnson needs to realise the damage they say it is doing to the Good Friday Agreement. The assembly must meet within eight days of the election. Expect it to sit on Tuesday or Thursday next week. The 90 elected members must then sign the register and declare whether they are unionist, nationalist or “other” under the power-sharing system in place. Unlike Scotland or Wales or the UK national government – where the largest party can form a government – the Northern Ireland assembly requires a coalition of the two largest parties of different designations to form the devolved government. It is a known as a “co-sociational” political system designed for countries with major internal divisions. The party with the largest number of seats must nominate a first minister (FM) and the second largest party a deputy first minister (DFM). The posts are equal, despite the connotations of rank. In the event of a tie in the number of seats won, the first minister post will go to the party with the most first-preference votes. Yes. Elected members can switch party up to the day they sign the register. Watch the DUP or Sinn Féin try to lure independents to their camp in the event that there are just one or two seats between them. Once an FM and DFM are nominated, ministers are appointed through the so-called d’Hondt formula, which allocates department according to the relative weighting of each party in the election. The justice minister is an exception and must be appointed with cross-community support. The executive then drafts a programme for government and an associated budget, which must be approved by the assembly of elected members. Initially, the parties have six weeks from the day the assembly first meets to fill the ministerial posts. A fresh crisis will ensue, but a partial executive can limp on for up to 24 weeks. Initially, the members have six weeks to form an executive. The new Northern Ireland (ministers in departments, elections and petitions of concern) Act 2022 allows for three successive six-week extensions to that deadline. The DUP has refused to give a commitment that it would nominate a deputy first minister if it was in second place. It has also indicated that it will not return to an executive without the removal of Irish Sea border checks. Stormont collapsed in 2017 and power-sharing did not resume for three years. But that cannot happen this time. Former Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith, who shepherded through the New Decade New Approach deal, also paved the way for the new laws to ensure parties continued to govern despite their differences. Other ministers can be appointed, but their powers will be limited. Lisa Whitten, research fellow at Queen’s University and a member of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said the amended act “provides a safety net” as “existing policies can continue”, but warned that, as new decisions “on critical issues such as a budget or health reforms” cannot be made, “there is still plenty of scope for stagnation”. The ministers in place would lose their office and the Northern Ireland secretary would be legally obliged under the Northern Ireland Act to name a date for a second election. That election has to take place within 12 weeks of that announcement.",News/UK news,Northern Ireland elections: what happens next?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/northern-ireland-elections-what-happens-next
5/7/2022,"“It’s a disaster,” says Tony Field, after Labour won control of Westminster city council for the first time since its creation in 1964. “Council tax will soar under Labour. I’m sure of it.” Picking up his copy of the Daily Mail, Field, a retired railway worker, says Boris Johnson has had a “bad patch” but adds: “He’s started to regain his touch. I don’t think Boris has done anything wrong. What’s the matter with having a drink when you’re the prime minister. Starmer did it as well.” But Field seemed to be in the minority in Westminster’s Maida Vale area on Thursday. “I was very happy when I woke up and found out Labour had won,” says Nahid Poladi, a former bookseller. Poladi, who has lived in the area since fleeing Tehran in the early 1980s, was appalled by Westminster council’s decision to spend £6m on a mound at Marble Arch, which was widely mocked and forced to close after failing to attract visitors. “It was horrendous and really bad taste. I love art. I think live art is lifesaving, but that was monstrous. And anyone could see that it was tasteless.” Paul Dimoldenberg, a Labour councillor and the group’s previous leader in Westminster, says the Marble Arch mound played a key part in his party’s victory. “It was very resonant on the doorstep. When people mentioned the low council tax in Westminster, we were immediately able to counter by saying, ‘The council spent £6m wasting your money on that useless mound in Marble Arch.’ And they would instantly agree.” Dimoldenberg won a symbolic victory in the Hyde Park ward – an area previously represented by Shirley Porter, the council’s former Tory leader who designed the gerrymandering homes-for-votes campaign in the 1980s. “It’s a very sweet victory. We have turned Westminster red, something Shirley Porter tried to ensure would never happen with the illegal homes-for-votes policy. We had dreams and hopes of winning Westminster, but we thought it was something that would never happen,” he says. Kamel Abdelaoui, the owner of a hardware store, voted Labour because of the cost of living crisis. “I’ve been disappointed with the Conservatives [over] the cost of living,” he says. “They have let a lot of people down. People are really struggling with money and they spent all that on a mound, it was ridiculous.” He adds: “We are tired of the Conservative party and how they have been lying in parliament. I hope Labour will do good things here now.” Bill Hennessy, who runs a taxi shelter in Little Venice, sees no reason for hope. “I used to vote Labour, but they don’t do anything for the working class.” But he is even more cynical about the Conservatives. “They’re all millionaires,” he says. Jacqui Gough, a former air steward, out walking Rosie, her son’s cockapoo, says: “I just hope it sends a message that the Conservatives shouldn’t be in government.” She adds: “Locally, the Conservatives have been quite good, they’ve cleaned up the canal and the rates have been very reasonable. I was thinking this morning that I bet they will go up, but we can afford to pay. And we should spend more on services.” Annikka Kauppinen agrees. “I had never voted Labour before,” she says. “But I have really changed my mind in the last few years. We should be paying teachers and doctors and nurses. I don’t mind paying more council tax if they spend it on services. I just think we need investment. If people lose patience, you see the rise of the far right, and that really scares me.” Kauppinen, who works in finance, adds: “And Boris is a buffoon.” In Wandsworth, Margaret Thatcher’s favourite council, it was also the end of a Tory era on Thursday. Colin Maitland, a former librarian, says: “I’ve lived here for 45 years and for 44 years it’s been Tory. I just saw two men carrying away a large sign saying: The Brighter Borough, Wandsworth.” Maitland voted for two Labour candidates and one Green. He says: “The council hasn’t behaved as outrageously as the prime minister, but it is time for a change. I work in a food bank, and poverty here is just disgraceful. People are just desperate.” Hacer Hagar, who has lived in Wandsworth since moving to the UK from Turkey, voted Conservative on Thursday. She says: “I’m very happy with the council. I think they’ve been working quite well. But I think people voted against the council because of Boris.” She will not be voting Conservative in the general election, however. “I think Boris is a big liar and he doesn’t seem embarrassed by it, he just carries on as if nothing has happened.” She adds: “He lied about Turkey joining the EU, he used it to campaign to scare people.” Lucy Tetley, an events planner, also backed the Tories locally. “The Conservatives in Wandsworth have always done a great job keeping our council tax low.” She, too, blames the prime minister for the party losing Wandsworth. “I think it’s great shame. I think people have let anger about Boris Johnson and Covid cloud their judgment.” Tetley, 23, adds: “Everyone of my generation says, ‘I hate Boris.’ It’s a classic pub conversation. I wouldn’t vote for him in a general election. Loyalty has just snapped. He’s just messed up too many times.”",News/Politics,‘People are just desperate’: how London turned on the Tories ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/london-westminster-wandsworth-elections-turned-on-the-tories
5/7/2022,"No ambiguity here: even an entry-level electric beats a manual. “Power toothbrushes can remove up to twice the plaque and really help to improve your gum health in the longer term,” says Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the Oral Health Foundation. The two main types are the oscillating-rotating brush (Oral-B has a wide range) and the sonic brush (Philips Sonicare is the leading brand). The latter has the benefit of a faster brushing motion, but it doesn’t really matter which you choose, says Dr Nyree Whitley, group clinical director of the dental-care provider, the key point is minimising the need for manual dexterity: “It can be quite challenging to put the toothbrush at 45 degrees, get circulation motions and the right amount of pressure on the tooth.” Two minutes – though most of us do not come close to that. The average time spent brushing is 43 seconds, says Carter. He suggests parents should get kids used to brushing for two minutes, even if their smaller mouths can be done in less time, as “that’s the habit they’re going to keep for life.” The Oral Health Foundation’s advice is to start as soon as the first teeth appear, with a children’s brush, and supervise until the age of seven. Another advantage an electric toothbrush has over a manual is that many now come with timers or apps that connect to your brush via Bluetooth to monitor and tell you how long you spend brushing. That means having your phone to hand every time you brush, but let’s be real: it’s never far away anyway. Coverage also matters. The more hi-tech electric toothbrushes, such as the Oral-B iO series, use artificial intelligence (or “3D teeth tracking”) to ensure that all areas of your mouth get equal attention. The latest model retails for a mind-boggling £500, although they can usually be found discounted to half that price, advises Carter. I try to imagine circumstances where I would spend £250 on a toothbrush, and can’t. Just make sure you pay equal attention to the inner, outer and biting surfaces of every tooth. This issue was raised on Reddit’s No Stupid Questions forum. A man’s girlfriend called him weird for brushing his teeth in the shower, out of some vaguely articulated sanitary concern. He said it was a “normal thing most people do”. The response from Reddit was mostly along the lines of: why would it be weird? “I mean, I’m still going to stand there for a while blankly staring into the void, may as well brush my teeth,” was the top-voted comment. My dental professionals respond with similar bemusement. “Certainly don’t utilise the toothbrush as a loofah at the same time – but, it’s fine,” says Whitley. Carter agrees: “I don’t think it matters where you brush.” I say, if you’re hung up on your boyfriend brushing his teeth in the shower, you’re looking for problems. All that matters is that you clean between your teeth every day. Carter says water picks, which use a pressurised, often pulsating stream of water to clean between your teeth, can be a savvy investment for people with bridge work or orthodontic braces, who might find it harder to clean in between their teeth (though, he adds, “It takes a bit of mastering so that you don’t shower yourself with water as well”). They can cost hundreds, but you can get a basic model for about £50. If your oral care needs are more straightforward, you can probably save your money. Interdental brushes have been shown to be more effective at plaque removal than string floss, and many people find them much easier to use (though you should ask your dentist which size is best). But, says Whitley, if you choose waxed floss tape rather than string, “it really isn’t that difficult”. The trick is to tie it in a loop, then put fingers either side of the knot, “like a little lasso”, rather than messing about with a long bit of string.(This video gives you the idea, with some jaunty music.) If your gums bleed, persevere – they will get healthier with consistency. Fluoride is the key ingredient, so make sure your toothpaste contains at least 1,350-1,500ppm (parts per million) and no sweeteners – duh! “Don’t assume toothpastes are all the same, because they’re not,” says Whitley. “Some tooth-cleaning tablets and herbal toothpastes don’t have fluoride in them. As a dentist it’s really difficult not to go up and tell people in the supermarket, ‘Don’t buy that one.’” Once you’ve checked the fluoride content, you might look for one that meets your needs, such as for sensitive teeth, or a preference for whitening. If you are brushing twice a day, for two minutes each time, you can probably do without mouthwash, says Carter – but if you’re not, it’s a “very useful adjunct to your cleaning routine.” While brushing removes more plaque than mouthwash, throwing it in can improve plaque control by up to 20%. Make sure it has fluoride in it, for an additional advantage. In terms of when to use mouthwash, a dental therapist on TikTok went viral for saying that it should always be used before brushing your teeth. But as soon as I mention TikTok videos, the professionals visibly shudder. “I saw an awful one where people were using things other than toothbrushes to brush their teeth,” says Whitley. “Just, like … sticks.” It goes without saying: do not brush your teeth with sticks. This tip about mouthwash, however, turns out to be quite sound as not all mouthwashes contain fluoride. By rinsing with those that have a lower concentration than toothpaste (or, even more so, with water), “you’re effectively washing your mouth out,” says Whitley. The advice differs depending on the mouthwash’s active ingredients: those that contain antimicrobial chlorhexidine, for example, should be used after brushing. But in general, dentists suggest using mouthwash at a separate time to brushing, such as between meals. “You’re immediately putting it into a mouth full of saliva,” says Carter. “It’s probably not going to make any difference.” Sticking the toothbrush under the tap harks back to the time when bristles were harder. These days even “hard” brushes are made from a manageable nylon. “What was hard in the 1970s you’d probably scrub the floor with now,” says Carter. Most people are advised to use medium-to-soft brushes. Like water picks, tongue scrapers haven’t taken off in the UK the way they have in the US. “It’s not something we’d routinely recommend as clinicians, but if people want to use them, fine,” says Whitley. They might help with bad breath or tongue discolouration by removing the bacteria that builds up – but if either of these is a problem, see your dentist. Whitening toothpaste is a bit of a marketing gimmick, says Whitley. “It can stop stains building up – simple things like tea, coffee, red wine – but it won’t make teeth whiter than they originally were.”And some at-home whitening kits risk damaging more than your teeth. Many sold online far exceed the UK legal limit of 0.1% hydrogen peroxide, with potentially dangerous results. Of 36 products bought from AliExpress, Amazon, eBay and Wish last year, consumer advocates Which? found that 20 contained more than 10 times the legal hydrogen peroxide level, and six contained more than 100 times. Even if a kit seems well reviewed, “you wouldn’t know quite where it’s coming from, or even if it’s legitimate”, says Carter. He tells me about a case where someone used a product containing 350 times the legal level of hydrogen peroxide. I shall spare you the gory details. Still, as a regular tea drinker, Whitley uses one herself, sometimes for sensitive teeth: “It’s about getting a balance between the two.” Good news: it may be less often than you think. The traditional six-monthly check-up was established “without huge science behind it”, says Carter. And tooth decay has been less of a problem since fluoride toothpaste was introduced in the 1970s. If you’ve not had a filling for three to four years, have good daily routines and are free of gum disease, you may only need a yearly check-up, or even every two years, says Carter (which will also free up appointments for more needy patients). A 2020 study found no difference in oral health between patients who saw the dentist once every six months and those who observed “risk-based recall intervals”. A change in lifestyle, and therefore diet, can be a risk factor, and Whitley points out that “it’s obviously more difficult to eat healthily on a low income. And if people are stressed, some turn to sugar as a crutch.” Similarly, children who have “never needed a single filling” can see a sudden reversal in fortunes after they leave home, she adds. But, in general, if your dentist tells you not to come back for a year, you can believe them. If people have difficulty wrangling actual string floss, Carter points out, “I don’t think human hair is going to work any better. And what about bacteria from the hair you’re transferring into your mouth?” I also try to ask Whitley about #teethtok trends – that use lemon juice and rubber bands – but she has heard enough and does not indulge me: “Just no!”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tongue-scrapers, mouthwash and flossing: the dentists’ guide to cleaning your teeth properly",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/07/dentists-guide-to-cleaning-your-teeth-properly-electric-toothbrush-oral-health
5/7/2022,"Amber Heard was asked in court last week if she recognized the name Carly Simon, soon after her attorneys introduced an exhibit of a mirror that Johnny Depp had defaced in tight, punctuated script after severing part of his middle finger in what his former wife described as a drug- and alcohol-induced blackout. Depp’s note read: “Call Carly Simon. She said it better. Bye.” Heard testified she wasn’t familiar with Simon or her work. But Depp, one can reasonably speculate, was referring to You’re So Vain, Simon’s 1972 hit. His attorneys may take up the issue on cross-examination the week after next. Or the week after that. So it goes with the Depp-Heard defamation case in Fairfax, Virginia. A cautionary tale, certainly, with disturbing allegations of domestic and sexual violence. But also a man-woman fight, part gender-switch Sunset Boulevard, part Mean Girls, with flashbacks and still images taken – appropriately enough given the sinister if not vampiric nature of the relationship – in Bela Lugosi’s old house. Which narrative jurors choose will not be known until after 27 May, when attorneys will deliver closing arguments. For now, with the court out next week – the judge, Penny Azcarate, is at an unrelated judicial conference – jurors are left to mull the last two days of Heard’s take on her turbulent marriage. “Two skilled actors on the stand as witnesses could be equally resonant without regard to exactly where the truth is in their narratives,” said Nancianne Aydelotte, a New Jersey lawyer. “This is very challenging for jurors, who might find what the plaintiff said to be compelling and is then equally moved by the defendant.” Heard’s testimony, highly charged at times, has been delivered while keeping eye contact with jurors. Depp has kept his head down, occasionally consulting with his lawyers, usually when he seems to find something implausible – for example, that he ingested eight to 10 ecstasy pills in one sitting in Australia, or took quaaludes in Los Angeles. Heard’s overall story is that she was courted and seduced, was bought a colt, and fell madly in love with a movie star – “when I was around Johnny I felt like the most beautiful person in the world” – while the world beyond their “bubble” was kept in abeyance. “We weren’t doing normal life stuff,” Heard said. “We weren’t stuck in traffic with each other, we weren’t going to the grocery store and doing life. We were hiding in these places around the world.” That bubble, she testified, started to deflate when Depp began to disappear and she didn’t know how to find or reach him. Heard argued that Depp became threatened by her career and jealous of her co-stars. She testified that Depp threatened her life shortly after the pair were married, and that just weeks later, in Australia while filming the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, he sexually assaulted her with a bottle of Maker’s Mark.“I’ll fucking kill you,” Heard alleged that Depp yelled. “I was scared,” she added. “I had just married him.” Months later, Heard alleged, Depp broke her nose and ripped out chunks of hair in another violent encounter. Depp has testified that he never hit Heard, and that she was the one who was the abuser, including when she threw a bottle of vodka at him, severing his finger. Heard testified that in her effort to help Depp get sober, she sought help through Al-Anon, and sought to distance herself from the relationship, but was drawn back in whenever Depp achieved brief periods of sobriety and when the “monster” that the pair called his intoxicated persona was subdued. But at each turn, she said, his efforts were hindered by an entourage – his security team, assistants, hangers-on – who shielded him from the consequences of his drug and alcohol use. In London, she said, his security carried him into their rented home “like a baby”. Some of the most interesting testimony of the past week came from Depp’s accountants. One estimated that Depp had lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heard’s 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”. Hollywood dealmaker Richard Marks, a Depp witness, told the court that the film-making community had interpreted Heard’s message loud and clear. “That actor is synonymous with the product,” Marks said. “When hiring that actor or actress, you want a reputation that supports the value that you spent on creating that product. Especially in the last five years, with the #MeToo movement, you wouldn’t want negativity hiring an actor who, quote-unquote, had been canceled.” Outside of the proceedings, Heard’s PR team have accused Depp of failing to take responsibility. “One of Ms Heard’s disappointments is Mr Depp’s inability to distinguish fact from fiction – a malady which appears to have spread to his legal team,” a spokesperson said in email to reporters on Friday. A Depp flack countered that Heard had delivered “the performance of her life” and that his attorneys look forward to cross-examining her. Public relations experts are divided over the consequences of Depp’s $50m defamation claim and Heard’s $100m counter-claim. “This case should serve as a cautionary tale to high-profile people living in the public eye: when you decide to make an abuse allegation, or discuss your personal life in the form of an op-ed, a televised interview, or conversation with a reporter, you run the risk of having to publicly discuss all sorts of ugly private details,” says Evan Nierman at Red Banyan. “It’s remarkable that Heard chose to author the op-ed that started this entire saga, and that Depp decided to pursue legal action, given that both have more skeletons in their closets than a haunted house.” But Juda Engelmayer at Herald PR says that no matter what the verdict in the case, Depp has afforded himself the opportunity to make his case in the court of public opinion. “He got to tell his narrative rather than have it be told by Heard in the Washington Post. He entertained, and ended up getting a lot of people, including female audiences members, on his side. That’s how he wins, whatever the verdict, because he wants the world to see that he is still capable of producing fans and producing entertainment.” For Heard, the issue may be more complex. “She was considered a hero for putting out her narrative, so now she comes out more of a hero for taking the abuse in her marriage, if believed, and for taking abuse in court last week when he was entertaining, witty, taking it lightly and getting laughs. “She’s coming off looking good also,” says Engelmayer. “She’s being strong, bold and unafraid, sitting up there telling her story. She’s straightforward, and not backing away from it, and fighting for what she believes is right.” Depp, Engelmayer believes, will slowly find his way back into movies, though perhaps not as prominently as before. Heard, he says, also will find her way back. “She’ll get recast in some films to test the waters to see if she has that moxie. She was never as big as Depp, but a lot of studios may think putting her in is a good draw for women, and for progressives who think she was strong and deserves a chance. She’ll get the roles, and the box office will tell if she can command them.”",News/US news,‘She’s coming off looking good’: the week Amber Heard finally spoke,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/07/amber-heard-johnny-depp-defamation-trial

5/7/2022,"Teenagers with child trust funds at NatWest are waiting months to get hold of cash in matured accounts. Those affected include Joshua Burdon, whose child trust fund (CTF) with £3,500 in it matured when he turned 18 more than a year ago. He was planning to use the money to buy a car, but is still waiting for NatWest to transfer the cash, and says he ended up having to use his own money and borrow from a family member in order to finance the purchase. Burdon is not alone in facing a struggle to get his CTF money out of the partially state-owned bank. NatWest is not short of cash – it made profits of £1.2bn in the first three months of this year – but it has been struggling to deal with a deluge of people wanting to redeem their CTF accounts. Guardian Money has also been contacted by a woman who says her 18-year-old daughter has been waiting months for her money, and there are a number of recent complaints along similar lines on the Review Centre website and on the MoneySavingExpert forum, as well as on Twitter and Facebook. CTFs – nicknamed “baby bonds” – are long-term tax-free accounts for children that were launched in 2005. More than 6.3m were opened before they were scrapped in 2011. Every child born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011 was awarded a cash “endowment” of, typically, £250. Some children received top-up payments from the government, and family and friends have been able to pay money in, too. In autumn 2020 the first CTF children began turning 18, kicking off a multibillion-pound payout that will run all the way through until early 2029. It is estimated that each month about 55,000 teenagers – about 1,800 a day – turn 18 and become entitled to a pot of cash with their name on it. NatWest is one of the biggest CTF providers, with about 8,000 accounts maturing each month. The official government guidance on what happens when a CTF account comes of age says that on a person’s 18th birthday, their CTF matures and they automatically take over the account, at which point they can either withdraw the money or reinvest it in an adult Isa. The complaints from Burdon and the others follow similar lines. They typically say they have sent NatWest the requested identity documents, in some cases several times, and tried contacting the bank via the phone line, online chat, post or email, but have not managed to get their cash. Burdon’s CTF account was run by RBS Collective Investment Funds, part of NatWest, and was predominantly invested in shares. The 19-year-old, who lives near Chelmsford, Essex, told Guardian Money he has been waiting months for the money to be paid into his Lloyds bank account. He says he has made several trips to the bank to get documents scanned in, posted off documents and tried calling the NatWest CTF phone line numerous times, spending hours on hold. “I can’t get through to the phone lines, I can’t get through to any of the services … It’s becoming absolutely ridiculous now, and I need the money,” he says. To make matters worse, the value of his fund appears to have fallen slightly – earlier correspondence gave a value of £3,598, while a more recent letter mentions a figure of £3,540. The Review Centre website features a string of complaints from teenagers and parents who say they have tried to access their CTF cash but with no success. One, dated 27 April, says: “I have been trying to access my child trust fund with NatWest since October 2021 when I turned 18! It is now April 2022 and still no success…” Another, dated 25 April, says: “I turned 18 in October 2021. I still have not yet received my CTF money. I have submitted my documents four times now…” On Facebook, there are a number of recent posts from unhappy people, including one who reported: “Portal not working… Phone line not being answered. Online chat unhelpful. How are our kids supposed to claim the money they’re entitled to? This process should be so simple.” NatWest says: “We are currently experiencing an extremely high volume of customers getting in touch to redeem child trust fund accounts and are sorry for the delays that some customers have experienced. “The safety and security of our customers’ accounts is of paramount importance, and these accounts are particularly vulnerable to attempted fraudulent claims, which is why we have a detailed checking procedure when redeeming a child trust fund account.” At the end of last year NatWest issued a reminder to customers whose accounts had matured but from whom it had not heard. This led to seven times the normal volume of inquiries, and the bank is dealing with these along with the regular maturity requests. It says that some of the reasons customers may experience a delay include having an out-of-date address associated with their account, or not having ID documents properly certified. The bank adds that it has “significantly increased the resource available to support customer queries on this” and expects waiting times and query volumes to return to normal in the next few weeks. Commenting on Burdon’s case, NatWest apologised for the delay, adding: “The safety and security of Mr Burdon’s account is of paramount importance; as a result of this, we required some further documentation, which led to a delay in processing. We are pleased that Mr Burdon’s account has now been processed and he should receive his funds soon.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘It’s ridiculous’: the teens struggling to access NatWest child trust funds,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/07/teens-access-child-trust-funds-natwest
5/7/2022,"As Maurice Lewis was granted his freedom at the end of last year, he wept before a judge. “God bless you,” he told her. “I’ll never do this again. Thank you for putting me back with my family.” Lewis, a 57-year-old man, had been sentenced to life without parole in 1998. He had spent the last 23 years at Angola prison, serving his punishment by laboring on the fields, sweeping the prison hospital wards, and cleaning toilets at Louisiana’s state legislature. Life without parole is a sentence so harsh, it is associated with heinous crimes. But not in Louisiana, the most incarcerated state in the world’s most incarcerated country. Lewis’s crime had been so banal it has never been written about before. He was sentenced in an almost empty courtroom, with no family members present, at the end of a hearing that lasted a few minutes. He had been convicted of stealing $20 in cash from a snatched purse. “It felt like it was me against the world,” he remembered in an interview. “They kept on digging over my past.” That the money was returned to the unharmed white woman within minutes of the crime did not matter. Under the state’s habitual offender laws, voraciously enforced by the Orleans parish district attorney’s office at the time, he had been branded a career criminal. And as this was the third time the state invoked the habitual offender law, he was mandatorily sentenced to life with no chance of release. A glance at Lewis’s prior record reveals no career criminal, but a life of struggle instead. He had left school at the age of 14 without learning to read and had taken a few low paying jobs – delivering newspapers, and dish cleaning at a local hotel to support his mother. His youth had been punctuated by a series of convictions for minor crimes in which no one was physically hurt and a grand total of $44 was taken and later returned. He was involved in the theft of some stereo equipment aged 19. A purse at the age of 21. And at 27, he took an umbrella from a front porch. It was, he recalled, raining that day. Lewis was convicted of burgling an inhabited dwelling and sentenced to 80 months in prison. Using his prior record, the city of New Orleans deemed that Maurice Lewis should die in prison after the final purse snatching offense in 1998, in which he had pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors described him at trial as “a predator”, a racist trope. At the end of September last year, Lewis became one of the first 128 people given back their freedom thanks to a new civil rights division in the Orleans parish district attorney’s office. The division was created by the city’s new district attorney, Jason Williams, who ran as a progressive reformer and pledged never to use Louisiana’s habitual offender statute again. Part of his new civil rights division’s work to address past harms has been to revisit excessive sentences. It has since relitigated 82 habitual offender cases, resulting in their sentence enhancement or “multi-bills” being amended or revoked, and leading to immediate release from prison. Overuse of Louisiana’s habitual offender law is seen by many reform advocates as one of the major drivers of mass incarceration in the state. The act automatically increases prison time (from a second felony conviction onwards) and significantly removes the discretion of judges. Their implementation was famously derided by Louisiana’s former supreme court chief justice, Bernette Johnson, in a 2020 dissent after the court denied a request to review the sentence of a man named Fair Wayne Bryant who was sent away for life for the attempted theft of a pair of hedge clippers. Judge Johnson described the law’s usage as a “modern manifestation” of 19th-century Pig Laws, racist statutes designed to criminalize Black people implemented shortly after the US civil war. Nowhere in the state were they as readily enforced as in New Orleans, where prosecutors used them routinely for decades, first at the instruction of former DA Harry Connick and continuing into the tenure of Leon Cannizzaro. Although in recent years the Louisiana state legislature has amended the laws to reduce mandatory sentences and later made it harder for prosecutors to enforce them as vigorously as before, there are still hundreds of people incarcerated, with their sentences enhanced by multi-billing. At the beginning of 2021, at least 718 people from Orleans parish were still incarcerated under sentences extended by the habitual offender statute. Ninety-three percent of them are Black. In a monumental shift, the DA’s office is now working with attorneys in the public defender’s office and other non-profit defense groups to sift through the hundreds of names, considering each individually for re-examination on a range of criteria. These include whether the defendant was a juvenile at the time of the offense, if the offense was categorized as non-violent or no violence occurred, if the conviction was secured by a non-unanimous jury or if the defendant had been offered a more favorable plea before trial. During a recent meeting of the civil rights division, Cormac Boyle, one of only two trial attorneys assigned to the unit in its first year, began reading from an extensive list of cases they were preparing to take back to court. It was a sobering monologue: Life without parole for a non-violent car theft. 60 years for possession with intention to distribute 2.4 grams of cocaine. 20 years for theft of a motorized dirt bike. 40 years for purse snatching. (The man, sentenced in 1986, had almost completed his sentence in full.) The list drew occasional gasps from the assembled attorneys and investigators. Some, like Boyle, have worked for years on similar cases, but the sheer volume of severity has remained striking to almost everyone. “I get so frustrated by the utter wastage that we see of human life with the kind of sentencing that we are dealing with,” said Emily Maw, chief of the civil rights division. “It is futile.” Afew weeks after his release, Maurice Lewis was struggling. He had been overjoyed as he came out and saw his sister and brother at the gates of Angola waiting to greet him. But the realities of life outside grew day by day. Every relitigated multi-bill case includes a re-entry plan for a defendant’s release. But plans do not always become reality. Decades of trauma do not simply wash away. Lewis had first taken up work at a local restaurant, cleaning pots and pans in the kitchen, but, he said, was laid off when his boss found out about his criminal record. Afterwards he had tried to find work downtown, in the bustling tourist hubs on Canal Street. He walked into a number of storefronts asking for a job. The old hotel he’d worked at in the 1980s. A Footlocker. No luck. Lewis had effectively spent his entire adult life incarcerated and the realities of the free world were difficult to adapt to. He had never used a mobile phone. He had no bank account. No drivers license or state ID. He met with family members; aunts and uncles, nieces or nephews who had grown old or grown up during his decades behind bars. It was a confronting reality. He was living with his younger brother Eugene in a small apartment block, but with little space, he was sleeping in the living room. Every morning he woke up facing a life-sized photograph of his mother, Alise, who had died while he was in prison. “I couldn’t even be there to look down on my mama,” he said one recent blustery afternoon. “Right now, today, it still messes with me.” On some nights, when it got too much, he had wandered the streets alone and slept outside under a bridge. On one occasion, he described being pulled over by police and asked for identification documents that he didn’t have. “At night time it’s dangerous,” he said, his deep baritone voice at odds with his slim, slight frame. “Anything can happen to you.” In conversations, he offered fragments of the abuse he experienced inside: of violence he witnessed, men beaten with padlocks wrapped in socks in the dorms, of a time he recalled being placed in restraints after a breakdown following the death of his mother. “I just thank God for the blessing, you know? For putting me back out here,” he said one evening in late winter as he ate dinner in the city’s French Quarter. “What they did to me was wrong, using my past record. And I’m just trying … trying to make it right.” Former New Orleans district attorney Harry Connick, now 96, forcefully defended his office’s routine use of the habitual offender laws, arguing it was his experience as a defense lawyer that guided his usage of the statute. “I represented them [multiple offenders] for years, and I know them,” he said, during an interview. “I know their criminal histories, and I know that if you give them a year, they come out, they’ll go and commit more crime. Give them five years and they come out, they’re going to go commit more crimes. That’s what they do.” Connick pointed to his office’s creation of a diversion program, which deferred prosecution of first time nonviolent offenders, as an effort to steer defendants away from punitive measures. But did he recognize that many of those he was prosecuting under the statute, like Maurice Lewis, were involved in crimes born of poverty and desperation? “Desperate for what?” He said. “Money? … I’m not a social worker. And my job was to prosecute.” “People used to complain about the number of people I was sending to Angola. I would tell them to stop committing crimes, and I’ll stop prosecuting them.” He added: “For every year that individual, that habitual offender, that career criminal, would spend in the penitentiary, that diminishes the number of crimes that he’s going to commit. If you get enough of them in, you’re going to help your crime rate tremendously.” Despite Connick’s claims, the crime rate in New Orleans soared throughout the 1990s, with experts pointing to a complex mixture of societal forces felt acutely in the city. These include multidimensional poverty, income inequality and the effects of mass incarceration itself. Jason Williams would point to these causes on repeat during his 2020 election campaign. In an interview, he cited his family’s experiences with racism and the criminal justice system as a major factor in shaping his views on fair prosecution. Williams’s mother grew up in Bogalusa in central Louisiana, a hotbed of KKK activity during the civil rights era. His great uncles were part of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, an armed Black self-defense group that was founded in the town. “Growing up, I’d see them work on cars and tend to chickens in the yard,” he remembered. “They just looked like men in overalls. I never thought about them as defenders of anything. “It painted this picture for me that people who fight for things don’t necessarily look a certain way. They don’t necessarily get the credit. No sign or marker. Sometimes you’ve just gotta fight for what’s right and go back to raising your family.” Williams was born in New Orleans but moved to Atlanta for much of his youth. He would return to the city in summers and hear stories from his cousins, living in New Orleans’s lower ninth ward, of police brutality and unfair arrests. He returned to New Orleans for college, and upon graduation quickly became a star of the criminal defense world and later the city council president. His unexpected victory in the 2020 DA’s race shook the city’s establishment, but he has since faced criticism on both sides of the political aisle. On the right, he has taken significant blame for rising violent crime rates, which began a year before he assumed office, but continued into 2021 when the city’s murder tally rose to 218, the highest since Hurricane Katrina. His office has also been under fire for charging delays, which have led to higher rates of jail release for violent crime suspects. On the left, both his rhetorical and policy response to the crime wave has been seen as a reversal of a number of campaign pledges. Earlier this year, Williams introduced bail bond scheduling, despite pledging progressive reforms to how the office handled cash bail – another major driver of mass incarceration. Following a spate of carjackings, Williams’ office has moved to prosecute carjackings as armed robberies meaning longer prison terms. And despite pledging to never prosecute juveniles as adults, Williams indicted two – 15-year-olds for second-degree murder in adult court, following a brutal shooting in the city. It was, he said in a recent interview, one of the hardest decisions he has had to make in office. In the same exchange, Williams reiterated his pledge never to use the habitual offender statute again, and maintained his longstanding criticism of his predecessor’s use of it. But, he added: “When you talk about violent crime, when I ran, I didn’t run as a prison abolitionist. There are some people that need jail time. And the jail time should be the appropriate number to hold that person accountable for the harm they cause.” Pointing to his critics on the right who have attempted to associate his tenure with a rise in violent crime, Williams said: “They would rather blame a reform minded DA who wanted to make the office more fair. If I took office and I was doing everything the same way as my predecessors I still think there’d be a bit of a double standard. “I think there are certain folks who are uncomfortable with the fact that the chief prosecutor in a southern state is a dark brown man.” On a bright Sunday morning in spring Maurice Lewis sat in church, his head bent in prayer and his right arm lifted to the heavens. He had come to worship at the Next Generation Original Morning Star, in a congregation made up mostly of formerly incarcerated people. It was his first Sunday service since release. Pastor Tyrone Smith led the worshippers in a rendition of Amazing Grace. It soared to the rafters and had the congregation swaying in time. It reminded Lewis of his mother again. The hymn had been played at her funeral, which he could not attend. Pastor Smith, himself formerly incarcerated, is co-director of the First 72+, a non-profit organization that assists people with re-entry. Lewis had received some assistance from the group, but even now, four months after release, he was struggling to navigate the complex bureaucracy to regain some of the documentation he required to claim income assistance or apply for jobs. There is little to no state assistance for those leaving prison in Louisiana, meaning non-profits like the First 72+ and individual family members shoulder much of the burden assisting those who re-enter society. “As a country we fail with the whole criminal legal system,” said Jené O’Keefe Trigg, the civil rights division’s director of partnerships and development. “We just completely rip families apart and lock them away from their homes and their families, and then don’t give them anything to come home to. It’s just such an utter failure, that means we have to do more on the back end.” At the end of last year the division secured a $1m federal grant to assess and bolster re-entry services in the city. “I think we [the prosecutor’s office] have a moral obligation to ensure that New Orleans has as robust of a re-entry landscape as possible because we are rectifying these cases and bringing more people home.” Lewis has tried to remain optimistic ever since his release and drew strength from the hour of church. He aspired to work in a local hospital, a cleaning job perhaps, anywhere surrounded by people, where he could contribute. “What the man up above did for me, he got that life sentence off me,” he said. “I just want to press on. Put it to the side. If I don’t take it and put it to the side, I’m going back to somewhere I don’t want to go.” “He’s the reason I’m out here now. He sees me. I’m not invisible.” Additional reporting by Katie Jane Fernelius",News/US news,Life in prison for stealing $20: how The Division is taking apart brutal criminal sentences,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/06/life-in-prison-for-stealing-20-how-the-division-is-taking-apart-brutal-criminal-sentences

Less edifyingly, the band head off to play in apartheid-era South Africa. PH Sorry to Bother You, 10pm, BBC Three This off-the-deep-end satire from political rapper turned film-maker Boots Riley heads for the surreal uplands beloved of Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman. LaKeith Stanfield brings his stoner charm to Cassius (AKA Cash), a poor Oakland resident who finds he is a natural at telemarketing, mainly due to the “white voice” he is encouraged to use on callers. However, his friends, including radical artist girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson), worry he is compromising his morals for money. Riley takes a hardline with the inequities of capitalism – along with sideswipes at Black stereotyping and art world posturing – but it’s done with a playfulness and keen eye for the unexpected. Simon Wardell The Personal History of David Copperfield, 9.20pm, Channel 4 It’s a bit of a task fitting Dickens’s semi-autobiographical novel into two hours but Armando Iannucci has managed it in most excellent fashion. Dev Patel (the colourblind casting is a masterstroke) plays David, who goes from much-loved son to abused orphan to naive, lovelorn youth, forever surrounded by eccentric characters who fuel his imagination and, ultimately, his writing. Shot in an off-kilter style that echoes Lewis Carroll, it’s a very funny film, with a top-notch cast from Tilda Swinton’s donkey-obsessed Betsey Trotwood to Peter Capaldi’s pathetic Mr Micawber. SW Mindhorn, 12.10am, BBC One If an actor can be elected president, why can’t a 1980s TV cop solve a murder on the Isle of Man? In Sean Foley’s smart Britcom, Julian Barratt stars as the self-absorbed Richard Thorncroft, who found fame as Jason King-style Detective Mindhorn but is now, 25 years on, reduced to doing sock adverts. However, when the main suspect in a woman’s killing demands to speak to Mindhorn, Thorncroft sees a chance to disinter his career … oh, and help the police prevent more deaths, of course. Comically retro action with a high gag count from the cream of UK comic talent. SW Women’s Challenge Cup Rugby: St Helens v Leeds Rhinos 11.30am, BBC Two. The final at Elland Road.
