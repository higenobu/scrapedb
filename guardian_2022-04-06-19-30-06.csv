4/6/2022,"A previously unheard recording by Paul McCartney of his song Attention, later recorded by Ringo Starr, is going up for auction this month. The demo recording by McCartney was given to saxophonist Howie Casey, to reference ahead of the recording session for Starr’s 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses. Casey’s wife Sheila would also perform backing vocals on the finished version of Attention, alongside Linda McCartney. Casey is now selling the tape (without the song’s copyright) at Merseyside’s Omega Auctions, with an estimated price of £10,000. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: “To hear [McCartney] unaccompanied working through the bones of a song like this is really fascinating and it does give an insight into his startling talent for songwriting.” In November 2021, Omega Auctions sold George Harrison’s three-bedroom childhood home in the Speke suburb of Liverpool for £160,000. It was the site of numerous rehearsals for the Beatles in the band’s infancy. McCartney’s childhood home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool, will be opened up to unsigned musicians, it was announced this week. The National Trust, which has managed the property since 1992, is inviting aspiring acts to record sessions at the house, where songs including Love Me Do and I Saw Her Standing There were written and rehearsed. McCartney’s brother Mike and music writer Pete Paphides will select the artists. McCartney is approaching his 80th birthday in June, and will headline the Glastonbury festival that month. He also begins a US tour later this month.",Arts/Music,Attention please!

4/6/2022,"Good morning. The United States and its allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine as the west makes a fresh attempt to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described the atrocities in his country as “war crimes” while Ukraine authorities said more than 4,400 incidents were being investigated. “Russia will be responsible for Bucha in The Hague,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said in a statement. The White House said sanctions to be unveiled today were in part a response to what has happened in Bucha. The measures, coordinated between Washington, G7 economies and the European Union, will target Russian banks and officials and ban new investment in Russia. What did Zelenskiy tell the UN security council? The president gave a vivid eyewitness account of what he had seen in Bucha, a town near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. “They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children,” he said unsparingly. What did he ask the UN to do? He called for Nuremberg-style trials – given Russia can veto any effort by the security council to prosecute Putin for war crimes, there may not be much hope of that. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 42 of the Russian invasion. It was Back to the Future at the White House. Starring Barack Obama as Marty McFly and Joe Biden as Doc Brown, writes David Smith. And ignoring Donald Trump as Biff Tannen, a four-year rupture in the space-time continuum. Obama returned to the White House on Tuesday for the first time since the bleak winter morning in January 2017 when he departed it alongside Trump, who seemed intent on erasing the first Black president. Like a star pupil going back to his old school, proud and shiny with career accomplishments, the 44th US president was greeted by gushing staff probably too polite to mention his ever-greying hair. He was hosted in the Oval Office by the protege who happens to be 19-years his senior. They had lunch, just like they used to when Obama was in charge and Biden was vice-president. “We weren’t sure who was supposed to sit where,” the 46th president said later with a grin. What did Obama say? After jokingly calling Biden “vice-president”, he talked about what had changed in the White House: “Coming back – even if I have to wear a tie, which I very rarely do these days – gives me a chance to visit with some of the incredible people who serve this White House and who serve this country every single day, a lot of times out of the limelight.” Staff at more than 50 Amazon warehouses have contacted the organizers of last week’s historic vote establishing Amazon’s first union, expressing interest in setting up unions of their own. “The revolution is here,” said Chris Smalls, who helped coordinate the triumphant campaign at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York. In a win that shocked labor organizers and observers, Smalls and his co-organizer, Derrick Palmers, succeeded where many other attempts had failed, winning a staff-wide vote to establish the union by 2,654 to 2,131. The union is a first for Amazon, which is the second largest employer in the US and fought hard to prevent the result. The company launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to stop their efforts, which began in March 2020 when Smalls led a walkout at a Staten Island warehouse over pandemic working conditions. He was laid off the same day. Amazon alleged that Smalls violated quarantine requirements; Smalls says he was dismissed as retaliation for his protest. What did Smalls say? “The workers that I organize with are like my family now. To bring this victory to them is the best feeling in the world next to my kids’ birth.” Ivanka Trump testified before the January 6 committee yesterday, making her the first of Trump’s children known to speak to the committee. “She came in on her own and did not have to be subpoenaed,” Bennie Thompson, the committee’s chairman said. Bobby Rydell, who enjoyed numerous US hits during the teen pop craze of the early 1960s, has died aged 79. He suffered complications from pneumonia, and died in hospital in his native Philadelphia. US Capitol police have apprehended an “aggressive” suspect accused of attacking Ami Bera, a congressman from California, and others. The alleged assailant: an unusually bold fox. “I expect to get attacked if I go on Fox News; I don’t expect to get attacked by a fox,” Bera said. The Covid-19 outbreak in Shanghai remains “extremely grim” with the continuing lockdown of China’s financial powerhouse threatening to devastate the country’s economy and “tear apart” already very stretched global supply chains. Attacks against the press in Mexico have increased by 85% since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office, making it the most deadly period for journalists since records began, according to a report. The total wealth of the world’s billionaires has dipped from a record high last year amid a drop in global stock markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite the planet’s richest people still holding a combined $12.7tn (£9.7tn) in assets. According to the annual Forbes magazine ranking of the world richest people, the number of billionaires worldwide fell by 329 to 2,668, with the total value of their combined assets falling slightly from $13.1tn on the 2021 list. In Charles Daniels’ modest home in Somerville, Massachusetts, lie tens of thousands of undeveloped photos, sitting in molting canisters scrawled with cryptic markings. Most have been sitting there for over five decades, and while Daniels can’t be sure of everything that’s hidden in his trove, he knows for sure that much of it chronicles a pivotal moment in pop culture – when rock acts as impactful as the Who, the Faces, and Jimi Hendrix made their first mark in America. The fossil fuel industry and its influence over policy was the major elephant in the room looming over the release of the third and final report, out this week, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading climate authority. The major source of contention: how do you talk about mitigating climate change without confronting the fossil fuel industry? “It’s like Star Wars without Darth Vader,” says environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, of Brown University. Archival footage has been found of the singer Prince at a teachers’ strike in 1970 when he was 11. The video was discovered by WCCO, a CBS News affiliate in Minnesota, and shows film of an April 1970 teachers’ strike. While watching the footage, production manager Matt Liddy noticed a reporter interviewing children, and was particularly struck by one child. “I immediately just went out to the newsroom and started showing people, and saying, ‘I’m not gonna tell you who I think this is, but who do you think this is?’ And every single person [said]: Prince,” said Liddy.

4/6/2022,"Microplastic pollution has been discovered lodged deep in the lungs of living people for the first time. The particles were found in almost all the samples analysed. The scientists said microplastic pollution was now ubiquitous across the planet, making human exposure unavoidable and meaning “there is an increasing concern regarding the hazards” to health. Samples were taken from tissue removed from 13 patients undergoing surgery and microplastics were found in 11 cases. The most common particles were polypropylene, used in plastic packaging and pipes, and PET, used in bottles. Two previous studies had found microplastics at similarly high rates in lung tissue taken during autopsies. People were already known to breathe the tiny particles in, as well as consuming them via food and water. Workers exposed to high levels of microplastics are also known to have developed disease. Microplastics were detected in human blood for the first time in March, showing the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs. The impact on health is as yet unknown. But researchers are concerned as microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and air pollution particles are already known to enter the body and cause millions of early deaths a year. “We did not expect to find the highest number of particles in the lower regions of the lungs, or particles of the sizes we found,” said Laura Sadofsky at Hull York medical school in the UK, senior author of the study. “It is surprising as the airways are smaller in the lower parts of the lungs and we would have expected particles of these sizes to be filtered out or trapped before getting this deep.” “This data provides an important advance in the field of air pollution, microplastics and human health,” she said. The information could be used to create realistic conditions for laboratory experiments to determine health impacts. The research, which has been accepted for publication by the journal Science of the Total Environment, used samples of healthy lung tissue from next to the surgery targets. It analysed particles down to 0.003mm in size and used spectroscopy to identify the type of plastic. It also used control samples to account for the level of background contamination. A 2021 study in Brazil on autopsy samples found microplastics in 13 of the 20 people analysed, whose average age was higher than those assessed by Sadofsky’s study. Polyethylene, used in plastic bags, was one of the most common particles. The researchers concluded: “Deleterious health outcomes may be related to … these contaminants in the respiratory system following inhalation.” A US study of lung cancer patients in 1998 found both plastic and plant fibres (such as cotton) in more than 100 samples. In cancerous tissue, 97% of samples contained the fibres and in non-cancerous samples, 83% were contaminated. Huge amounts of plastic waste are dumped in the environment, and microplastics now contaminate the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. Microplastics have been found in the placentas of pregnant women, and in pregnant rats they pass rapidly through the lungs into the hearts, brains and other organs of the foetuses. A recent review assessed cancer risk and concluded: “More detailed research on how micro- and nanoplastics affect the structures and processes of the human body, and whether and how they can transform cells and induce carcinogenesis, is urgently needed, particularly in light of the exponential increase in plastic production.”",News/Environment,Microplastics found deep in lungs of living people for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/microplastics-found-deep-in-lungs-of-living-people-for-first-time
4/6/2022,"The Irish writer and artist Sara Baume is still best known for her 2015 debut, Spill Simmer Falter Wither; Seven Steeples, her third novel, is a glacially beautiful book. I am almost certain it’s a ghost story, but it’s a novel that gives up its secrets warily. Bell and Sigh are a couple who leave the city with their dogs to rent a cottage by the sea and withdraw steadily from their lives, seeking to live in an atmosphere of continuous temporariness. I couldn’t help but think of the ring of bells and the sound of sighs as stock motifs of ghost stories the world over. But I believe this novel will mean profoundly different things to different readers, because its own presiding spirit is surely Elizabeth Bishop, who worked so carefully at keeping feeling unspoken under the surface of her poetry, only revealing the heart through the physical world: she understood that emotion would shine out through detail, through specific, close observation. As if in tribute, Baume offers up an astonishing prose poem that keeps close religiously and lovingly to the physical throughout. Bell, the female character, has a habit of “touching things to draw blessedness out of them”, and this is absolutely what Baume is doing throughout. In the paraphernalia of a life, its coffee grinds and washing lines, love and meaning are hiding – because all the meaning in our lives happens around these things, our little days, so where else would it end up secreted? From time to time, the reader is teased with a glimpse of some possible catastrophe that might have prompted the couple’s retreat from the world – a mouse dies “of trauma”; Bell and Sigh see “a solid mass the size of a premature foetus” on the beach, and mistake a thistle growing by their house for a child “ten times a day” (the novel aches with the absence of children). They love looking at maps online because on the internet they can “go back in time”, which feels like the revelation of a deeply felt wish. But the revelation never quite comes, in a way that is haunting and dreamlike and wonderful to read. What is shared instead is a record of two people who “had imagined, in the beginning, that if everything they owned was old and shoddy, even ugly, certainly nearing the end of its useful life, then they would better be able to bear its loss”. Their project, of course, eventually fails – they fall in love with these ugly, shoddy, temporary things, because they are their lives. In the meantime, though, Baume catalogues the accrual of dirt, broken things and insect bites – one way of totting up a life. Her novel powerfully recalls the middle act of Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, that heart-stoppingly moving depiction of time passing through an empty house, of loss accumulating. At the novel’s end, Baume finally sends her protagonists up the mountain they live on, a climb they’ve been meaning to get round to for seven years. Looking back at their house with them, I felt I was given a revelation of what had been going on all this time – but what I saw will be very different from how the story looks in the eyes of others. That is the magic and the brilliance of this haunting, fathomlessly sad book.  Seven Steeples by Sara Baume is published by Tramp Press (£11.99).

4/6/2022,"Vermont police have launched an investigation into hazing allegations surrounding the women’s rugby team at Norwich University in the state, including allegations of branding and waterboarding. Police have executed search warrants and went to a residence hall at the private military academy in Northfield to collect evidence, the Barre Montpelier Times Argus reported. According to a police affidavit, officer Karie Tucker of Northfield police spoke to an alleged victim who reported that she had been “branded” using pliers and a lighter by other members of the rugby team. In Tucker’s affidavit, the victim reported that she was too intoxicated to refuse and would have not agreed to be branded had she been sober. Tucker also found a Snapchat video on a phone in which the victim in question was holding a chair down and another girl sat in the chair with a cloth held over her face as a third woman poured liquid on to the cloth. According to court records, Tucker said she would describe what she saw as “waterboarding”. In a statement to the Times Argus last Friday, the Northfield police chief, John Helfant, confirmed that the police activity on campus was related to hazing allegations that involved “branding and waterboarding of and by NU students”. He also revealed that school officials refused to allow police access to students in their dormitories and instead only allowed police to speak with students in a conference hall, marking a departure from a previous verbal agreement that the police department and the school since Helfant has been chief, he said. And according to emails obtained by the Times Argus, the school had decided – before the hazing allegations – that it will not provide body-camera footage and other investigative material from its security personnel to police without a subpoena.",News/US news,Police investigate hazing allegations of women’s rugby team at Vermont college,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/womens-rugby-team-hazing-allegations-vermont-college
4/6/2022,"Late March’s balmy sunshine turned to sleet and snow last week, a sure sign that the English county cricket season is about to start. Another is the thunk of The Cricketers’ Who’s Who hitting the doormat. The annual tome of player profiles, stats and anecdotes pored over by fans and players alike is now on its 43rd edition. The book provides a “unique insight” into the minds of those who will grace the grounds up and down the country for the next six months, from St Lawrence to Sedbergh, Edgbaston to Aigburth. More than 400 (nearly but not quite all) players who make up the 18-county system, as well as all the contracted women’s players, have answered questions ranging from the thorny (“Which bowler would you least like to face?” Answer: invariably Darren Stevens) to the deep (“What gives you joy?”) and the downright disconcerting (“What’s the strangest object to be found in your house?”). The foreword this year comes from Tim Murtagh (his guilty pleasure? bubble baths), about to embark on his 23rd season around the county traps. “When I first went into a professional dressing room there was always a Cricketers’ Who’s Who in someone’s locker,” writes Murtagh. “There’s a lot of time to talk during matches, and we’d often play ‘guess the cricketer’: “This guy’s 40 years old, he averages 24 with the ball, his highest score is 74 not out and his lookalike is Frank Lampard. Who is he?” Or we’d open it just to see who’s had the dodgiest haircut or to read out some of the amusing comments.” Murtagh joins an esteemed rollcall of names who have written an introduction to the book. His fellow stalwart Stevens confessed to owning every copy of CWW since he turned professional in 1997, likewise Marcus Trescothick mentioned in the 2017 foreword that he had used the “iconic” book as a vital dossier in which to look up his opponents over the years. Katherine Brunt wrote movingly in the 2020 edition about her experiences of coming out: “You shouldn’t have to live your life behind closed doors because you are ashamed of who you are.” Among the profiles and statistics can be found essays and think-pieces on the issues of the day. The 2020 edition also contains a piece on wicketkeeping by the writer William Fiennes that is just about the finest love letter to cricket you could wish to read. Then again, Alastair Cook does mention in the 2013 foreword that CWW has been a key source for Graeme Swann’s sledges and dressing room “bants” over the years, so maybe it does have some things to answer for. Since 2016 CWW has been overseen by editor Benj Moorhead. He describes the process as: “Basically a case of consistent/artful nagging of media managers in the hope that they’ll sting the players into action. Continually shaking the apple tree until all the fruit has fallen, [although] it rarely does.” Back in 1980 the Conservative MP Iain Sproat had the same problem when he compiled and edited the first edition of CWW, although there were no media managers around then to do his bidding. Sproat was a man of many passions; he organised the translation of Alexander Pushkin’s complete works into English and wrote an in-depth study of PG Wodehouse. In 1983 Sproat also committed what Tam Dalyell described as “one of the most spectacular political boobs of all time” by leaving his Aberdeen South seat for a supposedly safer constituency, which he lost. The move was disastrous for Sproat, pushing him into the political wilderness for the next nine years, but did at least mean he could concentrate on CWW. In an early preface he thanked a “Mr Bill Smith FRPS” for personally taking nearly all the photographs. Murtagh and his Middlesex teammates would no doubt have a chuckle at the assortment of perms, combovers and luxuriously meaty sideburns on offer in the early 1980s editions. Those early volumes contain things that the modern world, cricketing or otherwise, would blanch at now. Not only are players’ heights listed (as they are in current editions) but weight too; some of the less lissom no doubt rounding down their stats before sending them to Sproat. Marital status, qualifications and parents names are all dutifully listed. As are “second jobs”. The professional contracts at the time not stretching to 12 months, all but the most well-off or successful players had to find winter employment. Jonathan Agnew proudly displays his status as a “Lorry driver for SBA (Asbestos), Leicester” and Kim Barnett his time as a bank clerk. There are insurance salesmen, builders, farmers, teachers, waiters, Harrods stock-takers, plasterers and even a gravedigger. You wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out that Mike Hendrick put his long seamer’s fingers to candlestick making come November (close … he did in fact work for the electricity board). Incredibly, most players even listed their personal address and landline number, in case, say, a fan in the shires wanted to ring up their county captain and enquire as to why they weren’t picking their frontline spinner. Yet despite this, and the anachronistic sponsors of the day’s big tournaments – John Player, Benson & Hedges (don’t mention KP Nuts) some aspects of the county game seem destined to remain the same. “As I travel the country I come across an older generation who assure me the game isn’t what it was,” wrote Botham in 1981, a few months before he went on to make that summer his own. The all-rounder touches on the impact of limited-overs cricket, the need to look at the structure of county cricket as well as pay, and the pros and cons of overseas players. He also writes that there “is a case for arguing we play too many matches” that could result in a “real danger of players not enjoying their role”. Familiar feelings for the county game more than 40 years later, then. As the game’s professionals embark on another domestic summer, plenty will have a copy of CWW in their kitbag. To them it will be a familiar source of information and laughs, intentional or not. To others the book will provide heart and soul and colour to the black and white names on the scorecard. Over the years, players used to fill in forms for each other with predictable results – local libraries must have forever been running low on the Kama Sutra if the answers to “What’s your favourite book?” were to be taken seriously. Scott Borthwick you ask? He’s a fan of The Girl on the Train, though he didn’t think the film adaptation was up to much. Dom Sibley lists The Alchemist by Paul Coelho as his favourite, a book that was written in just two weeks. It would be unfair to suggest that’s about the same length of time it takes Sibley to scratch his way to 28, wouldn’t it? Flicking through CWW you do find the odd gem – Stuart Broad claims he often dreams in French. No doubt recent slumbers have seen him as Robespierre enacting a Terror on Sir Andrew Strauss and the selectors. The Warwickshire bowler Olly Stone proudly states that his grandfather invented the Twix chocolate bar, while Jimmy Anderson, England’s highest ever Test wicket-taker, brags that he can peel a potato in 2.4 seconds. There’s room for poignancy, too. Asked how to go about dismissing Steve Smith, Jack Leach responds simply: “Keep my foot behind the line.” Or try to keep a dry eye upon reading which animal Mason Crane would choose to be: “A tortoise, because they are always home.”  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

4/6/2022,"Diego Maradona’s infamous “Hand of God” goal made footballing history and cemented the legendary status of the Argentinian superstar. Now the shirt he wore when he scored that goal in the 1986 World Cup championships is estimated to sell for at least £4m. Maradona’s number 10 shirt has been owned for the past 35 years by the former England midfielder Steve Hodge, after the two players swapped shirts at the end of the quarter-final between Argentina and England. Argentina won the match 2-1 after Maradona, then 25, scored both the notorious Hand of God and a second legendary goal, later named Goal of the Century. Argentina went on to win the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. The Hand of God was hugely controversial. Hodge kicked the ball towards England’s goalkeeper, Peter Shilton. Both Maradona and Shilton leapt to reach the ball, which touched Maradona’s left hand before landing in the back of the net. Although handballs are against football rules, the referee did not have a clear view of the encounter between Maradona and the ball. He allowed the goal, and the linesman confirmed the decision. After the game, the Argentina player said the goal was made “a little with the head of Maradona, and a little with the hand of God”, a phrase which became part of footballing history. Later Maradona, who died in November 2020, admitted the goal was scored with his hand, although he later claimed to have been misquoted. His second goal came after Maradona dribbled past and danced around England players before scoring. It was named Goal of the Century in a 2002 poll of 340,000 fans in 150 countries. Hodge said Maradona’s shirt had “deep cultural meaning to the football world, the people of Argentina, and the people of England”. He added: “It was an absolute privilege to have played against one of the greatest and most magnificent football players of all time.” Brahm Wachter, head of streetwear and modern collectibles at Sotheby’s, which is auctioning the shirt, said: “The Hand of God is truly a singular moment not only in the history of sports, but in the history of the 20th century. “The moment resonated far beyond the world of football, coming soon after the Falklands conflict, and has in turn inspired books, films, and documentaries. “Maradona is now remembered as one of the greatest to ever play the game of football – and this particular game is an instrumental part of his legacy.” Online bidding for Maradona’s Hand of God shirt will be open from 20 April until 4 May. The shirt will be on public display at Sotheby’s New Bond Street gallery.",Sport/Football,Maradona’s shirt from ‘Hand of God’ England match estimated to sell for £4m,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/maradonas-shirt-from-hand-of-god-england-match-estimated-to-sell-for-4m
4/6/2022,"Idon’t remember the first time I realized that I was different from my white classmates. I don’t even remember the first time I understood what race was. But I remember the first time I was made to hate myself for being Black. I was 10 years old when I was called the N-word for the first time. We had been dismissed from class for the day, so I went to grab my backpack from my assigned cubby in the corner of my elementary school classroom. Before I could throw it over my shoulders, my classmate had made the announcement. “Look everyone, it’s Tigger the [N-word].” I was the only Black girl in the room, so I immediately knew that he was talking about me. If that wasn’t obvious enough, he made sure to clarify by staring and pointing at me while he said it. The shock from the blow didn’t allow me to fully process what happened. All I could think to do was to question whether I had heard him correctly. When he said it again, he made sure to remove any doubt. One incident, one word: that’s all it took for me to realize that I was considered the “other”. My innocence and naive childlike hope was gone as I was thrusted into a position of subordination. My school district in Carmel, Indiana, is home to some of the best public schools in the US – it is where I received my education from the age of five until graduation. Other than the less than 4% of Black students in the district, the schools are made up of white hallways, white teachers and white students. Historically, lighter-skinned Black people were given privileges by white people. As a light-skinned Black woman, I wasn’t given these in Carmel. From the moment my classmate called me the N-word, I was constantly bullied for my Blackness. The self-hatred that followed was slowly sown into my identity. When students and sometimes teachers made fun of my “exciting” puff ponytail, I got braids. When I got braids, they said I looked like Whoopi Goldberg. When I finally resigned myself to perming my hair in order to make it straight like theirs, the teasing still did not cease. I quickly realized Carmel wasn’t a place for people like me to prosper. They made sure we knew it too. You could be as smart as Albert Einstein and as charismatic as Denzel Washington and it wouldn’t matter. Every time I stepped into a classroom, I carried the extra burden of knowing that I’d have to go above and beyond. In middle school, I had to work 10 times harder than my white classmates to get the basic acknowledgment they got for far less. Sometimes, I try to convince myself that if my white classmates and teachers were educated on the true history of this country, then maybe my experience wouldn’t have been what it was. Maybe administrators would see how their choice to dish out a year-long suspension to a Black student for drugs while not punishing the white student (who was caught with more drugs) parallels the “war on drugs” in America. Maybe they would see that adding extra security near the area dubbed “the Black Spot” mimics profiling and over-policing across the country. My 16-year sentence in the school system ended in 2016, when I earned my diploma. After the world was forced to grapple with a reckoning on race and policing in 2020, Carmel now claims that they are ready to change, but I can tell nothing has changed. As I scroll through social media, I look in disgust, but not shock, at the use of “[N-word] this” and “[N-word] that” in comments made. But instead of tackling this very real racial abuse, teachers, administrators and parents are more afraid of the bogeyman in the corner: critical race theory. White parents and families across the country are panicked by the idea of students being critical of the United States’ dark history – especially lessons that center the egregious actions of white people over time. The aim of critical race theory is to contextualize the history behind the racism and systemic oppression that we see today. But the parents of Carmel don’t want their students to be taught about anything that may make their children feel guilty for their whiteness. The school would rather cater to white comfort than address America’s skeletons. I never got a say in learning about Black trauma: it was an expectation. At a young age, images of slaves with whip scars on their backs and the horrors of the backlash against the civil rights movement were already burned in my mind. White students get a say in whether they want to learn about their history. I did not. Throughout my entire education, I sat silent while teachers sugarcoated white history. I vividly remember sitting in class while my teacher glorified the actions of white people: how brave they were for freeing the slaves, how kind they were for giving Black people rights, and how trusting they were when letting Japanese people out of internment camps. Parents are also to blame for their failure to teach their children about racism. Their refusal to educate their children sends the message that they are fine with the way society has been functioning. Through their willful ignorance, they are breeding a future generation of people who won’t change the dominant culture, because they believe that everything is sunshine and rainbows. The parents and administrators of Carmel are giving themselves a pat on the back for doing the bare minimum – for finally intervening in the racist culture they allowed to run rampant. All of a sudden the school claims to care about all students. Their newfound concern involves more training for teachers and administrators, a revision to policies and the hiring of a diversity, equity and inclusion officer to make school more equitable and inclusive. It shouldn’t have taken George Floyd being murdered to start thinking about the treatment of students that look like me. If George Floyd had not died, Carmel would have continued on in their perfect utopia with their eyes shut and their ears plugged – completely indifferent to the trauma occurring around them. I refuse to believe that Carmel is ready to change. Their new diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives reek of performative progressiveness used to ease white guilt.

4/6/2022,"Tatiana Huezo’s film, adapted from the 2012 novel by Jennifer Clement, was Mexico’s official submission for the Oscars: a complex, subtle, tender and heart-rending story of a young girl’s upbringing in a village menaced by the drug cartels and people traffickers. Ana (Ana Cristina Ordóñez González) is a kid whose careworn mum Rita (Mayra Batalla) tells her to cut her hair short and pretend to be a boy – because the gangsters like to take young girls away for reasons she needn’t explain. One girl nearby has already been taken away, her parents gone, too, and her abandoned home is eerily empty, with toys and clothes strewn all over the floor. Rita even shows Ana the shallow grave with branches over it in the back yard she has to hide in if the worst happens and these rapists show up: a disquieting sequence that is almost like a voodoo fake funeral scene, to ward off the unthinkable. Ana’s friend Paula (Camila Gaal) has to cut her hair, too, but their other friend María (Blanca Itzel Pérez) doesn’t, because her hare-lip means that she is spared the violent misogyny. As the years go by, these almost telepathically close friends grow to be teens, now played by different actors: Marya Membreño, Alejandra Camacho and Giselle Barrera Sánchez, becoming adults with the same cares and the same learned wary silence as their parents. But now Ana has a crush on María’s brother Margarito (Julián Guzmán Girón) who has a low-level job with the drug-runners. In this society, teachers are adored by the kids but mistrusted by parents for the way the pupils are encouraged to nurture hopes and dreams and self-expression that their elders, tragically, see chiefly as dangerous. Meanwhile, the federal government sends helicopters to spray poison over the poppy fields in which these people work, often harming the children. There is a sickening image of people at risk from vast forces over which they have no control, attacking them from overhead like capricious gods.

4/6/2022,"A highly toxic rat poison is killing increasing numbers of birds of prey, figures show, as wildlife campaigners call for its use to be banned outdoors. Most recently, a white-tailed eagle was found poisoned by the anticoagulant brodifacoum on an estate in Dorset. Police closed the investigation into the eagle death last week with no charges issued. But this rare bird was not alone. New data from the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme shows that from 2005 to 2019, the number of dead birds of prey found where the main poison in their body was brodifacoum was in single figures each year. This changed in 2020, when 23 were found, rising from four in 2019. Twenty-five were found in the first half of 2021. Brodifacoum is a potent anticoagulant that causes animals that ingest it to bleed internally, often for days, before dying. Experts monitoring the white-tailed eagle that died in January believe, due to its movements monitored by a satellite tag, that it suffered for days before it perished. Prior to 2016, the poison’s use outside was banned, and it was only sanctioned for use indoors, for example in food storage areas, barns and homes. Now, it can be used outside, near buildings, and gamekeepers and landowners are cautioned to remove dead rodents in areas the poison has been applied so predators do not eat them. Unlike some other poisons, users do not get put on a register. The EU recommends it is only used in buildings, or, in severe circumstances, around them. The rapid rise in deaths, which began four years after the rules were relaxed, has led bird-crime investigators to believe that those who wish to kill birds of prey have cottoned on to its potent impact. “Lots of the chemicals which were around which were the most common poisons which were used to kill birds of prey were banned in recent years, and the stockpiles of these were running low,” said Mark Thomas, head of investigations at the RSPB. He added: “Products including Ficam W, which would kill stuff instantly, were being abused to kill birds of prey. When the use of this and other poisons were restricted. It then meant that the commonest things people were using to kill birds of prey were banned or the stockpiles of them were running out. “We suspect that somebody somewhere has worked out – when the government went out and trained people how to not kill birds of prey on estates perhaps – that this would be an effective way to kill birds of prey.” He believes it “took the bad people a bit of time to realise the impact this newly legalised poison would have on killing birds, and you can see the results now.” Natural England has been contacted for comment over whether its “training sessions” for gamekeepers could have inadvertently taught them how to use the poison to kill birds of prey. A map of where dead birds with brodifacoum in their organs have been found shows that they have been poisoned in North Dorset, where there are many shooting estates, and around the North Yorkshire moors, another popular place for shooting. There have been very few incidents elsewhere in the country. Historically birds of prey have been shot and poisoned by gamekeepers because they are thought to disrupt shoots by flying overhead and scattering the quarry, as well as occasionally eating the small birds intended for shooting. The white-tailed eagle became extinct in the UK in the 19th century, with persecution cited as a leading factor in its demise. The large predator has now been re-introduced to the Isle of Mull in Scotland and the Isle of Wight in England. Even if the poison is not used intentionally to kill the eagles, and other birds of prey including red kites, buzzards and hen harriers, it is known to bioaccumulate in the food chain and cause great harm, as the small rodents the poison is intended for are also the prey of these birds. It is thought that widespread use of this poison could put the reintroduction of the eagles “in jeopardy”. Dr Tim Mackrill from the Roy Dennis Foundation, the team that released the white tailed eagles, said: “There is a growing body of evidence that the use of Brodifacoum presents a very serious threat to white-tailed eagles and other birds of prey, because it is highly lethal and can bioaccumulate in the food chain. White-tailed eagles are particularly at risk because carrion often forms a significant part of the diet, meaning that eagles will readily pick up poisoned rats. “We believe that brodifacoum and other highly toxic anticoagulant rodenticides should be banned for use in external settings because their environmental risk is simply too great. Failure to do so could jeopardise the success of the reintroduction of white-tailed eagles to England, and threaten other birds of prey such as red kites.” A government spokesperson did not answer as to whether there were plans to tighten the regulations around brodifacoum. They said: “Current product authorisations restrict the use of SGARs [certain rodenticides] in open-areas to farmers, gamekeepers and other trained professionals and only when other integrated pest management approaches fail to control rodent populations. Some SGARs, including brodifacoum, can only be used in sewers and in and around buildings. “Natural England in partnership with HSE are investigating the circumstances surrounding the recent incident.”",News/Environment,Toxic rat poison killing growing number of England’s birds of prey,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/toxic-rat-poison-killing-growing-number-england-birds-of-prey
4/6/2022,"The man seeking a high court challenge against federal intervention in New South Wales Liberal preselections has been expelled from the party. In an escalation of the NSW Liberal factional stoush, Matthew Camenzuli has asked the high court to prevent Scott Morrison’s hand-picked candidates from receiving Liberal endorsement on ballot papers pending the urgent case. Camenzuli on Wednesday sought leave to appeal against the NSW court of appeal’s decision to uphold the federal party’s intervention, which allowed a three-person panel, including Morrison, to select 13 candidates for the May election. Camenzuli, a businessman and member of the NSW Liberals’ state executive, had argued the constitution required plebiscites of the members to be held. On Wednesday the NSW state director, Chris Stone, used his special campaign powers to expel Camenzuli, based on Stone’s determination that his actions were damaging the party’s chances at the imminent election. The action will need to be confirmed by the state executive when it meets on Friday night. “He’s actively trying to stop us from nominating 12 candidates in seats,” one source said, in reference to Camenzuli. A spokesperson for the NSW division said the party did not comment on internal matters and Camenzuli did not return calls. Camenzuli sent an email to all members of the party on Tuesday explaining the reasons why he was taking legal action, saying he was seeking to enforce members’ rights. “I wouldn’t have thought taking legal action against the party was grounds for suspension,” one party member said. Lots of people have done that and not had any repercussions.” In Camenzuli’s application, seen by Guardian Australia, the businessman seeks a speedy hearing, warning of the “imminence of the issue of the writs” which will formally start the 2022 election campaign and allow party officers to write to the Australian Electoral Commission nominating endorsed candidates. Camenzuli’s lawyers note the case is “of considerable public importance in that its answer has the potential to affect who is endorsed as Liberal Party candidates” and therefore the constitution of the parliament. Camenzuli is seeking orders to prevent Liberal officials from requesting that the AEC print the Liberal party name beside candidates his case alleges have not been properly endorsed because of the federal intervention. His case has sought to challenge the decision of the federal party to allow a special committee consisting of Morrison, NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and Christine McDiven to select candidates in seats with vacancies. The committee intervened in March after factional brawling within the NSW Liberal party stalled the usual preselection processes, leaving the party without candidates in several important seats. That modified preselection process was used to re-endorse Morrison’s factional ally and immigration minister Alex Hawke, environment minister Sussan Ley, and Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman. On Saturday Morrison announced nine more candidates, including lawyers Jenny Ware in the seat of Hughes and Katherine Deves in Warringah, and businesswoman Maria Kovacic in Parramatta – a target seat held by Labor on a margin of just 3.5%. The prime minister said his agenda was “ensuring we put the best candidates in the field to ensure that our government could put the best foot forward”. Camenzuli’s case argues that the court of appeal erred in both its central findings: that the internal party dispute was not one courts could rule on, and the federal takeover of preselections was allowed by the Liberal party rules. He requested special leave to appeal to the high court, on the basis it needs to resolve “the multiplicity of inconsistent decisions by lower courts” about whether courts can decide internal party disputes. Camenzuli’s lawyers argued that candidates are not only “endorsed” once party officials nominate them in communications to the AEC, but rather once the usual preselection process are followed.",News/Australia news, NSW Liberal member seeking to challenge federal intervention in high court expelled from party,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/nsw-liberal-seeking-to-challenge-federal-intervention-in-high-court-expelled-from-party
4/6/2022,"One of the proudest boasts in any realm of the performing arts in Soviet times, be it acting, music, ballet or comedy, is the accolade of “Narodny Artist” or “People’s Artist”. Imbued with a sense of duty and service, it’s a title that has far more significance and gravitas that “Academy Award winner” or “Hollywood star”. It also contains a linguistic contradiction – because when you say “people”, which people are you talking about? In Soviet times, a blurring of distinctions of nationality and identity was encouraged, using the ubiquity of the (enforced) state language – Russian – to paper over the cracks. But now many Soviet-era “narodny” artists want to claim a very different and definite identity. Ada Rogovtseva is one of these hallowed stars: People’s Artist of the Soviet Republic of Ukraine (1967) and People’s Artist of the USSR (1978). Born in Hlukhiv, in what was the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1937 and a cherished fixture of film and television, these are just two of her many awards: her Russian-language Wikipedia page lists 17 quasi-militaristic decorations under her name. Her status is a reflection of her dozens of prominent theatre roles from 1959 onwards and appearances in more than 100 film and TV productions. Perhaps her most famous role is Maria in Hail, Mary!, a 1970 Soviet drama set in 1919 during the civil war, about a Soviet revolutionary who later goes on to work in an intelligence school. A fan site explains the appeal of her performances: “The screen heroines she plays are soulful, proud women who are, at heart, aristocratic.” (“Aristocratic” here means “haughty” or “self-possessed”.) Had things worked out differently, on 18 March Rogovtseva would have had an opening night on stage with a play in Kharkhiv. Instead, she is at home in Kyiv. She lists her activities as “being there for people who need food or somewhere to have a wash – or for anyone who needs a hug”. One of the actors she was due to appear alongside in the play has been killed. Her grandson and son-in-law are on the frontline. Her daughter is working in a volunteer centre. Speaking recently to Variety, she added her name to the list of Ukrainian film industry stars who are calling for a boycott of Russian culture: “I consider the screening of Russian films at festivals now completely unacceptable. This country sows death.” Also on the list: Lubomir Hosejko, critic and author of History of Ukrainian Cinema; Sergey Bukovsky, director of Spell Your Name (executive-produced by Steven Spielberg) and Mykhailo Ilenko, actor and director. These industry figures have left Ukraine, but Rogovtseva refuses to go. Three weeks ago she was interviewed by CurrentTimeTV, a Russian-language channel based in Prague and linked to Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, and explained why she won’t speak Russian publicly ever again: “It is on principle. I am from a Russian-speaking family. I worked in Russian theatre. I have worked a lot in Russia. But when your land and your family are attacked, you do not want to use the language of the people who are responsible for what is happening on your land.” She added: “Putin is not human. People cannot think like that, act like that. It is diabolical. Ukrainians are being treated as enemies, as wild animals. I don’t understand how a person can destroy others simply because of their own imaginings which have no bearing on reality.” This is symbolic of the choices around identity and allegiance that will have to be made by many in the world of art and culture. A Russian troll website listing “enemies and traitors” includes figures such as the novelist Boris Akunin and singer Boris Grebenschikov. The Russian ballerina Olga Smirnova has defected from the Bolshoi to the National Ballet in Amsterdam. Opera singer Anna Netrebko and conductor Valery Gergiev have faced cultural boycotts. In the TV interview Rogovtseva was asked whether she had contacted the Russian co-stars she has worked with to tell them what is happening in Ukraine. “It’s impossible,” she replied. “No one returns my calls. It doesn’t matter what you say to them, they’re zombified. They have decided we are animals.” It’s hard to understand the mental gymnastics that will be required here. Are Russian viewers supposed to “forget” the stars of stage and screen they have loved for decades, often performers they feel they know intimately? Rogovsteva’s impact on three generations of viewers is huge. Her best-known roles include The Taming of the Fire (1972), a film about the Soviet space industry based on actual events. She played Natalia Bashkirtseva, the wife of a rocket scientist. Her portrayal of “a woman in love with a genius” was so moving that the real-life cosmonaut Georgy Shonin, a contemporary of Gagarin, famously said of her: “When you are up in space, you think of a woman like her, a heroine, and your soul feels lighter.” Rogovtseva became a household name with the TV show Eternal Call. It ran for 10 years from 1973 and traced the 20th-century fate of the Savelyevs, a family from Siberia. She played Anna Kaftanova and had to be talked into the role: she had just given birth and ended up bringing her daughter, Katya, on set with her. Over the next 40 years Rogovtseva worked continuously on stage and screen, making at least one film every year, latterly more in Ukrainian than in Russian. In one year (2008), she appeared in 11 films. And she is far from retirement. In 2020, she played a grandmother in the Ukrainian TV series Early Swallows and in 2021 she appeared as a former opera singer in the miniseries Draw Me My Momther. Now it’s impossible to know when or whether she will act again. She quoted the Ukrainian poet Lesya Ukrainka: “‘A cloud moves freely across the sky, slowly, and we are free.’ But there is nothing free about the sky above us now.”",Arts/Film,"‘Ukrainians are being treated as enemies, as wild animals’ – film star Ada Rogovtseva",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/06/ukrainians-are-being-treated-as-enemies-as-wild-animals-film-star-ada-rogovtseva
4/6/2022,"Michael Towke, the man who Scott Morrison beat to become the MP for the Sydney seat of Cook 15 years ago, claims a serving federal cabinet minister has encouraged him to speak out about his alleged bad experiences with the now prime minister. Towke intitially won preselection for Cook in 2007 before it was overturned, paving the way for Morrison’s elevation to parliament. Morrison has denied allegations he warned after the Cronulla riots that a Lebanese Australian could not win Cook. He has also denied raising a false rumour in 2007 that Towke was a Muslim. The allegations were “completely untrue”, Morrison said on Sunday. The prime minister said he could not reject the allegations “more fundamentally [or] more soundly”. In an extraordinary claim likely to further destabilise Morrison as he prepares to call an election within days, Towke said on Wednesday that a current cabinet minister had contacted him to express support since he had spoken out about the prime minister’s alleged past behaviour. “I’ve got text messages from a cabinet minister telling me ‘I believe you’ and do what you need to do, just be careful,” Towke told Network Ten’s The Project on Wednesday night. Towke would not reveal the identity of the minister but said it was someone “more aligned” with Morrison and that people would be surprised by their identity. “This person is a minister of the crown, this person I’ve never had contact with before, this person sent me a text message, and it’s like, ‘Hey, Michael, this is XYZ – obviously in confidence along those lines – just want you to know I believe you, do what you feel you need to do, just be careful’,” Towke said. “That is pretty sound advice.” When asked by host Waleed Aly what he needed to be careful about, Towke said that he had been separately told by respected Canberra journalists that “people associated” with Morrison were backgrounding against him attempting to link him to neo-Nazi groups. “Similar to 2007, there is desperation here, and they will go to any lengths to try and deal with that,” Towke said. “People associated with the prime minister were circulating or were trying to get a story going that I was associated with neo-Nazis. That some of my supporters are neo-Nazis and then by definition, I was a beneficiary, or a friend, or an associate or whatever word you want to use to throw that tar and feathers so it sticks – I’m a neo-Nazi. They’ve gone from one extreme to the other.” Towke said it was possible that Morrison was not aware of this and it was just “the hacks in his office who are doing this”. He also said it was possible that Morrison was “wilfully ignorant”. “Maybe they know he is going to love what they are doing, maybe not, maybe he would sack them, I doubt it.” When asked if it was possible Morrison had changed his views in the past 15 years, Towke said the prime minister at the time of the Cook preselection was “desperate”. “It suited him to play the race card, I guess when you get to parliament and become the prime minister you are not an operative any more,” he said. “You’ve got the seat you want, you may not have to sort of lower yourself down to those tactics. “I’m not saying he’s a racist. I don’t know him well enough. But he has certainly used racism, Islamophobia, bigotry, with refugees, and families of dead refugees with migration policies, and is being dumped on by his own side.” Towke said he no longer had any interest in becoming an MP and if offered a seat would turn it down. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Towke on Wednesday repeated his previous allegation that Morrison had been at the centre of attempts to have him disendorsed in 2007 and that he had been told by multiple people Morrison had raised concerns about his Lebanese heritage in light of the Cronulla riots. He claimed he shifted his votes behind Morrison in the final ballot because there had been a “political gun to my head” to withdraw from the contest. “They figuratively put a political gun to my head and basically told me they were going to ruin me, I’d never be employable ever again if I didn’t withdraw from the preselection and throw my votes in behind Morrison,” he said. “That’s what I did.” In an earlier interview on Ten News, Towke said that the immigration minister, Alex Hawke – whom he described as the “ultimate faceless man” – had been his “handler” and had counselled him on how to get branch members signed on in batches. “When I did it for them multiple times, it was a branch recruiting, but when I did it and had the audacity to do it for myself, it became branch stacking because you can’t have a Lebo in a safe seat,” Towke said on Wednesday. Allies of Morrison have come out in defence of their besieged leader, saying the personal attacks were unwarranted. “The recent political pile on the prime minister could not be further from the reality of the leader I have worked closely with at the cabinet table, at party discussions or socially,” the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said. “The prime minister has displayed determination under pressure, a willingness to listen and a focus on getting the right outcomes for Australians.” Ley was one of the three incumbent Liberal MPs that was spared by Morrison’s actions from a preselection challenge from within the factionally divided NSW division of the party, along with Morrison’s close ally, Hawke, and moderate Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman. As part of the turmoil, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells lost her winnable position on the NSW Senate ticket in a preselection ballot, leading her to deliver a parting spray in parliament about Morrison’s character. Fierravanti-Wells labelled Morrison an “autocrat [and] a bully who has no moral compass”, saying he had destroyed the Liberal party and was not fit to be prime minister. She also raised the issue of Towke’s preselection in 2007, refering to allegations that Morrison had made racist comments about the Lebanese Christian’s heritage, including suggestions he may be perceived as a Muslim. But Fierravanti-Wells’s speech unleashed further internal attacks and another bout of instability within the party, with Catherine Cusack, a NSW Liberal excoriating the prime minister over flood relief. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, seized on the divisions, saying the Liberal party’s “entire focus is on themselves”. “They are not dealing with the challenges of how our economy goes forward, they are not dealing with issues like the aged care crisis.” Albanese said the prime minister’s claim that he had needed to intervene in the NSW division in order to protect women in his party was “demonstrably not true”. “That is why so many people in the prime minister’s own inner circle – people who know him well – have all come to a common view that he cannot be trusted,” Albanese said.",News/Australia news,Michael Towke claims cabinet minister texted ‘I believe you’ following allegations against Scott Morrison,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/michael-towke-claims-cabinet-minister-texted-i-believe-you-following-allegations-against-scott-morrison
