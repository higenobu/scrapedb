3/15/2022,"A Pinecrest man died after being hit by a boat propeller during a Florida Keys fishing tournament Saturday afternoon. Juan Carlos Escotet Alviarez, 31, jumped in the water to save his fianc√©e ‚Äî who fell from the stern of the 60-foot vessel on which they were fishing for sailfish about six miles east of Ocean Reef Club in north Key Largo, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Immediately upon entering the water, Escotet Alviarez was hit by the propeller and died from his injuries, the FWC said in an accident report the agency released Sunday evening. Escotet Alviarez and his fianc√©e, Andrea Montero, 30, were anglers in a fishing tournament organized by Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive gated community in north Key Largo. The boat was moving backwards, according to the FWC, indicating anglers were fighting a game fish when the tragedy happened. Montero managed to stay clear of the propellers and was not seriously injured, said Officer Jason Rafter, an FWC spokesman. She did hit her head, however, but it‚Äôs not clear if that was while falling or when the boat‚Äôs crew pulled her back in using a flotation ring they threw her. South Florida experienced high winds and high seas over the weekend, making the rescue difficult for the crew. ‚ÄúRough as it was, she couldn‚Äôt say whether it was when she went over or coming back in. She doesn‚Äôt remember when it happened,‚Äù Rafter said. Montero could not be reached for comment. Ocean Reef made international headlines a week earlier after 356 Haitian migrants arrived about 200 yards off its oceanfront property in a large wooden boat ‚Äî one of the largest migrant events in South Florida in recent memory. According to Venezuelan newspaper, El Nacional, Escotet Alviarez is the son of billionaire Juan Carlos Escotet Rodriguez, president of Venezuelan bank Banesco and Spanish bank Abanca. Escotet Alviarez was director of Banesco USA, the U.S. division of Banesco, according to the company‚Äôs website. The company has not released any statement on the incident. The company also did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Escotet Alviarez‚Äôs family could not be reached. The bank‚Äôs website says Escotet Alviarez has ‚Äúvast experience in real estate development in the Miami area.‚Äù He graduated from the University of Miami. Escotet and Alviarez were scheduled to get married in November, according to news reports. The investigation into the incident is ongoing ‚Äî meaning details into exactly what happened could be months away. However, anglers and fishing professionals will tell you that a fun day on the water can turn tragic in an instant. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm backing down on a fish and someone falls in while the boat is going backwards, there is a real possibility that they are going to end up in the propeller,‚Äù said Larry Wren, captain of First Choice Charters, a fishing boat based in Islamorada. Wren compared it to driving a car in reverse at a slow speed with someone sitting on the trunk. ‚ÄúIf you fall off, you‚Äôre under the vehicle,‚Äù Wren said. The size of the boat, built by Spencer Yachts, also means that the propeller was as large as 36 inches in diameter and likely razor sharp. Wren noted that anyone coming into contact with its blades is not likely to survive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tragedy, but it can happen any day. It‚Äôs the same as a marlin jumping into the boat and spearing someone. It happens,‚Äù he said.",U.S./Miami Herald,"Boat propeller kills man trying to save fallen fianc√©e during Keys fishing tournament, FWC says",https://news.yahoo.com/boat-propeller-kills-man-during-013323049.html

3/15/2022,"By Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Sunday at the start of the session, extending last week's decline, as a U.S. official said Russia was showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations over Ukraine. Brent crude futures fell $1.82, or 1.6%, to $110.85 a barrel by 6:47 p.m. ET (2247 GMT). WTI crude futures fell $2.41, or 2.2%, to $106.92 a barrel. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has roiled energy markets globally. Brent last week was down 4.8% after hitting $139.13 on March 7. U.S. crude recorded a weekly drop of 5.7% after touching a high of $130.50 on March 7. Both contracts last touched those price peaks in 2008. [O/R] Investors have been concerned about a tighter oil market following Russia's action. Prices fell last week as traders assessed potential improvements to the supply outlook that has been disrupted by the Ukraine crisis. Russia is showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations over Ukraine, even as Moscow is intent on ""destroying"" its neighbor, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday. Russia-Ukraine talks are not taking place right now but will continue on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Sunday by the RIA news agency. Peskov made the comments after Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukraine and Russia were actively conducting talks on Sunday. Russia said on Sunday it was counting on China to help it withstand the economic blow from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

3/15/2022,"Ukrainian soldiers shout 'God Save the Queen!' when using UK-made weapons, per The Sunday Times. The UK sent Ukraine 3,615 NLAW anti-tank missiles, which proved effective destroying Russian tanks. Per the Sunday Times, Volodymyr Zelensky praised the weapons in calls with Boris Johnson. ""God save the Queen!"" is shouted by Ukrainian soldiers when they fire weaponry given to the country by the UK, according to The Sunday Times of London, which cited an anecdote told by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It's one of several lighthearted details reported by the paper describing calls between Zelenskyy and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which they bonded over the UK sending weapons to defend against Russia. As of March 9 the UK had sent 3,615 anti-tank weapons known as NLAWs ‚Äî next-generation light anti-tank weapons ‚Äî to assist Ukraine, according to Sky News. Journalists from MailOnline ‚Äî a British publication ‚Äî were also greeted with ""God Save the Queen!"" during a reporting trip to a base where Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to use NLAWs, according to one of MailOnline's own reports. Per The Sunday Times, in a recent call, Zelenskyy serenaded the UK prime minister with two songs adapted to play on the similar sound of NLAW to ""in love"" when pronounced in Ukrainian, which sometimes voices a W sound as a V. They were ""All You Need is N-Love,"" based on The Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love,"" and another played on ""When You're Young and In Love"" by The Marvelettes, the paper said. NLAWs are shoulder-mounted weapons capable of firing a single 150mm high-explosive anti-tank missile up to 2,600 feet. They are built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by the French company Thales, and have been highly praised in Ukraine's defense. They've enabled many of the tank ambushes that have slowed Russia's invasion. A video published by Sky News on February 26 showed the aftermath of a Ukrainian attack, where a soldier carried an NLAW not far from the smoldering ruins of tanks on a highway. ‚ÄîSky News (@SkyNews) February 26, 2022 James Cleverly, a minister in the UK foreign office and a former soldier, was among many in the UK to celebrate the contributions of the weapons, alongside other UK military donations. ""British desert uniform, British DPM waterproofs, British NLWs, Ukrainian spirit. A great combination.
