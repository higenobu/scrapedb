4/26/2022,"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc CEO Parag Agrawal would get an estimated $42 million if he were terminated within 12 months of a change in control at the social media company, according to research firm Equilar. On Monday billionaire Elon Musk struck a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion, ending its run as a public company since 2013. Musk in a securities filing on April 14 had said he did not have confidence in Twitter's management. Equilar's estimate includes a year’s worth of Agrawal's base salary plus accelerated vesting of all equity awards, an Equilar spokesperson said, based on Musk’s offering price of $54.20 per share and terms in the company's recent proxy statement. A Twitter representative declined to comment on Equilar's estimate. Agrawal, previously Twitter's chief technology officer, was named CEO in November. His total compensation for 2021 was $30.4 million, according to Twitter's proxy, largely in stock awards.

4/26/2022,"This might be the hottest housing market ever recorded. Over the past 12 months, U.S. home prices are up a staggering 19.2%. For comparison, in the years leading into the 2008 housing bust, the biggest 12-month jump was 14.5%. Heading into 2022, real estate research firms forecasted that the ongoing housing boom would lose some steam and home price growth would decelerate. It hasn't come to fruition—yet. Actually, if anything, this year it has gotten a bit hotter, with housing inventory on Zillow down 52% from pre-pandemic levels. That stubbornly hot housing market now has housing economists flirting with the real estate industry's most feared word: bubble. “We’re not in a housing bubble just yet—but we’re skating close to one if prices continue rising at the current pace,"" said George Ratiu, a housing economist at Realtor.com, in an article published last week on the home listing site. It isn't just Ratiu. There's a growing chorus of economists speculating that if home price growth doesn't abate soon, the housing market could eventually overheat. Or worse: We could wind up in another full-fledged housing bubble. Back in March, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas sent a shockwave through the industry after releasing a paper titled Real-Time Market Monitoring Finds Signs of Brewing U.S. Housing Bubble. The Dallas Fed researchers were blunt in their assessment: ""U.S. house prices are again becoming unhinged from fundamentals."" But even if we're in a housing bubble, the Dallas Fed researchers don't think it would be a 2008 repeat. For starters, homeowners are in much better shape now than they were heading into the 2008 meltdown. At the height of the 2000s housing bubble, U.S. households were spending 7.2% of disposable personal income on mortgage debt payments. As of the fourth quarter of 2021, that figure is just 3.8%. In addition, subprime mortgages are less of a worry these days, given the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act outlawed many of the shady loans that plagued the aughts. “There is no expectation that fallout from a housing correction would be comparable to the 2007–09 global financial crisis in terms of magnitude or macroeconomic gravity. Among other things, household balance sheets appear in better shape, and excessive borrowing doesn’t appear to be fueling the housing market boom,” write the Dallas Fed researchers. Historically speaking, U.S. homeowners are in a fairly strong financial position. But they aren't who economists are worried about. Instead, they're concerned about the next crop of homebuyers. Back in December, the typical American household would have to spend 24% of its monthly income to make a mortgage payment on the average-priced U.S. home, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider. At the latest reading this month, Black Knight's mortgage-payment-to-income ratio was now up to 31%—the highest reading since September 2007. (During the 2010s decade, that figure averaged 19.9%.) What's going on? The swift move up in mortgage rates over the past few months has dramatically increased mortgage payments for new borrowers. Back in December, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 3.11%. At that rate, a borrower would owe a $2,138 monthly principal and interest payment on a $500,000 mortgage. A borrower who took out that same mortgage at the current average rate (5.11%) would owe $2,718 per month. Over the course of the 30-year loan, that's an additional $208,800 in payments. Soaring mortgage rates could be a good thing. At least that's the message from Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire. He sees a housing market that needs to lose some steam. The spike in mortgage rates, he says, could result in home shoppers backing off a bit. There are some signs it is already starting to happen. If the housing market does slow, he says, it could allow inventory levels to rise and ultimately see us move into a market with lower levels of home price appreciation. Every single major real estate research firm with a publicly available forecast model projects that home prices will continue to climb over the coming year. Over the coming 12 months, Zillow predicts home prices are poised to spike 14.9%. CoreLogic forecasts a more modest 5% jump, while the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts prices will climb 4.8%. Industry insiders do say there's a chance the economic shock caused by soaring mortgage rates could see home prices drop in some regional housing markets. ""Some markets will see a correction if mortgage rates continue to rise, in which sales will drop and prices will follow,"" Realtor.com's Ratiu said in the home listing site's article, published on April 19. Where might prices drop? Ratiu points to Rust Belt markets like Toledo and Rochester, N.Y. While housing economists who have spoken to Fortune aren't predicting a housing correction or crash, they do see a market that's starting to reach concerning levels. Earlier this month, CoreLogic provided Fortune with its regional market risk assessment scores for around 400 metropolitan statistical areas. The real estate research firm aimed to find out whether local income levels could support regional home prices. The finding? CoreLogic now considers 65% of U.S. regional housing markets to be ""overvalued."" That ""overvalued"" label was placed on every metropolitan statistical area in Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Nevada.

4/26/2022,"Brutal earnings days may be the new norm for Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta (FB) as the social media giant deals with slowing growth, elevated expenses, and high expectations. ""I certainly think it's possible [it reports another bad quarter],"" Technalysis founder Bob O'Donnell said about Meta on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Meta will report its first quarter results on April 27 after the close of trading. O'Donnell, who noted that Big Tech earnings overall will likely be a ""mixed bag,"" said that “in the case of Meta, it will be an interesting story. There’s been a lot of challenges there. We’ll see how the advertising space plays out.” It's almost hard to imagine a darker day for Meta than Feb. 3, 2022, when shares crashed 26% after a very disappointing fourth quarter and outlook. The company reported that it added just 2 million monthly active users in the quarter after adding 15 million monthly active users in the previous quarter. Daily active users also fell by 1 million amid increased competition from TikTok. Overall, the company missed analysts' profit estimates by a whopping 14 cents. The resulting stock slide wiped away $251.3 billion in market value from Meta, marking the biggest one-day loss in value for any U.S. company ever. Thus far in 2022, Facebook has seen slowing growth and a $10 billion hit from privacy changes to Apple's iOS operating system. “I don’t see anything that’s necessarily magically corrected,” O’Donnell said. “So I certainly think there is a possibility we will continue to see those kinds of trends for Meta.” Shares of Meta have largely flat-lined since that report as Wall Street braces for another financial shoe to drop at the company. And two shoes arguably have already dropped in the past week, both from outside of Meta's walls. First, a shockingly lackluster quarter and outlook from fellow FAANG member Netflix called into question growth rates at large-cap tech companies. And then a tepid outlook from Snap due to advertising weakness raised questions about the health of the digital ad space. Pros think Meta's quarterly results could showcase similar themes. ""I think the expectations are going to be super low [on Meta],"" veteran tech analyst Mark Mahaney of EvercoreISI, who has a short-term negative rating on Meta, said on Yahoo Finance Live last week. ""I think we will see signs of brand advertising weakness out of Western Europe. I guess currency headwinds will be a bit of an issue."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

4/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Sri Lanka plunged, triggering a trading halt for the rest of the day, lasting barely 32 minutes after the market opened for the first time in two weeks. Most Read from Bloomberg New Texts Shed Light on Elon Musk’s 2018 Spat With Saudi Fund Anger in Japan as Ukraine Links Emperor Hirohito to Adolf Hitler Ukraine Latest: U.S. Vows to Step Up Weapons for Kyiv Ukraine Latest: Zelenskiy Says Top U.S. Officials to Visit Kyiv Stocks Tumble as China Lockdowns Rattle Investors: Markets Wrap Sri Lanka’s blue-chip index sank 12.6%, exceeding the 10% drop that resulted in an all-day suspension. Benchmark Colombo All-Share Index fell 6.7% as investors worry about the nation’s economic crisis. While trading in Sri Lanka was halted for the previous two weeks -- the first week due to a holiday and the second by the securities regulator -- the central bank hiked policy rates by a record, the government halted payments on foreign debt, while rating companies slashed the nation’s credit rating. Civil protests against the government over soaring food prices and fuel shortages intensified. “The market is reacting to the 700-basis point interest rate hike that happened after trading had stopped on April 8,” said Dimantha Mathew, who heads research at Colombo-based First Capital Holdings PLC. The markets regulator late Friday eased rules related to margin calls and forced- selling of securities citing difficulties faced by investors to service credit obtained from stock brokers. This however provided no respite as the sell-off stretched. “A lot of negatives are coming together,” said Mathew, who expects the selloff in the market could extend to Tuesday before seeing some stability over the next sessions. Prior to Monday’s fall, the Sri Lanka Colombo Stock Exchange All Share Index had erased almost a third of its value this year, after a world-beating rally of 80% in 2021. Sentiment still remains jittery as the government seeks up to $4 billion this year from international lenders to help ease shortages of food, fuel and medicines as its foreign reserves dry up. The Securities & Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka on April 16 abruptly ordered the stock exchange to be halted for a week, citing the need to give investors time to digest the country’s economic conditions. The order came after the exchange had been already been shut for a week for the traditional new year holidays, drawing sharp criticism from the financial industry. “Closures of this nature can dilute the confidence on the Colombo Stock Exchange, especially from foreign investors who might find this to be unpredictable,” said Naveed Majeed, senior vice president for research at Asia Securities Ltd. in Colombo. The prolonged shutdown, the longest since a seven-week halt during the peak of the pandemic in 2020, had left traders high and dry. At a time when the country is “desperate” for dollars, the closure had sent a negative signal and may lead foreign investors to put off their investments on liquidity concerns, said Suramya Ameresekera, analyst at JB Securities.

4/26/2022,"By Greg Roumeliotis NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk clinched a deal to buy Twitter Inc for $44 billion cash on Monday in a transaction that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders to the world's richest person. It is a seminal moment for the 16-year-old company that emerged as one of the world's most influential public squares and now faces a string of challenges. Musk has criticized Twitter's moderation, calling himself a free speech absolutist, said that Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets should be public and criticized giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise. Political conservatives hope that a Musk regime would mean less moderation and reinstatement of banned individuals including former President Donald Trump. Musk himself also has described user-friendly tweaks to the service, such as an edit button and defeating ""spam bots"" that send overwhelming amounts of unwanted tweets. Discussions over the deal, which last week appeared uncertain, accelerated over the weekend after Musk wooed Twitter shareholders with financing details of his offer. Under pressure, Twitter started negotiating with Musk to buy the company at the proposed $54.20 per share price. ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a statement. Twitter shares rose 5.7% on Monday to close at $51.70. The deal represents a near 40% premium to the closing price the day before Musk disclosed he had bought a more than 9% stake. GRAPHIC: Twitter's stock market value has lagged rivals https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnykyjpr/Pasted%20image%201650920557516.png Even so, the offer is below the $70 range where Twitter was trading last year. ""I think if the company were given enough time to transform, we would have made substantially more than what Musk is currently offering,"" said Jonathan Boyar, managing director at Boyar Value Group, which holds a stake in Twitter. However, he added, ""this transaction reinforces our belief that if the public markets do not properly value a company, an acquirer eventually will."" Musk’s move continues a tradition of billionaires buying control of influential media platforms that include Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of the New York Post in 1976 and the Wall Street Journal in 2007 and Jeff Bezos’ 2013 acquisition of the Washington Post. Twitter said Musk secured $25.5 billion of debt and margin loan financing and is providing a $21 billion equity commitment. Musk, who is worth $268 billion according to Forbes, has said he is not primarily concerned with the economics of Twitter. ""Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all,"" he said in a recent public talk. OUTSIZED IMPORTANCE Musk is chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc and aerospace company SpaceX, and it is not clear how he much time he will devote to Twitter. ""This is great news for Twitter shareholders as it doesn’t seem like the company was going to get things right anytime soon. Tesla shareholders can’t be happy that Musk will have to divert even more attention away from winning the EV (electric vehicle) race,"" Edward Moya, and analyst at currency broker OANDA, said in an email to clients. Still, Musk's 80 million-strong Twitter account is seen as an important, free public relations tool for Tesla. The Twitter transaction was approved by the board and is now subject to a shareholder vote. No regulatory hurdles are expected, analysts said. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said the company's board of directors had its back ""against the wall"" once Musk detailed his financing package and no other bidders or white knights emerged. It was not immediately clear what the breakup fee would be or who would run the new company. Twitter's outsized importance as a mouthpiece for politicians, political dissidents and activists belies its relatively small size. Although it is only about a tenth of the size of far larger social media platforms like Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook, it has been credited with helping spawn the Arab Spring uprising and accused of playing a role in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's U.S. Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech."" Trump, whose company is building a rival to Twitter called Truth Social, said he will not return to Twitter, according to a Fox News interview. The White House declined on Monday to comment on Musk's deal, but said that President Joe Biden has long been concerned about the power of social media platforms. ​ ""Our concerns are not new,"" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki, adding that the platforms need to be held accountable. ""The president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation.""

Crypto projects may burn tokens to reduce supply, which could lead to increased prices in the future as tokens become more scarce. While the community already burns tokens, the portal incentivizes the process for users. It allows users to send SHIB tokens to a dead wallet address and in exchange sends “burntSHIB” tokens to users.
