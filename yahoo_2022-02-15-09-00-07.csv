2/15/2022,"Donald Trump's accountants quit in the middle of preparing his and Melania's taxes after questioning 'discrepancies'. Mazars USA told The Trump Organization that it has halted its relationship with him, court papers say. The company is distancing itself from key evidence in a criminal probe into alleged financial fraud. Donald Trump's longtime accountants have suddenly severed all ties with the former president and his business — quitting even though they are in the midst of preparing his and Melania's tax returns. In a letter made public Monday by the New York Attorney General Letitia James, the accounting firm, Mazars USA, told The Trump Organization's top corporate lawyer it has stepped away from Trump and his business due to questions about the reliability of key company financial statements. News of Mazar USA's stunning move surfaced in papers filed Monday by James, as part of New York prosecutors' ongoing probe into possible banking, insurance and tax fraud on the part of Trump and his business. Since at least 2004, Mazars has prepared annual financial statements — so-called ""Statements of Financial Condition"" — containing detailed estimates of Trump's net worth. Trump has used these statements to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and insurance over the years. In court documents filed over the past two years, James has alleged that Trump has exaggerated his worth when trying to impress bankers, and downplayed his worth when seeking lower taxes. ""Last week, after review of [the AG office's] filings, Donald J. Trump's and the Trump Organization's former accounting firm informed the Trump Organization that the Statements of Financial Condition from 2011 through 2020 should no longer be relied upon,"" James wrote in papers filed Monday. James filed the papers in Manhattan Supreme Court, as part of a civil lawsuit seeking to compel Trump, his daughter Ivanka, and his son Donald, Jr., to comply with subpoenas from her office requiring their documents and testimony. As part of her filing, James included a copy of the letter Mazars sent to Alan Garten, chief legal officer of The Trump Organization. In the letter, Mazars' top attorney William J. Kelly tells Garten that after speaking with the AG's office, and after their own investigation, they realize the accountant firm can no longer represent the former president or his business. ""The Statements of Financial Condition for Donald J. Trump for the years ending June 30, 2011 - June 30, 2020 should no longer be relied upon,"" the letter read. ""We have come to this conclusion based, in part, upon the filings made by the New York Attorney General on January 18, 2022, our own investigation, and information received from internal and external sources,"" the letter continued. ""While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based upon the totality of the circumstances, we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate."" The Mazars' lawyer went on to say that continuing to do accounting work for The Trump Organization would be ""a non-waivable conflict of interest"" — suggesting that Mazars is weighing its own potential criminal liability. ""As a result, we are not able to provide any new work product to the Trump Organization,"" the letter continued, adding that the Trumps' tax returns are among the ""limited number"" that still remain to be filed. Garten did not immediately respond to a request for comment; neither did attorneys for Trump and Mazars.

New York City residents expressed shock and outrage on Sunday after an Asian woman was fatally stabbed by a man with a lengthy rap sheet, which included 27 charges from a single arrest last month.

The killing reportedly took place in the victim’s Chinatown apartment at 111 Chrystie St. in the wee hours of the morning, leaving neighbors terrorized and fearful for their own safety, reported the New York Post.

Christina Yuna Lee, 35, was found in her bathtub “bleeding from multiple wounds to her body,” according to New York police. A neighbor phoned 911 after hearing Lee scream for help.

“She was calling for help, screaming for help. I woke up to it. It was awful,” the neighbor told the New York Post. “‘Help me! Call 911’ – that’s exactly what she said over and over and over again.”

Surveillance video shows the suspect following Lee into her apartment moments before the gruesome attack. Responding officers recovered a bloody knife, which they believe to be from Lee’s own kitchen.

Officers from the 5th Precinct reportedly responded at around 4:35 a.m. They arrested 25-year-old Assamad Nash, who allegedly hid under the bed after trying to flee through the fire escape.
  UPDATE: 35YO victim is Korean American, just got out of cab. Suspect followed her up 6 flights of stairs. Neighbors heard screaming, called 911. Police found her w/ stab wounds throughout her body. Suspect is 25YO Assamad Nash. Homeless; arrested several times including assaults. https://t.co/f0zEt0GOxS pic.twitter.com/ovGpeEe6B3  — CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) February 13, 2022 


Nash, who is reportedly homeless, has three active cases and a history of multiple escapes from police custody. Just last month, he was charged with 27 counts of criminal mischief for damaging MetroCard machines, according to the New York Post.

Overall, the 25-year-old was reported to have at least seven arrests dating back to 2015, ABC7 New York reported. He is expected to be charged for Sunday’s incident today.

“So much blood. My wife said I should call someone to clean all the blood but I’m going to clean it up myself. It’s the least I can do for that poor girl,” said the building owner of Lee’s apartment, according to the New York Post.

Lee’s killing took place barely a month after Michelle Go was shoved into the path of an oncoming subway train in Manhattan. Since the onset of COVID-19, New York City has led the country in cases of violence against Asian Americans.

“It’s been two long years, and especially with the last couple of months with Omicron we’ve seen yet another spike in anti-Asian hate. Now, maybe this is a hate crime. Maybe this is not a hate crime. But it’s yet another Asian woman. Another Asian American was brutally attacked and killed in her own home. Think about that,” State Sen. John Liu said, according to amNewYork.

“So when the Asian American community is upset, and frustrated and downright angry, you know where it’s coming from. People do not feel safe, and part of this is that government at all levels need to pay more attention.”

Lee, who is Korean American, graduated from Rutgers University and served as a senior creative producer at digital music platform Splice, per The New York Times. She also worked on media campaigns for companies such as Equinox and Marriott International.

The mission of this administration is clear: We won’t let this violence go unchecked.”  Nash was also stabbed in the incident and taken to Bellevue hospital. As of this writing, it remains unclear whether the case will be investigated as a hate crime.  Featured Image via New York Police Department (left) and LinkedIn (right) Enjoy this content?

 Centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told reporters Monday that he would not support confirming another nominee to the Supreme Court right before the midterm elections and would prefer to wait until the country knows which party will control the Senate in 2023. Manchin told reporters that if another Supreme Court seat becomes vacant shortly before the Nov. 8 election, he would support holding off a vote on President Biden's nominee to see if Republicans win back control of the Senate. ""I'm not going to be hypocritical on that. If it comes a week or two weeks before like it did with our last Supreme Court nominee, I think that's a time it should go to the next election,"" he said. He's being consistent with the position he and other Democrats took in the fall of 2020 after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September of that year. Democrats insisted that then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wait until after the election to move a nominee so that the winner of the presidential contest could make the choice - the same position McConnell took in 2016 when he blocked President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from getting a Senate hearing or vote. Manchin was outspoken in opposing McConnell's plan to speed President Trump's third Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, through the Senate confirmation process before the 2020 presidential election. ""Rushing to confirm a Supreme Court nominee weeks before a presidential election has never been done before in the history of our nation and it will only fan the flames of division at a time when our country is deeply divided,"" he said at the time. ""I cannot support a process that risks further division of the American people at a time when we desperately need to come together. I will not vote to confirm Judge Coney Barrett or any Supreme Court nominee before Election Day on November 3rd. I urge my Republican friends to slow down, put people before politics, and give their constituents a chance to vote."" Moderate Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) joined Manchin in calling for Republicans to await the outcome of the election to let the winner pick Ginsburg's successor. Collins at the time cited the treatment of Garland in 2016 as the reason why she wanted to hit the pause button on Trump's nominee. ""When the Senate considers nominees to the United States Supreme Court, it is particularly important that we act fairly and consistently, using the same set of rules, no matter which political party is in power,"" she said in late October 2020. Murkowski voted against a motion to end debate on Barrett's nomination and advance her nomination. But she voted ""aye"" on the final confirmation vote. ""I voted no on the motion to proceed yesterday because I have stated on multiple occasions since 2016 I do not believe the Senate should take up a Supreme Court nomination this close to a presidential election,"" she said, explaining her ""no"" vote on the procedural motion.",Politics/The Hill,Manchin would oppose second Supreme Court nominee right before midterms,https://news.yahoo.com/manchin-oppose-second-supreme-court-222759129.html
