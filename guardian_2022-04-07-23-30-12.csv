4/7/2022,"If you have looked at Netflix over the past few days, there is an overwhelming chance that you will have been bashed over the head by a weird-looking Japanese documentary. No matter what your viewing history is – whether you prefer Bridgerton or Stranger Things, Breaking Bad or second world war documentaries – there it is. Floating in multicoloured bubble letters, devoid of any context whatsoever, is the title Old Enough. Which begs the question: what the hell is Old Enough? Unfortunately, the initial explanation is even more confusing than Netflix’s aggressive push. Old Enough is the wildly popular Japanese show Hajimete no Otsukai (My First Errand), an entertainment documentary show where toddlers are sent out into the world completely alone, to go shopping or navigate public transport. In Japan, Old Enough has been airing for 30 years, with two three-hour shows broadcast each year. When it airs, a fifth of all Japanese viewers tune in. It’s a true phenomenon. The length between episodes can be explained by the sheer level of preparation that goes into each task. All the errand routes are inspected by parents and production staff, to check for dangerous roads or “suspicious persons”. The children are chosen after a laborious selection process, the camera crew and safety team are given hiding places so the kids won’t spot them and all the local neighbours are informed of the task, so as not to freak out and call the police when they see a four-year-old wandering aimlessly through the streets. Part of the appeal, from what I can tell, is the show’s ability to instil confidence into the children. They’re all aged between three and six years old, and they’re almost always scared to death when they first set out. Rightly so, because walking a mile to a shop alone can be a terrifying prospect for a toddler. However, the big heartwarming punch that usually comes at the end is a newfound pride in their abilities. The kids had an adventure, and they weren’t helped, and they did it. So that’s what Old Enough is. Netflix’s aggressive stance on shoving it at the top of everyone’s homepage is harder to explain. The arrival of Old Enough was greeted with a flurry of press releases from the Japanese broadcaster Nippon, hailing a partnership with Netflix for 30 of its shows. Whether those shows – including Death Note, Your Turn to Kill and Life’s Punchline – will be given the same attention remains to be seen. Now for the big question: is Old Enough any good? The answer is a resounding “sort of”. The good news is that the Netflix versions are much shorter than the original programmes. These are all less than 20 minutes long, rather than three hours. It is a resoundingly sweet show. For the most part, you can’t help but root for the children. In the first episode, a very young boy walks to the supermarket to pick up three items, narrating his adventure to himself as he goes. Later on in the series, we see a young girl attempt an errand, only to rush back to her mother in tears after getting lost before overcoming her nerves and setting out again. It is an absolute rollercoaster of emotions that leaves you in tatters, and you suspect this is why it has such a dedicated following in Japan. That said, this is a very Japanese show, in terms of concept and execution. Japanese words continually pop up onscreen in cartoonish font, and each onscreen action is accompanied by what sounds like canned laughter or applause, which can be off-putting. Either way, if you think Old Enough is inescapable now, just wait. A British remake is apparently in the works.",Arts/Television & radio,Old Enough: the Japanese TV show that abandons toddlers on public transport,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/07/old-enough-the-japanese-tv-show-that-abandons-toddlers-on-public-transport
4/7/2022,"Huge, ancient magnolias are in full bloom in Ireland’s oldest garden, which surrounds Lismore Castle, in the Waterford countryside. Mauve aubretia crawls up stone walls, while stiff white daffodils and maroon fritillaries bow and curtsy to each other on the lawns. Edmund Spenser is said to have composed his epic poem The Faerie Queene in the gnarly yew walk in the late 16th century, though the magnolias were a Victorian addition, creating a glorious spring garden for successive dukes of Devonshire. It’s almost as if the 1922 creation of the Irish Free State never happened, except of course we, the general public, are only here because it did. The compulsory purchase of land from English landowners that followed it left Lismore with seven acres with which to support the upkeep of a whole heap of crumbling masonry. The response of the latest heirs, the Earl and Countess of Burlington, has been to rent out the castle over the summer, let the formal gardens run wild, and convert one of its derelict outbuildings into an art gallery, which has been operating as a not-for-profit enterprise since 2005. Its new summer show – girls girls girls – is a class act, both cheekily of the moment and locked in a whispered conversation with its historic surroundings. In the case of one painting, Genieve Figgis’s Upstairs Downstairs, the whisper becomes a shout. This is the only work that was personally selected by its (Irish) artist: it’s Downton Abbey meets the Mexican day of the dead, with ghoulish lords and ladies flanked by de-faced maidservants, in a travesty of one of those excruciating all-together photographs that were so beloved of Victorian aristocrats. The painting commands attention, striking a subversive note that feels a bit out of kilter until you turn around and find the discomfort staring back at you from the opposite wall, where a pair of black twins in neat blue frocks stand, looking away from each other, with their hands anxiously clasped. There’s no explanatory text, leaving curator Simone Rocha to explain the story behind Mozambique-born Cassi Namoda’s painting: these were real twins, who were born into slavery in the US and sold to a circus freak show. Rocha, a fashion designer who has created quite a thrill in her native Ireland, has used her licence as a charismatic art-world outsider to gather an impressively varied, international collection of work by female artists with an age span between them of nearly 90 years. The oldest is Louise Bourgeois, a longtime muse of Rocha, who would be 110 if she were still alive. The youngest is just 23. All were chosen for works that “inspire, challenge and engage with femininity and its subversive characteristics”. Some stare you down and others are more hidden, she says. “I wanted them to all speak to each other.” The tortures of fashion are never far away. A pink patterned blouse is embalmed in wax by the German Canadian artist Iris Haeussler. It looks as if it’s gasping for air. Ouch, I felt, as I reeled from Dorothy Cross’s 1994 cow-udder installation Stilettos – each pointed toe a shrivelled teat – to a surrealist photograph by Petra Collins of shoes so deforming that one big toe juts out like an old tree trunk. But if you lean too hard on overt connections, you might miss the delicate, Chagall-like whimsicality of Georgian artist Elene Chantladze, a one-off, whose paintings on stone and old cardboard sit in two vitrines. The baby of the show is the formidably talented Sian Costello, who works in Limerick and is yet to be snapped up by a gallery. Her three paintings titled Wishful Self-Portrait show a girl who could be a Velázquez infanta, or a model in one of Rocha’s puffy Victorian nightie-inspired gowns that were much in evidence over the launch weekend, but was inspired by Whistler’s women in white, says Costello. The images are smudgy, ambivalent, and one is missing her head, so that all that remains is the performance of her frock. These little girls punch above their weight. Twenty-six-year-old Sophie Barber exerts a different sort of authority, dominating the long gallery with a huge oil painting of two pink huts on stilts, mysteriously titled The Greatest Song a Songbird Ever Sang. Look sideways, and there are two sets of songbirds smooching in miniature. One is of actual birds (Barber, who grew up and still lives in Hastings, cites her birder father as a key influence). The other is of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. To give such a young artist such pole position is a bold and sisterly move, and in both scale and colour (there’s a lot of pink in the room so, hey, why not shout it loud?), it works. It’s not until you get to the two ante-rooms that the doyennes of the show appear. A series of Cindy Sherman’s crisply composed Bus Riders self-portraits sit at a right angle to a series of closeups of Roni Horn’s weather-battered face on a trip to Iceland. The lips of Polish Holocaust survivor Alina Szapocznikow are lit up in a ghoulish humanoid table lamp made from a lump of orange resin shortly before her premature death in 1973. Only then do we arrive at two pieces by Bourgeois, tucked away in their own little turret at the show’s farthest reach. Rocha says she chose 1968’s Janus in Leather Jacket because of its reference to clothing, but to the uninitiated eye, it dangles in mid-air like a fat turd that someone has tried to cover up with pages from a book. An untitled 1993 bronze cross of four clasped hands, with a little house at the end of one arm, points an ironic elbow at the relationship between women and home. The positioning makes you think as well as wait. The turret is both a life sentence and a fantasy: a constraining Bourgeois cell, and a perfect little tower-room in a fairytale castle, such as little girls dream of before they awake to the realities of life. Though girls girls girls is the main attraction, it’s not the only show in town. A kilometre along the road in an old methodist chapel, the American artist Matt Connors has installed four bright, abstract paintings which exactly replicate its windows but are placed upside down on the opposite wall. The installation is titled Invert, a nod to his struggles with his own sexuality and catholicism. At the right time of day, when the late afternoon sun slants through the stained glass, casting a brilliantly coloured net across the floor, you could stand here and bathe in the beauty of being out and proud. girls girls girls is at Lismore Castle Arts, Lismore, County Waterford, until 30 October",Arts/Art and design,girls girls girls review – Simone Rocha curates a dazzling display of art by women,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/07/girls-girls-girls-review-simone-rocha-curates-a-dazzling-display-of-art-by-women
4/7/2022,"Dmitry Yurin was at home on 16 March when a Russian bomb struck Mariupol’s drama theatre. His flat in Prospect Mira was a couple of hundred metres away, across a square with a fountain. The theatre had become a capacious air raid shelter. Hundreds of women and children were inside. “It was terrible, a massive blast, an enormous explosion. I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. “I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood.” Nearby a woman lay motionless on the ground. Family members were desperately attempting to resuscitate her, pressing on her chest. “They were trying to bring her back. There was a child standing next to her, saying: ‘Mum, don’t sleep.’ The woman was dead.” The exact number of people who perished in the Russian air strike is still unknown. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says 300 people were killed. Witnesses including Yurin confirm there were dozens of bodies. They say continuous Russian shelling made rescue work dangerous. Yurin said he went back to the garage where he had been sheltering with his mother, Nadezhda, lit a cigarette and swallowed some tablets. He decided he had to get out of Mariupol, which for two gruesome weeks Russian forces had attacked and besieged. The city was cut off from all directions. He came up with an extraordinary plan. Yurin decided he would swim to safety. A keen fisherman, he had spent hours on the Sea of Azov with his father catching a local mullet known as pelengas. He found his fishing waders, previously used for digging up worms. He took two rubbish bags to tie around his socks, some string, and four 5-litre plastic bottles, for use as buoyancy aids. Dressed in this improvised costume, Yurin said, he set off on foot towards the beach. It was early evening. He passed ruined blocks of flats. “There were a few people out looking for water. Someone asked me for cigarettes. Otherwise the city was deserted. I took a path I knew to the seafront. It was cold.” Yurin said he waded along the sand and then plunged in. He swam out 150 metres, parallel to the shore, and started heading west. The water was freezing. “My teeth were chattering. I hid behind one of the bottles so no-one could see me. Sometimes I rested on top of the float.” He swam for two and a half hours. The 2.5-mile route took him past the Russian position at Rybatske and to the village of Melekine, which before the war was a beach resort. He staggered out. He found an elderly couple who took him in, gave him a shot of vodka and a bowl of borsch. The village was under Russian control. With the help of a neighbour, Yurin managed to board a minivan heading for the port of Berdyansk, also occupied by Russian forces. He said the Russian soldiers on the checkpoint ignored him. “They were 17 or 18 years old,” he recalled. From Berdyansk he was able to cross into Ukraine-administered territory. Diana Berg, a Mariupol resident who escaped the city, said a family had taken a similar route to Yurin’s. “Since the beach was mined they had to walk in cold water for kilometres,” she posted on Facebook. Leaving by foot through Russian positions was now impossible. “They don’t let anyone in or out,” she wrote. She added: “The city is still blocked. Every day the Russians keep ruining it with all possible weapons – air strikes, rockets, artillery, mines, tanks. Only on Wednesday there were 118 air bombs. We thought the city was destroyed already. But now it is being even more heavily ruined.” The Ukrainian army and its allied Azov battalion controlled a shrinking area in the centre of Mariupol, she said. “Civilians are trying to survive this hell. This terror is beyond imagination,” she wrote, calling for a ceasefire and evacuation organised by the international community. The government in Kyiv has accused Moscow of kidnapping thousands of Mariupol residents, including children. They were forcibly taken from city hospital number four to Russia via neighbouring pro-Russian separatist controlled areas. Video on Thursday appeared to show soldiers deporting doctors and patients at gunpoint from a city hospital. The Mariupol city council says separatists are now trundling through the ruins in a white van, collecting bodies lying on the streets. These are being burned in a mobile crematorium. The aim, it says, is to avoid the embarrassing photos that came out of Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, showing executed and bound civilians. Residents of Mariupol were forcibly deported to the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. Armed men came to the city hospital and in an ultimatum said that doctors and patients should get out and get on the occupiers' vehicles. pic.twitter.com/O21Twv4NEO Another Mariupol resident, Vika Dubovitskaya, said she managed to flee with her two children – Artyom, six, and Nastiya, two – in a private car. They had been sheltering in the drama theatre when the building was obliterated. “It was quiet. Then there was an explosion. We had to run,” she said. “I put my daughter on my shoulders and grabbed my son’s hand. He told me: ‘I’m tired of running’. The blast threw me against the wall. I hurt one side of my face but didn’t notice. It was the adrenalin. My only thought was to get the kids out.” Speaking from the western city of Lviv, Dubovitskaya said 1,500 people had been living inside the theatre. She said she arrived on 5 March after gas, heat, water and power inside the city were all cut off. One of the actors, Damir Sukhov, showed her a place to say on the first floor. “We were living in the corridor between classical columns. There were thick walls,” she said. Other women and children were already sleeping in the auditorium, as well as in the makeup room and in two underground cellars. The stage area was warmer but more vulnerable, she said. For the first three days there was nothing to eat. “You feel guilty when you can’t feed your kids,” she said. Ukrainian soldiers then brought food including frozen fish, which was cooked outside the building on a wood fire. Only children were allowed to eat. Volunteers looted a shop and brought warm clothes, she said. Dubovitskaya said the Russians were aware the theatre was full of women and children. They had taken over the surrounding districts and had moved surreptitiously one night into a branch of the Pumb bank, 250 metres away. Ukraine’s armed forces had painted the word “children” in giant letters outside the theatre. Later she moved to the second floor and was in the projector room when the bomb fell. It was unclear how many people died or what happened to Sukhov, the actor, who had been organising the relief effort. She was reunited on 23 March with her husband, Dmitry, who had returned from Poland to look for her and found her in a red cross camp. “There were no communications in the city. I left my phone and rucksack behind when we ran out the theatre,” she said. “Dima [Dmitry] came to the school outside Mariupol where we were living. He saw our son first but didn’t recognise him because he had lost so much weight.” The family are now camping in a basement in Lviv with 25 other refugees. Yurin, meanwhile, said his mother, who worked as a cleaner in the offices of Mariupol’s Pryazovia Worker newspaper, managed to escape a few days after his epic Azov sea swim. She was now staying with her sister in Russian-occupied Berdyansk. “What the Russians did to the theatre was an act of terror,” he said. “They knew there were peaceful people inside. They killed hundreds. It was the same story when they bombed the maternity hospital.” “He continued: “I’m 31, of fighting age. If they had got hold of me I would have been tortured and taken prisoner.” He said: “Thank God I knew the shoreline around Mariupol so well. That saved me.”",News/World news,Escape from Mariupol: the man who swam to safety from Russian terror,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/ukraine-escape-from-mariupol-man-swam-eussian-terror
4/7/2022,"More than 1,500 book bans have been instituted in US school districts in the last nine months, a study has found, part of a rightwing censorship effort described as “unparalleled in its intensity”. PEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression in the US, scrutinized efforts to ban certain books from school libraries for its “Banned in the USA” report. The organization found that 1,145 books were targeted by rightwing politicians and activists, including the work of the Nobel prize laureate Toni Morrison. The report shows the striking impact of the ongoing effort by conservatives to censor literature in schools. The bans have largely targeted books which focus on race and LGBTQ issues, and a large number of the banned books are written by non-white or LGBTQ authors. PEN America tallied efforts between 1 July 2021 and 31 March this year, in what it said was the first “book by book, district by district account of what books are being banned, where in the country, and through what procedures”. It found that 1,586 bans were implemented in 86 school districts across 26 states. “This type of data has never been tallied and quite frankly the results are shocking,” said Jonathan Friedman, director of PEN America’s Free Expression and Education. “Challenges to books, specifically books by non-white male authors, are happening at the highest rates we’ve ever seen. What is happening in this country in terms of banning books in schools is unparalleled in its frequency, intensity and success.” The data confirms that was a specific theme to the book bans. Of the banned titles, 41% included “protagonists or prominent secondary characters” who were people of color, according to PEN America. About 22% of the banned books “directly address issues of race and racism”, while 33% “explicitly address LGBTQ+ themes, or have protagonists or prominent secondary characters who are LGBTQ+”. PEN America found that the three most frequently banned titles all are centered on LGBTQ+ individuals, “or touch on the topic of same-sex relationships”. Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe has been banned in 30 school districts, while All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M Johnson and Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison are also among the most targeted. Out of Darkness by Ashley Hope Pérez, a novel about a romance between a Black teenage boy and a Mexican American girl, has been banned in 16 districts, while the Bluest Eye, the story of a young Black girl’s experiences in 1940s America by Toni Morrison, has been banned in 12 districts. “This is an orchestrated attack on books whose subjects only recently gained a foothold on school library shelves and in classrooms,” Friedman said. “We are witnessing the erasure of topics that only recently represented progress toward inclusion.” The book censorship has been matched by a wave of rightwing legislation dictating what teachers can and cannot discuss in schools. In March Florida passed a bill dubbed “don’t say gay”, which forbids “instruction” on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Some states have also banned discussion of the modern-day impact of historical racism in the US – an issue which has become a hobby horse for Republicans at state and national level. The censorship has frequently been pushed by conservative groups linked to deep-pocketed rightwing donors. Groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education have been instrumental in book-banning attempts in the US, often presenting themselves as small, “grassroots” efforts, while in reality they have links to prominent, wealthy Republicans. There is, however, some evidence that the efforts to censor literature which focuses on race and LGBTQ issues are having the opposite effect. “Banned book clubs”, where children and young adults meet to read and discuss titles that have been censored by school districts, have sprung up across America, while sales of the book Maus, a Pulitzer prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust, soared in January after it was banned by a Tennessee school board.",News/US news,"‘Unparalleled in intensity’ – 1,500 book bans in US school districts.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/book-bans-pen-america-school-districts
4/7/2022,"It has taken until now for Mitsuko Uchida to lay down a recording of Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations. This colossal work, which grew out of a publisher’s request for one single variation on a fairly naff little tune, encapsulates so many of Beethoven’s contradictions – and Uchida, so adept at putting across music’s humour without diminishing its depth, is made for it. Her playing conveys a keen sense of the music’s absurdities without exaggerating its quirks, gently raising an eyebrow at Beethoven’s passages of deliberate heavy-footedness and revealing that there is always a sincere, profound truth right behind them. It’s not so much that her sudden changes of inflection turn the music itself around, more that she lets us see through things to what’s waiting behind. At the start, the theme bounces and bumbles along, with the downward scales at the end of each phrase jumping out at us just a little, as if the music is saying it might be up for a joke later. But in the first variation, by stressing each long chord slightly in a way that makes the music sound like it’s puffing up to the top of the keyboard, Uchida simultaneously introduces and skewers the pomposity that informs so many of the variations to come – something that dissolves, temporarily but instantly, in the delicacy of the next variation. And so it continues, with a constant thread tying the variations together through so many jack-knife changes of mood. Variation 20 sounds fascinating, all strangely modern-sounding harmonies in search of a melody; two variations later, Beethoven quotes the melody sung by Leporello in Mozart’s Don Giovanni grumbling about working night and day – was he getting fed up, or was he on a roll? – and the clarity and dexterity of Uchida’s playing here is a delight. Beethoven ends his variations, as he began, with a dance – but this delicately wrought yet expansive minuet is to that stomping little opening tune as a butterfly is to a caterpillar. In Uchida’s quietly poised hands it is at once the culmination of an entertainingly roundabout journey and the opening-up of a whole new vista. The Leonore Trio’s new recording for Hyperion is of music by Woldemar Bargiel, Clara Schumann’s younger half-brother. Here are two bafflingly neglected piano trios in gloriously vibrant performances. If you’ve ever wished there was more chamber music to discover by Brahms and Robert Schumann, this is a real treat.",Arts/Music,Diabelli Variations review | Erica Jeal's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/diabelli-variations-review-mitsuko-uchida-beethoven
4/7/2022,"At Easter, I am always in the mood for comfort baking. Madeira cake and custard, warm chocolate chip cookies, double chocolate sheet cake, oozing melted chocolate sandwiches. I make it festive with Easter spices, candied and sugared fruits, crushed up day-old hot cross buns and, of course, a little California twist. Easter sits at a time in spring when we are still waiting for strawberries to come, forced rhubarb is on the way out, outdoor rhubarb just coming in. But we have oranges, other candied citrus fruits and spices to use up. We give them a different treatment than in winter and pair them with fresh cheeses, such as ricotta, and maybe leave out the stronger cloves and darker sugars. A little orange brightens up cookies, cakes and custard making them fresh for spring. I began sugaring fruits and flowers when I started making wedding cakes more than 20 years ago. Then, I was focused on delicate rose petals, raspberries, the odd bay leaf, keeping it minimal. Now, I Iove whole fruits that look top heavy and sculptural, like Italian and French fruits made out of marble, suspended in their glittering, sugared glory. Some of the recipes take more than a day from start to finish, and some take less than an hour, so whatever your level of ambition, there is something here for you and your Easter table. These are my favourite chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever made. The base recipe has my signature use of egg yolks for richness but with added crunchy bits of hot cross buns and all the chocolate for texture and flavour. Make and freeze the dough, baking off individual cookies as and when you want them for optimum satisfaction and that fresh-baked cookie smell in your home. Makes 18 cookiesunsalted butter 250g, softenedsoft brown sugar 200gwhite sugar 100gvanilla extract 2 tspegg yolks 4plain flour 315gfine sea salt 1 tspbicarbonate of soda 2 tspstale hot cross buns 200g (2-3 buns), toasted and torn into 2cm pieceschocolate 300g, broken into different sized chunks (I use a mix of white, milk and dark. You can also use chocolate Easter eggs and random bits of bars you have, which makes it fun to eat) Line a small baking tray or baking tin (one that will fit inside your freezer) with parchment paper. Beat the butter and sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer until combined but not too creamy – you are not aiming for light and fluffy here, as that would make the cookies too cakey. Add the vanilla and the egg yolks, and mix well. In another bowl weigh out the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda, and whisk together well. Add this to the butter and egg mixture, and mix until combined. Add the hot cross bun pieces and all the chocolate chunks. Scoop individual portions of cookie dough on to the lined baking tray or tin. If using spoons, pat each portion into a little ball. Cover with clingfilm and freeze for at least 1 hour, or up to a month. When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the cookies evenly on the tray, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to expand during baking (they will almost double in size). If you are baking from frozen, allow the cookies 5 minutes out of the freezer before placing in the oven. Bake for 14 minutes or until the centre of each cookie is slightly soft and underbaked but the edges are crisp and golden. Remove from the oven, rap the tray on your counter to flatten them a little and allow to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before serving. Sheet cakes for gatherings are easier to portion and the ratio of icing to cake is perfect. My grandma Betty championed the sheet cake and everyone looked forward to her arrival at a picnic, foil-wrapped Pyrex dish in hand. For the sugared fruit, choose underripe fruits that are fresh and plump. I love to use odd-shaped fruits, and tropical fruits work well for a retro feel. I recommend sugaring the fruit the night before or the morning of your event. It gives the egg white a chance to set and dry out. If using berries, do them just before using or they will weep.

You will need a pastry brush, or a small paint brush, and a cooling rack. Separate your eggs and use the yolks to make the Easter Spice custard for the madeira cake. Whisk the whites in a small bowl. Wipe the fruits with a dry cloth and lay on the cooling rack placed over a baking sheet to catch any drips and the excess sugar. One at a time, pick up a fruit and delicately brush it with the thinnest layer of egg white possible. It needs to be fully coated, but paper thin. Then, holding the brushed fruit by the stem, use your free hand to sprinkle over the granulated sugar. Work swiftly so the egg white does not dry before the sugar sticks to it. You may need to sprinkle it with the sugar a few times. Use this technique, rather than rolling the fruit into the sugar, for a finer, smoother finish. Grease and line a 23cm x 33cm oblong baking tin and set aside. Heat the oven to 150C fan/gas mark 3½. Weigh out all the dry ingredients into a large bowl, sift together twice and set aside. Melt the butter and pour into a large bowl. Add the water and vanilla to your melted butter. Whisk in the creme fraiche and finally the eggs until smooth and incorporated. Gradually whisk this into your dry ingredients until smooth, being careful not to overmix. Pour the mixture into your prepared baking tin and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean and the sponge springs back to the touch. The low oven temperature allows the cake to rise slowly and evenly without peaking in the middle. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from the tin to cool completely. To make the icing, melt the chocolate, butter, vanilla and golden syrup in a bowl over barely simmering water. Scrape into a food processor and process until cool. Add the remaining ingredients and beat until smooth. Chill for 30 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer and beat with a paddle until creamy and of a spreadable consistency – about 5 minutes. When ready to assemble the cake, place the sponge on a flat surface, such as an upturned baking sheet, or you could use a cake drum from a party store, or a lovely large serving platter. Split the cake through the middle with a large serrated knife, like a bread knife, being careful to cut evenly. Use a removable tart or cake tin base to lift the top layer off and set it aside. Fill and ice the middle, replace the top layer of cake, and ice the top and sides. Pipe a little border around the base and top edge of the cake. Chill until 30 minutes before serving. Decorate with the sugared fruits and serve immediately. Any remaining cake can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days, but remove the sugared fruit. The sugared fruits last about 2 days – they are not really for eating but for decoration. A quick home version of pain au chocolat for Easter, these can be made with hot cross buns or slices of the Italian colomba di pasquale bread, which is baked in the shape of a dove. They both make great options; hot cross buns are packed with sultanas and spices, while the colomba has candied citrus peel and is similar to panettone in flavour and texture. Serves 6double cream 350mldark chocolate 250g, chopped into small pieceshot cross buns 6, or a loaf of colomba di pasquale Heat 250ml of the cream gently to just under the boil (I never take my eyes off it). Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped chocolate until smooth. Sometimes this can split, so this is where your extra 100ml double cream comes in. Add cold cream little by little until the ganache is smooth. You can also use a stick blender or food processor to save a broken ganache by gradually adding the extra cold cream while the blender or processor is running. All chocolates are different so this accounts for the irregularity in results. Put the ganache in a bowl or container and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Split the buns or slice the bread and heat a heavy bottomed frying or griddle pan over medium heat. Spread a thick layer of ganache on to your bread, staying a few millimetres in from the edge. Top with another piece and place on to your pan. Griddle on each side for just a few minutes as these sweet breads brown very fast. Be really careful when you flip it so you don’t lose too much filling. Serve straight away. I first tasted a true cassata on a road trip in Sicily with my daughter when she was four. We drove for hours in 40C heat to find the famous hilltop bakery, Café Sicilia. You will need to start the day before you plan to serve this cake. Serves 10-12caster sugar 50gwater 60mlGrand Marnier 2 tbsppistachio marzipan 200g, or green marzipan (available online and in large supermarkets)madeira cake 1 (about 900g), 1-2 days old (see recipe below)ricotta cheese 1kg, strained through a cheesecloth for 12-24 hoursvanilla extract 1 tspfine sea salt ½ tsporange juice 1 tbsplemon juice 3 tbspcaster sugar 100gicing sugar 250gglacé fruits such as cherries, melon, kiwi, citrus (available online and in speciality delis and food halls such as Fortnum & Mason) Line a 30cm pie plate (with angled sides) with clingfilm. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the 50g of caster sugar with the water. Once dissolved, take off the heat and stir in the Grand Marnier and cool. Roll the marzipan out to about 3-4mm thickness if it is not ready rolled. Cut into strips that are the same width as the depth of your pie dish. Line the sides of your dish with the marzipan, overlapping slightly where you have to patch the strips together to form one continuous ring. Slice the madeira cake into ½cm thick slices and arrange half of them on the base of the pie plate. Drizzle half the Grand Marnier syrup evenly over the cake slices and set aside. In a large bowl whisk together the strained ricotta, vanilla, salt, orange juice, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and the 100g of caster sugar until smooth. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over the soaked cake and then top with the remaining cake slices, trimming where necessary to fit the dish. Drizzle over the remaining syrup and cover snugly with clingfilm. Chill for two hours. Whisk together the icing sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Invert the chilled cassata on to a serving dish, carefully removing all the clingfilm. Spoon enough of the white icing on to the top to cover, containing it within the border of the marzipan. Decorate with the glacé fruits. Refrigerate again for a further 2 hours before serving. Tender orange-flavoured biscuits sandwiched around creamy milk chocolate – these are fun to make and much easier than they look. Put them on a plate of paper doilies, like in an old-fashioned shop, to catch the sprinkles.

Heat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Whisk together the dry ingredients and set aside. Cream the softened butter and cream cheese with the orange zest until smooth. Add the caster sugar, orange juice and vanilla seeds, and mix well. Add the egg, mix well and finally add the dry ingredients. Mix until just incorporated. Scoop the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip, such as Wilton No 6B. Pipe in shapes on to your prepared baking tray. I like simple oval or S shapes. Whichever shape you choose, keep them about 6cm long and be sure to pipe them in matching pairs (that reflect each other), so you can sandwich them together harmoniously. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden. Cool for 10 minutes then turn half of them upside down. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a water bath and melt gently. Or melt the chocolate in a microwave, being careful not to burn it. Using a small knife or offset spatula, spread a thin layer of chocolate on the flat side of the upturned biscuits, doing just a couple at a time so the chocolate does not set before you sandwich each cookie with their partner. Finally, use the knife to spread a swoosh of chocolate on to the end of each sandwich and sprinkle with your chocolate strands or decoration of choice. Serve in flattened cupcake cases or on a plate lined with paper doilies. They will keep in an airtight container for a week. This madeira cake is my attempt at a supermarket classic. It gets the soft brown crust just right and, soaked in warm, delicately spiced custard, I dare you not to eat two portions. The lavender and rose is optional but I really recommend trying it. Mixed with the citrus and spice, it all comes together in an unusual yet beautifully balanced silky custard delight.

Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, oil and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder and salt. Add half of the mixture to the butter-sugar mixture and beat well. Add half the milk and beat well, repeating with the remaining dry mixture and milk. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to make sure nothing is stuck there, mix a final time. Tip the mixture into your prepared baking tin and tap on the counter a few times to remove large air bubbles. Bake until golden, a skewer inserted comes out clean, and the madeira cake is springy to the touch – about 45-50 minutes. While the cake is cooling, you can make the custard. I love to serve the custard hot, just cooked with the freshly baked cake, but both will last well for up to 5 days and can be eaten cold, room temperature or reheated. Basically, any which way you eat this cake and custard combo is delicious. To make the custard, put all the ingredients except the egg yolks and Grand Marnier in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Bring to just under the boil, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and steep for at least 20 minutes. Place the egg yolks in a large bowl (save the whites for the sugared fruits or another use) and place a fine sieve over the bowl. Pour the steeped cream over the yolks and discard the spices. Whisk together the yolks and milk mixture until smooth. Rinse out the saucepan before pouring the custard back in. Place over a medium-low heat and whisk continuously until the custard is thick. Remove and decant into a jug or bowl and add the Grand Marnier, if using. If not using straight away, put it in an airtight container and leave at room temperature for up to 2 hours or chill.

4/7/2022,"Donald Trump has said he regrets not marching on the US Capitol building with his supporters on the day of the January 6 insurrection and again rejected suggestions he used “burner phones” on the day of the assault. In a defiant interview with the Washington Post the former president said he had pressed to march with his supporters on January 6, but was blocked from doing so by Secret Service agents. “Secret Service said I couldn’t go. I would have gone there in a minute,” Trump told the Post, later bragging about the size of the “tremendous crowd” at the “Save America” rally that day. Last month CBS News and the Post revealed internal White House phone records from the day of the attack on the Capitol showed a seven-hour-and-37-minute gap in Trump’s phone logs including the period in which the assault occurred. The reports revealed the House committee investigating the attack were examining whether Trump had used burner phones – disposable mobile phones – during that period. Trump has denied doing so and said he did not know the meaning of the term, but last week his former national security adviser John Bolton said the former president had used the term several times in conversations. In his interview with the Washington Post, Trump again denied use of burner phones and said he had not destroyed any call logs. He claimed instead he had not received many phone calls on the day of the assault, but remembered talking to two Republican congressmen, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Jim Jordan. “From the standpoint of telephone calls, I don’t remember getting very many,” he told the Post, later adding, “Why would I care about who called me? If congressmen were calling me, what difference did it make? There was nothing secretive about it. There was no secret.” Trump also acknowledged he had communicated with Ginni Thomas, wife of the conservative supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, during his presidency but said he was not aware of her lobbying around the 2020 election results. Text messages obtained by the Washington Post and received by the 6 January committee, revealed Ginni Thomas had repeatedly lobbied Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to push to keep Trump in power after Joe Biden won the election. “First of all, her husband is a great justice. And she’s a fine woman. And she loves our country,” Trump said in his interview with the Post. The former president also said he had not been contacted by the 6 January committee and offered no clear indication of how he would respond if contacted. He branded his daughter Ivanka’s appearance before the committee earlier this week as “shame and harassment” but told the Post he was not aware of what she had said. The interview came as the committee received a cache of 101 emails belonging to the Trump lawyer John Eastman, which are likely to reveal details of the efforts undertaken to block former vice-president Mike Pence from certifying the election result in Congress on 6 January. On Wednesday the House also voted to hold two former senior Trump aides, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas issues by the committee, paving the way for potential criminal prosecution.",News/US news,Trump says he regrets not marching on Capitol with supporters on January 6 ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/trump-regrets-not-marching-capitol-january-6
4/7/2022,"A security guard at the British embassy in Berlin accused of spying for Russia allegedly passed “secret” information about the government to a Russian military attache, a court heard. David Smith, 57, denied nine offences under the Official Secrets Act when he appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday. The Briton, who was living in Potsdam in the German capital, is accused of gathering information from the embassy and passing it to someone he believed was a representative of the Russian state, as well as other alleged offences, between October 2020 and August last year. During his appearance Smith spoke only to give his full name, age and address, and to submit his plea of not guilty. The court heard the charges included the allegation that Smith tried to communicate by letter with Gen Maj Sergey Chukhurov, a Russian military person based in the Russian embassy in Berlin. The court was told the material in the letter allegedly contained “details about the activities, identities, addresses and telephone numbers of various members of Her Majesty’s civil service”, in breach of the Official Secrets Act. Regarding the other eight charges, Smith is accused of committing acts “prejudicial” to the safety and interest of the state by gathering information classified as “secret” about the “activities of Her Majesty’s government” and that he “collected material relating to the operation and layout of the British embassy in Berlin, and that information was calculated to be or might be or was intended to be directly or be indirectly useful to an enemy, namely the Russian state”. He is also alleged to have made unauthorised photocopies of documents, video recordings of the embassy’s CCTV system and kept sim card packaging he had been asked to dispose of. Smith also allegedly communicated information about building repairs at the embassy after being “approached by a person you believed to be a member of Russian military intelligence (the GRU)”. All charges carry a maximum sentence of 14 years. Smith was denied bail and remanded in custody. He was extradited to the UK from Germany on Wednesday after his arrest by German police on 10 August 2021. Scotland Yard said the investigation was led by counter-terrorism officers. Nick Price, the head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “David Smith has been charged with nine offences contrary to the Official Secrets Act. “He is accused of seven offences of collecting information with the intent of sending it to the Russian authorities, one of attempting communication, and one of providing information to a person he believed was a member of the Russian authorities. “After reviewing the case and authorising charges, we obtained an extradition warrant and worked closely with our German counterparts in order to bring Mr Smith back to the UK.”",News/UK news,"UK embassy guard gave secrets to Russian general, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/uk-embassy-guard-david-smith-secrets-russian-general-court-told
4/7/2022,"The novelty song is a dying art form. Deliberately silly, often profoundly annoying earworms by unestablished artists rarely factor into today’s pop universe. Instead, they have been replaced by the viral hit: a song by a nascent star that swiftly rises from obscurity to ubiquity, sating the appetite for newness and surprise with a bit more coolness and class. Although the viral hit is implicitly attention-grabbing, it doesn’t tend to be gimmicky – usually the accompanying social media craze (TikTok dance, or back in the day, Twitter meme template) takes care of that. Occasionally, there comes a viral hit that dances on the edge of novelty territory – comedic, a bit weird and infuriatingly catchy – but, crucially, not without serious musical panache. In 2019, that song was Old Town Road, the country-trap smash by Nicki Minaj stan turned musician Lil Nas X. Last year, it was minimalist indie number Chaise Longue by Isle of Wight duo Wet Leg, AKA late twentysomethings Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers. Over a monotonous bass line and sirening post-punk riff, a deadpan Teasdale intoned a series of non sequiturs – from suggestive Mean Girls quotes (“would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?”) to suggestive allusions to academia (“I went to school and I got the big D”). The chorus – essentially, “on the Chaise Longue” repeated ad infinitum in staccato style – combined with the vaguely gross-out band name sealed its strange, adolescent appeal. At 13m Spotify streams, the numbers aren’t exactly at Drivers License levels (that particular viral hit is on more than 1.3bn streams), but the hype Chaise Longue has generated on both sides of the Atlantic is far from negligible – they came second in the BBC’s influential Sound of 2022 poll and have appeared on several late-night US chatshows. Yet there is a price to pay for such teasing flamboyance. Firstly, you risk being seen as an irritant – I can’t be the only one who found Chaise Longue’s irreverence rather ersatz, and its supposedly witty innuendoes more like sub-Carry On inanity. Secondly, you introduce a certain amount of scepticism towards your first proper body of work. Are Wet Leg just a flash in the pan? While their eponymous debut album will no doubt disappoint fans of endless double entendres, it may just convert the cynics. Much like Lil Nas X did with his debut, the pair don’t repeat the style of their brash breakthrough hit, but have instead produced a far more subtle and conventional record. Wet Leg – mostly recorded in cocoon-like circumstances before Chaise Longue’s release, with help from producer du jour Dan Carey (Black Midi, Fontaines DC) – is a collection of 90s and 00s-era indie that is by turns dreamy, lush, hooky and thunderous, and layered with lyrics saturated with millennial disaffection, anxiety and overwhelm. The tracks that bookend the album are among the best examples of this approach: opener Being in Love – in which a satisfyingly original twist on the idea of infatuation as mental instability is relayed through the medium of scuzzy/delicate rock – and closer Too Late Now, a stormy tribute to opportunities passing you by and alienation setting in. The latter has a gratifyingly relatable self-doubt break, when the music drops out to allow Teasdale to document her existential angst as it spreads into the track she is currently performing: “I’m not sure if this is a song / I don’t even know what I’m saying … I’m not sure if this is the kind of life that I saw myself living.” The quarter-life crisis – rendered in messy, anxiety-riven, circular thought patterns – is perhaps the unifying motif of Wet Leg. On the psychedelic I Don’t Wanna Go Out, whose recurring riff nods to Bowie’s The Man Who Sold the World, our narrator is “almost 28, still getting off my stupid face.” On Angelica, sourly chiming guitars soundtrack a woman miserably going through the motions at a party; Oh No reflects on the infinite scroll while only just managing to suppress screeching panic. There are more in-yer-face tracks – with its hummed bass line and ambling raucousness, Supermarket’s tale of being stoned while doing the big shop recalls first-wave British punk in spirit and subject matter, while Wet Dream archly rejects the idea of being the object of masturbatory fantasies – but there is a maudlin air to these, too. The music is more muted and bittersweet than on Chaise Longue, as are the jokes – which actually make sense this time. That Teasdale and Chambers are able to treat great lines like throwaway remarks – as on the sweetly incantatory Loving You, which features the jibe: “I hope you choke on your girlfriend” – is proof they have wit to spare. You have to concede that in the content-saturated streaming age, arriving with a bit of goonish novelty probably isn’t a bad way to kickstart a career. Wet Leg have certainly got people listening, and by channelling their sense of humour and showmanship into a series of tracks that are far more nuanced and three-dimensional than the infuriatingly repetitive song that made their name, they’ve ensured their debut album is well worth hearing – again and again and again.",Arts/Music,Wet Leg: Wet Leg review | Rachel Aroesti's album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/wet-leg-wet-leg-album-review-chaise-longue-domino
4/7/2022,"The man accused of murdering Conservative MP Sir David Amess has told a court he did not have “any shame” as he admitted to killing the Conservative MP because he had voted seven years ago in support of a military campaign in Syria. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, stabbed Amess more than 20 times with a foot-long carving knife at Belfairs Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, shortly after midday on 15 October 2021, the Old Bailey heard. Telling the court he considered himself to be a “moderate Muslim”, he said he had previously hoped to kill Michael Gove, now the levelling up secretary. He denies preparing terrorist acts and murder. Dressed all in black, the bespectacled defendant told jurors: “I decided to do it because I felt that if I could kill someone who made decisions to kill Muslims, it could prevent further harm to those Muslims.” Ali said Amess had previously voted along with other MPs in support of airstrikes on Islamic State-controlled territories in Syria, a vote that took place in 2015 under the former prime minister David Cameron. Cross-examined by Tom Little QC, Ali was asked what difference killing Amess would make. He replied: “For one, he can’t vote again. “If he had previous for doing votes like that he won’t do it in the future, and perhaps send a message to his colleagues.” Little put it to Ali that on the day of the attack, Amess was trying to help him. Ali replied: “Oh, because of the surgery? I guess, yes. I killed him because he harmed Muslims. If he helped me after that [voting on Syrian airstrikes] then it doesn’t really matter.” Little said: “He posed no risk at all to you.” Ali replied: “He posed risk to Muslims.” He agreed that Amess’s membership of the Conservative Friends of Israel group was another “big problem” for him. Ali admitted he had previously been asked why he had a note on his phone about his “plans” to kill Gove. Ali said: “That was plans I had to attack and hopefully kill Michael Gove at the time. I believe he was someone who was a harm to Muslims. I thought if I couldn’t go join Islamic State, I should try and do something here to help Muslims here.” Ali told the court he had no regrets over killing Sir David, who he referred to as simply “David”. He denied being “utterly shameless”. He said: “I wouldn’t use the word ‘shameless’ but I don’t have any shame.” Little said: “You don’t think you did anything wrong.” And Ali replied: “If I thought I did anything wrong, I wouldn’t have done it.” Ali said he “deeply” regretted not being able to join Islamic State and did not think the attack was wrong. I consider myself a Muslim who went out and killed someone who killed Muslims,” he said. Asked if he regarded himself as a radical, he replied: “I am a moderate Muslim.” Ali had managed to arrange an appointment with Amess, 69, by telling the politician’s office he was a healthcare worker moving to the area and wished to discuss local matters. The trial previously heard how Ali allegedly spent years hatching his plot, researching a number of potential high-profile political targets including Gove, Dominic Raab and Sir Keir Starmer, before settling on Amess. Describing his childhood, Ali told the jury it was “full of love and care”. “I had a big family who used to come around all the time,” he said. “I don’t recall any bad memories at the time.” He told the jury he dropped out of university as he felt “as a Muslim” he was obliged to do something during a period when there was fighting in Syria. “I felt I was railroading myself into a normal life,” he said. The trial continues.",News/UK news,Ali Harbi Ali tells court he did not feel shame after killing David Amess,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/ali-harbi-ali-tells-court-he-did-not-feel-shame-after-killing-david-amess
