3/16/2022,"If you’ve been paying attention to how Russian President Vladimir Putin talks about the war in Ukraine, you may have noticed a pattern. Putin often uses words to mean exactly the opposite of what they normally do. He labels acts of war “peacekeeping duties.” He claims to be engaging in “denazification” of Ukraine while seeking to overthrow or even kill Ukraine’s Jewish president, who is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. He claims that Ukraine is plotting to create nuclear weapons, while the greatest current threat of nuclear war appears to be Putin himself. Putin’s brazen manipulation of language is drawing attention. Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, recently said of Putin in a CNN interview: “When he says, ‘I want peace,’ this means, ‘I’m gathering my troops to kill you.’ If he says, ‘It’s not my troops,’ he means ‘It’s my troops and I’m gathering them.’ And if he says, ‘OK, I’m retreating,’ this means ‘I’m regrouping and gathering more troops to kill you.’” As a philosophy professor who studies the British author George Orwell, I am reminded by Rudik’s comments about Putin of another set of claims: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” These are the words etched onto the side of the building for the government agency called the “Ministry of Truth” in Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” published in 1949. Orwell uses this feature of the novel to draw attention to how totalitarian regimes – like the book’s fictional state of Oceania – perversely warp language to gain and retain political power. Orwell’s keen understanding of this phenomenon was the result of having witnessed it himself. In grappling with Putin’s lies and spin, it’s helpful to look at what previous thinkers and writers, like Orwell, have said about the relationship between language and political power. Orwell, an Englishman who lived from 1903 to 1950, experienced war, imperialism and poverty during the first half of his life. These experiences led Orwell to identify as a socialist and member of the British political left. It might seem inevitable, then, that Orwell would have favorably viewed Soviet Communism, a leading force on the political left in Europe at the time. But this was not so. Instead, Orwell believed that Soviet Communism shared the same defects as Nazi Germany. Both were totalitarian states where the desire for total power and control crowded out any room for truth, individuality or freedom. Orwell did not think Soviet Communism was truly socialist, but rather that it only had a socialist façade. At age 33, Orwell served as a volunteer soldier in the Spanish Civil War. He fought with a small militia as part of a larger left-leaning coalition that was trying to stop an insurrection from Spain’s Nationalist right. This left-leaning coalition was receiving military support from the Soviet Union. But the small militia Orwell was fighting with ultimately became a target of Soviet propagandists, who leveled a range of accusations against the militia, including that its members were spies for the other side. This was a byproduct of the Soviet Union’s attempts to use its involvement in Spain as a way of gaining political power. Orwell observed how the militia he had fought with was maligned in the European press as part of this Soviet smear campaign. He explained in his book “Homage to Catalonia” that this smear campaign included telling demonstrable lies about concrete facts. This experience deeply troubled Orwell. He later reflected on this experience, writing that he was frightened by the “feeling that the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.” That prospect, he claimed, frightened him “much more than bombs.” Such fears influenced much of Orwell’s most influential writing, including his novel “1984” and his essay “Politics and the English Language.” In that essay, Orwell reflects on the relationship between language, thought and politics. For Orwell, language influences thought, which in turn influences politics. But politics also influences thought, which in turn influences language. Thus, Orwell – like Putin – saw how language shapes politics and vice versa. Orwell argues in the essay that if one writes well, “one can think more clearly,” and in turn that “to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration,” which I believe meant to him that a political order could recover from destructive political influences like totalitarianism. This makes good writing a political task. Orwell’s desire to avoid bad writing is not the desire to defend rigid rules of grammar. Rather, Orwell’s goal is for language users “to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about.” Communicating clearly and precisely requires conscious thought. It takes work. But just as language can illuminate thought and regenerate politics, so too language can be used to obscure thought and degenerate politics. Putin sees this clearly and seeks to use this to his advantage. Orwell warned against the kind of abuses of language Putin commits, writing that “if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” Orwell explored what mutual corruption of language and politics in a totalitarian regime looks like in his dystopian “1984.” In the world of “1984,” the only crime is “thoughtcrime.” The ruling class seeks to eliminate the possibility of thoughtcrime by eliminating the language needed to have the thoughts they had criminalized – which included any thought that would undermine the party’s totalitarian control. Limit language and you limit thought, or so the theory goes. Thus, the Russian Parliament passed, and Putin has signed, a law that could result in criminal charges for using the Russian word for “war” to describe the Ukraine war. Orwell also uses “1984” to explore what happens when communication conforms to the desires of political power instead of demonstrable fact.

The slogans “War is peace,” “Freedom is slavery” and “Ignorance is strength” are paradigmatic examples. This Orwellian idea has given rise to the concept of doublespeak, which occurs when one uses language to obscure meaning to manipulate others. Doublespeak is a tool in the arsenal of tyranny. It is one of Putin’s weapons of choice, as it is for many authoritarians and would-be authoritarians around the world.

3/16/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Japanese accountant Masamitsu has not travelled or gone to the cinema in years and rarely eats out. Instead, his annual salary of about $34,000 goes to support his family and has risen by just $4 a year for nearly a decade. ""I can't save, I have nothing at all put by for my old age. I'll just have to keep on working,"" said the 50-year-old, who declined to give his last name out of concern for his job at a small company that works in event planning. ""After I retire from this company, I'll do anything I can get. Maybe work as a security guard."" Masamitsu's plight mirrors that of many workers at small and medium-sized firms in Japan, where the average salary in 2020 was $38,515, little changed from the 1990s and well below the average of $49,165 in countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged profitable companies to boost wages at spring wage negotiations, when managements of blue chip firms meet key unions for talks to fix wages in the coming year, setting a guideline for most other companies. This year's talks are expected to wrap up on Wednesday. Masamitsu, who was trained in accounting at a vocational school, switched jobs at age 43, in a move relatively unusual for Japanese employees, after his previous employer cut salaries. After a long series of unsuccessful interviews, he felt lucky to land his current job, only to be told upfront that raises would be only 500 yen ($4.25) a year for the first decade. ""Given my age, the base pay actually wasn't too bad, there were other places that were lower,"" he said. ""And I was told that after 10 years, it'd go up by 5,000 yen a year."" Masamitsu's monthly pay, along with allowances common in Japan, amounts to about 250,000 yen, and he gets a bonus of two months' pay twice a year for a yearly total of roughly 4 million yen ($34,000). ""It's kind of unfortunate it doesn't rise more, even though I'm working hard,"" he said. From this sum he supports his wife, who works part-time to supplement their income, and a daughter who is just about to complete high school. For recreation, he and some friends do yoga from YouTube videos, though he occasionally buys a one-day gym pass to take yoga classes. ""I'd have liked to have had another child, but the one has taken everything we have,"" he said. He has little hope that Kishida's urging will change much. ""This kind of thing doesn't really reach people in places like me,"" he said. ""Officials say a lot of things that don't really work out.""

3/16/2022,"Mikhaela Jennings is a Black TikToker who created the viral ""girls that get it, get it"" sound. Jennings has repeatedly called out creators and brands using it without crediting her. She is now reportedly considering trademarking her sounds. A Black TikToker has spoken out against creators and brands who have used her viral sound without crediting her, calling them ""disrespectful."" Mikhaela Jennings, who goes by @KhaeNotBae on TikTok, has 460,000 followers and is known for posting short comedic videos sharing her opinion about TV shows and trends. In November 2021, she posted a TikTok in response to people who criticized her new hairstyle, and used the phrase, ""The girls that get it, get it; the girls who don't, don't."" The sound has since been reused in 71,000 videos as part of a TikTok trend where women share divisive beauty and fashion choices. Variations of the phrase have been used by brands including Boohoo, LinkedIn, Outback Steakhouse, and Oreo. Jennings told Refinery 29's Katherine Singh that she's asked some brands which have used her phrase to compensate her, but they have been reluctant to do so. Some creators re-recorded the phrase using their own voices, and their videos received more views than Jenning's original clip, which has 3.3 million views. Many of these TikToks did not credit Jennings as the creator of the trend in the video description or comments section. In an interview posted by Complex on Twitter in February, Jennings said seeing non-Black creators use her sound was ""eerie"" because she didn't expect the sound to circulate beyond the Black community, which her content is geared towards. She said she feels people expect her to be grateful that her sound is used, but she thinks it's ""very disrespectful."" Jennings, who also coined the phrase, ""I know you girls like to tussle,"" which became a viral sound in October 2021, told Refinery29 she plans to continue to make TikTok content ""for as long as it's giving back to me,"" adding, ""as soon as it starts taking more than it's giving, it's done for."" The outlet also reported that she is now looking into trademarking her sounds. It is not always customary to credit TikTok sounds, as users can click on a link to the sound at the bottom of the TikTok, where the original clip can typically be found. However, some Black creators who invented dance trends on TikTok previously told Insider that being credited in the description by other creators can open up ""life-changing"" opportunities. In March 2021, TikTok stars Addison Rae and Charli D'Amelio faced criticism for demonstrating TikTok dances without acknowledging the original Black creators. Some Black creators refused to make any new dances for a month to highlight how their work has been co-opted by white creators.

3/16/2022,"BANGKOK (AP) — While Russia's war in Ukraine dominates global attention, Myanmar's military is targeting civilians in air and ground attacks on a scale unmatched in the country since World War II, according to a longtime relief worker who spent almost three months in a combat zone in the Southeast Asian nation. David Eubank, director of the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian relief organization, told The Associated Press that the military’s jets and helicopters stage frequent attacks in the areas of eastern Myanmar where he and his volunteers operate, bringing medical and food aid to civilians caught in conflict. Ground forces are also firing artillery — indiscriminately, he said — causing thousands to flee their homes. Video shot by his group’s members includes rare images of repeated air strikes by Myanmar military aircraft in Kayah State – also known as Karenni State — causing a number of civilian deaths. An analyst for New York-based Human Rights Watch said the air attacks constitute “war crimes.” Myanmar’s military seized power last year, overthrowing the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. After security forces cracked down violently on large, peaceful street demonstrations opposing the takeover, thousands of ordinary people formed militia units, dubbed People’s Defense Forces, to fight back. Many are loosely allied with well-established ethnic minority armed groups — such as the Karenni, the Karen and the Kachin — that have been fighting the central government for more than half a century, seeking greater autonomy in the frontier regions. Despite overwhelming superiority in numbers and weaponry, the military has failed to crush this grassroots resistance movement. The army has now stepped up attacks, taking advantage of the dry, summer conditions. Eubank described the fighting he had seen as probably the worst in Myanmar since World War II, when the country was a British colony still known as Burma and largely occupied by the Japanese. There has been serious but sporadic fighting in Kachin State in northern Myanmar for a few years, he said, “but what I saw in Karenni I had not seen in Burma before.” “Air strikes, not like one or two a day like they do in Karen State, but like two MiGs coming one after the other, these Yak fighters, it was one after the other,” said Eubank. “Hind helicopter gunships, these Russian planes, and then just brought hundreds of rounds of 120mm mortar. Just boom, boom, boom, boom.” Russia is a top arms supplier to Myanmar’s military, keeping up supplies even as many other nations have maintained an embargo since the army’s takeover to promote peace and a return to democratic rule. Eubank knows whereof he speaks. He was a U.S. Army Special Forces and Ranger officer before he and some ethnic minority leaders from Myanmar founded the faith-based Free Burma Rangers in 1997. Two of its members have been killed in Kayah state since late February: one in an air strike, the other in a mortar barrage. Drone footage shot by the group shows the impact of the army’s offensive on Karenni settlements, with buildings on fire and smoke drifting thick in the sky. In a Feb. 24 report in the state-run Myanma Alinn Daily newspaper, the military acknowledged using air strikes and heavy artillery in order to clear out what it called “terrorist groups” near the state capital, Loikaw. As casualties mount, people have to scramble for their lives, cowering in crude underground shelters topped with bamboo. A nighttime air raid on Feb. 23 that struck northwest of Loikaw left two villagers dead, three wounded and several buildings destroyed. “These are war crimes,” Manny Maung, the Myanmar researcher for Human Rights Watch, told AP. “These attacks by military on civilians, civilian buildings, killings of civilians, public buildings like religious buildings, yes, they are no less than war crimes that are happening right now in that particular area and this is because they are indiscriminately targeting civilians.” As well as in Kayah, the military is currently hitting hard in Sagaing, in upper central Myanmar, burning villages and heavily engaging with poorly armed militia units. The United Nations refugee agency says 52,000 people countrywide fled their homes in the last week of February. It puts the total figure of internally displaced since the military takeover at just over half a million. Casualty figures are unclear, given the government's control of information and the remoteness of the war zones. More than 1,670 civilians have been killed by the security forces since the army seized power in February last year, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that monitors arrests and deaths. But its tallies are mainly from Myanmar's cities and generally lack casualties from combat in the countryside. “In the middle of all this we have Ukraine, which is a tragedy, and I’m really grateful for the help the world has galvanized behind Ukraine,"" Eubank said. “But the Karenni people ask me ‘Don’t we count? ... And of course, the people of Ukraine need help. But so do we. Why? Why isn’t anybody helping us?’”",World/Associated Press,Witness: Army attacks in eastern Myanmar worst in decades,https://news.yahoo.com/witness-army-attacks-eastern-myanmar-031443911.html
