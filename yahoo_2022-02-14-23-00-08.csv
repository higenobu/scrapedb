2/14/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian expression “tanks don’t fear mud” is common enough that it’s been the title of a short-lived Russian television series and can be found stenciled on car windows. And it’s yet another reason why any Russian decision to invade Ukraine is likely to depend very little upon fears that a spring thaw will hinder tanks from crossing boggy ground. Russia’s military has, in addition to tanks and other armored vehicles that are well equipped for mud, a range of fighter jets and missiles that are the hallmarks of any modern military. U.S. President Joe Biden has said that Russia is essentially in position for an invasion of Ukraine “assuming that the ground is frozen above Kyiv,” the Ukrainian capital that is only 75 kilometers (47 miles) from the border of Belarus, a key Russian ally. It’s not the first time an American official has invoked Russia’s need for frozen ground to stage an invasion. But analysts trying to figure out how Russia could invade say any assault would start with air and missile strikes, likely targeting Ukrainian military sites. “If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin agrees to an invasion, then it won’t be tanks or ships in the vanguard, but rather aircraft and missile forces. The first targets for them will be air defense systems and the missile defense force, command posts, critical infrastructure, after which the advantage of Russian forces in the air and upper hand on land and sea are guaranteed,” said Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military analyst at the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think tank. Some Ukrainian analysts have acknowledged that the country’s air defenses are insufficient in case of a massive Russian assault. Kyiv has prodded its Western allies to provide the country with modern air defense systems in addition to ground combat weapons provided by the U.S., Britain and others. Sunhorovskyi said “the only deterrent is the West’s position and the readiness of millions of Ukrainians to fight to the end."" The Kremlin, which has denied having any Ukraine invasion plans, has scoffed at an argument that it wants to see the ground frozen to launch an attack on Ukraine. Ukrainian officials agree that frozen ground or mud isn’t an issue. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed at the argument to taunt British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss following their icy talks in Moscow on Thursday. “They say that Russia is waiting for the ground to freeze like a stone so that tanks could easily roll into Ukrainian territory,” Lavrov told reporters. “The ground was like that with our British colleagues, with numerous facts we cited bouncing off them.” Konstantin Sivkov, a Russian military analyst, said even if there were a ground incursion, Russian battle tanks are significantly lighter than Western armored vehicles and don’t get bogged down. “Our tanks are much better suited for advancing on muddy terrain, there is nothing to worry about,” Sivkov said in remarks carried by the FAN news outlet. “A thaw can only stop Western tanks.” ___ Yuras Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. ___ Follow all AP stories on tensions over Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"In Russia's Ukraine plans, how much does the mud matter?",https://news.yahoo.com/russias-ukraine-plans-much-does-091006192.html
2/14/2022,"A young girl fell from the gondola ride at the Florida State Fair Saturday night. Three members of the same family, all under the age of 10, were riding the gondola across the fairgrounds around 8:40 p.m., according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. The 7-year-old girl slipped under the safety bar and fell 35 to 40 feet onto a grassy area. The girl was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a possible broken wrist. Florida State Fair 2022: From prices to entertainment, here's what you need to know Thrill rides safe? Coasters are scary, but pretty safe Detectives determined the incident to be an accident. The ride was shut down for a time before resuming operation. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has been involved in the potential hazards associated with amusement park rides since its creation in 1973. Statistics compiled by Safety Commission indicate that approximately 10 deaths occur every year which are associated with amusement rides at permanent amusement parks and traveling carnivals. There are an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 injuries every year on rides. In 1977, the commission filed suit against the Chance Manufacturing Co. of Wichita, Kansas, the manufacturer of a ride called the ""Zipper."" Over a four-year period prior to 1977, four people had been killed in four separate accidents when the locking mechanism on the Zipper's door failed, causing the door to open in mid-air. The case was settled out of court. In August 1980, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued formal complaints involving amusement ride accidents at three amusement parks in Texas, California and Illinois. At the State Fair of Texas in 1979, a Skyride accident resulted in the death of one man and injuries to 17 others when two of the Skyride's gondolas fell approximately 70 feet onto the midway area of the state fair. Another complaint against the Marriott Corporation follows an accident on March 1980, in which a 14-year-old boy was killed and eight other persons injured when two cars of the Willard's Whizzer collided at the Great America park in Santa Clara, California. In 2016, a 10-year-old boy was decapitated when going down the world's tallest waterslide at the Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts and its park in Kansas City, Kansas. The 168-foot slide was later demolished.  In 2017, one person was killed and 7 injured when a ride at the Ohio State Fair broke apart. Some of the victims were thrown from the Fire Ball ride.

2/14/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Former U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the Biden administration over its handling of North Korea, at an event in South Korea that included as a guest speaker former Vice-President Mike Pence. Several former leaders and top officials participated virtually or in-person at the weekend event in Seoul jointly sponsored by the Cambodian government and the Universal Peace Federation, an organization linked to the South Korea-based Unification Church, a religious group known for its mass weddings and global business and media interests. Pence, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were among those who attended the event and spoke in person. Trump appeared in a recorded video message that was screened on Sunday at the forum. He alleged that a recent “return to escalation” that has seen North Korean leader Kim Jong Un launch missile tests would “never have happened if I were president.” He also urged North Korea not to undertake any actions that could “endanger” what he described as the “unique opportunity that we worked so hard to create together over the past four years.” The North resumed tests of shorter-range weapons threatening U.S. ally South Korea while Trump was in office in 2019. The year before, Kim had unilaterally suspended the testing of nuclear explosives and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles. Trump met Kim three times during his presidency. Their diplomacy never recovered from the collapse of their second meeting in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for a major release of U.S.-led sanctions in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. North Korea kicked off 2020 with ramped-up testing activity, conducting seven rounds of missile launches in January alone. Experts say the North could increase weapons demonstrations after its ally China finishes hosting the Winter Olympics in Beijing, as it attempts to move the needle with the Biden administration, which has offered open-ended talks but shown no willingness to budge on sanctions. During his speech at the weekend gathering, Pence said deepening relations between China and Russia are posing increasing threats to their democratic neighbors, according to the forum organizers. He also called for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the statement read. While in Seoul, Pence met with South Korean conservative presidential candidate, Yoon Suk Yeol, as well as foreign policy advisers to the rival ruling party of Lee Jae-myung.
