3/24/2022,"Volatile oil prices are hurting every corner of the global economy, but experts warn that it's nothing compared to the looming diesel shortage. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, global energy markets have spun into endlessly volatile territory as Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia and private oil and gas companies backed out of the country. Europe has been hardest hit by the disrupted trade flows with Russia, which was the continent’s largest provider of fuel. Now it might be facing an unprecedented diesel shortage, the CEOs of three leading commodity trading companies said Tuesday at the Financial Times’ annual Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland. “Europe imports about half of its diesel from Russia and about half of its diesel from the Middle East,” Russell Hardy, CEO of energy trading company Vitol, said at the conference. “That systemic shortfall of diesel is there.” Executives warned that extreme conditions caused by that shortage could lead to dwindling supply for the rest of the year, requiring fuel rationing from EU governments. “The diesel market is extremely tight. It’s going to get tighter,” Jeremy Weir, CEO of commodity trading house Trafigura, said at the summit. Torbjörn Törnqvist, CEO of commodity conglomerate Gunvor, also predicted that Europe’s energy supplies could remain low until next year, calling the energy market “paralyzed” at the moment. “This is a global problem, but for Europe it’s very hard because Europe is so short,” Törnqvist said. Europe imports roughly two-thirds of all its external crude oil, which is refined to make diesel, from Russia. And the conflict in Ukraine has exposed Europe’s extreme reliance on Russian fuel. Europe will feel the sting of a diesel shortage, but measures to conserve fuel are being advised everywhere, including the U.S., as oil and gas reserves reach dangerously low levels. On Friday, the International Energy Agency, a global energy watchdog, prescribed a set of strategies to cope with oil and gas shortages reminiscent of the steps taken during the 1970s oil crisis, including car-free Sundays and reduced speed limits on highways. In the U.S., diesel fuel is mainly used for farm and construction equipment, but in Europe, many normal road cars use diesel. In 2019, 42% of vehicles in Europe utilized diesel fuel. In some countries, such as Spain, Ireland, France, and Austria, that number was even higher, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, and well over half of all cars required diesel. Europe imports around 1 million barrels a day of Russian diesel, according to Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at research and consultancy firm Energy Aspects, who also spoke at the summit, the Financial Times reported. Sen called diesel “by far the worst affected” of oil products for European markets. Diesel prices in Europe had already been projected to rise for some time due to new EU regulations and taxes on carbon emissions, but the Ukraine invasion and supply shortage has already sent them soaring to record highs in the U.K. and the EU. Amid the shortage, the EU is now hunting for new sources of diesel to weather the storm. Europe is coordinating to increase diesel trade flows with Middle Eastern and Asian nations, and in a reversal of normal trade directions, two U.S. fuel tankers recently left port in New York carrying 700,000 barrels of diesel to Europe.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- In what looks increasingly like an uncharacteristic bout of bad timing, retail investors who hung tough during the selloff in January and February are now taking money off the table just as stocks are rallying. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves Russia China Plane Crash Update: Voice Recorder Sent for Analysis Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists China Jet’s Dive Took It Near Speed of Sound Before Crash Evidence of a retail pullback was visible in data from several Wall Street banks and the U.S. options clearing agency. Data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. showed their flows have slowed from a torrid pace earlier this year. Bank of America Corp.’s retail clients were net sellers of U.S. stocks for the first time this year. Many factors may have driven the retreat. One that has been getting the attention of analysts of late is the need to pay off an outsize tax bill on massive capital gains. According to a February estimate from Morgan Stanley’s trading desk, at least $325 billion will be due at next month’s deadline, 75% higher from what was to be paid a year ago. Of course, equities are not the sole source of that cash. Yet the pressure to meet tax obligations could mean waning demand from one key pillar of support in place since the market’s pandemic bottom two years ago. Indeed, data from JPMorgan showed broad daily retail flows this month are about 20% lower than this year’s average. Whether appetite from the YOLO crowd will continue to subside is hard to tell. To some market watchers, their withdrawal follows a stretch of furious risk unwinding from the likes of hedge funds -- a contrarian sign that sentiment may have reached a point where the last buyer is depleted and a floor can be established for the market. “‘There’s no one left to sell’ is the logic behind the retail finally surrendering their optimism and becoming as glass-half-empty as the rest of the world has already been,” Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC, said in an interview. “So professional investors use that as a tell to indicate when capitulation has occurred.” Day traders pulled back as stocks staged a strong comeback. The S&P 500 fell to within points of its 2022 lows at the start of last week before jumping in five of the next six sessions. Up 8% over the stretch, the index clawed back half its losses incurred during the previous two months. It slipped 0.9% as of 2:10 p.m. in New York. Retail activity has become a focal point of Wall Street attention after many bored Americans flooded into stocks during the pandemic lockdowns, emboldened by zero trading commissions offered by online brokers. Their market influence, however, has diminished this year as a hawkish Federal Reserve and war in Ukraine jolted big-money managers into action. Bank of America’s retail clients sold more than $800 million of shares last week after pouring in almost $8 billion since January as the market pulled back. “Retail has been a more aggressive buyer of the dip year-to-date than any other time since the global financial crisis and dip-buying has been a successful strategy,” BofA strategist Jill Carey Hall said in an interview. “Retail is not a contrary indicator. We found that the weeks we’ve seen positive retail flows, those have positive correlation with subsequent market returns even more so than hedge fund flows do.” Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at F.L. Putnam, agrees, saying it’s too early to determine what the latest retail action means for the market. “It used to be the case that retail investors were considered a contrary indicator because they were considered to always be late to the party. But I don’t know that that’s true any longer,” she said. “The jury is out as to whether or not the reliability of that as a contrary indicator is as high as it used to be.” There are also signs in the options market that retail interest is cooling. Once a big fan of using bullish options to chase equity gains and make quick money, day traders have seen their demand for calls dwindling. Last week, small-lot buying of call contracts made up the lowest portion of total call volume since March 2020, Options Clearing Corp. data compiled by Susquehanna International Group show. While amateurs were exiting, hedge funds tracked by BofA reined in their selling. Their share disposals totaled less than $400 million last week, down from $2.4 billion from the previous week. Meanwhile, hedge fund clients at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were tiptoeing back after frenetically slashing their equity exposure. Last week, they trimmed short positions against stocks while adding longs, separate data from their prime brokers show. “Unfortunately, the retail client is often wrong and moving the opposite direction of institutional cash,” said Victoria Greene, founding partner and chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth. “Retail selling may be signaling we saw at least a short-term bottom and support in this turnaround.” (Updates trading in seventh paragraph, BofA strategist comment in 10th) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin China Bets on $1.5 Trillion of Tax Cuts in Quest for Growth The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•5 hours ago,Day Traders Finally Retreat After Standing Firm Amid Stock Market Rout,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/day-traders-finally-retreat-standing-113012146.html
3/24/2022,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com, to prepare for more audit disclosures, sources said, as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure domestic companies remain listed in New York. This comes as China's regulators are considering a proposal to allow their U.S. counterparts to inspect audit working papers of some Chinese firms that do not gather sensitive data, two of the sources said. As part of that move, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and other regulatory agencies earlier this month summoned top internet companies, including search engine leader Baidu Inc and e-commerce major JD.com Inc, four sources told Reuters. Other internet firms summoned by the regulator included Alibaba Group and Weibo Corp, two of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. E-retailer Pinduoduo Inc and gaming firm NetEase Inc also attended the meeting, one of them added. They were asked to prepare audit documents for the 2021 financial year keeping in mind U.S. regulators' requests for more disclosure, said the sources, who declined to be named as they were not allowed to discuss details of the meeting. The companies should better seek Chinese regulators' advice if they are ""uncertain about anything"" during the whole process the first source said, which includes auditing and communications with U.S. regulators. CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and Weibo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pinduoduo and NetEase also did not immediately provide comment. The latest step by the Chinese regulators shows Beijing's willingness to make some concessions to resolve a long-running Sino-U.S. audit stand-off that has put hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments in Chinese companies at stake. The U.S. authorities are moving towards kicking Chinese companies off American stock exchanges, if the companies' audit records are unavailable for their inspection for three years in a row. DELISTING RISKS In December, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) finalised rules to delist Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), and said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without naming them. The SEC earlier this month named for the first time five of these firms, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings and biotech firm BeiGene Ltd, that could face delisting. Describing the SEC move as ""normal procedure"", CSRC said it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the dispute. Chinese regulators' deliberations with the New York-listed domestic companies on more audit disclosure were ongoing, three of the sources said. Washington has long demanded complete access to the books of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing, citing national security concerns, bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms. A map on the website https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), an auditor oversight body tasked to help keep publicly traded companies in the United States in check, showed China as the only jurisdiction that denied the organisation ""necessary access to conduct oversight"". Goldman Sachs estimated on March 11 that U.S. institutional investors held around $200 billion of exposure to Chinese companies' American depositary receipts (ADRs). The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies traded on Wall Street, fell nearly 60% over the past 12 months. In an attempt to calm investor fears, China's Vice Premier Liu He said last week talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators on companies listed in the United States have made progress and both sides are working on specific cooperation plans.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a month since the war started, but Russia is actually shipping more natural gas through Ukraine and Moscow is still paying Kyiv in full for transiting the fuel to Europe. Most Read from Bloomberg China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Xi Risks Leaving China Isolated by Backing Putin to Counter U.S. China Plane Crash Update: Wreckage Found, Airline Grounds Jets China Eastern Boeing 737 Jet Crashes With More Than 130 on Board Daily gas flows from Russia at some point surged more than 50% from January lows, with shipments traveling through Ukrainian pipelines more than doubling as energy companies rushed to buy after the invasion. Exports from Europe’s top supplier became cheaper than buying gas in the spot market, and Russia is still paying for transit in hard currency, according to Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive officer of NJSC Naftogaz Ukrainy, Ukraine’s largest state-owned oil and gas company. It’s an awkward situation for European policy makers, which have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow to try to starve President Vladimir Putin’s government of the cash it needs to fund the invasion. The increase also comes as European governments pledge to wean themselves off Russian gas, with plans to keep nuclear and coal plants open for longer and import more liquefied natural gas from countries including the U.S. and Qatar. Russian gas flows to Europe soared to the highest level since December in the 48 hours after the war began. State-run exporter Gazprom PJSC said supplies increased due to more orders from European customers, and for some time, shipments through another major Russian pipeline crossing Belarus and Poland and ending in Germany resumed after a two-month halt. The increase in imports from Russia reflects the lack of options that European customers have in the near term to meet demand, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a report last week. Naftogaz called on Europe and its allies to put payments for Moscow’s energy flows in an escrow account until Putin withdraws troops. That would further curb funding to Moscow just as cargoes of crude oil and grains from Russia are also finding a way to flow again. Ukraine has said before that Gazprom pays about $2 billion per year for gas-transshipment services.

3/24/2022,"Dow component Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) could offer superior returns for market players seeking a strong technical pattern and reliable dividend payout. The timing could be perfect because the stock just bounced at support generated by a 12-month cup and handle breakout in November, raising odds the 3-month correction is drawing to a close. Accumulation has barely budged during the downturn, indicating that shareholders have no intentions of jumping ship. The household goods giant is engaged in multiyear cost-cutting and reorganization focused on brand superiority that makes it easier to raise prices. That’s especially important right now, with rising inflation cutting into profit margins throughout the retail space. It’s also perfectly positioned to weather macro political tensions, scaling back Russian business operations and capital investment while continuing sales of basic health, hygiene, and personal care items. Truist analyst Bill Chappell upgraded the stock to ‘Buy’ on Tuesday, noting “not only do we believe that PG has emerged stronger, but we also believe its focus on product superiority and consumers has accelerated migration to trusted brands over the past two years. As consumer behavior patterns return to a ‘new normal,’ investors will again be able to see PG’s operating momentum, and we believe the stock will therefore restart its period of outperformance”. Wall Street consensus stands at an ‘Overweight’ rating based upon 10 ‘Buy’, 3 ‘Overweight’, 10 ‘Hold’, and 1 ‘Underweight’ recommendation. Price targets currently range from a low of $145 to a Street-high $187 while the stock is set to open Tuesday’s session about $22 below the median $174 target. This modest placement bodes well for continued upside off the corrective low but substantial gains may wait until we get closer to the Q2 earnings release on Apr. 20. Procter & Gamble broke out above the February 2020 peak at 128.07 in July and rallied to 146.92 in November. It carved a cup and handle pattern into November 2021 and broke out, posting an all-time high at 165.32 in January. The stock broke down from range support at 156 in February, yielding a decline that reached breakout support and the 200-day moving average earlier this month. Positive action since that time has established a trading floor at that level. The company pays a 2.31% forward dividend yield.

3/24/2022,"When it comes time to start taking your retirement income, you'll hopefully have an array of options available to you: Social Security benefits, 401(k) and IRA funds, dividends from stock investments, and other assets you can liquidate. But how you tap those various sources of income is hugely important. Withdrawing assets in the wrong order, taking benefits at the wrong age, or failing to consider tax implications can wind up undermining your retirement income. To make sure you're making the most of your nest egg, be sure to avoid these retirement withdrawal mistakes. A financial advisor can help you optimize your retirement income strategy. Find an advisor today. Withdrawing from your investments first gives your retirement accounts more time to grow through compound interest. If you dive straight into your 401(k) or IRA, you could cost yourself years' worth of income in retirement savings. Whether you have mutual funds, a brokerage account, ETFs, stocks or bonds, they’re all taxable, so you’ll have to pay capital gains taxes on withdrawals. Some investments also require you to pay taxes on distributions each year, like some mutual funds. Check with a fiduciary financial advisor to see if this is the case for your accounts. All of the financial advisors on SmartAsset’s matching platform are registered fiduciaries, who are legally bound to act in your best interest. If your advisor is not a fiduciary and constantly pushes investment products on you, use this no-cost tool to find an advisor who has your best interest in mind. If you want your maximum Social Security benefits, you’ll need to work until your “full retirement” age. But benefits at age 62, 66 or 67 are not your maximum benefits. The maximum Social Security retirement benefit kicks in at age 70. If you claim before, you're not getting your full entitlement. Each year after full retirement, your payout increases by a certain percentage based on specific criteria. To maximize on this strategy, we recommend holding off until you are 70 — payments will be the highest possible, increasing by 8% each year you wait. While this strategy will help you collect the highest Social Security benefit, every situation is different. Consult a financial advisor to figure out how and when Social Security benefits should factor into your unique retirement plan. You can start withdrawing money from your 401(k) when you turn 59 1/2, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. The law doesn't require you to start taking Required Minimum Distributions until you turn 72, so this is time your money can keep growing with compound interest. Put off withdrawing money from your Roth IRA as long as possible. You paid taxes up front so you can take money out of your Roth IRA and it won’t count as taxable income. Your Roth IRA also will continue to grow tax-free as you tap into your other accounts. Since a Roth IRA holds after-tax funds and the IRS doesn’t need to tax it again, you also don’t need to take Required Minimum Distributions. This account can keep growing for as long as you don't touch it. Determining the optimal sequence to withdraw money from your retirement accounts is different for everyone, so we recommend speaking with a financial advisor. Voya Financial found that 79% of people who use an advisor said they “know how to pursue achieving their retirement goals.” The study also found that 59% of those who use an advisor have calculated how much they need to retire, while 52% established a formal retirement investment plan.5 Chances are, there are several highly qualified financial advisors in your town. However, it can seem daunting to choose one. Our no-cost tool helps makes it easy to find a qualified advisor. You can get matched with up to three fiduciary investment advisors that have been vetted and subject to our due diligence criteria. You even earn 3 free consultations with each of our matches, so you can compare them and be fully prepared to pick a financial advisor. The entire matching process takes just a few minutes.

3/24/2022,"By Raphael Satter WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Okta Inc, whose authentication services are used by companies including Fedex Corp and Moody's Corp to provide access to their networks, said on Tuesday that it had been hit by hackers and that some customers may have been affected. The scope of the breach is still unclear, but it could have major consequences because thousands of companies rely on San Francisco-based Okta to manage access to their networks and applications. Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post that a customer support engineer working for a third-party contractor had his computer accessed by the hackers for a five-day period in mid-January and that ""the potential impact to Okta customers is limited to the access that support engineers have."" ""There are no corrective actions that need to be taken by our customers,"" he said. Nevertheless, Bradbury acknowledged that support engineers were able to help reset passwords and that some customers ""may have been impacted."" He said the company was in the process of identifying and contacting them. The nature of that impact wasn't clear and Okta did not immediately respond to an email asking how many organizations were potentially affected or how that squared with Okta's advice that customers did not need to take corrective action. The company's shares were down 1.3% at $167.14 in late afternoon trading, off earlier lows. On its website, Okta describes itself as the ""identity provider for the internet"" and says it has more than 15,000 customers on its platform. It competes with the likes of Microsoft Corp, PingID, Duo, SecureAuth and IBM to provide identity services such as single sign-on and multifactor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites. 'BE VERY VIGILANT' Okta's statement follows the posting of a series of screenshots of Okta's internal communications by a group of ransom-seeking hackers known as Lapsus$ on their Telegram channel late on Monday. In an accompanying message, the group said its focus was ""ONLY on Okta customers."" Lapsus$ responded to Okta's statement on Tuesday by saying the company was trying to minimize the importance of the breach. Some outside observers weren't impressed with Okta's explanation either. ""In my opinion, it looks like they're trying to downplay the attack as much as possible, going as far as directly contradicting themselves in their own statements,"" said Bill Demirkapi, an independent security researcher. Dan Tentler, the founder of cybersecurity consultancy Phobos Group, earlier told Reuters that Okta customers should ""be very vigilant right now."" There were already signs that Okta customers were taking action to revisit their security. Web infrastructure company Cloudflare issued a detailed explanation https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-investigation-of-the-january-2022-okta-compromise of how it reacted to the Okta breach and saying the company did not believe it had been compromised as a result. FedEx said in a statement that it too was investigating and ""we currently have no indication that our environment has been accessed or compromised."" Moody's did not return a message seeking comment. Lapsus$ is a relatively new entrant to the crowded ransomware market but has already made waves with high-profile hacks and attention-seeking behavior. The group compromised the websites of Portuguese media conglomerate Impresa earlier this year, tweeting the phrase ""Lapsus$ is now the new president of Portugal"" from one newspaper's Twitter accounts. The Impresa-owned media outlets described the hack as an assault on press freedom. Last month, the group leaked proprietary information about U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp to the Web. More recently the group has purported to have leaked source code from several big tech firms, including Microsoft. In a blog post https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction published Tuesday and devoted to Lapsus$, the software firm confirmed that one of its accounts had been compromised, ""gaining limited access.""

3/24/2022,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell in February amid rising mortgage rates and higher house prices, which are squeezing out some first-time buyers from the market. Despite the second straight monthly decline reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, sales remained above their pre-pandemic level. Economists saw reduced affordability curbing activity in the near-term, but expected the new housing market to plod along this year given pent-up demand, a record low inventory of previously owned homes and strong wage gains. ""With interest rates climbing further because of the negative supply shock emanating from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, home sales are likely to trend lower in coming months,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""But unless mortgage rates spike or the economy stalls or worse, the falloff in new home sales should be modest."" New home sales decreased 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 units last month. January's sales pace was revised down to 788,000 units from the previously reported 801,000 units. Sales surged 59.3% in the Northeast and increased 6.3% in the Midwest. But they fell 1.7% in the densely populated South and tumbled 13.0% in the West. New homes are a leading indicator for the housing market as they are counted at the signing of a contract. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 11.4% of U.S. home sales, would rebound to a rate of 810,000 units. Sales declined 6.2% on a year-on-year basis in February. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January 2021, which was the highest since the end of 2006. Mortgage rates surged in February and have continued to push higher after the Federal Reserve last week raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023. The 30-year fixed rate vaulted 23 basis points to a three-year high of 4.50% last week, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed on Wednesday. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as oil prices rose. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. SUPPLY-DEMAND IMBALANCE Though, mortgage rates remain low by historical standards, strong house price inflation has combined to significantly increase the typical monthly mortgage payment. ""Mortgage payments as a share of median family income have risen above 20% for the first time since late 2007,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""That will act to cool housing market activity. A record low number of existing homes on the market that implies new sales will grind out a small gain over 2022."" Data last week showed sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in February. The median new house price in February increased 10.7% from a year ago to $400,600. House prices have risen 31% compared to three years ago. None of the houses sold last month were below $200,000. Strong house price growth is expected to persist through this year and into 2023. ""We may be approaching a pivot point when higher home costs and higher mortgage rates cool both sales and price increases, but given the supply-and-demand imbalance, we may not hit that point this year,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. There were 407,000 new homes on the market, the highest since August 2008 and up from 398,000 units in January. Houses under construction made up 65% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 26%. The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances. At February's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.1 months in January.

3/24/2022,"The S&P 500 is rallying again during the trading session on Tuesday to reach the crucial 4500 level in the futures market. If we can break above here and stay above there, then it is very likely that we may have seen the S&P 500 trying to turn everything around. That being said, the next battle will be the 4600 level, which is where we had seen a small “double top.” The market will continue to be very noisy in general, especially as we have so many different fundamental reasons to think that the volatility is going to get worse, not better. However, it is worth noting that traders are starting to come to grips with the idea of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, so that may be a fundamental factor the people are starting to ignore again. Looking at this chart, if we were to break down below the 50 Day EMA, then it is possible that we break down but right now it certainly looks as if the market is going to ignore most things and simply rally. At this point, there is probably a certain amount of FOMO being seen on the charts as well, so it is what it is.

3/24/2022,"Estate planning startup Wealth is going after a $180 billion U.S. market by eliminating the three-ring binder of papers that become obsolete in months and replacing it with a digital dashboard that updates your holdings in real time. Many technology companies have come with their approaches to solving this problem, from Trust & Will to Quicken’s WillMaker to Everplans. Rafael Loureiro, co-founder and CEO of Wealth, which emerged from stealth today, believes his company is taking a more unique approach by appealing to employers that want to offer more value-added benefits. Loureiro founded the Arizona-based company with Rei Carvalho, founder and former CEO of Emailage, which was acquired by LexisNexis. Wealth enables members to create, manage and visualize their estate plans through an integrated ecosystem of proprietary legal documents, third-party APIs and a bank-level-encrypted digital vault. “We thought, why can’t we make this process easier so your information is dynamic, always up-to-date and will motivate your family for growth to have a holistic view of all your assets,” Loureiro told TechCrunch. “This is important, because this is what's going to make us different from everybody else. This is a holistic view of all your assets, including crypto, stocks, real estate, your car, identifying each institution and anything that's important to you. If baseball cards are important to you, you're going to be able to add them to the platform information with your estate plan.” Here’s how it works: When you set up your profile, you will answer a series of questions, including where you live, so that Wealth can determine the types of documents you need. Then users interact with a dashboard where they can add all of their assets and create digital documents of important papers. All of that information now lives in one place, and users can designate emergency access to loved ones. In addition to beginning to offer its products, the pre-revenue company is the latest to attract venture capital, bringing in a $16 million seed funding round, led by Anthos Capital, with participation from Bela Juju Ventures. Much of the funding will go to R&D and continuing to assemble a team. Wealth already has 50 people and will grow to 70 by the end of the year. Wealth initially will go after the employee benefits market. The company ran a survey at the end of 2021 and found that of 10,000 working Americans between the ages of 30 and 55, 13% are getting estate planning from their employer. Over 70% who do not have a plan said they would be more likely to set up one if it was offered by their employer. Next up, the company is getting its mobile apps ready so that it can open its solution directly to consumers.

AMAZON POST TECH BUBBLE COLLAPSE: In the first quarter of 2000, Amazon shares declined into late January, bounced into early February, declined into Mid-March, rallied into late March, and from that late-March high, prices collapsed over 40% by mid-April. If Tesla peaks in the coming days and collapses into mid-April, I think the rest of the chart could play out, implying a year-end target for Tesla around $200. I’m long-term bullish on Tesla and will accumulate aggressively when I feel prices bottomed, likely in 2023. TESLA TODAY: If Tesla follows the post-tech collapse of Amazon in 2000, then we could see an important top in the next few trading days, followed by a collapse to around $550 by mid-April.

3/24/2022,"By Julia Payne LAUSANNE (Reuters) -Energy and commodity markets are in shock after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the world's top trading firms said on Tuesday, warning of gas and diesel shortages in Europe and economic recession if Russian flows fall further. Prices across gas, oil, metals and agricultural markets have soared since the invasion and become so volatile that companies have had to cut traded volumes owing to strained liquidity. The chief executives of four of the biggest energy traders - Vitol, Gunvor, Mercuria and Trafigura - said the gas market in particular had become dysfunctional owing to unmanageable margin calls. ""The longer the war goes on, the greater the chance of an economic recession,"" Vitol CEO Russell Hardy told the FT Commodities Global Summit. Russia calls the biggest invasion in Europe since World War Two a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"". The West says this a false pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country. Energy markets had little spare capacity even before Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24. They will now struggle to absorb the potential loss of about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Russia, which competes with Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil exporters. ""From an economic perspective, Russia will be a loser. Europe won't do particularly well either with a refugee crisis ...(and) higher commodity prices,"" Mercuria CEO Marco Dunand said, adding that he expects Middle East Gulf countries to benefit most from prices and as political brokers between the West and Russia. Though sanctions have not been imposed on Russian oil globally, companies far and wide have been boycotting Russian commodities. ""Many people across Europe wish to boycott Russian oil,"" Hardy said, adding that it is unclear as yet how much oil would be lost. Trafigura Chief Executive Jeremy Weir pegged lost Russian crude and products so far at between 2 million and 2.5 million bpd. Vitol, Mercuria and Gunvor, on the other hand, said the decline is not immediately calculable but they do not see the shortfall exceeding 3 million bpd. The three businesses have halted spot purchases of Russian oil but are seeing out existing longer-term contracts. DIESEL SHORTAGES? The top concern for Europe is diesel. Europe imports half of its needs from Russia and could face shortages, the trading companies said, with Trafigura adding that Latin America and Africa could also be hit hard. Any replacement oil is likely to be months away. Iran could increase exports by 1 million bpd provided that an international nuclear deal is signed, but the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies are unlikely to increase output faster, Hardy said. ""They've been fairly clear up til now that they will continue with their OPEC+ agreement,"" Hardy said, adding that African countries in particular had less oil to spare than before the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Are we expecting a 1-2 million bpd increase? Yes, but not likely in the next couple of months,"" he said. Hedging in futures markets, particularly for natural gas, has become difficult to manage as strained credit lines force market participants to cut positions, which in turn contributes even more volatility. The trading companies said the market was looking to regulators, central banks and governments for back-up emergency liquidity. Gunvor's chief executive said that Dutch TTF wholesale gas futures, which are used as a European benchmark, were not fit to be used to hedge the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. ""The problem is the dysfunctional TTF price because of margin calls. The tradeability of gas has exploded over the last five years and a proper benchmark to absorb that kind of volume was shown not to be there,"" said Gunvor CEO Torbjorn Tornqvist. ""We are in the middle of a storm now. Many parties got hurt."" Liquidity contraints because of extreme margin calls have forced traders to focus on core business, Tornqvist said, including his own. The initial margin is collateral, or cash, posted by clearing members to the clearing house to cover potential losses in the event of a member default. Margin calls arise when the gap between the current spot price and the future sale becomes too wide, forcing traders to increase the deposit they hold at exchanges on each trade. ""The spot market has dried up ... Every trader is focused on core business. We are doing less volume than we normally do but we can size up again quickly,"" Tornqvist added.

3/24/2022,"Quantum tech may be having its moment at long last. Consider that earlier this month, one of the few ""pure play"" quantum tech companies in the world, Rigetti Computing, went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC. It only narrowly missed becoming the first publicly traded company to expressly focus on commercializing quantum tech when another outfit, IonQ, went public through a SPAC merger in October. Meanwhile, another rival in the space, D-Wave, says it is also now planning to go public via SPAC. While movement toward the public markets is one indicator that quantum tech is progressing beyond the realm of the theoretical, an even stronger signal that it's getting ready for its close-up ties to Alphabet, which said this morning that it's spinning out its six-year-old quantum tech group, Sandbox AQ, into a standalone company. Jack Hidary, who was formerly the director of AI and quantum at Sandbox and is a longtime X Prize board member, will continue to lead the 55-person, Mountain View, California, outfit, which describes itself as an enterprise SaaS company that's developing commercial products for telecom, financial services, healthcare, government, computer security and other sectors. Sandbox has also assembled an enviable cast of advisers, including former Alphabet Chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt; Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan Chase exec who helped create credit default swaps; and John Seely Brown, the former chief scientist of Xerox PARC. Notably, too, Sandbox is rolling out with an undisclosed amount of ""nine-figure"" funding. Among its new outside investors is Breyer Capital, whose founder, Jim Breyer, has also joined Sandbox's board of advisers. Section 32, Guggenheim Investments, TIME Investments and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates are also in the investor mix. Seemingly, burgeoning market demand partly explains Alphabet's decision to spin out Sandbox. According to Gartner, by next year, 20% of global organizations are expected to budget for quantum-computing projects, up from less than 1% in 2018. Among the customers already paying Sandbox for its computing power are Vodafone Business, SoftBank Mobile and the Mount Sinai Health System. But judging by a recent chat with Breyer, perhaps an even bigger driver of growing interest in quantum tech is the realization is that, while true, fault-tolerant quantum computing -- meaning the ability to harness quantum physics to zip through numerous possibilities and determine a probable outcome -- could be five or more years away, other related tech, like so-called quantum-sensing technologies -- is fast becoming a reality. Indeed, rather than work on quantum computers, Sandbox is instead focused on how quantum tech intersects with AI, developing applications to strengthen cybersecurity platforms, among other things. In the company's own words, ""[T]here are many aspects of quantum physics and technology that can be commercialized in the near term with no need for quantum computers … using today's high-performance computers."" The resulting ""quantum simulations can address real-world business and scientific challenges across a broad spectrum of industries, from financial services and healthcare to aerospace and manufacturing to communications and materials science.""  The statements echo comments made by Breyer when we spoke a couple of weeks ago, when he told us that there are ""tremendous national security opportunities for the quantum companies … But what I'm really excited about today from an investment standpoint is not necessarily the big super capital intensive quantum computers … but areas like quantum sensing."" Think of a very high-powered 1,000x light microscope that can be applied to medicine, Breyer had offered by way of explanation. ""There are quantum sensing technologies today that are being piloted at some of our great hospitals in the United States that I think will revolutionize areas such as cardiology [and] drug discovery."" Indeed, suggested Breyer, while quantum computing platforms will eventually play a role in helping catch diseases faster, improve security systems and to protect all kinds of data -- they might also be used to attack some of those systems, which is partly why larger organizations, including governments and corporations, are no longer waiting for those massive quantum computers to arrive -- or shouldn't be, in any case. ""We need to get our arms around it,"" he'd said. ""There are quantum technologies now where -- they're not at the breakout point of where quantum computing will be in four or five years -- but are making a very big difference,"" he said. The team at Sandbox, he suggested at the time, is among those leading the charge.",Business/TechCrunch•yesterday,"Alphabet just spun out out its quantum tech group, launching it as an independent company",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-spins-subsidiary-sign-times-212604627.html
3/24/2022,"The US and China may soon be locked in a recruitment battle for Taiwanese semiconductor talent as the two superpowers accelerate plans to ramp up domestic chip capacity, according to analysts and industry insiders. For China, the shortage of experienced talent is a major impediment to its goal of achieving self-sufficiency in semiconductors. A semi-official report published last November predicted that China would see a shortfall of 200,000 semiconductor experts by 2023, equal to about one in four positions in the industry not being filled. The situation has pushed China to aggressively woo engineers from Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. Taipei has responded by threatening to prosecute anyone who helps transfer chip expertise to mainland China. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. On the other side of the Pacific, Washington's initiative to boost semiconductor production on American soil has generated new-found demand for engineers with experience working in wafer foundries. William Hunt, an analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), said the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act will generate demand for skilled foundry workers that may be hard to find in the US, making it necessary to extend the search to Taiwan and South Korea. ""The United States should explore creating specialised visas for high-skilled workers with significant experience in semiconductor manufacturing and engineering,"" Hunt said. ""The main priority here is to reduce existing barriers to immigration for workers with skills relevant to US national security."" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's No 1 wafer foundry, is building an advanced 5-nanometre chip fab in Arizona, while in November last year South Korea's Samsung Electronics unveiled a plan to build an advanced US$17 billion fab in Texas, which would create over 2,000 jobs. Separately, Pat Gelsinger, the chief executive of US chip giant Intel, has promised the company would build multiple mega-fabs at home if it receives subsidies under the US$52 billion CHIPS act. Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of Intel Corp. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of Intel Corp. Photo: Bloomberg> CSET estimates that 27,000 wafer fab job vacancies may be created in the US over the next decade, of which some 3,500 would need to be filled by foreign-born workers. In a report published this month, CSET recommended that ""US policymakers consider establishing an accelerated immigration pathway for experienced fab workers - perhaps specifically for Taiwanese or South Korean workers seeking to work in newly constructed fabs in the US"". That could be bad news for China, especially when its efforts to lure engineers from outside the mainland are already facing growing resistance from Taipei. Taiwan last month tightened controls over its hi-tech know-how. Under new regulations, ""economic spies"" caught stealing or leaking intellectual property to mainland China and Hong Kong could face 12 years in jail and fines of up to NT$100 million (US$3.59 million). Taiwanese engineers who were educated in the US but trained in local fabs like those operated by TSMC have been a major source of know-how for the development of China's chipmaking industry. However, anecdotal evidence points to a slowdown in the flow of such talent from Taiwan to the mainland. The number of outbound Taiwanese workers going to the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau - in all sectors - declined for the seventh consecutive year in 2020. A recent high-profile departure from China's chip industry was Sun Shih-Wei, the former vice chairman and CEO of Taiwan's No 2 foundry United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), who resigned as general manager at XMC, a NOR flash manufacturer in Wuhan, Hebei province, according to Taiwan media reports this week. Sun's departure came on the heels of the resignation of Chiang Shang-yi, another Taiwan semiconductor veteran, from the vice chairmanship of China's top chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, late last year. At the same time Taipei is making it harder for the island's tech talent to job hop to the Chinese mainland, it is engaged in value chain cooperation with the US, with both sides setting up a Technology Trade and Investment Collaboration framework at the end of 2021 to ""explore actions to strengthen critical supply chains"". Arisa Liu, a senior semiconductor research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said Taipei is unlikely to prevent the island's top talent from working in the US, in contrast to its efforts to punish those who contribute to the brain drain in the other direction. ""Taiwan should pay more attention to US efforts in poaching our talent in the future,"" Liu said. Although America's share of global chipmaking capacity has declined to 12 per cent currently from 37 per cent in 1990, the US semiconductor industry employs over 270,000 workers, and supports 1.6 million people indirectly, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. In contrast, China had 541,000 people directly employed in the industry in 2020, including a third in chip manufacturing, and total chip sector jobs could reach 766,500 by 2023, according to the China Semiconductor Industry Association. To try and alleviate its shortage, Chinese authorities have been creating semiconductor engineering schools across the country and local governments, including the city of Shanghai, are offering generous incentives to woo semiconductor talent to work locally. However, the talent shortage won't be going away any time soon. SMIC founder Richard Chang Rugin said in a speech last year that China's biggest challenge in its semiconductor drive was not lack of money or policy support - it was lack of experienced people. Regardless, given the common language and cultural background, as well as proximity, mainland China will remain a favoured destination for Taiwanese chip engineers. CSET's Hunt believes China will continue to be active in luring these much-needed engineers for its own chip factories.

Officials increased the key, 28-day Leliq rate by 200 basis points to 44.5%, according to a statement. The announcement comes after President Alberto Fernandez declared a “war on inflation” last week, adding days later that the government will take “all necessary measures” to combat price increases. Government data last week showed consumer prices in February rose 4.7% from January, the fastest monthly pace in nearly a year and the third straight month of higher inflation. Raising borrowing costs above Argentina’s 52% annual inflation rate is a pillar of the monetary policy the government agreed upon in its pending program with the International Monetary Fund. Tuesday’s rate increase boosts the effective annual rate, which accounts for compounded interest, to 53.3%. Policy makers at the central bank consider that the effective annual rate is the one that needs to exceed inflation to comply with the IMF’s goal of positive rates. After not raising borrowing costs for a year despite high inflation, the government’s IMF agreement has made the central bank shift its inflation strategy. Along with raising rates, the monetary authority has committed to printing less money this year to finance government spending.

3/24/2022,"Contrary to popular belief, high-skill professions may be more susceptible to replacement by artificial intelligence, according to Future Today Institute CEO Amy Webb. “We did a short study trying to assess which jobs were most at risk, but also which ones stand to gain,” Webb told Yahoo Finance Live. “I really think that the business community has gotten this wrong over the past 10 years or so. You know, it's not the blue collar jobs that are going to go away first. It's not truckers, it's not plumbers, and that's because there's too much variability.” Plumbing is one of the types of jobs least likely to be replaced in any significant way by automation in the near future, Webb said. “We've got too many different types of toilets,” she explained. “So there's no finely tuned, finely articulated robot that's going to work on its own yet. It's the knowledge jobs that are going to find that they are either obviated or reduced to some capacity.” Some of the occupations which AI is projected to have the largest impact include office workers, paralegals, customer support, software developers, advertising, and even journalism. You can rest assured that this story was written by a real person, and not advanced artificial intelligence, but forecasters generally expect to see significantly greater AI contribution within journalism within the next decade. AI is primarily used to cut down on variable costs and help with information gathering, especially at large news organizations, according to The Knight Foundation, a journalism and arts non-profit. Other roles which require high levels of education and training, such as lawyers and other legal professionals, could also be exposed to automation as computer learning becomes more advanced. “That actually has profound implications on law firms, professional services agencies, and a lot of consulting groups, which are built using a more pyramid model,” Webb said. “We automate some of our research now, and we use AI to do some of it. So again, I think that if you can re-perceive [automation], that's going to help you get a better understanding of what's happening and help you make bigger bets, better bets on the future.” Automation won’t necessarily displace workers, even as it eliminates jobs, the Future Today Institute’s 2022 Emerging Tech report on AI noted. Certain processes may be automated to free employees up to work on other, human-oriented tasks and save time. “RPA can automate certain tasks and processes within offices and allow employees to spend time on higher-value work,” the report found. “It’s the most commonly deployed AI technique among enterprise companies.” Ihsaan Fanusie is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has spent more on share buybacks than any other tech firm since the sector’s downturn began.

The Hangzhou-based firm unveiled a plan on Tuesday to boost its buyback plan to $25 billion -- the third increase since Beijing’s tech crackdown started in late 2020. The stock’s lackluster performance reflects lingering worries about the impact of China’s crackdown, which has left virtually no corner of Alibaba’s core business untouched. It also mirrors the broader weakness in Chinese equities, where a fresh virus outbreak and slowing economic growth have hurt sentiment. To be sure, Alibaba’s shares jumped as much as 9.8% to HK$108.80 in Hong Kong on Tuesday after the buyback was announced. But, that’s still a distance from the peak of HK$267 reached in February last year.

Cardano’s ADA led gains among major cryptocurrencies with a nearly 7% jump in the past 24 hours. Polkadot’s DOT surged 6.5%, while Ripple's XRP and Solana’s SOL each increased 5%. Bitcoin climbed above $43,000 at one point overnight, but has pulled back to $42,900 at press time, still ahead 4% for the day. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to see major resistance at about the $44,500 level, having fallen back from there four times this year. “Altcoins have a very strong correlation with BTC,” explained Egor Volotkovich, director at yield farming platform EVODeFi, in a Telegram message. “The growth surge in the cryptocurrency accounts for why these altcoins are also trading positively today.” The move in bitcoin came even as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Monday about rising inflation and suggested the U.S. central bank is willing to raise rates more aggressively. “A more aggressive increase in rates raises the chance of a recession, as it will slow growth more,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk. “In my opinion, they will not raise rates by more than 25 basis points until September at the earliest, as the Federal Reserve will try their best to avoid a recession.” Ether (ETH) rose to and held above $3,000 on Tuesday as ""Kiln"" – expected to be the final testnet before Ethereum is “merged” to a staking network – was deployed last week. Staking involves users locking up their tokens to validate transactions on the network, and stakers have locked up over 10 million ether on the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, as previously reported. Locked ether effectively takes freely traded ether from the open market while reducing circulating supply, possibly a bullish catalyst for the price.

Generally speaking, recent green bars could mean more upside is ahead. Now, let’s check out technical action grabbing my attention: 1-month outperformance vs. Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (+13.0% vs. XLB) Outperformance is important for leading stocks. Next, it’s a good idea to check under the hood. Meaning, I want to make sure the fundamental story is strong too.

3/24/2022,"When markets turn volatile, it’s natural to look for some signal to cut through the additional noise and to clarify the stocks that are set for long-term gains. One signal that some investors latch onto is the trend of insider trading. CEOs, CFOs, COOs, and Board members all have access to the deeper workings of their companies, and their positions hold them responsible for company performance. This gives them a vested stake in the company – and it also gives them a much clearer view of their companies’ potential stock performance. To level the playing field, Federal regulators require that the insiders publish their trades in a timely fashion, and this makes it possible for the retail investor to see what the insiders are doing. Against this backdrop, we’ve used the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, from TipRanks, to look up details on three stocks that have recently attracted substantial ‘informative buys’ from their company officers. All three are also considered ‘Strong Buys’ by the consensus of the Wall Street analysts. Let’s dig a little deeper, to find out what else should bring them to our attention. Natera (NTRA) We’ll start with Natera, a leader in the medical testing realm. Natera focuses on cell-free DNA, or cfDNA, testing; that is, doing genetic tests based on fragments of the subject’s DNA floating freely in the bloodstream. The company has several testing platforms, including Panorama as a set of non-invasive pre-natal tests; Signatera, a set of tumor-specific assay tests to generate individualized cancer treatments; and Prospera, a set of best-in-class organ tests, to screen for rejection before transplant surgeries. The Texas-based company has expanded its operational footprint to 90 countries around the world, and boasts over 3 million cfDNA tests performed in total. While Natera’s business boomed in 2021, the company’s net loss grew deeper. Natera generated $173 million in revenue in 4Q21, up 54% year-over-year. This included a 51% increase in product revenues. For the full year of 2021, the company recorded $625.5 million at the top line, a 60% increase from the previous year. During the year, Natera processed over 1.45 million cfDNA tests. This was up 51% from the 961K tests processed in 2020. At the same time that revenues were increasing, Natera recorded deeper net losses. For 4Q21, the company reported negative EPS of $1.48. This was a loss increase of 66% compared to 4Q20. For all of 2021, Natera’s net loss came to $5.21 per share, nearly double the $2.84 net EPS loss from the pre-corona year of 2019. For investors following the insider moves, Natera this month has seen several important developments. First, the company was accused early in the month of deceptive billing practices. This allegation prompted a major sell-off of NTRA shares – it also prompted the company to decisively rebut the charges the next day. This issue has not yet been resolved; the company points out that the allegation was made by a short-seller research firm. A week after the billing allegations, on March 14, the company announced that all top execs, including the CEO, CFO, COO, the co-founder, and the executive chairman, plus the non-employee members of the Board, will take the remainder of their 2022 salaries in company stock rather than cash. The company promoted the move as a vote of confidence by insiders in the stock. Within days of that announcement, Roelof Botha, the lead independent director of the Board, spent over $5 million to pick up 153,000 shares. Assessing the recent allegations, BTIG analyst Mark Massaro noted, ""We think [the] weakness in the stock was overblown... NTRA management decisively refuted all the allegations, which helps to alleviate some of our concerns... We think that the most likely scenarios range from NTRA avoiding any fault in this matter at all, to potentially NTRA possibly paying a settlement agreement in the event a formal investigation occurs."" To this end, Massaro gives Natera stock a Buy rating, and his $100 price target indicates his confidence in a one-year upside of 152%. (To watch Massaro’s track record, click here.) Overall, Wall Street remains bullish here, with the 10 recent reviews breaking down 9 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $39.25 and their $103.75 average target implies an upside of ~164% for the year ahead. (See NTRA stock forecast on TipRanks) Vita Coco Company (COCO) Next up on our list of insider buys is Vita Coco, a small-cap ($510 million) beverage company focused on the creation, marketing, and distribution of coconut-based beverages and other drinks in the healthy foods market. The company has several brands, including its flagship Vita Coco, the energy drink Runa, a protein-infused water called PWR LIFT, and Ever & Ever, a sustainable enhanced water. Vita Coco boasts that it holds a 46% share in the US market for coconut water and coconut beverages – share greater than its 10 largest competitors put together. Vita Coco went public in the fall of 2021, with an IPO that saw the company put 11.5 million shares on the market. Of that total, 9 million shares were sold by existing investors and 2.5 million were sold directly by the company. The initial price of $15 per share was below the expected range of $18 to $21 each. Even at the lower price, Vita Coco raised $173 million in the IPO. During the corona crisis, Vita Coco reported a spike in sales, as consumers stocked up on bottled beverages – and showed a preference for healthier options. In 2021, the company reported that sales continued strong, with a 22% year-over-year gain to $380 million. This was driven by 39% growth in the Vita Coco brand of coconut water. The company reported full-year net income of $19 million, or 35 cents per share, in 2021. Turning to the insiders, we find that Vita Coco’s Co-CEO and Board member Martin Roper last week bought over $875K worth of company stock – a purchase of 100,000 shares in the company. Roper now owns over 435,000 shares of COCO. Evercore analyst Robert Ottenstein sees this company in a sound position for future growth, and writes, “Consumer migration to products perceived as contributing to a healthy lifestyle, and the demographic engine of Hispanic and Asian American population growth will continue to benefit COCO’s brands and no beverage category can claim greater authenticity than coconut water. COCO’s understanding of the category, along with its irreplicable supply chain, have allowed it to beat out brands from much larger companies and maintain its commanding market share.” In line with his bullish outlook, Ottenstein rates COCO an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $15 price target implies a one-year upside of ~63%. (To watch Ottenstein’s track record, click here) The Evercore stance is hardly the only bullish view out there, as the shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating supported by a 3-1 breakdown of Buys over Holds. The stock is selling for $9.18 and its $12.50 average price target suggests a 36% upside from that level. (See COCO stock forecast on TipRanks) Mission Produce (AVO) The last stock we’ll look at here is Mission Produce, a small-cap company that has been a major player in the global avocado market for over 35 years. Mission handles both sourcing and production of avocados, as well as distribution, for a wide network of retail, wholesale, and foodservice customers, and four major packing facilities. The company has operations in California, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa, and its distribution centers offer additional services including ripening, bagging, packaging, and logistics. Mission also owns over 10,000 acres of growing space, distributed around the world to take advantage of differently timed growing seasons. In addition to avocados, Mission also deals in mangos. Earlier this month, Mission released its financial report for Q1 of fiscal year 2022. The report showed an 18% decrease in the volume of avocados sold, which was more than compensated by a 50% increase in average selling prices compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Total revenues in the quarter came to $216.6 million, up 25% y/y. Despite the increase in revenue, the company reported a drop in earnings, from 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter to a 19-cent net loss in the current report. Shares in AVO fell more than 20% after the earnings release. On the insider front, Stephen Barnard, President and CEO of Mission Produce, purchased 25,000 shares of AVO in the middle of this month, paying over $293,000 for the stock. Despite the low current share price, Stephens analyst Ben Bienvenu believes that AVO is a stock to watch. He writes: “We think the stock is attractive for long-term oriented investors. With volumes poised to recover as we rotate into a new source of supply, we'd expect results to improve as we pivot into the second half of AVO's fiscal year and beyond. The secular volume growth story is intact, the company's leading position in the market place is intact, and we think LT shareholder value will be realized.” Bienvenu sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on AVO, commensurate with his comments above, and his $20 price target suggests the stock has room for a 70% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Bienvenu’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street tends to agree with the bull. The 4 recent share reviews include 3 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $19 average price target indicates a 61% upside potential from the current share price of $11.78.

3/24/2022,"By Anne Kauranen HELSINKI (Reuters) - The initial impact of the European Union's sanctions against Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine has led to a greater drop in trade between Finland and Russia than when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Finland's Customs said on Wednesday. Finnish Customs recorded a roughly 60% drop in both imports from Russia and exports from Finland to Russia in the last two weeks compared with the previous two weeks before the EU began to impose sanctions, Director of Statistics at Finnish Customs Olli-Pekka Penttila told Reuters. ""In the 1990s there were no sanctions, payment transactions functioned and there were no reputational risks (for companies). Now all these three are reality and it means that the impact is certainly bigger than it was in the 1990s,"" Penttila said. She said financial sanctions were having a greater impact than export sanctions, with the biggest impact resulting from reputational risks as Western companies withdraw voluntarily from Russia to avoid being reprimanded by clients for staying. The greatest drops have been in goods under sanctions, such as machinery, equipment and electric appliances, but even trade in goods theoretically unaffected, including paper, cardboard and energy products, has also dwindled, the data showed. The biggest impact on imports from Russia has resulted from voluntary decisions. Finnish refiner Neste for instance has replaced some of its crude imports from Russia with Norwegian oil. Finnish forestry groups UPM and Stora Enso have stopped buying Russian wood as international certifiers labelled it ""conflict timber"". Last year, the Finnish forest industry imported some 9 million cubic metres of wood or around 10% of its annual consumption from Russia, Finnish Natural Resources Institute data showed. EU sanctions against iron and steel imports will also have an impact but took effect only last week, meaning their full extent had yet to show up in the data. Traded volumes are likely to keep falling as Russian imports continuing under long-term contracts will end. In addition, the EU could add more sanctions if the war drags on.

3/24/2022,"Bridgewater Associates wants to increase its exposure to digital assets. The $150 billion hedge fund will not be buying cryptocurrencies directly. Billionaire Ray Dalio had previously advised investors to allocate a small portion of their portfolios to BTC. The world’s largest hedge fund is readying investments in an “external vehicle” and won’t be dabbling directly in the crypto-asset markets. Billionaire Ray Dalio’s fund currently has $150 billion in assets under management (AUM), and it wants a slice of the digital asset pie. The man admitted to owning some Bitcoin (BTC) last year, so the move has not been unexpected. However, according to reports, the size of Bridgewater’s crypto-related investments is tiny compared to its AUM figure. In January, the company released a report on the “Evolution of Institutional Investors’ Exposure to Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technologies,” signaling that it was actively researching the space. A Bridgewater spokesperson confirmed this in February, telling CoinDesk, “While we won’t comment on our positions, we can say Bridgewater continues to actively research crypto but is not currently planning on investing in crypto.” Sources did not elaborate on the details this time around, however. Last month they said Bridgewater is in a first-half plan this year before adding that they planned to have a “small slug of their fund” deployed directly into digital assets. Another person familiar with the firm’s crypto investment strategy said, “Bridgewater is looking to get involved. They are doing serious diligence: liquidity, service providers, and whatnot.” The report added that the firm is following a similar path to hedge funds Marshall Wace, Point72, and Brevan Howard, reportedly making forays into the crypto sector last year. Ray Dalio cautioned that cryptocurrencies were getting too much attention from regulators in January. However, the billionaire also suggested that investors allocate 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin in the same month. Institutional interest in crypto assets has increased over the past year, and markets have generally remained range-bound for most of 2022. Over the past 24 hours, total market capitalization has gained 1.8% to $1.97 trillion. However, it is still down around 36% from its November peak. Bitcoin has added 1.9% on the day to trade at $41,766 at the time of writing, adding to the 5.3% it has made over the past week.

3/24/2022,"Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a few things flowing in his veins. One, an admirable work ethic that sees him pushing his own physical boundaries each day. Think working to near exhaustion (yes, for real, as the stories on Levchin are told). And two, financial services — which perhaps harkens back to Levchin arriving to the United States in 1991 from Ukraine as a teenager in search of the American Dream, with little money at first. ""I came to the U.S. as a teenager, I had no credit history, my parents had an immigrant history, we had no ownership of anything. And so trying to borrow money was completely out of options for us. And so when I got to college, I got a credit card on campus because that's what we did back then, and promptly misunderstood how minimum payments work and got my FICO score trashed. So all the sort of classic immigrant mistakes and like. I understand how the system works, but I needed money. You know, I'm guilty of every one of those things,"" Levchin told Yahoo Finance Presents. Fast forward to present day. Levchin is 46 years old. He is a husband, a father of two young children, the co-founder of PayPal and the founder of Affirm. Despite the impressive resume — which has seen his net worth surge to more than $1.2 billion, according to Forbes — Levchin is back trying to take the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector to the next level by way of Affirm. ""I did financial services as my first kind of a real project with PayPal. I wandered through the desert for a while and came back to financial services at the urging of my brilliant wife. She said you're good at one thing, go do that thing. I probably am just going to stick to that one thing. Financial services is what I'm good at,"" Levchin explained. Affirm is now 10 years old. The company went public in early January 2021. Shares priced at $49, then skyrocketed to $100 by the close of the first day of trading in part because of the strong rep of Levchin and optimism around the surging BNPL space. By late November, Affirm's stock hit $168 a share intraday. The company landed deals with Amazon, Apple and Shopify. It even revealed its desire to enter the crypto and debit card space. Win after win seemingly piled up, overshadowing the fact regulators were starting to eye the industry's business model. And on top of that Affirm still wasn't profitable. The backdrop has changed a little so far in 2022, however. As of this article, Affirm's stock is around $42 — well off its record highs north of $160 from 2021. The company's most recent quarter surprised some on the Street as the Amazon deal will be more lucrative over time than immediately upfront. The company also continues to invest aggressively in its business to support future growth, which is still placing pressure on the bottom line. Affirm has done its part to keep the bull thesis intact. The company recently lifted its quarterly outlook, and CFO Michael Linford struck a bullish tone in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live. Levchin acknowledges it has been a wild ride, but he doesn't regret taking Affirm public. And he believes Affirm will be profitable. ""So I do think it's my responsibility and the company's responsibility to make money. Like we're not a charity, we never declared ourselves to be nonprofits. So I do not want to mislead anyone into believing that we do not intend to make money. We very much intend to make money, and hopefully lots of it and continue to do so for shareholders forever and ever. And we intend to be a self sustaining business,"" Levchin explains. ""And at the moment, in terms of pure profitability vision we intend to get to sustainability breakeven, whatever you want to call it, and continue investing into this business until we're out of great ideas. And I think that some great companies of record are doing exactly that, most notably, Amazon. For years, they were being told by Wall Street, why don't you go print some dividends? Why don't you, you know, post some profits? And I think their answer has always been, there's a lot to do, and I need the capital to invest in that doing. And so that is the plan for me as well. We can absolutely get profitable, and we will for sure."" To put a finer point on his belief, Levchin —who held approximately 29% of the total voting power of Affirm's common stock as of October 1, 2021 — hasn't sold a single share of his stock. ""I have never sold a share of Affirm. In fact, I bought shares of Affirm all through the history of the company, in addition to my founder grant. So I'm obviously fairly bullish, very bullish on my stock,"" added Levchin. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

3/24/2022,"There's more to retirement planning than just saving your money. Wealth accumulation is a vital component of a successful plan, but it's only half of the calculus. How you withdraw your hard-earned savings over the course of retirement is nearly equally as important. JPMorgan Asset Management announced the launch of a new tool to help retirees do just that. The financial services giant is rolling out enhancements to its suite of SmartRetirement target date funds, including annual recommended withdrawal amounts designed to help retirees stretch their nest eggs up to 35 years into retirement. For help with retirement planning, consider working with a fiduciary financial advisor. Find an advisor who serves your area today. New Tool For Retirement Withdrawals JPMorgan's series of target date funds, SmartRetirement and SmartRetirement Blend, will be managed to allow investors to withdraw a portion of their holdings each year until the target maturity year, which will be set for 35 year after retirement, the company announced Monday. Investors with money in these target date funds can use the firm's SmartRetirement Illustrator to generate their sample withdrawal amount: an estimate of how much of a participant's account balance can be safely withdrawn in a given year while preserving future withdrawals through the fund's target maturity year. The estimates will be based on market conditions as of Jan. 1 and the fund's underlying strategy. However, they will not consider a shareholder's age, financial needs, risk tolerance or required minimum distributions (RMDs) into account. The company said the new spending capabilities were developed using JPMorgan's access to spending data from nearly half of U.S. households. ""Retirees are increasingly looking to their employers to help them plan their income needs in retirement, and through our access to real-world spending data across JPMorgan Chase, we are uniquely positioned to build this innovative solution to help Americans navigate retirement,"" Andrea Lisher, head of Americas Client for JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a statement. ""Through integrating retirement income into our award-winning SmartRetirement target date series, we are not only helping people build adequate savings during their working years, but also giving them confidence to spend down in retirement."" Will It Allay the Top Retirement Fear? When workers and current retirees are asked about their fears in retirement, running out of money is consistently among the most common responses, if not the most common. A TransAmerica survey of over 3,100 workers in late 2020 found that ""outliving my savings and investments"" was the No. 1 retirement fear, followed by ""declining health that requires long-term care."" According to JPMorgan's research, nearly seven out of 10 defined contribution plan participants are concerned about outliving their money in retirement. As a result, 85% say that they would likely leave their assets in their plans in retirement if there was an option to help generate monthly retirement income. These statistics not only underscore the importance of saving, but the time and energy required for planning your withdrawals. While there are a number of strategies aimed at stretching retirees' savings across a time horizon of 25 to 30, their complexity can make them difficult for the average person to implement. That's where a financial advisor can be a valuable asset in the retirement planning process. But JPMorgan's SmartRetirement Illustrator can be a good place to start when it comes to planning how you'll spend your retirement savings. Bottom Line Outliving their savings is perhaps the top retirement fear that workers face as they approach their golden years. JPMorgan has integrated new spending tools into its SmartRetirement target date funds to help retirees make annual withdrawals and preserve their savings for up to 35 years. While these suggestions don't take a shareholder's RMD obligations into account, they are based on market conditions and the overall investment strategy of a given fund. Tips for Retirement Planning A financial advisor can help you save for retirement and make a plan for withdrawing your assets. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. Did you know the formula for calculating RMDs recently changed for the first time in decades? With the IRS raising the average life expectancy from 82.4 to 84.6, RMDs that begin in 2022 will be less than they were under the previous formula, which had been in place since 2002. That's good news for retirees. Are you on track to hit your savings goals? SmartAsset's retirement calculator can help you estimate how much money you'll have by the time you're ready to retire.

3/24/2022,"By Megan Davies NEW YORK (Reuters) -Russia's coupon payment on a sovereign bond maturing in 2029 was processed by correspondent bank JPMorgan Chase & Co, a source said on Monday, the second time in recent days the country appears to have averted default. Russia had been due to make a $66 million payment to bondholders on Monday on the bond. Last week, it paid interest due on two sovereign bonds, easing doubts about its willingness and ability to honor external debt after harsh sanctions were imposed by Western nations following its invasion of Ukraine. Making the payment meant Russia avoided its first default, for now, since a 1998 financial crisis and its first on international bonds since the 1917 revolution. JPMorgan worked on Monday with the U.S. Treasury Department on necessary approvals, the source familiar with the situation said. The payment had moved on to the next step before the money is handed over to bondholders, the source added. Reuters could not learn which bank was acting as the payment agent on the bond. Last week, JPMorgan processed the payment as correspondent bank and handed it to Citigroup Inc, which as payment agent distributed the funds on to bondholders. Russia has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia. The country's next test is a $102 million payment on March 28 and after that on March 31 there is a $447 million payment that must be made in dollars. Its biggest payment of the year — and its first full repayment of ""principal"", of $2 billion — is due on April 4. Even if Russia is willing to pay, there may be complications in the coming weeks and months, especially for bonds that must be serviced in dollars, after a temporary license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control expires on May 25. Russia will still have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year. If Russia does not make any of its bond payments within their defined grace periods, or pays in roubles where dollars or euros are specified, it will be a default. Russia's rouble on Monday steadied and OFZ treasury bonds returned to trading, although in a volatile fashion. Stocks and bonds last traded on the Moscow Exchange on Feb. 25 and the central bank has yet to say when trading in equities can resume. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation.""

3/24/2022,"Adobe beats analyst estimates on both earnings and revenue.  The company’s weak Q2 guidance is the main reason for today’s sell-off.  The stock needs positive catalysts or additional support from the general market rebound to break the current downside trend.  Shares of Adobe  gained downside momentum after the company released its quarterly report. The company reported revenue of $4.26 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.37 per share, beating analyst estimates on both earnings and revenue. While Adobe managed to beat analyst estimates, the report did not provide support to the stock, which made an attempt to settle below the $427 level. The market ignored the company’s quarterly results and focused on Adobe’s guidance for the second quarter. The company expects to report revenue of $4.36 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.30 per share, below analyst estimates. Analysts expect that Adobe will report earnings of $13.78 per share in 2022 and earnings of $16.26 per share in 2023, so the stock is trading at 26 forward P/E for 2023. This is not expensive for Adobe stock, which touched highs near the $700 level back in November 2021, and has already lost almost 40% of its value since then. However, concerns about slowing growth may push the stock even lower. The market is worried about aggressive rate hikes from the Fed, so traders are very sensitive to guidance from tech companies. The second-quarter revenue and earnings forecast from Adobe shows that no growth is expected, which is bearish for the stock. It should be noted that the near-term dynamics of Adobe stock will also depend on general market mood. The recent rebound of S&P 500 provided significant support to Adobe shares. In case this rebound continues, Adobe stock may get some support despite its disappointing second-quarter guidance. For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

3/24/2022,"Recently, the Chinese EV space has been beset by several worrying developments. Morgan Stanley’s Tim Hsiao counts “geopolitical tensions, pervasive Covid curbs and ADR de-listing risks” which have further impacted EV start-ups already struggling with operational challenges such as disruptions to the supply of chips, batteries and other elements. Rising EV manufacturing costs which will result in higher prices could also mean EV sales will take a hit. However, given the “continuous innovation,” in the space, Hsiao sees this headwind fading over time. Additionally, China’s policies toward EVs are highly favorable with the sector forming a big part of the 5%+ GDP growth the country has targeted. As such, while Hsiao thinks smaller EV players might not be able to survive against the “gloomy macro backdrop,” bigger well-funded companies such as Nio (NIO) should be able to whether the current headwinds. Furthermore, the recent secondary listing in Hong King also helps mitigate the worry of a US delisting. That said, based on the latest developments, there are several adjustments to Hsiao’s model. Mainly based on the macro slowdown which could put some pressure on the sale of luxury vehicles, the analyst’s volume estimate for 2022 is slashed by 8% to 165,000 units. Additionally, with legacy OEMs accelerating the move to hybrid offerings (both HEV and PHEV), that could potentially delay the “holistic BEV transition,” Hsiao has also cut his longer-term volume estimates (towards 2030) by 3-7%. Also, to account for a more “cautious view on emerging markets as well as the consumption slowdown,” Hsiao has increased the China equity risk premium from 2% to 4%. “Our risk premium assumption is on par with our assumption for other traditional OEMs despite the ADR de-listing overhang, as we believe this is largely hedged by the H-share listing,” the analyst explained. The result of all the above is a reduction to the price target, which drops from $66 to $34. Nevertheless, there’s still upside of 56% from current levels. Hsiao’s rating stays an Overweight (i.e., Buy). (To watch Hsiao’s track record, click here) It’s mostly Buys from the rest of the Street’s analysts too – 11, in total - and with two additional Holds, the consensus view is that this stock is a Strong Buy. The average price target is more bullish than Hsiao will allow; at $48.59, the figure suggests one-year gains of 123%.

The firm upgraded Altria stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral,"" and upped its price target to $57 from $48, saying that it's better positioned than competitor Philip Morris International (PM), thanks to its defensive, domestic-focused business. Coming into today, analysts were hesitant toward Altria Group stock. Of the nine in coverage, six carried a ""hold"" rating on the equity, with three recommending a ""strong buy."" Meanwhile, MO's 12-month consensus price target of $54.61 is a 3.2% premium to current levels of trading. Call traders are taking notice of the bull note, too. At the halfway point, 31,000 calls have already crossed the tape, which is double what's typically seen at this point and around seven times the amount of puts traded today. New positions are also being bought to open at the most popular contract, the weekly 3/25 54-strike call. Drilling down, it looks as if one investor bought 2,000 contracts on the April 55 call for a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of 22 cents. If this is the case, breakeven for the call buyer at the close on Friday, April 14, is $54.78 (strike less premium paid). It’s also worth noting Altria stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) sits at 88 out of 100, meaning the equity has exceeded option traders' volatility expectations during the past year. On the charts, MO was last seen up 1.4% to trade at $52.99, and earlier rose to $53.96 -- its highest level of trading since May 2019.

3/24/2022,"By David Gaffen NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices jumped 5% to over $121 a barrel on Wednesday as disruptions to Russian and Kazakh crude exports via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline added to worries over tight global supplies. The situation adds to market worries about the ripple effect of heavy sanctions on Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, after its invasion of Ukraine. The CPC pipeline is a significant supply line for global markets, carrying around 1.2 million barrels per day of Kazakhstan's main crude grade, or 1.2% of global demand. Brent crude futures settled up $6.12, or 5.3%, to $121.60, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $5.66, or 5.2%, to $114.93 a barrel. Oil benchmarks have been steadily rallying since Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago in what it calls a ""special operation"" and United States and its allies slapped heavy sanctions on that nation, disrupting worldwide oil trade. Russia exports between 4 million and 5 million barrels of crude every day, making it the world's second-largest exporter behind Saudi Arabia. Analysts have varying estimates of how much oil will be unable to make it to market. ""There’s a growing consensus that the de facto ban on Russian oil purchases has resulted in a supply disruption of 2 to 3 million barrels a day, and until the world can figure out how to replace that oil we’re going to march on higher until demand destruction takes place,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Crude oil exports from Kazakhstan's CPC terminal on Russia's Black Sea coast stopped fully on Wednesday after damage caused by a major storm and continued bad weather, a port ship agent and the head of CPC said. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak later said that oil supplies by the CPC may be completely stopped for up to two months. U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce more Russian sanctions when he meets European leaders on Thursday in Brussels, including an emergency meeting of NATO. European Union member countries remain split on whether to ban imports of Russian crude and oil products after both Canada and the United States said they would ban imports from Russia, and Britain said it would wind down such purchases. ""If there was any expectation that the war was dwindling it's not the case,"" said Claudio Galimberti, senior vice president of analysis at Rystad Energy. ""You can expect further tightness in the markets."" U.S. crude stocks fell 2.5 million barrels last week, government data showed, compared with expectations for a modest increase. Crude production remained flat at 11.6 million barrels per day for the seventh straight week. Producers in the United States have been boosted drilling, but output has been slow to respond.

3/24/2022,"– Local Bounti (NYSE: LOCL) is an “agtech” operator focusing sustainable production, delivery of fresh produce – Went public through SPAC last year; PIPE investors included Cargill Inc., still involved on debt side – $30 bln TAM for U.S. vegetables and herbs by 2025 – Uses proprietary hybrid vertical farming and greenhouse model called Stack & Flow – Greens grown without any soil, pesticides, fungicides or herbicides – Purchase of Pete’s expands reach of greenhouse-grown produce; customers include Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, Target – Scope to expand Pete’s capacity by 35%, suggesting revenue can reach $40 mln/yr soon By Jarrett Banks and John Jannarone Traditional outdoor farming has been bad for the planet in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as damage to the environment and wildlife. But until recently, no one had been able to crack the code on making environmentally-friendly indoor farming profitable. Meet Local Bounti (NYSE: LOCL), which focuses on the sustainable production and delivery of fresh produce. Founded in 2018 by co-CEOs Craig Hurlbert and Travis Joyner, the company uses proprietary technology to grow leafy greens such as romaine and butter lettuce along with herbs like cilantro and basil using 90% less land and water than traditional agricultural methods – all without pesticides or herbicides. Vertical farming has high yields but is very costly, while indoor greenhouses generate lower yields at a lower cost. The Hamilton, Montana-based company uses a combination of vertical farming and greenhouses—which it calls Stack & Flow Technology—that it can “bolt on” to acquisitions. And with a $30 billion dollar total addressable market for vegetables and herbs in the U.S. by 2025, the future is looking bright. Local Bounti is one of the few startups that went public via SPAC last year that exceeded its 2021 revenue projections, in addition to boasting an impressive 32% gross margin. The company raised $125 million via a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from major investors including agriculture giant Cargill Inc., which is providing $200 million in debt financing. With such backing, the company’s finances are on strong footing as it starts greenfield construction projects. And now, with this month’s purchase of farming peer Pete’s for $122.5 million, the company is poised to expand distribution to major food retailers such as Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons and Target. Indeed, the company will see a roughly 20x increase in its sales footprint overnight. Pete’s, based in Carpinteria, California, sells at roughly 10,000 retail locations across 35 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada. Local Bounti’s lettuce and herbs are currently distributed at 500 locations in nine states. The acquisition is also cementing its position in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) by giving it more greenhouses. The Pete’s deal is financially compelling. It already generates run-rate revenue of more than $30 million – giving the combined company a big jump start. What’s more, there is scope to expand Pete’s capacity by at least 35%, suggesting revenue can soon reach well over $40 million a year. And Pete’s is highly profitable, with a gross margin of more-than 45%. While the company didn’t disclose Ebitda margins, it is Ebitda positive. IPO Edge conservatively estimates a margin of 20%, suggesting $8 million of Ebitda. Assuming modest cost synergies, Pete’s effective Ebitda is roughly $10 million – indicating Local Bounti paid a reasonable 12x Ebitda for the business. And investors who buy shares of Local Bounti now are also getting a deal. Adjusted for the acquisition, which leaves the company with about $15.5 million of net debt, Local Bounti trades an enterprise value of $765 million, or just 1.7 times 2025 sales. The deal will be immediately accretive. Local Bounti has 12 of its own greenhouses and will gain three more from the merger, including one under construction. The company plans on utilizing Pete’s growing practices within its future facilities including its Pasco, Washington facility that is under construction. Local Bounti intends to co-develop the brands under a multi-brand strategy, with Pete’s positioned as a premium offering to the traditionally grown produce and Local Bounti positioned as an above-premium local product. The company also bolstered its leadership ranks last year, adding Kathleen Valiasek as chief financial officer and former Beyond Meat Inc. CFO Mark Nelson to its board. Co-CEO Craig Hurlbert has an energy background—having worked at General Electric and North American Energy Services—that has served him well in agtech because both are capital intensive, commodity-based businesses. While there are no immediate plans to move beyond leafy greens, the time could come down the road and there is certainly opportunity to license its technology to major agriculture players and it already has more than 50 patents. There’s also the potential for more M&A, including distressed agtech assets. With a mission to ‘bring our farm to your kitchen in the fewest food miles possible,’ Local Bounti is disrupting the cultivation and delivery of produce. The company is also bolstering its ESG credentials by giving back to each of the communities it serves. Local Bounti has a clear vision ahead with plans for international expansion, a subscription based service, new products and segments, as well as franchising and licensing. For the consumer, the brand recognition isn’t there yet for leafy greens—something that the company sees as an opportunity. With the acquisition of Pete’s, Local Bounti is demonstrating its unit economics focus, while enabling rapid scale in a capital efficient way. Bottom line: Pete’s de-risks the entire business and is good for the planet—something that investors will want to take a bite out of.

3/24/2022,"Investment in the metaverse and metaverse technology has grown significantly over the past year, with tech giants like Meta (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. According to ProShares Advisors Global Investment Strategist Simeon Hyman, metaverse presents an investment opportunity for individuals and institutions alike. “Today you have an immersive but not quite interconnected metaverse,” Hyman told Yahoo Finance Live. “There's already a half [a trillion] dollars being made in the metaverse. That's likely to double even in the context of just the near term [with] social media, interactive gaming, and live music, before we even get to the interconnected piece on the other side.” Hyman joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for stocks as the Fed raises interest rates and investing in the metaverse. ProShares recently launched its metaverse ETF (VERS) designed to give investment access to companies shaping the digital frontier. The VERS (pronounced “verse”) ETF tracks Solactive’s Metaverse Theme Index, which includes 40 companies across a broad range of industries — from data processors and software to social media and gaming — and utilizes algorithms to determine metaverse investment opportunity as it evolves. A few of the companies tracked include Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Roblox (RBLX), Microsoft, Meta, Snap Inc. (SNAP), and Unity (U). “It's really interesting, when you look at the basket of companies,” Hyman said. “It's almost like a timeline of innovation over the years, because companies like Microsoft are there, but so is NVIDIA, and of course Meta, but more recent companies like Roblox and even more recently than that, a company like Unity. So this is an evolving opportunity.” ProShares joins the likes of Roundhill Investments and their Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) in allowing investors to participate in the financial performance of companies making the push into metaverse. And with the Federal Reserve raising near-term interest rates by 25 basis points, with plans to pump the brakes further if surging inflation is not quelled, uncertainty remains in regard to metaverse investment as investors begin to favor value over growth stocks. However, Hyman believes that it is important for portfolios to maintain some level of exposure in the burgeoning tech sector to serve as a “bulwark against inflation and rising rates.” In this sense, he said that funds like ProShares’ metaverse ETF are forward-looking, although the companies included are already currently generating revenue within metaverse. “And, you know, what we've found over the last decade or so, is that some of these transformational thematic ideas can be very, very important parts of that growth piece of your equity portfolio,” he said.

3/24/2022,"While oil’s wild swings have captured the attention of consumers and the finance world alike, uranium mining ETFs have emerged as one of the best-performing segments since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM) has outperformed all other U.S.-listed nonlevered ETFs in the past 30 days with a 31.57% return, while the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) has posted a third-best 26.69% return, according to ETFLogic data. Russia’s assault and its isolation from Western economies is partially to blame. Russia accounted for approximately 6% of the world’s uranium exports in 2020, while Ukraine accounted for approximately 1.5% of global supply. The VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF (NLR) is up a muted 7.34% on the year, due in part to having a heavy weighting to energy utilities with nuclear plants instead of pure-play uranium mining operations. The acceleration of renewable energy plans from Western governments is also driving investment into uranium as part of a broader renewable energy mix, as Western governments seek to phase out their significant reliance on Russian oil and gas. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans earlier this week to increase nuclear use in the country from 16% of its current power mix to a quarter, including replacing several reactors due for age-related retirement. The White House also held a summit last week to explore the commercial viability of nuclear fusion as a replacement for fossil fuels. URA has added just shy of $450 million in assets this month to have $1.8 billion in assets under management as of Monday, while URNM with its higher average share price and expense ratio has added $171 million to have $989 million in AUM. Those are increases of 33% and 21%, respectively. URA Flows (For a larger view, click on the image above) URNM Flows (For a larger view, click on the image above) However, the gains are small compared to the triple-digit returns the funds generated after nuclear briefly took meme stock status last fall. URNM is in the process of being acquired by Toronto-based Sprott Asset Management as a complement to the firm’s existing physically backed uranium trust. That firm is also in the process of applying to list a new class of shares of that trust on U.S. markets later this year.

3/24/2022,"PRAGUE (Reuters) -Skoda Auto, part of the Volkswagen Group, said on Tuesday its supply partner in Ukraine had decided to restart production of wire harnesses which should allow the Czech carmaker to resume production of its electric ENYAQ iV model. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to supply chain problems for global automakers -- which were already struggling with semiconductor shortages that have cut production -- with a break in deliveries of wire harnesses from the war-torn country. While Skoda, the Czech Republic's biggest exporter, said it expects the supply of semiconductors to improve in the second half of 2022, it said the war in Ukraine and supply bottlenecks will put a significant burden on its operating business. Skoda's 2021 deliveries fell 12.6% year-on-year and earlier this month it stopped production of the ENYAQ because of harness shortages, saying that two other models were at risk because of the lack of availability of the component. ""Our partner...in Ukraine decided to restart production of wire harnesses this week, with full service and full security for workers there,"" Karsten Schnake, Skoda's board member for purchasing, said during its online 2021 earnings presentation. Wire harnesses form a key part of a car's electrical system, which group and guide cables inside the vehicle. ""We decided to double the production in case something is going wrong, and this production will be ramped up in an alternative factory,"" Schnake said, adding that work there would start in three or four weeks. ""Hopefully we can restart production of ENYAQ one or two weeks later when we have wire harnesses,"" Schnake said. Skoda delivered 878,200 cars worldwide in 2021, the first time that this had fallen below the 1 million mark since 2013. Nevertheless, the VW group brand's sales revenue rose 3.9% to 17.7 billion euros ($19.5 billion) in 2021 and operating profit rose 43.2% to 1.1 billion euros as it took cost measures. Skoda did not give a financial or production outlook, saying there were still considerable uncertainties as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and the impact on its Russian operations. Skoda, like VW, has suspended production and other business activities in Russia, which was its second-largest market last year, with 90,400 vehicles delivered.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Just as worries from the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and surging Covid cases pummel Chinese stocks, a local hedge fund that jumped almost 30 times over the past five years by picking undervalued shares is ready to dive in. Most Read from Bloomberg China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Will Join NATO Summit Via Video Link China Plane Crash Update: Pilots Didn’t Answer Calls as Jet Dove Guangdong Zhengyuan Private Fund Investment Management Co., which saw its assets surge fivefold from the start of last year to about 14 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) now, is planning to raise money again next month as stock valuations become increasingly attractive, founder and fund manager Liao Maolin said. “With the market having fallen to this level, there are so many stocks that I want to buy now but we have no more money” as the company is already fully invested, he said in a March 8 phone interview from Guangzhou, where the company is based. While that sounds like a risky bet, Liao has built a solid track record after his funds returned a whopping 2,944% since 2017, topping five-year rankings for stock hedge funds at Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment & Management Co. His rationale is simple: all the gloom out there -- from the war in Ukraine to monetary tightening in the U.S. and economic headwinds at home -- reinforces the possibility that policy makers will refrain from pricking more bubbles and move faster to spur encouraged areas like new infrastructure and digital transformation. “Everything you see this year could be bad news and uncertainty, but the government will likely take counter-cyclical measures,” Liao, 37, said. “The negative news you see has been mostly priced in and we would instead see more unexpected policy support down the road.” His comments were borne out last week, when Beijing pledged to stabilize markets, a move that triggered the biggest two-day rally in Chinese stocks since 1998. Policy makers are now expected to loosen monetary policy and ease up on technology and property industry crackdowns. Liao favors middle- and downstream firms in emerging strategic industries like batteries and new-energy vehicle parts, he said, declining to name specific targets. Such companies now suffering from soaring raw material costs will only benefit when commodity prices eventually subside, according to Liao. By sticking to areas supported by the government and steering clear of those in the cross-hairs of regulators, Zhengyuan has avoided “land mines” from real estate developers to internet platforms, which have imposed huge losses on investors in the past two years. For the same reason, the company has shunned once-hot stocks like liquor makers that mutual funds were heavily exposed to, as well as gaming industry shares -- even as those could perform well. ‘Positive Energy’ “What we buy is full of positive energy -- we walk in the sunshine,” Liao said. “Therefore it’s very unlikely for us to step on policy or ethical mines.” The firm’s Zhengyuan No. 1 fund, which manages more than 1 billion yuan, gained more than 160% last year by focusing on upstream plays like rare earths, industrial silicon and raw materials for new-energy vehicles -- areas that benefited from the local economy’s rebound from that stage of the pandemic. This year, Liao said he’s focusing instead more on downstream firms, in industries including new energy infrastructure such as charging piles for electric vehicles, database construction, information security and environmental protection. He reckons depressed valuations due to high costs will translate into profits when their performance rebounds. “The surge in commodity prices clearly can’t be sustained,” he said. When tensions in Ukraine escalated ahead of Russia’s invasion, Zhengyuan added to its photovoltaic holdings in anticipation that higher costs of traditional energy like natural gas would fuel demand for solar power in Europe, Liao said, declining to provide details. Such investments returned about 40% last year, he said. Zhengyuan targets undervalued stocks that are expected to show substantial improvements within a year to attract other investors, providing it with opportunities to realize profits, Liao said. It borrows leverage less than 30% but doesn’t short. While stock prices and economic growth fluctuate, the key for long-term returns at Zhengyuan is picking the right industries and companies. “The structure is really important these days,” Liao said. “When you get it right, it feels good every time. When you get it wrong, it can really hurt.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin China Bets on $1.5 Trillion of Tax Cuts in Quest for Growth The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•yesterday,"Hedge Fund Up 3,000% in Five Years Can’t Buy Enough China Stocks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-3-000-five-210000887.html
3/24/2022,"Gold futures are edging higher on Tuesday despite soaring U.S. Treasury yields and a stronger U.S. Dollar, a combination that tends to weigh on demand for the non-yielding asset. Perhaps underpinning the market is the intensifying conflict between Russia and Ukraine that is fueling steady safe-haven demand. At 07:18 GMT, June Comex gold is trading $1941.40, up $6.60 or +0.34%. On Monday, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) settled at $180.65, up $1.35 or +0.75%. Technical factors could also be influencing the price action with the precious metal currently sitting inside the contract’s 50% to 61.8% retracement zone at $1908.10 to $1958.70. Trader reaction to this area could determine the near-term direction of the market. Treasury yields rose sharply higher, the U.S. Dollar firmed and U.S. equity prices softened after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday promised to take tough action on inflation, which he said jeopardizes an otherwise strong economic recovery. “The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,” the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for the National Association for Business Economics. Powell also noted rate hikes could go from the traditional quarter-percentage-point moves to more aggressive half-basis-point increases if necessary. While Powell’s hawkish remarks may be capping gold prices, the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine may be providing the support. Just like the rest of us, gold speculators have been trying to interpret the ever-changing headlines about the conflict, which may be the key reason behind the sideways price action. The recent $182.00 break in gold is a strong sign that the “war premium” has been taken out of the market. Meanwhile, five days of sideways action suggests traders are waiting to see if the situation escalates or if it is dampened by a cease fire, or peace. What could be keeping the market underpinned are potentially bullish comments from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who warned that if peace talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin fail, it would mean the start of a global war. “If these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday morning. Ukrainian and Russian officials have met intermittently for peace talks, which have failed to progress to key concessions. Furthermore, U.S. President Joe Biden has said Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s “back is against the wall” and he could resort to using more severe tactics in Ukraine. Technically, a sustained move over $1958.70 could signal the start of another leg up. An escalation of the war in Ukraine is likely to be the catalyst behind the move. A sustained move under $1897.70 will be a sign of weakness. This could trigger the start of a steep decline. The catalyst behind this move is likely to be a ceasefire. Additional pressure will likely be fueled by a jump in Treasury yields and a stronger dollar.

The department is now asking the judge to sanction the company ""for its extensive and intentional efforts to misuse the attorney-client privilege to hide business documents relevant"" to the case. In the brief (PDF) its lawyers wrote for the judge, the DOJ said Google refers to the practice as ""Communicate with Care"" and that it first started no later than 2015. New employees are reportedly directed to follow the practice without discussion on whether it should only be used when legal advice is truly needed. In addition, Google allegedly provided the same training to teams handling search-distribution for the department's (and other authorities') antitrust cases. Google specifically told those teams to follow the practice for any written communication containing revenue-sharing agreements and mobile application distribution agreements, based on the presentation slides the DOJ included in its brief. Those agreements are central to the case. If you'll recall, the DOJ accused Google of having an unfair monopoly over search and search-related advertising in its 2020 antitrust lawsuit. It also questioned its terms for Android device manufacturers that force them to pre-load Google apps and set Google as the default search engine. According to the DOJ, statements such as ""adding legal"" or ""adding [attorney] for legal advice"" appear in thousands of Google documents. These emails apparently lacked any specific request for advice and attorneys rarely respond to them. In the brief, the department said the practice ""pervades the entire company"" and is being used even by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. The DOJ is now asking the court to hold Google's conduct as sanctionable and to order it to immediately produce ""all withheld or redacted emails where no attorney responded to the purported request for legal advice."" Google spokesperson Julie Tarallo McAlister defended the company in a statement sent to Axios, however, calling the allegations ""flatly wrong."" McAlister said: ""Our teams have conscientiously worked for years to respond to inquiries and litigation, and suggestions to the contrary are flatly wrong. Just like other American companies, we educate our employees about legal privilege and when to seek legal advice. And we have produced over four million documents to the DOJ in this case alone — including many that employees had considered potentially privileged.""",Business/Engadget•yesterday,US Justice Department says Google misuses attorney-client privilege to hide documents,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-justice-department-google-misuse-attorney-client-privilege-072951407.html
3/24/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp and 'flying car' firm SkyDrive Inc said on Tuesday they have signed a deal to team up in research, development and marketing of electric, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. In a joint statement, the two companies said they will also work to open up new markets with an initial focus on India, where Suzuki has a roughly half share of the auto market. Suzuki announced on Sunday it plans to invest 104.4 billion rupees ($1.37 billion) in its India factory to produce electric vehicles and batteries. The companies didn't disclose details of investments in their partnership, nor outline any production timetable or target. Founded in 2018, Tokyo-headquartered SkyDrive counts big Japan businesses like trading house Itochu Corp, tech firm NEC Corp and a unit of energy company Eneos Holdings Inc among its main shareholders. In 2020 it raised 5.1 billion yen ($42 million) in total in Series B funds, according to its website. SkyDrive is currently engaged in the development of a compact, two-seating electric-powered flying car with plans for full-scale production. The statement did not say whether Suzuki would be working on this specific vehicle. The company, which is also developing cargo drones, aims to launch a 'flying car' service in Osaka in 2025 when the Japanese city hosts the World Expo. For Suzuki, the partnership will add 'flying cars' as a fourth mobility business, in addition to automobiles, motorcycles and outboard motors, the statement said.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Add another leveraged nickel trade to the long list of wipeouts in the historic turmoil rocking the metal. Most Read from Bloomberg China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Will Join NATO Summit Via Video Link China Plane Crash Update: Pilots Didn’t Answer Calls as Jet Dove Just two weeks after its bearish sibling was shuttered, the WisdomTree Nickel 3x Daily Leveraged exchange-traded commodity (ticker 3NIL) is being compulsorily redeemed, issuer WisdomTree Investments said in a statement dated March 21. The London and Milan-listed product, which used swaps to treble the return of nickel futures, had at one point surged more than 600% this month before the London Metal Exchange controversially halted trading in the metal. When the market eventually reopened March 16, nickel fell by the most allowed for four days in a row -- delivering a fatal blow to 3NIL. “The limitation on trading imposed on the nickel market by the LME after 7 March 2022 led to severe disruptions in nickel trading and pricing, which prevented the product from being priced and resetting its leverage at the end of each day as usual,” WisdomTree said in the statement. The firm applied to the LSE and Borsa Italiana to immediately suspend and delist 3NIL. The ETC -- a type of exchange-traded product that invests in commodities, often via futures contracts -- had about 22 million euros ($24 million) of assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A spokesperson for WisdomTree referred Bloomberg News to the March 21 statement. While 3NIL was relatively small, it was among a breed of controversial leveraged products that offer almost any investor easy access to often-complex strategies teeming with risk. The nickel ETC also gave them entry to a relatively specialized market, typically the preserve of sophisticated traders and qualified firms. Nickel had soared earlier in March amid concern over supplies from Russia and a subsequent squeeze on short positions. That killed off the WisdomTree Nickel 3x Daily Short ETC (3NIS), which used derivatives to deliver three times the inverse of the commodity. Read more: The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market As for its bullish counterpart, 3NIL’s reset mechanisms had to be measured from March 7, WisdownTree said. The subsequent plunge in nickel meant the product’s index fell almost 35% -- spurring a 100% wipeout in the triple-leveraged vehicle. “The Redemption Amount of the WisdomTree Nickel 3x Daily Leveraged securities has been calculated as zero so investors should not expect to get paid for the securities they hold,” the statement said.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. bond market reeled further on Tuesday, extending Monday’s declines after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s aggressive rate hike comments drove yields on short-dated Treasuries to one of their biggest daily jumps of the past decade. Most Read from Bloomberg China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Xi Risks Leaving China Isolated by Backing Putin to Counter U.S. China Plane Crash Update: Wreckage Found, Airline Grounds Jets China Eastern Boeing 737 Jet Crashes With More Than 130 on Board The central bank chief’s hawkish tone led traders to rapidly ratchet up estimates for how aggressively the Fed will tighten monetary policy this year as rising commodity prices threaten to add fuel to the fastest consumer-price increases in four decades. His comments on the possibility of a half-point hike, which doubled down on the message he gave after last week’s Fed meeting, sent yields across much of the curve to the highest since 2019. Those on two-year notes rose 5 basis points to 2.17% on Tuesday, after soaring 18 basis points Monday. The gap between 5- and 30-year yields narrowed further to the smallest since 2007, indicating expectations tighter policy will slow the economy or even cause a recession. The moves compounded what is on course to be the worst quarterly losses the market has seen since at least 1973. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index has lost 5.55% since Dec. 31, surpassing the 5.45% slump at the start of 1980 that stands as the biggest quarterly decline since the gauge’s inception. The selloff spread to other markets with yields on benchmark Australian and New Zealand bonds surging by more than 10 basis points each and German bund futures retreating. The severity of the losses underscores the degree to which some investors have underestimated just how far the central bank is willing to go in order to control inflation. Monday’s yield move was “pretty violent,” said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. “At the end of last week, investors including us were thinking the long-end looks cheap. But our models can’t factor in the uncertainty about inflation from the commodity price shock.” The tone of Powell’s remarks reinforced the view that the main monetary-policy concern from the war in Ukraine is that it will worsen inflation and leave it more entrenched in the U.S. economy. That such a risk appears more prominent than a slowdown in growth opens the door to tightening policy at a much faster pace toward the bank’s late-2023 target of 2.8% for overnight rates. Derivative traders Monday priced in about 7.5 quarter-point rate hikes at the remaining six FOMC meetings this year, effectively making provision for more than one half-point rise. It hasn’t raised rates that steeply at any of its meetings since 2000. The three-year yield at one stage jumped more than 20 basis points on Monday and ended the day at 2.32%, up around 18 basis points, notching one of the biggest one-day advances at that tenor in the past decade. While the price moves were strongest in the shorter-dated parts of the Treasury market that is typically hit hardest by monetary-policy tightening, yields also jumped on the longer end, including on the 10-year benchmark that serves as an touchstone for global markets and underpins the cost of borrowing for households and companies. Thomas Atteberry, a more than three-decade bond-market veteran who manages money at First Pacific Advisors, said Powell adding such a large degree of uncertainty to the size of the Fed’s rate changes has bumped up the risk in fixed-income markets and potential for pain ahead. “In recent past cycles the Fed was much more methodical in their hiking cycles, so basically you weren’t getting surprised,” Atteberry said. “Powell adding this optionality and taking the past-cycle predictability off the table makes it just more more volatile and unpredictable. This has made the environment more difficult for fixed-income investors.” The rise in yields has been seen worldwide as central banks pull back on pandemic-era stimulus to keep inflation from becoming unmoored. Ten-year yields in Germany, the U.K. and Japan have all risen this month, in some cases threatening to reduce demand for Treasuries from overseas buyers. With Powell’s remarks indicating that the U.S. central bank is squarely focused on the inflationary consequences of the commodity-price jump -- rather than its impact on consumer demand -- bond traders are speculating that the Fed may welcome a rise in longer-term yields that would ripple through the economy. That has also shifted a lot of focus to whether the Fed will use the planned shrinking of its balance sheet holdings, known as quantitative tightening, in a more active way than their 2017-2019 unwind to put more upward pressure on long-date yields. “The Fed has a big constraint now, which is inflation that is just too high now,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup Inc. “The context in which this QT will be happening now is that the Fed is fighting against inflation and wants to actually do things that are going to tighten financial conditions. So the upcoming round of balance-sheet run off will most likely be anything but ‘watching paint dry’ -- the description used in the last reduction cycle.” With a couple of notable exceptions, the speed and scale of Monday’s repricing confounded bond-market strategists at several large banks, who’d judged that steep increases over the past two weeks made it risky to be positioned for even higher yields. Strategists at Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank AG cautioned against maintaining short positions coming into this week. The exceptions included Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which recommended positioning for the possibility of one or more half-point Fed rate increases at some point this year and for a bigger total number of increases than the market was pricing in. Likewise, Morgan Stanley said the market could “easily” price in a 3% rate for the Fed’s benchmark at the end of its cycle “in the coming days” and raised its year-end Treasury yield forecasts. Powell’s hawkish tone also conveyed a dismissal of the recession risk signaled by this year’s pronounced flattening in the yield curve between two- and 10-year notes and in the gap from five- to 30-year yields. He said he’s focused on the gap between shorter-term rates. Read more: Powell Says Look at Short-Term Yield Curve for Recession Risk “We are seeing a breakout in the long end and we don’t know long it lasts until buyers step in,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. “This is a credibility event for the Fed and the more aggressive they are, the market has to ask what does it mean in practical terms for the chances of a recession and the performance of risk assets.” (Adds global bond moves in fifth paragraph.)

3/24/2022,"Since the start of the pandemic, most federal student loan borrowers have had their payments paused, and interest rates are set at zero. But not every American has been able to take advantage of these benefits, including those with private student loans and Family Federal Education Loans (FFEL). It’s what happened with these borrowers that may help predict the outcomes for the more than 43 million Americans with federal student loans when the freeze is lifted, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The student loan moratorium put in place in March 2020 has had a number of benefits: Many federal student loan borrowers were able to squirrel away more savings, pay down other forms of debt, make on-time payment for monthly bills, and some even saw a boost in their credit scores. But only about 18% of federal loan borrowers took the opportunity of 0% interest rates to pay down their loans during the pandemic, according to the New York Fed’s research. While most federal student loans remain under the payment freeze through May 1, 2022 (and many experts predict that will be extended yet again), emergency forbearance programs for other borrowers mostly lapsed by the end of 2020, according to the New York Fed’s research. Specifically, about 10% of FFEL borrowers and 7% of private borrowers entered forbearance during the pandemic period. But those programs lapsed by the end of 2020. The outcome for those without a payment freeze varied. The New York Fed found that on average, those with private loans actually increased their rate of pay down during the pandemic. But researchers noted that private student loan borrowers also tend to have historically lower delinquency rates and higher credit scores. Perhaps more tellingly, many FFEL borrowers—who have only slightly higher credit scores and better delinquency rates than the average federal borrowers—struggled with their loan payments during the pandemic. Delinquency rates for these borrowers increased shortly after the forbearance period ended—and not just on their student loans. Compared to federal student loan borrowers still in forbearance, researchers found FFEL borrowers experienced 33% higher delinquency rates on debts like credit card balances and car loans after exiting forbearance. “The difficulties faced by these borrowers in managing their student loans and other debts suggest that direct borrowers will face rising delinquencies once forbearance ends and payments resume,” researchers write. They estimate that delinquency rates for federal student loans could hit as high as 12%. By comparison, the delinquency rate for direct federal student loans was about 5.3% as of February 2020. Most expect that restarting student loan payments is going to be chaotic, especially because it's been more than two years since the vast majority of Americans have made any payments. Some borrowers, for example, haven’t ever made any payments on their student loans because they graduated during the pandemic. Meanwhile, millions of borrowers had their loan servicer change during the pandemic, meaning at minimum, they may need to update their contact information and repayment terms. New York Fed researchers say a lot of the outcome depends on what steps policymakers implement to soften the blow of payments restarting. For example, there have been some proposals that would require federal servicers not report delinquencies for some amount of time after payments start back up to provide some cushion. But that would be only a short-term solution. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,Only 18% of federal borrowers paid their student loans during the pause. That could make things complicated when payments restart,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-18-federal-borrowers-paid-182220073.html
3/24/2022,"Mirroring the markets’ overall trend, the biotech sector has not gotten off to a good start in 2022, as evidenced by the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) tilting 12% into the red year-to-date. However, according to Yaron Werber, biotech analyst at investment firm Cowen, that is not necessarily indicative of how the rest of the year will pan out. In fact, taking the Cowen Annual Health Care Conference in late February/early March (this year’s took place between March 7-9) as a “time point” that can be used to forecast annual performance, the findings paint an upbeat picture. “A negative start followed by positive performance during the Cowen HC conference (matching the current set up in 2022) has been associated with positive performance for the remainder of the year in 3 of 3 instances over the last 22 years (2003, 2009, 2020),” the 5-star analyst said. “This provides a reason to be optimistic that sentiment may be shifting in the sector.” So, it’s time to look at some promising names operating in the biotech space. We delved into the TipRanks database and zeroed in on three such stocks. All offer a bullish profile; rated Strong Buys by the analyst consensus and projected to bring home some serious gains over the coming months. Let’s see what makes them such appealing picks right now. Altimmune (ALT) We’ll first take a look at Altimmune, a clinical-stage biopharma working on novel peptide-based therapeutics indicated as therapies for liver diseases and obesity. Altimmune’s lead candidate is ALT-801 (Pemvidutide), a distinctive peptide-based dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist which is undergoing testing for the treatment of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Obesity is a common cause of NASH, and ALT-801 will try to address it. If approved, ALT-801 could be something of a game-changing medicine in obesity and NASH treatment - both are substantial unmet medical needs - by helping to lower body weight and comorbidities. Earlier this year, the FDA gave the all-clear for the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its Phase 2 clinical trial of pemvidutide for obesity. The company still expects to initiate the study this quarter. An interim analysis is planned to assess changes in body weight following 24 weeks of treatment, with an expected readout in 4Q22. The readout will form part of what JMP analyst Jonathan Wolleben calls a “data-rich year.” Before that Q4 readout, Q3 should see the release of key 12-week data from the Phase 1b NAFLD study, and Wolleben has high hopes regarding the outcome. “New data coming in 3Q22 from a Phase 1b in NAFLD patients could continue to support a best-in-class profile for pemvidutide,” wrote the analyst. “We expect the 12-week NAFLD data could replicate the unprecedented liver fat reductions observed already with best-in-class weight loss to boot. We also expect more data will assuage some investor concerns over the single ALT elevation observed in the prior Phase 1. To that end, ALT expects to have safety data from >200 subjects treated with pemvi by 4Q.” Overall, the analyst summed up, ""The pemvidutide data to date are quite compelling, in our view... We continue to recommend ALT shares and point to multiple catalysts in 2022, which we expect could provide a boost to shares in the near term..."" Accordingly, Wolleben rates ALT shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), while his $24 price target shows room for growth of a hefty 257% over the coming year. (To watch Wolleben’s track record, click here) The rest of the Street is in full agreement. Based on Buys only – 6, in total – the stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $25, the average target is just above Wolleben’s and set to generate returns of 272% in the year ahead. (See ALT stock forecast on TipRanks) Adicet Bio (ACET) The next biotech stock we’ll look at is Adicet, a company targeting the development of engineered T cell-based therapies against cancer. To do so, the clinical-stage biotech makes use of a differentiated class of T lymphocytes called gamma delta (γδ) T cells. Given gamma delta T cells’ unique properties – they can home in on and eliminate tumor cells while skipping over normal, healthy cells – the treatments have the potential to produce longer-lasting therapeutic activity while also having a better safety profile, making them very appealing for the treatment of solid malignancies. Most of Adicet's pipeline is still in the early stages but leading the way and further along in development is ADI-001, indicated for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In December, an interim data readout from the ongoing Phase 1 trial was highly promising and showed 2 complete responses (CR) and one partial response (PR). The company expects to present additional interim data during 1H22. In another important development, in January, Regeneron opted into the company’s solid tumors program by deciding to license the exclusive, worldwide rights to ADI-002, an allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting Glypican-3. As a result, the company received an exercise fee of $20 million. Based on the above, Adicet has caught the eye of Guggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt, who thinks the company's prospective treatments could represent an “intriguing new class of therapeutics within the adoptive cell therapy space,” while the share price looks appealing too. “In light of the key de-risking clinical data presented in December, we continue to think ACET trades at an extremely attractive valuation,” the 5-star analyst said. “ACET is well financed with cash runway into 2023, and we continue to believe ACET shares are set up well to outperform the XBI longer term as the company successfully advances development of existing product candidates towards additional clinical proof-of-concept and via general validation of γδ T cell technology driven by increasing industry interest in the technology.” Unsurprisingly, Schmidt puts a Buy rating on ACET shares, backed by a $22 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~102% from current levels. (To watch Schmidt’s track record, click here) This is another name with the Street’s full support. All 6 recent analyst reviews are positive, naturally culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of ~87%, considering the average target clocks in at $29.67. (See Adicet stock forecast on TipRanks) Seres Therapeutics (MCRB) Last but not least is Seres Therapeutics, a clinical stage company hoping to impact patients’ lives with what it terms “revolutionary microbiome therapeutics.” Research has shown that gut microbiome has a big role to play in the health of the human body. By creating metabolites that interact with other microorganisms and the host, bacteria, a significant component of the gut microbiome, can influence various bodily functions including metabolism, and immune and inflammatory responses. The company’s pipeline includes two therapies indicted to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) - SER-287 and SER-301 - and another - SER-155 – which is currently in a Phase 1b study assessing the effects of the drug in lowering the incidence of infections and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in immunocompromised patients. But the candidate making the biggest splash so far is SER-109, indicated for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI). In the Phase 3 clinical trial, the treatment met the primary endpoint of showing an advantage over the placebo in reducing CDI recurrence. The company is currently getting the BLA ready for filing with the FDA, which should take place around mid-2022. H.C. Wainwright’s Vernon Bernardino is confident the treatment is destined for success. He writes, “We believe there is substantial commercial opportunity for SER-109 given that there are approximately 170,000 cases of rCDI and CDI results in over 20,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Additionally, with the cost to treat a patient with rCDI approximately $34,000 in annual direct healthcare expenses, which does not include substantial indirect costs, rCDI creates a significant burden to the healthcare system. Overall, we anticipate approval of SER-109 in 1Q23 given two months for acceptance of the Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) and a six-month priority review.” Accordingly, Bernardino rates MCRB a Buy, and has a $25 price target for the shares. Should the target be met, investors are looking at returns of a strong 239%. (To watch Bernardino’s track record, click here) 2 other analysts have reviewed Seres’ prospects recently and both have reached the same positive conclusion, making the consensus view on this name a Strong Buy. The average price target currently comes in at $18, suggesting shares could climb ~144% higher in the year ahead.

3/24/2022,"The war in Ukraine is to slash economic growth in Britain this year as inflation wrecks household budgets and taxes rise, the fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility delivered a slew of downgrades in its forecasts after the Chancellor warned the conflict risks “significantly” worsening the economy and public finances. The OBR cut its prediction for 2022 growth from 6pc to 3.8pc, marking a sharp slowdown from a strong 7.5pc rise in GDP last year. Richard Hughes, chairman of the official forecasting body, said: “The shock of the Russian invasion hit an economy that had only just returned to its pre-pandemic level of activity at the start of this year, after being buffeted by the Omicron variant in December."" Inflation is expected to surge much higher than previously feared, peaking at 8.7pc in the final three months of 2022 after another huge increase in the energy price predicted for October. Combined with tax hikes, the rise in bills will send households’ spending power tumbling in the coming financial year. Economist George Dibb at the Institute For Public Policy Research, said this will risk a recession as hard-pressed families find bills spiralling. He said: “If families are spending a bigger share of their income on gas and electricity, they’re spending less in the everyday economy."" “That fall in spending could tip our economy from stagnation to recession.” The OBR predicts that spending will drop by 2.2pc, the sharpest drop on record. Around one-third of that pain comes from taxes and benefits, while the rest comes from rising prices which will outstrip an expected 5.3pc increase in average earnings this year. Mr Hughes said: “This would be the biggest single financial-year fall in living standards since records began 66 years ago, and more than twice the roughly 1pc falls in living standards experienced during the oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s. “And, without the range of energy rebates and tax cuts announced by the Chancellor in today’s Spring Statement, this fall in living standards would have been half as big again at over 3pc.” Support measures announced by the Chancellor include raising the earnings threshold at which workers start to pay national insurance contributions to £12,570 to ease pressure on low earners, as well as cutting 5p from fuel duty for the next 12 months to combat record high petrol and diesel prices. Overall households will still be hit with higher taxes as the national insurance rate rises by 1.25 percentage points next month. Despite the gloomier outlook for the economy, the watchdog delivered some brighter forecasts. Borrowing more than halved in 2021-22 to £128bn, over £50bn more than previously predicted following stronger than expected tax receipts. Record debt interest costs of £83bn will mean borrowing in the coming financial year is £16bn higher than expected at £99bn, before halving in 2023-24 to £50.2bn. My Sunak said he is trying to be prudent with the finances given the damage wrought on the public purse by Covid. Speaking in Parliament, the Chancellor said: “We should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen – potentially significantly – and the cost of borrowing is continuing to rise. “The war’s most significant impact domestically is on the cost of living. Covid and global factors meant goods and energy prices were already high.” On current forecasts, the OBR estimates the Chancellor will meet his target of balancing the books by the middle of the decade with a margin of £31.6bn to spare, raising the tantalising prospect of tax cuts before the end of this parliament to undo some of the pain of tax rises inflicted over the past two years. However, Mr Hughes warned Mr Sunak’s pre-election war chest could be wiped out by further downgrades in the coming years. This could happen depending on the course of the war in Ukraine, he said, as well as the potential economic fallout from more sanctions on Russia. The emergence of a dangerous new Covid vaccine is also a risk, while there are financial hazards including the potential difficulty of reversing the cut in fuel duty which is planned to go back up again next March. By Tim Wallace It was presented by the Chancellor as "" largest single personal tax cut in a decade"" as he sought to burnish his credentials as a protector of low-paid workers. But a National Insurance overhaul aimed at helping the poorest employees will not spare them from a cost of living crisis, economists have warned. The Chancellor is increasing the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from £9,880 to £12,570 per year, saving the typical earner more than £330 a year. Mr Sunak called it “a £6bn personal tax cut for 30m people across the United Kingdom... And the largest single personal tax cut in a decade"". However, the move only undoes around one-third of his total national insurance increase. The change cuts workers’ bills by £6.3bn, out of the overall £17.2bn extra cash which the Treasury had expected to take through the higher tax on employees and their employers in the coming financial year. Overall the combination of higher taxes and rampant inflation will force down living standards at the fastest pace on record, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned. It said real disposable household incomes will fall by 2.2pc this year, equivalent to a £500 hit for the average adult. Around one-third of this blow comes from taxes while the remainder comes from inflation. Price rises are already at their highest in 30 years with steep increases in goods including petrol and food. Inflation hit 6.2pc last month, its highest since 1992 with food and drinks up 5.1pc - a decade high - and petrol up almost 23pc. The cost of filling up the tank has increased further since last month, with petrol routinely hitting new record highs this month. Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said: “The permanent cuts to National Insurance and income tax announced today reverse just over a quarter of the personal tax rises the Chancellor announced last year.” “They reverse around one-sixth of total tax rises announced by this Chancellor since he came to office in February 2020."" The Chancellor’s total haul from income tax will rise from £225bn this year to almost £300bn in five years’ time. Over the same period national insurance, including the new health and social care levy, will jump from £158.1bn this year to £200bn in 2026-27. Economists said it shows Mr Sunak is taking few steps to help, as he is pressing ahead with raising taxes to their highest level since the late 1940s. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said if the Chancellor “wants to be remembered as a tax reforming chancellor, so far he is headed in the wrong direction”. The latest changes mean that those earning between £10,000 and £25,000 will pay less tax in the coming financial year, while those on higher salaries will pay more, according to the think-tank’s calculations. But this is not enough to undo the Chancellor’s previous tax changes which few people will escape. Mr Johnson said: “The freezing of the income tax personal allowance and higher rate threshold turn out to be much bigger tax rises than first intended. “As a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in 2025 than they would have been paying without this parliament’s reforms to income tax and NICs, despite the tax cutting measures announced today.” Economist Kallum Pickering at Berenberg Bank said voters should “not be fooled” by the Chancellor’s claims he is cutting taxes. He said: “In contrast to his claims that he is lowering the UK tax burden, the Chancellor unveiled a conservative fiscal plan that will raise the UK tax burden to its highest level since 1949."" Carys Roberts, executive director at the Institute for Public Policy Studies, called the proposals “woefully out of touch with the reality facing millions of families, who face being pulled into poverty and debt.” She said: “We’re going into the biggest incomes squeeze in a generation and yet the Chancellor hasn’t offered the help that many households need."" Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said Mr Sunak was increasing the tax burden even as the public finances improved thanks to the stronger-than-expected economic recovery from Covid. He said: “It’s hard to overstate the scale of the cost of living crisis coming, with the year ahead bringing the highest inflation in 40 years and the worst income squeeze on record. But while our household finances are being hammered, the public finances have actually improved. “The Chancellor announced a bigger package of measures than expected, but it was a badly designed one with almost no new support for the poorest households. Higher earners will be hardest hit by tax rises, but it makes no sense to raise National Insurance while cutting Income Tax - 21st Century Britain doesn’t need to do more to make things harder for workers, and easier for landlords.”",Business/The Telegraph•9 hours ago,Economic growth slashed by war in Ukraine,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tax-burden-hits-70-high-135159832.html
3/24/2022,"The Chinese government has not made life easy for ecommerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Regulatory crackdowns and an almost hostile approach have been de rigueur over the past couple of years. But a slowing Chinese economy has caused a bit of a rethink at the higher echelons of Chinese decision-making. The government is preparing a course of action that will boost its ailing economy. According to a report by the Xinhua news agency, the government will “actively release policies favorable to markets” and in advance of any pending regulation which could potentially have a substantial influence on capital markets will run it by financial management departments. To boost the economy in CQ1, the government will take ""forceful measures.” On top of the regulatory woes, the slowing economy has impacted Alibaba’s business, and as a result of this potent combination and other factors, the stock has taken a battering. As such, the latest development is a welcome one. “We view this as very encouraging commentary from a regime which over the last year has increased scrutiny and enacted unfavorable policies towards some of its leading domestic tech companies,” said Truist analyst Youssef Squali. Further boosting sentiment, a number of news publications have reported that in an attempt to appease US regulators and prevent Chinese companies like Alibaba from being delisted from U.S. exchanges, China’s securities watchdog is planning to make compromises on the disclosure of Chinese audit information. This is also a promising development. “Given its scale and importance to both Chinese consumers and US/Hong-Kong based-investors, BABA's risk exposure is material, and therefore a compromise that satisfies both governments would remove one of the biggest overhangs for BABA shares in our view,” the 5-star analyst noted. That said, it should also be noted that investors’ enthusiasm for equities worldwide has soured somewhat, due to a mix of new Covid outbreaks in China, inflationary pressures in the US and Europe, ongoing supply-chain problems and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As such, adding a note of caution, Squali says that it “remains to be seen what actual measures the Chinese government decides to take to boost the economy in general and consumer spending in particular, and in what time frame.” Nevertheless, shares “look attractive” at the current valuation, according to Squali. The analyst gives BABA a Buy rating along with a $180 price target. The figure suggests shares have room for ~74% growth over the coming year. (To watch Squali’s track record, click here) The Street’s average price target is only slightly lower; at $174.38, shares are expected to appreciate 68% in the months ahead. Most analysts are backing BABA at this point; based on 19 Buys vs. 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Strong Buy.

3/24/2022,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates more aggressively – including by half a percentage point at some meetings – to tame inflation that’s been stuck at a 40-year high. “In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points (a quarter percentage point) at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” Powell said at the National Association for Business Economics’ annual conference in Washington, D.C. He added, “And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.” LATEST HIKE:Fed raises interest rates for first time in 3 years to fight inflation, forecasts six more hikes in 2022 TIME TO REFI:Mortgage rates are rising: Is it your 'last chance' to refinance? A neutral interest rate supports full employment while keeping inflation stable. And so lifting the federal funds rate above that level suggests Fed officials are willing to push unemployment – now 3.8%, modestly above a 50-year low – higher to get inflation under control. ""We do place a high priority on the labor market, but ultimately if you want a strong labor market you have to have price stability,"" he said during a question-and-answer session. The consumer price index rose 7.9% annually in February, the fastest since 1982. After Powell's remarks were published, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite were down by more than 1%, as of 1:25 p.m. EST. The S&P 500 was down by 0.7%. The Fed last week hiked its key short-term rate by a quarter point, marking its first increase in more than three years, and forecast a total seven quarter-point hikes this year. That would boost the rate, now near zero, to 1.9% by the end of 2022. Fed officials’ median projection pencils in four more increases next year, which would leave the rate at 2.8% by the end of 2023. At a video news conference, Powell suggested the Fed is willing to hoist rates even more quickly, but his remarks Monday were more explicit. He noted that demand in the economy exceeds supply, with job openings, for example, outpacing the number of available unemployed workers. Ideally, he said, rising rates would ""reduce excess demand,"" easing wage pressures without pushing unemployment higher. ""That's our goal,"" Powell said, while acknowledging that ""monetary policy is a blunt instrument.""

3/24/2022,"Aqua Metals Inc (NASDAQ: AQMS) revealed recovery of its first copper from lithium-ion battery black mass at its Innovation Center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. The company noted the plating of copper as another significant step in building out its capabilities for recovering all the high-value materials in lithium-ion batteries. AQMS has also produced high-purity lithium hydroxide from lithium-ion battery black mass and successfully lab-tested cobalt plating. As of 2021, the world consumed 30 million tonnes of copper per year, and by 2050 it is predicted to double to 60 million tonnes. Efficient and clean recycling methods for recovering copper from spent lithium-ion batteries are critical in meeting this global demand.

To show you what I mean, have a look at all the Big Money signals CF has made the last year. The last few weeks have seen Big Money activity, too. Each green bar signals big trading volumes as the stock ramped in price: Source: www.mapsignals.com In the last year, the stock attracted 27 Big Money buy signals.

Now, let’s check out technical action grabbing my attention: 1-month outperformance vs. Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (+35.2% vs. XLB) Outperformance is important for leading stocks. Next, it’s a good idea to check under the hood. Meaning, I want to make sure the fundamental story is strong too.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia will restart trading in some local equities, ending the nation’s record long shutdown that was meant to shield domestic investors from the impact of tough sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists China Plane Crash Update: Voice Recorder Sent for Analysis This Is Now The Worst Drawdown on Record for Global Fixed Income Putin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves Russia The Moscow Exchange will resume trading in 33 Russian equities, including some of the biggest companies such as Gazprom PJSC and Sberbank PJSC, on March 24 between 9:50 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time, the Bank of Russia said in a statement. A ban on short selling these shares will apply, it said, adding to an earlier restriction on foreigners exiting local equities. Moscow stock trading has been halted from Feb. 28, marking the longest closure in the country’s modern history. Read More: Lessons for Russia From Long Stock Market Shutdowns: QuickTake Even with the ban on short selling, local traders and strategists are bracing for a selloff, as international sanctions hit everything from Russia’s ability to access foreign reserves to the SWIFT bank-messaging system. The MOEX Russia Index slumped as much as 45%, the most on record, on the day the invasion started. The ruble is among the world’s worst performers this year, although it has edged higher over the past week as peace negotiations continued between Russia and Ukraine. In a sign of what might happen when local stocks trading reopens, European companies with business exposure to the country have lost more than $100 billion in market value since the war risks surged, Russian companies’ global depositary receipts slumped more than 95% before being halted and global index providers removed the nation’s shares from their indexes. READ: Why Short Sellers Become Targets During Market Routs: QuickTake To shield the economy and markets from steep losses, the Bank of Russia earlier banned brokers from selling securities held by foreigners on the Moscow Exchange. Wall Street Is Scrambling For the Exits in Moscow — and Billions Are at Stake “The very limited re-opening will make little difference to foreigners who cannot sell and remain trapped, assuming they have not already marked down local holdings to zero,” said Hasnain Malik, a strategist at Tellimer in Dubai. Foreign Investors Foreign holdings of Russian stocks stood at $86 billion at the end of last year, according to data from the Moscow Exchange. “With foreigners from unfriendly geographies at bay, the pain will be less severe,” said Luis Saenz, head of international distribution at Sinara in London. The Moscow Exchange will resume trading in 33 stocks that have their primary listing in Russia out of 50 listed in the benchmark index. Yandex NV, TCS Group Holding Plc, Ozon Holdings Plc and other companies, whose main listing is abroad, won’t be restarting their trading tomorrow. Earlier this month, Russia said it plans to deploy up to $10 billion from its sovereign wealth fund to buy up battered local stocks. This compares with the $650 billion market capitalization of the companies on the MOEX Index before the rout began on Feb. 21. On Monday, the nation’s local bonds slumped as trading resumed for the first time in three weeks. At the same time, bond holder concerns eased after Russia avoided triggering the first foreign default in more than 100 years after $117 million of interest payments started to reach international investors on Friday.

3/24/2022,"Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have historically been one of the only options available for individuals to invest in commercial real estate, since private equity investments have traditionally been limited to institutional investors. A series of regulation changes over the past decade has changed that, however. Retail investors now have access to a wide range of passive real estate investments outside of publicly traded REITs and other real estate-related stocks. However, REITs have performed well for investors over the past 20 years. The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has outperformed the S&P 500 in total returns during 13 out of the last 20 years with an average total annual return of 13.1% versus 11.1% for the S&P 500 over the same time period. Does it really make sense to invest in private equity when the public markets are already producing solid returns? Total Returns Based on Benzinga’s data of the average returns from the top real estate investment platforms, private equity real estate has produced average total annual returns ranging from 17.4% to 25.56% over the past 9 years, compared to a 12.42% average total return for the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index. Of course, there are some important factors to consider when comparing these two types of investments. Available Data Data available for private equity returns is limited. Returns are being calculated based on sponsor-reported data from a small handful of companies compared to publicly available information from the index that currently comprises 156 companies. Liquidity Publicly traded REITs also allow investors to move in and out of the market as liquidity needs change, while private equity investments can have minimum investment terms ranging anywhere from three to 10 years. However, real estate is best suited as a long-term investment, whether through publicly traded REITs or private equity investments. The limited liquidity options actually help keep the real estate market more stable compared to the stock market, since panic can’t result in a short-term selloff. Investment Options Private equity investments through platforms like CrowdStreet allow investors to choose specific deals to invest in rather than having to analyze the outlook on an entire REIT portfolio. Options aren’t limited to specific deals, however. Most platforms also have managed private equity funds that allow investors to diversify across multiple properties. The minimum investment required to access private equity real estate is often significantly higher than the minimum required to purchase shares of a publicly traded REIT. Private equity real estate platforms typically have minimum investments starting at $25,000. However, a third option is becoming increasingly popular; non-listed public real estate offerings. A few new platforms are offering real estate investments through Regulation A+ offerings to non-accredited investors. For instance, Arrived Homes sells shares of rental properties with a minimum investment of only $100. Other companies, such as CalTier Realty, have offerings for real estate funds with minimum investments in the $500 to $1,000 range. Which is the Better Option? The simplicity that comes with buying and selling shares of publicly traded REITs make them a logical option for most investors. However, those seeking out higher potential total returns that are willing to commit to longer-term investments would be wise to explore private equity and non-traded real estate investments. You can access a variety of private equity and Regulation A+ real estate offerings through Benzinga’s Real Estate Offering Screener and filter opportunities based on your personal criteria.

The Lightfoot administration is expected to choose a final proposal to submit for approval by City Council by early summer, according to Chicago Chief Financial Officer Jennie Bennett. Assuming it’s cleared by the Council, the bid will then go to the Illinois Gaming Board for approval. The proposed facility is projected to generate about $400 million annually in gaming revenue for Chicago and Illinois, with the city’s expected share of roughly $200 million slated to go toward pension obligations, according to the city.
