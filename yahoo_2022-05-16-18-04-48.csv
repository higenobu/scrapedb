5/16/2022,"The Terra ecosystem completely unraveled last week, taking much of the cryptocurrency market down with it. Its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) crashed far below its $1 peg, and its sister token Luna collapsed to nearly zero. Though the overall market is now recovering, the demise of UST and Luna wiped out many cryptocurrency investors’ life savings. This left the Terra community, including its creator Do Kwon, proposing plans to somehow fix the damage done. One proposal on the Terra forum suggests that Terra should make investors “whole” again with its remaining funds—and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is all for it, with a few tweaks. Buterin agreed with one Twitter user who said that Terra should prioritize helping “smaller wallets,” or people who had “a couple thousand or more of UST deposited in Anchor,” rather than “rich whales.” “​​If Terra just focussed on the ‘poorest’ 99.6% of wallets, then they could make this gigantic group 100% whole,” the user Tweeted on Friday. Buterin retweeted the user on Saturday, saying: “Strongly support this. Coordinated sympathy and relief for the average UST smallholder who got told something dumb about ‘20% interest rates on the US dollar’ by an influencer, personal responsibility and SFYL [or sorry for your loss] for the wealthy.” https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1525562865016483841 He added that the “obvious precedent is FDIC insurance,” being “up to $250,000 per person.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is a federal agency that dates back to the 1930s, a Great Depression-era regulation that represented the first time the government backed bank deposits in U.S. history. It was part of the New Deal series of government programs that restored faith in the financial system, yet came under criticism of too much government involvement in business. Buterin stopped short of endorsing regulation for the until-now unregulated crypto space, but he said similar regulations were “interesting.” His comments are newsworthy in light of President Joe Biden signing an executive order in March, directing the government to ""“ensure responsible innovation in digital assets,"" with the crypto community wondering what ""responsible"" means. “An interesting unrelated one is Singapore employment law,"" Buterin tweeted. ""Stronger regulation for low-earning employees, and a more figure-it-out-yourself approach for the wealthier. IMO [or in my opinion] things like this are good hybrid formulas.” Buterin also criticized algorithmic stablecoins on Twitter, saying that “‘algostable’ has become a propaganda term serving to legitimize uncollateralized stables by putting them in the same bucket as collateralized stables.” He added that “we need to really emphasize that the two are very different.” UST is an algorithmic stablecoin, which means it has no reserves. Instead, it holds value based on an algorithm that is coded to strike a balance between the stablecoin and a partner coin, in this case, Luna. Every time a UST token is minted, the equivalent of $1 in Luna is burned, or removed from circulation, and vice versa, to maintain the peg. As the UST stablecoin dropped, it brought its sister token Luna down with it. UST is trading at around 14 cents, down 85% in the last seven days. Luna remains at a 100% loss in the same timeframe, trading at pretty much zero.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- After one of the most dramatic weeks yet for ARK Investment Management, Wall Street can no longer have any doubts: Cathie Wood is sticking with her strategy -- and investors are sticking with her. Most Read from Bloomberg Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape Whereabouts of Terra’s Bitcoin Reserve a Mystery After Transfers How Omicron Infection Turbo-Charges Vaccinated People’s Immunity The chances of both have been questioned this year as a selloff in speculative tech stocks laid waste to her future-focused exchange-traded funds. Wednesday was a particular low point, with the flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) slumping 10% in its third-worst drop on record. One of the biggest drags that day was Coinbase Global Inc., the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, which tumbled 26% after disappointing results and amid a rout of digital assets. But while the rest of Wall Street was ditching the stock, Wood and her team stuck to their playbook and used the drop to increase holdings, adding about 860,000 shares in the week through Thursday. In many eyes, it’s a system that risks loading up on losers. Hitched to a concentrated portfolio of often highly speculative bets, it leaves Wood and her firm with plenty of critics. But the clarity of the goal -- chasing companies that can win big from major technological shifts -- and ARK’s commitment to it has won some remarkably loyal fans. “Cathie Wood has not wavered at all in her conviction in her strategy, and in fact has doubled down on her strategy,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “That’s attractive to a certain segment of investors.” As it plunged on Wednesday, ARKK actually posted inflows. It was a relatively small amount for the $7.8 billion ETF -- about $45 million -- but net inflows in 2022 are more than $1.5 billion. That’s for a vehicle that has plunged as much as 61% this year. “Investors that are in this strategy have stayed loyal to this strategy, have a long-term time horizon and view selloffs as opportunities to deploy some additional capital,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at ETF Trends. Of course, there’s also no shortage of investors ready to bet against ARK. Short interest in the main fund is a relatively elevated 14.8% of shares outstanding, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. Meanwhile, by the close on Wednesday the price of the Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF, which aims to deliver the reverse performance of the innovation fund on a daily basis, was more than double that of the ARK ETF. In other words, betting against Wood’s flagship strategy for a day cost twice as much as buying the fund itself to hold. But things were looking more positive for ARK by the end of the week as tech stocks managed a rebound. The innovation fund jumped 12% Friday after climbing 5.6% a day earlier. One of Wood’s high profile picks, Robinhood Markets Inc., was surging after cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried revealed a major stake. It’s a long way from undoing recent damage to Wood’s main ETF -- the fund would have to jump about 260% from here to reclaim its all-time high. But at least it provides some respite for the faithful. Ultimately, investors continue to lean on Ark ETFs as vehicles to get in and out of disruptive technology. In a turbulent week for the flagship fund, trading volume surged to a record 316 million shares. As Ark sticks to its strategy, investors “know exactly what they’re going to get” and can rely on its funds to make pure-play trades on innovation, Geraci said. “The benefit of Cathie Wood not wavering from her strategy during this brutal downturn is that I think it will help the longer-term viability of Ark.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville Venture Capitalists Are Aiming to Disrupt Fish Farming Crypto’s Fall, in Three Charts Starbucks Baristas Are Unionizing, and Even Howard Schultz Can’t Make Them Stop How Gillette Embraced the Beard to Win Over Scruffy Millennials ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Cathie Wood Just Keeps Buying Coinbase and Getting More Inflows,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-keeps-buying-170000015.html
5/16/2022,"Investors are facing a confusing environment, with long- and short-term signals sending different messages. Inflation remains stubbornly high, above an 8% annualized rate, and the Federal Reserve has made it clear that additional interest rate hikes are in the offing. Stocks are well off their highs, and despite last Friday's gains, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their sixth consecutive weekly loss. But there are positives, too. The 1Q22 earnings season gave an upbeat vibe, as more than three quarters of the S&P-listed companies reported positive earnings surprises. However, while corporate earnings are up for now, the purchasing managers index (PMI), a measure of inflation from the production side, is running at 11%, suggesting a higher rate of consumer inflation later in the year. So how do you find the next hot stock to buy in this environment? One way might be to screen for stocks that have been endorsed by analysts at major investment banks in particular, such as Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley. The firm’s stock analysts are showing their upbeat outlook by selecting the stocks they see as winners for the coming year – and winners with substantial upside, on the order of 60% or better. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve looked up three of these Morgan Stanley picks, to see what makes them stand out. SI-Bone, Inc. (SIBN) We’ll start in the healthcare industry, with SI-Bone, a medical tech and device company. SI-bone works in the field of sacroiliac joint pain and diagnosis, or the treatment of lower back problems where the spine connects to the pelvis. Musculoskeletal disorders of the sacropelvic region have a large impact on quality of life, an SI-Bone’s mission is to develop new surgical devices and procedures to solve these issues. The company’s lead product is the iFuse surgical implant system. This orthopedic implant device is designed for surgical procedures featuring smaller incisions and faster recovery times, and its triangular shape is proven to produce a more effective result in the patient’s recovery. SI-Bone saw significant pressure early in the year, when medical procedure deferments generally peaked. SI-Bone’s total deferments in January and February reached approximately 140 – but there were fewer than 20 in the month of March, indicating an acceleration of business. The company’s worldwide revenue grew 22% in Q1, to reach $20.4 million. This number included a gross profit of $18.2 million, for a gross margin of 89%. This compared favorably to the $16.8 million in revenue and $14.8 million profits from the same quarter last year. EPS, however, came in negative. The net loss of 37 cents per share was an improvement, however, over the 47-cent EPS loss in the year-ago quarter. SI-Bone finished Q1 with cash and short-term liquid assets, including inventory, of $208 million. Morgan Stanley analyst Drew Ranieri has a positive outlook for SI-Bone’s immediate future, writing: “While 1Q was in line with our expectations, the recovery trends exiting the quarter remain promising for the balance of 2022, and we see a positive setup for upside through the balance of the year if pandemic procedure pressures continue to abate. Broadly, our commercial inflection point thesis remains intact, and we believe this should become more visible as procedure recovery takes further hold through 2022."" To this end, Ranieri rates SIBN shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $22 price target implies a one-year upside of 76% for the year ahead. (To watch Ranieri’s track record, click here) Overall, there are 5 additional analyst reviews on this medtech firm, and they all agree with Morgan Stanley’s bullish take – for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $12.50, and their $27.50 average price target indicates room for a 120% one-year upside potential. (See SIBN stock forecast on TipRanks) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) The next stock under Morgan Stanley's radar is Palo Alto Networks, a leader in the digital world’s security segment. The company offers its customers protection from malware attacks through state-of-the-art network firewall technology. Palo Alto’s product line allows customers to automate their online and network security operations, to secure cloud activities and applications, and even to home and small business networks with enterprise-grade security. Given the increasing importance of online security – both generally, and specifically in today’s work environment of increased remote and home office activity – it should come as no surprise that Palo Alto’s revenues and earnings are both up. At the top line, the company has seen increasing revenue numbers for the last two years; the most recent report, for fiscal 2Q22, showed 30% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.3 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was reported at $1.74 for the quarter, up 12% y/y. Looking ahead to the full fiscal year 2022, the company expects its total billings to reach between $6.8 billion and $6.8.5 billion. This would represent a y/y gain of 25% to 26%, and would support revenues in the range of $5.425 billion to $5.475 billion. For comparison, the top line in fiscal 2021 came to $4.256 billion. All of this adds up, in the view of Morgan Stanley’s Hamza Fodderwala, to a solid prospect for investors. Fodderwala writes of PANW, “Security remains a top priority due to rising cyber threats and is by far the most defensive area of spend within IT budgets), with Palo Alto Networks positioned as a top strategic vendor to capture more wallet share within a large installed base of nearly 60K customers. With durable topline growth plus a focus now on driving higher margins and capital return, we view PANW as one of the most attractive risk/reward opportunities in software.” In line with these bullish comments, Fodderwala rates PANW an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a price target of $823 to suggests an upside potential of ~68% going forward into next year. (To watch Fodderwala’s track record, click here) This view is far from the only bullish take on Palo Alto Networks. The stock has no fewer than 23 Buy ratings on record, overwhelming the 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus view. The shares are selling for $491.01 and their average target of $656.88 implies an upside of ~34% from that level. (See PANW stock forecast on TipRanks) ZoomInfo Technologies (ZI) We’ll wrap up with another tech firm, ZoomInfo. This company offers a range of B2B services, through a cloud-based platform, that include sales and marketing, prospecting, demand generation, account management, data management, and custom data solutions. The company’s platform gives both marketers and sellers the tools they need for a comprehensive view of their business landscape, to shorten sales cycles and increase win rates. ZoomInfo already holds a strong position in its niche, but that has not prevented it from taking steps to expand its footprint. Early this month, ZoomInfo announce that it had acquired the digital marketing and branding platform Comparably, combining that company’s platform with ZoomInfo’s existing TalentOS. ZoomInfo did not disclose financial terms of the acquisition, which is expected to show a positive impact on the firm’s full-year 2022 results. On the same day as the Comparably announcement, ZoomInfo released its results for 1Q22. The company posted revenue of $241.7 million, up an impressive 58% year-over-year, and 18 cents per share in non-GAAP diluted earnings. That EPS result was flat sequentially, but up 38% from the year-ago quarter. The company had $125.9 million in unlevered free cash flow during the quarter. ZoomInfo expects revenue for this calendar year to reach $1.06 billion to $1.07 billion, an increase from the previous guidance of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion. Management expects this revenue to generate between $435 million and $445 million in unlevered free cash flow for the year. 5-star analyst Keith Weiss, covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, writes of the company’s outlook: “We believe a higher level of investment to build out the platform capabilities is warranted in light of sustained momentum and large market opportunity... We see ZI as one of our top ideas into 2022, as the company continues to deliver near 50% organic growth supplemented with best-in-class profitability.” Acknowledging the company’s potential growth, Weiss rates ZI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $81 price target suggests an upside of ~84% for the year ahead. (To watch Weiss’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s tech firms typically pick up a lot of analyst attention, and ZoomInfo has 14 recent reviews. These include 13 Buys and a single Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares have an average price target of $71.08, suggesting ~61% upside from the current trading price of $44.03.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Most Read from Bloomberg Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Meet the Hedge-Fund Manager Who Warned of Terra’s $60 Billion Implosion Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape How Omicron Infection Turbo-Charges Vaccinated People’s Immunity The euro is on the verge of U.S. dollar parity for the first time in two decades. Europe’s common currency has already slumped to a five-year low near $1.03, buckling from a rush into the greenback as a haven from market turmoil and on the war in Ukraine. That’s led the likes of HSBC Holdings Plc and RBC Capital Markets to predict the two will hit parity in 2022. Hedge funds are already betting on it. They’ve piled on $7 billion in notional value into options wagers on parity in the past month alone, making it the most popular trade among those looking for a further drop in the common currency. “The euro itself is not an attractive currency at the moment,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING Groep NV. While the Dutch bank is keeping its official euro forecast for the next six months at $1.05, Pesole admits the dollar’s strength and market volatility means parity is likely. To a large extent the euro’s plight is a function of dollar strength, which has been supercharged as the Federal Reserve presses on with bigger interest-rate hikes than its peers. A fresh bout of global risk aversion that has taken the wind out of equity and credit markets is only adding momentum to the move into haven currencies. There’s also a darkening outlook for the European economy. A continuing standoff with Moscow over the supply of natural gas to the continent has raised the prospect of a pronounced slowdown. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its 2022 growth forecast for the currency bloc to 2.8%. That’s left the European Central Bank walking a tightrope. It has to balance the need for tighter policy to tame record inflation against the prospect of the economic damage that could cause -- especially in some of the region’s most indebted member states such as Italy. While officials may raise rates above zero before the end of the year, there are doubts over further hikes beyond that. ECB Officials Increasingly See Rate Exceeding Zero This Year Investors will be watching speeches from the likes of ECB President Christine Lagarde in coming days, as well as the minutes of the bank’s April meeting on Thursday, for further clues on thinking. Lagarde has joined a crowd of policy makers signaling a hike as soon as July. “I think it’s politically difficult for many in the ECB to sound too dovish, considering that inflation has likely not yet peaked,” said Peter McCallum, a rates strategist at Mizuho International Plc. “Unless we get 50 basis-point hikes being talked about, it’s tough for many of the hawks to surprise the market now.” Any renewed selloff in the euro that breaches the January 2017 low of $1.0341 -- almost touched on both Thursday and Friday -- could set the currency up for further losses. Tail Risk With the region’s bonds also being dumped, the currency market may start to factor in debt risks in the euro zone, according to HSBC Holdings Plc strategists including Dominic Bunning. The spread between Italian and German yields -- seen as a risk gauge -- topped 200 basis points this month for the first time since the early days of the pandemic. Not everyone is negative. Roberto Mialich, a currency strategist at UniCredit SpA, expects the euro to climb back above $1.10 in the course of next year as the Fed’s hiking cycle tails off. He sees a lasting below-parity scenario as just a tail risk, and only likely if euro-zone growth slumps far more than feared. Yet as long as risk assets remain vulnerable, traditional havens like the dollar and the yen will stay in vogue. Russia’s war in Ukraine also remains a major headwind for the euro, particularly given the prospect of further disruptions in gas supplies. “The euro has already faced more downward pressure than we expected, but we find it hard to see a silver lining for the single currency at this stage,” HSBC strategists wrote in a note, pointing to downward revisions to growth forecasts and upward revisions for inflation. “This is a nasty cocktail for any currency to try to digest.” This Week UK labor data is due as well as inflation figures for April, which are expected to show consumer prices rose an annual 9.1% from 7% in March, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed. For the euro-area, the minutes of the latest ECB meeting will be released, albeit there may be few surprises given the raft of central bank policy makers that have expounded their views As well as the minutes, speakers next week include ECB Executive Board member Luis de Guindos and ECB President Christine Lagarde. BOE rate setters Andrew Bailey, Dave Ramsden, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders will be grilled by lawmakers on Monday. European government bond issuance volume should pick up to about 25 billion euros next week, with supply from countries including Germany, France, Spain, Finland and Slovakia, according to Commerzbank AG.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A mass exodus of money, an $11 trillion wipeout, and the worst losing streak for global stocks since the 2008 financial crisis. The bad news is that it may not be over yet. Most Read from Bloomberg Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Meet the Hedge-Fund Manager Who Warned of Terra’s $60 Billion Implosion Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape How Omicron Infection Turbo-Charges Vaccinated People’s Immunity The selloff in the MSCI ACWI Index has dramatically lowered valuations of companies across the US and Europe, but strategists ranging from Michael Wilson at Morgan Stanley to Robert Buckland at Citigroup Inc. expect stocks to fall further amid worries of high inflation, hawkish central banks and slowing economic growth, especially in the US. Money is continuing to leave every asset class and the exodus is deepening as investors rush out of names like Apple Inc., according to Bank of America Corp. Historically significant technical levels for the S&P 500 show the index has room to fall nearly 14% more before hitting key support levels, while the share of companies that have so far hit a one-year low is still a far cry from the number during the economic growth scare that slammed stocks in 2018. “Investors continue to reduce their positions, particularly in technology and growth stocks,” said Andreas Lipkow, a strategist at Comdirect Bank. “But sentiment needs to deteriorate significantly more to form a potential floor.” On the other side, some say the rout has already created pockets of value across sectors including commodities and even technology, which is valued on future earnings growth and, therefore, generally shunned during periods of high interest rates. The Nasdaq 100 rallied on Friday, but it still closed the week down over 2%. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Peter Oppenheimer has been among the most high-profile strategists to say it’s time to buy the dip, while Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital LLC, said “old school tech” stocks including Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc. were now trading at attractive multiples. But amid the morsels of value, the broader market looks to be buckling as recession creeps more and more into the conversation. And even as growth worries mount, the inflation focus at the Federal Reserve and other central banks means investors can’t count any more on the monetary elixir that’s helped to keep alive the long-running bull market. The MSCI ACWI has fallen for six straight weeks, the Stoxx Europe 600 is down 6% since late March, while the S&P 500 has dropped more than twice as much. Here are some key metrics showing the potential downside for stock markets. Falling Fast The S&P 500 is still about 14% above its 200-week moving average, a level that’s previously been a floor during all major bear markets, except for the tech bubble and the global financial crisis. Strategists at Canaccord Genuity say there could be further declines on Monday on forced margin selling after yet another red week for the US benchmark. Stressing Out For all the recent declines -- the S&P 500 is down more than 13% from its high on March 29 -- stress indicators also aren’t at levels seen during comparable slumps. Fewer than 30% of the benchmark’s members have hit a one-year low, compared with nearly 50% during the growth scare in 2018 and 82% during the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, the 14-day relative strength index suggests the S&P 500 isn’t yet at the floor. While the Stoxx Europe 600 Index entered into oversold territory last week, the US benchmark has not yet hit that level, which is generally a precursor to a rebound. Getting Defensive Defensive stocks have been in demand as the specter of slowing growth hammers economically sensitive cyclical sectors. The Stoxx 600 Defensives Index is flat in 2022 versus a 15% drop for cyclicals, and strategists at Barclays and Morgan Stanley expect that trend to continue. At UBS Wealth Management, Claudia Panseri sees pricing for a “mild recession” in the cyclical-versus-defensive relative performance. Comparison with past periods of defensive strength also signals the potential for more to come. Relative gains this year still trail the performance in 2016, brought on by a slowdown in China and Brexit worries, and in the early days of the pandemic in 2020. Cheap-ish Although valuations of technology stocks have fallen sharply -- the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now trades at about 20-times forward earnings, the lowest since April 2020 -- some strategists expect them to remain under pressure from aggressive monetary tightening by central banks. Tech stocks just suffered their biggest weekly outflows of the year, according to Bank of America. And even after the crushing price drops, Valerie Gastaldy, a technical analyst at Day By Day SAS, says the sector is at risk of losing another 10% before finding a floor. “I don’t think we have seen capitulation just yet,” said Dan Boardman-Weston, chief executive of BRI Wealth Management. “This week has been pretty brutal, and investor sentiment, especially in the technology area, is shot to pieces.

The EU’s executive arm told the governments that the guidance does not prevent companies from opening an account at Gazprombank and will allow them to purchase gas in accordance with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the people added. European companies have been scrambling for weeks to figure out how they can meet Moscow’s demand and keep the crucial gas flowing without violating sanctions on Russia’s central bank. Putin said on March 31 that if payments aren’t made in rubles, gas exports would be halted. Europe depends heavily on the Russian fuel to heat homes and power industry. Initially, the EU had assessed that the payment mechanism demanded by Putin handed Moscow total control of the process, breached contracts and -- crucially -- violated the bloc’s sanctions. On Friday, the commission told member states in a closed-door meeting that the updated guidance will clarify that companies can open an account in euros or dollars at Gazprombank as ordered by the Kremlin, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. But the EU’s executive arm stopped short of saying whether also having an account in rubles -- a step included in the Russian decree -- was in line with EU regulations. Previously, officials had indicated, though never in writing, that opening such an account would breach sanctions. The updated guidance, as presented to member states, fails to address this specific point, the people said. Another key point in the guidance is that once European companies make a payment in euros or dollars and declare their obligation complete, no further action should be required of them from the Russian side in regard to the payment. The clock is ticking because many firms have payment deadlines falling due later this month -- and if they don’t pay, gas flows could be cut off. Poland and Bulgaria already saw their supplies cut after failing to comply with Russia’s requests. Putin’s demands to pay in rubles have divided EU member states, highlighting the dependence of some nations on Russian imports. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said earlier this week European companies will be able to pay for gas in rubles without breaching sanctions. At the Friday meeting, government representatives were split too, according to one of the people. While Germany, Hungary, Italy and France broadly endorsed the commission’s plan, Poland said it failed to offer legal clarity and called for the matter to be discussed by EU ambassadors. Others were confused by the lack of specific guidance on opening accounts in rubles. Germany said at the meeting that it consulted its companies on the proposal and got positive feedback, the person added. It also sought to fine-tune the recommendations by clarifying that EU sanctions don’t prohibit opening multiple accounts at Gazprombank. The commission declined to comment on the revised guidance. Individual member states are ultimately responsible for enforcing EU sanctions, but the commission provides legal guidance. Putin’s decree called for companies to open two accounts with Gazprombank -- one in euros and one in rubles -- and stipulated that gas payments aren’t settled until euros are converted into rubles. Russia clarified its decree earlier this month, stating that payments received in foreign currency would be exchanged to rubles via accounts with Russia’s National Clearing Center, and Gazprom provided buyers with additional assurances that the central bank would not be involved in the conversion process.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest bounce in US stocks is a bear market rally and more declines lie ahead, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.

But the benchmark still marked its sixth straight week in the red -- the longest such decline since 2011-- as investors worry a combination of surging inflation and hawkish central banks will spark a sharp economic slowdown. While some strategists believe the selloff in US equities has potentially reached a floor, Wilson continues to be among the most prominent bears, saying the S&P 500 is still not fully priced for the slowdown in both corporate earnings and macroeconomic indicators. Although his base case doesn’t foresee a recession, Wilson notes that “the risk of a recession has gone up materially. That is just another reason why the equity risk premium is too low, and stocks are still overpriced in our view.” He expects the S&P 500 could slump to as low as 3,400 points -- about 16% below current levels -- which is where both valuation and technical support are, he said. He expects the benchmark to climb to 3,900 index points by next spring, while saying equity market volatility will continue. Wilson also has a defensive sector bias by staying overweight health care, utilities and real estate and underweight consumer discretionary and tech hardware. Morgan Stanley isn’t alone in its sour outlook. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by David Kostin cut their year-end target for the S&P 500 on Friday to 4,300 from 4,700 points on higher interest rates and slower growth. Their new base-case outlook predicts no recession and forecasts the US benchmark’s price-to-earnings ratio will end the year unchanged at about 17. A recession, they say, would see the index fall by 11% to 3,600 as the P/E drops to 15 times.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Europe wavered and US equity futures slipped as traders weighed China’s latest measures to support its economy after poor data fueled concerns about the global outlook.

Telecoms also advanced as Vodafone Group Plc climbed after Emirates state-backed firm e& bought a 9.8% stake, becoming the group’s largest shareholder. Contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 declined, but were off the morning’s lows. Chinese data showed that industrial output and consumer spending hit the worst levels since the pandemic began, hurt by Covid lockdowns. Officials are taking measured steps to help the economy: China effectively cut the interest rate for new mortgages over the weekend to bolster an ailing housing market, but the one-year policy loan rate was left unchanged Monday. In the bond market, the 10-year US yield was little changed around around 2.92%. A key question is whether economic worries will help stem this year’s Treasury selloff, which has been driven by inflation and tightening US monetary settings. Cryptocurrencies dipped as the mood in stocks weakened. That took Bitcoin back below the $30,000 level. The risk of an economic downturn amid price pressures and rising borrowing costs remains the major worry for markets. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Senior Chairman Lloyd Blankfein urged companies and consumers to gird for a US recession, saying it’s a “very, very high risk.” Many traders remain wary of calling a bottom for equities despite a 17% drop in global shares this year. Volatility that saw the S&P 500 dip to a 13-month low last week before rebounding “is a reminder that for most investors, trying to time the market is likely to prove time-consuming and loss-making,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Investor sentiment is fickle, and markets are likely to remain choppy until we get greater clarity on the three Rs: rates, recession, and risk.” Food and fuel prices are feeding into rising costs. Wheat jumped by the exchange limit on India’s move to curb exports. Oil was dented by the Chinese figures but remains in sight of $110 a barrel. Shanghai is close to the necessary threshold for loosening its six-week lockdown, a development that could spur bets on rising energy demand. Traders are also waiting to see how European markets react to efforts by Finland and Sweden to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The shift in Europe’s security alliance could exacerbate tensions with Russia.

5/16/2022,"* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * China retail sales dive 11.1%, output drops 2.9% * Nikkei pares gains, S&P 500 futures turn lower * Dollar holds near 20-year highs, yen gets safety bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 16 (Reuters) - Asian share markets were struggling to sustain even a minor rally on Monday after shockingly weak data from China underlined the deep damage lockdowns were doing to the world's second-largest economy. China's April retail sales plunged 11.1% on the year, almost twice the drop forecast, while industrial output dropped 2.9% when analysts had looked for a slight increase. The risks had been to the downside given new bank lending in China hit the lowest in nearly four and half years in April. China's central bank also disappointed those hoping for a rate easing, though Beijing on Sunday did allow a further cut in mortgage loan interest rates for some home buyers. News that Shanghai was relaxing some of its lockdown restrictions offered only cold comfort to investors. Chinese blue chips shed 0.4% in reaction, while commodity currencies took a knock led by the Australian dollar which is often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were still up 0.2%, though that followed a 2.7% slide last week when it hit a two-year low. Japan's Nikkei clung to gains of 0.6%, having lost 2.1% last week even as a weak yen offered some support to exporters. EUROSTOXX 50 futures and FTSE futures went flat. S&P 500 stock futures lost early gains to ease 0.4%, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.3%. Both are far from last year's highs, with the S&P having fallen for six straight weeks. Sky-high inflation and rising interest rates saw U.S. consumer confidence sink to an 11-year low in early May and raised the stakes for April retail sales due on Tuesday. DOWNGRADING GROWTH A hyper-hawkish Federal Reserve has driven a sharp tightening in financial conditions, which led Goldman Sachs to cut its 2022 GDP growth forecast to 2.4%, from 2.6%. Growth in 2023 is now seen at 1.6% on an annual basis down from 2.2%. ""Our financial conditions index has tightened by over 100 basis points, which should create a drag on GDP growth of about 1pp,"" said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius. ""We expect that the recent tightening in financial conditions will persist, in part because we think the Fed will deliver on what is priced."" Futures imply 50 basis-point hikes in both June and July and rates between 2.5-3.0% by year end, from the current 0.75-1.0%. Fears that all this tightening will lead to recession spurred a rally in bonds last week, which saw 10-year yields drop 21 basis points from peaks of 3.20%. Early Monday, yields were easing again to reach 2.91%. The pullback saw the dollar come off a two-decade top, though not by much. The dollar index was last at 104.560, and within spitting distance of the 105.010 peak. The euro stood at $1.0394, having got as low as $1.0348 last week. The dollar did lose ground on the yen which seemed to get a safe-haven bid in the wake of the China data, slipping to 128.88 yen. In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was last up 2% at $30,354, having touched its lowest since December 2020 last week following the collapse of TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin. In commodity markets, gold was pressured by high yields and a strong dollar and was last at $1,811 an ounce having shed 3.8% last week. Oil prices reversed course as the dire Chinese data rekindled worries about demand. Brent lost $1.22 to $110.33, while U.S. crude shed $1.04 cents to $109.45.
