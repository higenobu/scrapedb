3/19/2022,"Labor looks set to form majority government in South Australia where the Marshall Liberal government has suffered large swings against it. The ABC election analyst Antony Green said that he did not believe the Liberal party could retain power based on swings towards Labor, which in metropolitan areas were as high as 7.8%. Premier Steven Marshall’s own seat of Dunstan – held on a margin of 7.4% – was also at risk of falling to the Labor party where there was a 6.2% swing against him in early voting. The deputy premier, Dan Van Holst Pelekaan, was also facing the potential loss of his safe regional seat of Stuart after a redistribution put former Labor-aligned independent Geoff Brock’s hometown of Port Pirie into the electorate. The ABC indicated the key marginal seats of Elder and Newland were likely to fall to Labor, along with the safer seat of Davenport. It was also ahead in two other key marginal seats of King and Adelaide. Labor holds 19 seats in the 47 seat House of Assembly while the Liberal party holds 22. Labor needs to win four seats to form majority government. As of 8.40pm, figures from the Electoral Commission of SA showed the Labor party had received 37.6% of first preference votes, the Liberal Party 37.4% and the Greens 10.2%. Labor is ahead in 26 seats, while the Liberal party was ahead in 13. Family First – which is now run by former Labor ministers Tom Kenyon and Jack Snelling – had registered 3.5% of primary votes. The Labor MP Tom Koutsantonis said there had been “dramatic” swing towards Labor and criticised the Liberal campaign for failing to address the priority of health. But the party’s former attorney general and deputy Vickie Chapman said that with just 14% of the vote counted, it was too early for the government to concede. The Liberal party was also struggling in key seats being fought against conservative independents who had defected from the Liberal party during the past term of government, with independents ahead in the seats of Kavel, Narrunga and Mt Gambier. Labor has run its campaign on the issue of health and ambulance ramping, while the Liberal party has been campaigning on the economy and the risk a change of government would pose as the state emerges from the Covid pandemic. Green said there remained an “outside possibility” that Labor would fall short of winning enough seats to form a majority government, but was still well placed to form a minority government.",News/Australia news,South Australian election: Labor on track to form government after large swing against Liberals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/south-australian-election-labor-on-track-to-form-government-after-large-swing-against-liberals
3/19/2022,"Sleep-deprived Americans may be rejoicing this week, if they have the energy: it could be the last time daylight saving time kills a precious hour of snoozing. But those extra hours of evening light could come at a cost. On Tuesday, days after we moved our clocks forward, the Senate – which refuses to tackle the climate crisis or ensure people can vote – somehow managed to unanimously support a bill to make daylight saving time permanent. Senators from both parties celebrated the passage of the grandiosely named “Sunshine Protection Act” – and instinctively, as a late riser, I found myself agreeing with them. Bright evenings for after-work strolls, sun-kissed drinks on a Friday night … who could object? Well, the experts could. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) released a statement in response to the Senate’s move, hailing the end of clock-changing but arguing that it should be standard time, not daylight time, that is made permanent. The organization cited an earlier position statement pointing out that “daylight saving time is less aligned with human circadian biology” than standard time. “Permanent, year-round standard time is the best choice to most closely match our circadian sleep-wake cycle,” said the statement’s lead author, Dr M Adeel Rishi, in an accompanying release. Tinkering with our bodies’ natural rhythms could lead to “increased cardiovascular disease risk, metabolic syndrome and other health risks”, the AASM said. “The reason it’s called standard time is because when they came up with these time zones, they did their best to pick the time when the sun was immediately overhead at noon,” said Dr Beth Ann Malow, a neurologist and sleep expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who recently testified before House legislators on the issue. “So the idea is that it’s most aligned with getting light when we should get light biologically.” Malow agrees that we should eliminate the twice-yearly changing of the clocks, which she says is associated with medical risks including heart attack and stroke. But of course, by moving the clocks forward, we’re not actually “protecting the sunshine” as the bill claims. We’re just moving it later in the day, meaning more trudging to work or school in the wintry dark. One misconception that came up in the House hearing is that dealing with daylight saving time is akin to dealing with jet lag, which travelers face routinely. But that’s a very different issue, Malow says, because when you travel, your environment is changing rather than just your clock. “When you actually change time zones, the light is traveling with you, so it’s easier to adapt,” she says. But when daylight savings begins, the sun’s position hasn’t changed. “That’s why some people actually get over jetlag, even though it could be multiple time zones, quicker than they do the whole one hour of daylight saving time.” Sleep experts are “big believers in the idea that morning light is really healthy for the body and helps synchronize biological rhythms,” Malow says. “I worry that going to permanent daylight, which is what the Senate just voted to do, is going to hurt a lot of people who really need that morning light.” And contrary to what I’d thought, that includes night owls like me. With the world conspiring to make us operate on a schedule tailored to earlier risers, those who have what’s known as delayed sleep phases – which are all the rage among teenagers – need the morning light to help them. “When I’ve taken care of people with delayed sleep phase, let’s say high school students, and they have to be in school at a certain time, I make sure that they get that light in the morning. We get them light boxes if they need, just to try to get them awake,” Malow says. Dr Jamie Zeitzer, who studies psychiatry and sleep medicine at Stanford University, agrees that we should stop the constant clock-changing, and that morning light is particularly important. But he remains uncertain about whether daylight time or standard time is a better permanent solution, arguing that while the existing evidence favors standard time, more research is needed. “I don’t think we have sufficient data to say that the biological aspects of it should outweigh all things,” he says. In addition to biological concerns, “you also have economic ones. You’ve got social ones – would you rather have kids standing outside for the bus in the dark in the morning, or kids able to play sports after school in the evening? Different people want different things.” At Malow’s House hearing, Steve Calandrillo, a law professor at the University of Washington, enumerated some of those external concerns, arguing in favor of permanent daylight savings by noting that, for instance, crime and traffic are higher in the evening; there may be energy savings involved; and later daylight benefits commercial interests. He cited a 2004 study that argued permanent daylight savings could prevent 366 pedestrian and motor vehicle occupant deaths per year. But, as Aaron Blake writes in the Washington Post, it is not clear that the practice offers dramatic energy perks, and it may even increase gasoline consumption. As for crime risks, poor sleep may harm our situational awareness, Malow notes. The non-profit National Safety Council, whose focus includes traffic safety, endorsed the AASM statement. And should we account for regional differences in any decision? Perhaps permanent daylight savings appeals to people in Florida, including Marco Rubio, who championed the bill, but not in the midwest, both Malow and Zeitzer say. In fact, the US has tried permanent daylight saving time before, most recently in 1974 amid an energy crisis. There was little evidence that later light would actually save energy, but the idea was popular, Blake writes. After just a few months of dark mornings, support for the idea plummeted from 73% to 30%. “People were sending their kids to school in the dark, and it was just super unpopular,” says Malow, who was disappointed senators didn’t take heed. “We don’t want to make the same mistake twice.” Given experts’ concerns, why did a Senate that reaches consensus about once per millennium have no trouble passing the bill? Some senators did have a problem with the plan, according to reporting from BuzzFeed News, but it was passed via a procedural move known as unanimous consent that slipped under some lawmakers’ radars. Now the bill heads to the House, where Malow was glad to see more careful consideration of the issue. “Rather than jumping into, ‘Well, let’s just get rid of that,’ they want to do the analysis,” she says. Zeitzer would like to see lawmakers going to federal bodies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to commission thorough investigations of the risks and benefits of change. “But that may be my fantasy, that the Senate actually cares about data, and facts, and things like that,” Zeitzer says. “​​It’s not like they’re saying: ‘Oh, here’s this report that was put out that examines nationwide crime rates.’ It’s always, you know, ‘Doesn’t it make sense?’ And usually anything that makes sense isn’t true.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,My sleepy brain loves the sound of permanent daylight savings.

3/19/2022,"At the beginning of the pandemic, one romantic comedy setup I heard repeatedly (from fellow authors, hoping to wrangle a book deal out of the situation) was the one about the couple who meet on Tinder and have one date in real life, before (for a variety of complicated and tenuous reasons) they have no choice but to move in together because of lockdown. It’s easy to see why this idea was so attractive: it was a ready-made romcom plot. Take two fish, remove them from their water and watch hilarity ensue. Of course, no one ever suggested a happily married couple for this kind of scenario because what fun would that be to read? And yet, over the past two years, I’ve found myself living in a gentle romantic comedy of sorts – less When Harry Met Sally, and more I’d Always Thought You Were My Favourite Human Being But Thanks to Two Years of Covid, I Now Know This for a Fact. In the first lockdown, social media came into its own. When I wasn’t on FaceTime with friends, I was Zooming them, and when I wasn’t doing either of those we would be catching up via Houseparty (remember that?). As the weeks rolled on, however, it became clear that not going anywhere or doing anything was something of a conversation-killer. By the time we had clocked up the first month, barely anyone was interested in talking at all. My wife Claire and I, meanwhile, always seemed to have something to discuss, whether it was guesstimates as to how long this whole thing would go on for, or telling each other anecdotes we had already shared many times across our 25 years together. We even took to conversing at length about the size, shape and solidity (or lack thereof) of our rescue greyhound’s poo (I’m sure fellow dog owners will understand). Unlike when speaking with friends, no topic, no matter how prosaic, was out of bounds with my wife. It was almost as if, unconsciously, we’d both decided that it wasn’t so much what we said in this often-terrifying situation that was important, but rather the fact that we were communicating at all, letting the other know that we were in this together. I know that single male friends of mine found lockdown particularly difficult to handle. So much of our remote communication is functional in nature (Me: Pub? Mate: thumbs-up emoji) and we only really warm up to back-and-forth conversation in person, which, of course, wasn’t allowed. It certainly made me grateful that I had my wife to laugh, cry and yell at the TV with. It was funny how quickly she and I adapted to a world that had changed overnight. Suddenly, date night wasn’t dinner and drinks but rather a walk around the block after dark. A romantic getaway wasn’t a mini-break in Paris, but heading up to bed early several nights in a row to make our way through back-to-back episodes of Spiral. Several times during the various lockdowns, it occurred to me that perhaps this was a little bit of a glimpse into what our retirement might look like. I’ve always hated the idea of becoming one of those men who take up golf to avoid being around their partner. The pandemic, then, has at the very least shown me two things: that it’s highly likely I’ll spend much of my twilight years in front of the TV or reading books, rather than working on my golf swing – and that the person I’ll be doing this with will be my wife.

3/19/2022,"Is this bag too heavy? Do my boots pinch? Am I fit enough? Do I look a complete anorak in this cagoule? There is nothing like the prospect of a multi-day, long-distance footpath to rouse lurking anxieties and keep you awake at night for weeks beforehand. And there is always the helpful soul who insists you must take a particular item: a thick hardback volume on the benefits of walking? Lovely. A selection of artisanal cheeses and a bottle of fizz? I’ll squeeze them in somehow. Once for me, in Yemen, it was a pistol, presented with the comforting words: “Take this – you’re going to need it.” Then, finally, you begin. You are moving and eventually comes the realisation that, assuming you manage the feat of placing one foot in front of the other, you will make it. You dump the hardback book and pistol, scoff the food, quaff the drink; your bag gets significantly lighter. The sun comes out and all the mountains stand before you. With luck, there are no more cars, no power lines or pavements for a long time to come. Within a few hours you are looking back and saying, “I can’t believe I’ve walked so far already!” Within a few days, you say, “I just want to keep going forever.” (There will be moments when you bitterly regret that one.) You have entered the real world, the one you now prefer. You are a long-distance European mountain walker. So here are some ideas, some real walks to be considered. In 1766 two Dresden art teachers, Anton Graff and Adrian Zingg, set off on a trip into Saxony, heading through the town of Pirna, south-east of their home, into a region of mountains, mists and deep valleys that now straddles the border of Germany and the Czech Republic. Other painters, including Caspar David Friedrich, soon followed, triggering a romantic art movement and a love of hiking. In 2006 a new path, the Malerweg or Painters’ Path, opened, a 71-mile circuit that has quickly become a German classic. Normally done over eight days, the walk takes in highlights such as sandstone outcrops and massifs such as the Schrammtor and Schrammsteine, where the trail burrows up narrow canyons, often on ladders, to magnificent views. Don’t bring a massive, wide backpack – you will get stuck – but come with sketching gear. There is plenty of accommodation in guesthouses along the path, but there are some campsites, too, and pitching under rock overhangs is tolerated.More details on the official website: Malerweg. Hiking Navigator has a very useful stage-by-stage guideTours The Natural Adventure Company offers a great self-guided walk of the Malerweg from £765pp, which includes nine nights in hotels, luggage transfers and breakfasts It was on the Alta Via 1 that I first experienced the magic of the Dolomites. We had hiked up the trail to the Rifugio Nuvolau mountain hut in broad sunshine, but as the day ended clouds came rolling in from the Adriatic Sea, blossoming above the 3,000-metre peaks in dramatic thunderheads that were then slowly torn apart by the wind in the dying rays of a ripening red sun. In many years of mountain walking and climbing I had never witnessed anything like it. Eventually we went inside the hut for a hearty, home-cooked dinner and asked the manager if he’d seen the spectacle outside: he nodded, grinning, “Yes, every night.” The Dolomites, named after an 18th-century French mineralogist, are an Italian extension of the Alps that regularly pull in the Adriatic clouds to adorn their stunning peaks and rock formations. Cinque Torri, the Five Towers, is just one clutch of crags that lies on the Alta Via 1, a north-south hiking route that also passes valleys (decked with flowers in season), waterfalls, epic ridges and some fascinating first world war history. Most walkers start in the north at Lago di Braies (spend a night there if possible – it’s beautiful) and take 10 days to reach the finish at La Pissa, 74 miles away, but there is no reason you couldn’t do it the other way around. It can be done faster, but the terrain is tough – don’t underestimate it. Some via ferrata (steel climbing fixtures) can be included, which are great fun, but you’ll need a harness and a lanyard. There is no wild camping allowed, but the accommodation is a prime attraction on this route: the stop before Nuvolau (only accessible on foot) is Rifugio Lagazuoi, a larger but equally enjoyable place that sits on an escarpment above a complex network of first world war tunnels. The hut can sleep about 70 and is accessible by a cable car, so it is a lot busier than others, but the atmosphere and panoramas are as good as anywhere. Allow a day to explore the tunnels and trenches. Outside this short honeypot section, you will encounter only a few other hikers and climbers.More details Visit Dolomites; maps: use the Tabacco editions; books: Trekking in the Dolomites by Gillian Price; The Dolomites: Rock Climbs and Via Ferrata by James RushforthAccommodation Booking at the rifugio is essentialTours Collett’s Mountain Holidays specialises in the area. Alpine Exploratory does self-guided and guided versions of the complete 74-mile ute At a mere 2,863 metres, Triglav might seem like an Alpine pimple, but be warned: this is a serious lump of rock, requiring careful preparation, and also home to several of Europe’s most incredible walks. All routes require at least two days for normal mortals; more if you actually want to enjoy the experience. The most demanding ascent is called the Bamberg, and requires nerves of steel on the iron cables. Head for the top of the Vrata Valley and a night in the Aljažev Dom hut. Ahead stands Triglav’s legendary North Face, a near-vertical kilometre of karstic limestone. The Prag route to Krederica hut is easier than the Bamberg, but still requires steady hands up some vertical sections – all well protected as long as you use the via ferrata correctly. Triglav is a very dry place (except during summer thunderstorms), so bring lots of water. The Bamberg itself takes you through a series of tough vertical pitches, narrow canyons and plenty of exposure, as climbers call it, popping out on a rocky plateau that takes you to Planika Hut for a possible overnight before the final ascent. If you really don’t like the prospect of a via ferrata – and they’re not everyone’s bag of wire – try the Krma route, which starts from Kovinarska Koča hut, rising up to the Krederica hut at 2,515 metres. The final ridge does involve some via ferrata cables, but the summit is in sight and is worth it.More details Triglav national parkTrips (tours) Much Better Adventures runs various two-night trips to Triglav from £392, including guides, via ferrata equipment, meals, accommodation and airport transfers The Czech Republic has some fine walking routes, but none beats the exquisite labyrinth of sandstone rock towers in the east known as Bohemian Paradise. From the start in the town of Turnov, this feels like moving into a Mitteleuropa of a slower, more ancient vintage: villages that cluster around castles are dotted across a landscape of mountains, meadows and forests. The path heads south and soon begins to bump into isolated rock towers and natural grottoes that become more and more grandiose and dramatic. If they were the fanciful rock follies of some deranged Austro-Hungarian princeling, it would be no surprise, but they are completely natural. At Prachovské Skály the geological eccentricity reaches its apogee: this is a baffling playground of towers, canyons and stairways (humans have played a minor role here) that is difficult to leave – partly because it is so delightful and partly because it’s hard to find the way out. No wonder film location scouts looking for a gothic or medieval fantasy hideout often end up here. Walking north to south is preferable, because you finish in Jičín, an imposing old city with a beautiful square and market. However, going in the other direction does open up the possibility of connecting with the E3 long-distance path.More details Visit Czech RepublicTours On Foot Holidays does a six-night trip from £635pp including breakfasts and luggage transfers Having warmed up on short hikes like the other five mentioned here, you may be ready to really stride out. For this I suggest the GR10, which traverses the entire length of the Pyrenees, a distance of around 900km. At the end of your 50- to 60-day walk, you will have climbed the equivalent of more than five Everests (about 48,000 metres of ascent). I have done a few sections and it is superb high-country hiking. There are in fact two paths: on the French side of the border is the GR10, the Sentier des Pyrénées, and on the Spanish, GR11, the Senda Pirenaica. Overall, the French side is a slightly easier option: there are more mountain huts and more walkers, while its altitude is slightly lower. Both paths are spectacular, with stunning scenery including the Añisclo Canyon and the Cirque du Gavarnie. For those without time for the entire hike, these two highlights can be done as day walks. The wildlife is special: chamois, marmots and bears (although you are very unlikely to see one), plus wonderful birdlife, especially during migration periods. As both paths rise above 2,500 metres, they may not open until late June, or even into July, whereupon thunderstorms become a danger.More details Walking the Pyrenees , with a blogfrom Steve Cracknell, who walked both routes; Cicerone guide Occasionally you go somewhere, you walk, you see no wildlife, the clouds come down and any views go no further than you could chuck a walking pole. So it was when I first hiked in Austria’s vast Hohe Tauern national park. We were unlucky with the weather, and the wildlife. But everything else was magnificent: the forest, the waterfalls and the cosy mountain huts. The Glockner Circuit is an Alpine classic: 71 miles of tough footpath that circumambulates Austria’s highest peak, the Grossglockner (3,798 metres). Start with a 660 postbus from Zell am See (which has international rail connections) to Kaprun, then make for the trailhead, where you start on an anticlockwise route around the peak. With luck you’ll see bearded vultures, golden eagles, steinbock and ibex – and even without it you will enjoy Austrian dishes like Kaiserschmarrn (a sweet pancake served with plum or apple sauce) and Käsespätzle (a type of cheesy pasta) in mountain huts such as Rudolfshütte (there’s a big climbing wall inside) and Salmhütte (recommended). This is a summer walk, but even then some of the higher sections can be impassable, with hikers forced to take lower alternative routes. It’s definitely not one for beginners.More details Hohe Tauern national, and also Carinthia Tourism, where there is a useful brochure to downloadAccommodation It’s worth joining the Austrian Alpine Club UK for access to huts Advice from the experts Mick FowlerMountaineer and hill walker who specialises in bagging unclimbed peaks, the type that invariably require long-approach hikesI always take a bivvy bag with me, Polartec gloves and a spare pair of socks – there’s nothing like clean dry socks in the morning! For mud and snow, gaiters are essential, and I find that trekking poles – love them or loathe them – protect my joints. To stay warm, layering is essential: base layer, fleece, then a down jacket. For me, the development of waterproof down jackets with a hood, like Berghaus’s Tephra, has been a game-changer. As far as your bag is concerned, get something big enough and don’t overstuff it; they get out of shape and uncomfortable. I generally take a 65-litre sack. Use compression straps to reduce size.

3/19/2022,"The world’s attention is focused on the conflict in Ukraine. But, as someone born in Afghanistan, the catastrophic events since the fall of Kabul are still uppermost in my mind. In those tumultuous days last August, the bustle of the capital city evaporated. The new Taliban government banned women from public spaces for decency reasons. Speaking out or protesting was met with harsh beatings and threats of maiming and murder. Gone, too, was outdoor music, or women walking around their city without a male escort. Within the first few months after western forces fled the country they had sunk trillions of dollars into – and lost – the first issue for Afghans was accessing money. When I spoke to my aunt in Kabul last month, she was forced to ask me for cash, for only for the second time in our lives. It’s hard to explain the cultural significance of this. My proud aunt, a headteacher, is now begging her staff to keep coming in to work every day for no pay. She’s used up all her savings and can’t afford food any more. “When the Americans left, the money left with them. Public sector workers like us haven’t been paid in five months. There’s whispers that women who work won’t be paid at all,” she tells me. The economic collapse of the entire country looms. Surprisingly, the Taliban government chose to keep the US-educated deputy finance minister Nazir Kabiri – who, despite having the opportunity to flee the country along with president Ashraf Ghani, didn’t do so. Of all the ideological clashes during the transition of power, to me this is the most peculiar one. On the day the Taliban fighters ousted the government, Kabiri tried to explain to the uneducated, mostly illiterate young militia men that the country was on the brink of bankruptcy. Kabiri takes a view that I wish more who are trying to help would. “The ministry of finance is a public institution … the banks, the private sector, the businesses, they all belong to the people of Afghanistan.” It seems that, on some level, the Taliban are gearing up to govern over the long term. My aunty and millions of Afghans are depending on it. Now, seven months on, the western withdrawal has had consequences more dire than could have been imagined. I see it every day on my social media feeds. Fathers and mothers trying to sell their small children for cash. Formerly high-profile women begging or selling their belongings on street corners. The UN warned of starvation, drought and mass unemployment, and it was right. Afghanistan is in the grip of not only a humanitarian crisis but a political one, where reports of torture, murder and Taliban retribution demonstrate a society in free fall. Yet the world has largely turned away. And, as Putin’s Russia has waged a vicious war on the Ukrainian people, I have found myself comparing and contrasting the western response to these two conflicts. Yes, Ukrainians seem to be being treated with more sympathy than Afghans – and some people believe this has been underpinned by racism or Islamophobia – but I think it is fine for Europeans to feel a heightened sense of sympathy for Ukrainian people. This week, as I watched footage of the destruction raining down on Mariupol, I was struck by how similar the block of flats in the background looked to the ones I grew up in London. They live like us, the British side of me gasped as the sadness set in. On the other hand, the British public has a myopic view of Afghanistan that barely goes beyond the image of burqa-clad women and scruffy children. Many in the global north know or care little about people who live so differently to us. This doesn’t excuse the blatant xenophobia that was on display in the initial stages of the Ukraine conflict, with exclamations of how tough the war is because its victims had “blue eyes and blond hair” and “are not obviously refugees getting away from the Middle East”. But life goes on and, judging from Ukraine charity appeals on my Apple Music app and at railway stations, society has answered the call of Ukrainian people laudably. During last summer’s war in Afghanistan there was a similar sense of collective outrage, of seeing human suffering and speaking up; and, this time, for the people of Ukraine, we have transformed that righteous anger into useful action. I guess, as a British Afghan, I’m a little jealous. I want us to care about Afghans in the same way we do the devastating war in Ukraine; but I’m now facing the reality that we don’t. That we can’t. It’s not only that British people see much of themselves in the blue of the Ukrainians’ eyes and the blond of their hair. It’s that, to our western sensibilities, Vladimir Putin represents a classic evil villain who triggers a desire in us to be the hero who brings him down. Yet to overly focus on him could have severe consequences for millions of people. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, captured it perfectly when he warned that the tragic situation my family are facing risks being overlooked: “Humanitarian assistance has to flow no matter how many other crises compete with Afghanistan around the world,” he said. For those of us watching from the Afghan diaspora in the west, it does feel like a competition – and one which, again, we are losing.

3/19/2022,"Greg Williams has 173,000 photos on his phone, but this is one of his favourites. Honeymooning in Mexico, he and his wife, Eliza Cummings, had enjoyed a massage in their hotel, and stepped into a large, round bubble bath for two. “We were messing around with the bubbles,” Williams recalls, “and when she lifted her hand up to her mouth like this, it looked just like she was holding a cup of tea. It felt such a glamorous, timeless moment, and there are frames within the frame, like the window, and the engagement ring – a black sapphire – which even mirrors the shape of her face,” he says. Understandably, he didn’t have his professional camera to hand – he was stark naked – so he grabbed his iPhone, and took one quick shot. With over 30 years’ experience as a photographer, predominantly of celebrities (he also teaches an online photography course), he’s used to working at speed. “I never want to give the subject a chance to get bored,” he says. “And I’m not being self-deprecating, but luck plays a big part in photography, too. Sometimes you just capture magic.” All that said, his subject is no stranger to the camera’s lens; Cummings is a model. Williams thinks he caught something a little different, though. “Fashion photographers are looking for something from her, and she’s giving it to them, but here, she’s giving something to her husband,” he says. “This is not a portrait of Eliza Cummings: it’s a portrait of my wife.”  Greg Williams’ online photography courses can be found here: https://skillsfaster.com/",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘We were messing around with the bubbles’: Greg Williams’ best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/19/we-were-messing-around-with-the-bubbles-greg-williams-best-phone-picture
