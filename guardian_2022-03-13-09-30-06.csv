3/13/2022,"That this Players Championship has been completely distorted by storms was demonstrated by the completion of round one some 54 hours and 16 minutes after it got under way. Clear skies arrived on Saturday afternoon but so, too, did gusting winds. With ­temperatures falling, this felt far more Saltcoats than Sawgrass. Keegan Bradley explained the scale of the battle after a 71. “This is ­probably one of my best rounds of my life, honestly,” he said. “This is as tough as golf as you’re ever going to play. This is a course you want to play under no conditions because of how tough the shots are, and to play in this wind, to play like that, that was really, really a special round. “I hit nine-iron from 95 yards, then a couple of holes later I hit nine-iron from 208 yards. Even tapping in tiny little putts was just brutal.” Bradley’s score even included a two-stroke penalty after wind moved his ball on the 16th green. It took those who completed 18 holes on Saturday afternoon some five hours and 20 minutes to go about their business. Kevin Kisner was among those not impressed: “It’s pure luck and a somewhat loss of integrity of the tournament in my opinion,” he said. A large chunk of the field, including the 18-hole leader, Tommy Fleetwood, are still a long way from finishing their second rounds. This event will not conclude until Monday evening; Tuesday should at least now have been removed from the equation. Justin Rose slammed his club into the turf after finding water at the 11th. The first four players of the day to step on to the 17th tee ended up wet. By close of play, more than 20 others had followed the same path. This was as attritional as a major championship. Rory McIlroy, shortly before completion of a first round of 73, reached the green at the iconic 17th but proceeded to three putt. At the par four last, a McIlroy drive and three-iron proved insufficient to reach the putting surface. “Wow,” was the McIlroy reaction and no wonder. A second round of 73 from McIlroy means he faces an anxious wait to discover if he will make the cut from an ominous position of two over. A McIlroy double bogey at the 7th, his 16th, looked costly. The Northern Irishman found water from the tee, just moments after chipping in for a birdie. Justin Thomas, who played alongside McIlroy, is in good shape to successfully defend the Players after adding a 69 to a 72. Sepp Straka reached the 17th tee of his second round at five under par and one from the lead. Two balls were duly sent to swim with the alligators. Straka was lucky that shot five didn’t encounter the same fate. A seven from the Austrian removed him from the front page of the leaderboard. As others wilted, Bubba Watson marched through the field. The two-time Masters champion, who is now 58th in the world, produced a terrific second round of 68 to move to minus three. Even more extraordinary than Watson’s score was his failure to record a single second round bogey. He ensured that from 13ft at the last. Brooks Koepka, who has encountered problems at the 17th before, at least burst out laughing after watching his tee shot at the par three finish with a splash. “There’s nothing you can do, it’s gust dependent,” Koepka said. “I think today everybody knew today was going to be extremely tough. You play the wrong shot with the wrong gust and you make some numbers.” As if the elements didn’t throw up enough problems, England’s Matt Wallace had to deal with an unruly spectator as he walked from the 9th green. Wallace, who will miss the cut at eight over, said he was branded an “arsehole” by a member of the public. “He was drunk, very drunk,” Wallace said. “I went back to him and asked ‘Sorry?’ He was absolutely hammered so I just told his mates to look after him.” Others may not have been quite so polite.",Sport/Sport,Players battle ‘brutal’ conditions at storm-hit Players Championship,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/players-battle-brutal-conditions-at-storm-hit-players-championship
3/13/2022,"Soaring gas and electricity prices, high inflation, the worst squeeze for living standards in decades … The economic outlook was challenging even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now conflict on European soil and economic warfare through sanctions has added to the pressure. This week the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, as the war pushes up already high energy prices. It will be adding to the cost-of-living crisis by increasing the cost of borrowing, but the idea is to stop high rates of inflation becoming more permanent. Threadneedle Street’s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to vote for a rise from 0.5% to 0.75%, lifting borrowing costs back to pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Some of its more hawkish members may push for a bigger rise, to 1%, which would be the highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. While all of this was likely before the first Russian tank rolled into Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s war has complicated an already delicate balancing act for the central bank. With the impact of western sanctions and Russian countermeasures driving up the cost of oil and gas on international markets, inflation is now set to peak at higher than the 7.25% forecast by the Bank for April, and stay at elevated levels for longer than first thought. Some economists have spoken of inflation peaking close to 10%, compounding an already bitter cost-of-living crisis by adding to energy bills and driving up the cost of petrol and diesel to record levels. Until Putin’s invasion, Britain’s economy was holding up better than had been expected. Official figures show gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a faster rate in January than City economists had forecast, with a 0.8% rebound on the month from the Omicron-driven dip in activity seen at the end of 2021. Employment has continued to rise despite the end of the furlough scheme, and companies are still warning of shortages of workers and materials despite some signs of supply chain problems caused by Covid gradually fading. However, it’s probable that growth in the opening months of the year was as good as it will get for some time, given the impact of the war on wholesale energy prices and supply lines. With households facing a harsher squeeze, consumer spending is expected to suffer, which will be a drag on economic growth. Analysts at Goldman Sachs anticipate growth of about 1.2% in the first quarter of 2022, similar to the summer of last year, when the easing of pandemic restrictions helped repair some of the damage caused by Covid. However, GDP in the second quarter is expected to come in at only 0.4%. According to analysts at UBS, every 10% increase in the price of fuel, electricity and gas has the effect of cutting about 0.3 percentage points from household spending and 0.2 percentage points from GDP growth. Some economists warn that a worst-case scenario of soaring oil prices and energy bills could even tip the UK economy into recession later this year. Several people have therefore been asking whether the Bank should plough ahead with rate rises when the economy is slowing. Raising borrowing costs has little impact on global energy prices, and such powerful headwinds will take some of the steam out of the UK economy without the need for higher rates. Economists believe Threadneedle Street will continue to prioritise keeping a lid on inflation over providing more support to the economy. However, with households facing the worst squeeze in incomes since at least the 1970s, it will need to tread very carefully.",News/Business,Will the Bank of England push rates up with war set to drag spending power down?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/13/will-bank-really-push-rates-up-war-drag-spending-down

3/13/2022,"From the sea butterfly to the naval shipworm to the barge-footer, a strange cast of characters is vying for the public’s affection as part of a mollusc of the year competition. Researchers in Germany are asking people around the world to vote for their favourite creature out of a list of five nominees. The winner will have its genome sequenced, with scientists extracting DNA to work out more about how it evolved. This is a significant prize for a group of animals that remains largely unexplored from the genetic point of view, with only a few dozen genomes fully sequenced. “Molluscs represent some of the most amazing achievements of animal evolution – you go from one common ancestor to tiny little clams that live in the sand and a giant squid and so many other extraordinary forms,” said Prof Julia Sigwart, of the Senckenberg Museum of natural history in Frankfurt, who was involved in creating the competition. “A lot of these species don’t get studied, but each one tells its own wonderful story,” she said. Many people associate molluscs with garden slugs and snails but there are more than 120,000 known species of the invertebrates, which first evolved 500m years ago. Most of this ancient group of animals live in the sea. They have no bones or teeth but have a strong muscle for movement called the “foot”, and a sac for their intestines to go in. Voting for your favourite mollusc might seem niche, but like other nature competitions, including threatened plant of the year and insect of the year, it is a way of raising the public profile of undervalued wildlife. “People need to know molluscs are not just snails and slugs in their garden, they are so much more than that,” said Dr Carola Greve, laboratory manager of the Loewe Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics (Loewe-TBG) in Frankfurt, who did her PhD on sea slugs. “We want people to have fun with this competition, so they can feel enthusiastic about these creatures.” Among the nominees is the sea butterfly (Cymbulia peronii), which spends its whole life drifting in the open sea. At 6cm wide, it has a gelatinous shell and two wing-like structures, which give it the appearance of flying through the water. Sea butterflies are believed to be a “canary in the coalmine” for their sensitivity to ocean acidification. Knowing the genome will help scientists understand how it will react to ocean changes and provide insight into the creation of its fragile shell. The painted snail (Polymita picta) is an endangered species confined to eastern Cuba and is described as “possibly the most beautiful snail in the world”, on the competition website. It measures less than 3cm across and has bold, colourful, spiral bands. Genetic sequencing of this species could shed light on its “elaborate traumatic mating rituals”, which involve stabbing partners with a “love dart” and then transferring sexual hormones. Another competitor is the naval shipworm (Teredo navalis) – a clam, despite looking like a worm – that has been eating the hulls of wooden ships for thousands of years, most famously those of Christopher Columbus, leaving him stranded in Jamaica. Scientists believe shipworms could be used as nutrient-rich human food in the future as they can reach more than a metre long in just six months, surviving on wastewater and algae. “In the past, we were considered villains. But our future (and our genome) may just help save humanity,” the competition website says. Two other contestants are the telescope snail (Telescopium telescopium), which has a cone-shaped shell that is often covered in barnacles; and the barge-footer (Fustiaria rubescens), which lives in the muddy bottoms of the seabed and has a shell shaped like an elongated tusk. “I try to stay neutral – I think it’s important we back all five – but I’ve got to say, I’m a sucker for the barge-footer,” said Sigwart. A jury of scientists from the Senckenberg Museum, Loewe-TBG and the worldwide society for mollusc research (Unitas Malacologica), which are running the competition, narrowed the entries down to five. The cost of sequencing a genome for a mollusc is about €8,000-€10,000 (£6,700-£8,400). The process involves taking a single fresh specimen, euthanising it and bursting its cells to extract the DNA, which can then be sequenced. In last year’s inaugural competition, more than 20,000 votes were cast from 120 countries, and the winner was the greater argonaut, also known as the paper nautilus. Billed as the “most romantic” mollusc because of its long sea journeys, it is an elusive type of octopus that floats on the surface of the ocean. Sigwart said: “Obviously molluscs are wonderful, but it also speaks to the fact people are fascinated and thrilled by the natural world. These stories of weird and wonderful species are out there, and this competition is a way for people to express their joy about some of these animals.”  Voting is open until 15 March.

3/13/2022,"Labor will consider establishing a civilian natural disaster agency rather than use defence forces to respond to floods and bushfires. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, cited the “increased incidence of natural disasters and also the need for our defence force to be trained for military purposes” as reasons to consider a separate agency. O’Connor’s comments to the ABC on Sunday come as Scott Morrison continued to defend the pace of the Australian defence force emergency response, arguing that the community “are always the first” on scene because it is not possible to have “an ADF base around the corner in every town”. O’Connor told the ABC’s Insiders that “the incidence of natural disasters [is] increasing as a result of climate change” resulting in more “non-military deployment” of the ADF. “And that’s at the same time … that we have increased instability in the region, where we require … more significant effort in terms of potential military investment.” If elected in May, the Albanese Labor government would look at the climate change threat assessment and make “a series of decisions” in the first four months, O’Connor said. “One of the matters that would be under consideration is whether, in fact, we would continue to deploy the defence force in the way we are, or whether we need to think of some other means to respond so rapidly to the scale of the natural disasters that we’re experiencing.” O’Connor said Australia may need a “national emergency taskforce”. Although ADF assistance is helpful, he said he was “not sure it’s sustainable in the way in which it’s currently operating”. O’Connor said proposals had been put forward by the former chief of the defence force, Chris Barrie, Peter Cosgrove, and defence analyst John Blaxland. He argued the Queensland and New South Wales floods were the latest instance of the prime minister “failing to act on national disasters”, suggesting the ADF could have been in place sooner if he had “made clear from the outset” they would be used and declared a national emergency. The Sunday Telegraph reported the NSW SES had twice rejected ADF offers of assistance on 25 February, before ADF helicopters were requested and sent to Lismore on 28 February. Earlier, Morrison told Channel Nine’s Today that “we moved as quickly as the defence force and agencies can”. Morrison said that in comparison to the callout after the 2011 Queensland floods, the current response has seen four times as many ADF personnel mobilise one week sooner. The first response “is always from the community”, followed by the SES then the ADF, he said. Asked about scenes of Australians rescuing their neighbours, Morrison said “we need people to do that”. “The community are always the first ones there. To deploy a nationally positioned defence force, to mobilise with heavy equipment and provisioning, you can’t just turn that off and on. We don’t have an ADF base around the corner in every town.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison said the floods were “one in 500 years”, but conceded that climate change has affected the severity and frequency of such events. The Coalition has “always been very clear on the issues of resilience and adaptation”, he said. Morrison also boasted that Australia has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, a reduction driven in part by Labor’s carbon price, which the Coalition repealed in 2014, and by cheaper renewable energy. Morrison rejected “Labor commentary” that the government had been slow to act on bushfires and floods, citing a series of other crises it had responded to quickly including jobkeeper wage subsidies and closing the borders to China at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and building a “web of protection” against regional threats.",News/Australia news,Labor to consider civilian natural disaster agency as alternative to ADF ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/labor-to-consider-civilian-natural-disaster-agency-as-alternative-to-adf
3/13/2022,"Joe Root fancies his England players have turned a corner with their attitude after battling back from a horror start to the first Test against West Indies and ending it as the only team striving for victory. Though thwarted by a docile pitch in Antigua and two resolute batters in Nkrumah Bonner and Jason Holder, it still proved a solid turnaround after a slump to 48 for four on the first morning that brought memories of their Ashes collapses flooding back. This owed much to Jonny Bairstow’s sparkling 140 in their first innings 311 all out and then Root and Zak Crawley both passing three figures in the third to allow a sporting declaration; Root, trying to use this tour as a clean break from Australia, was happy. “It’s much nicer this way,” replied Root, with a smile, when asked how it compared with the Sydney Test in which the team were nine down and clinging on for their only other draw of what has been a chastening winter. “I’m really proud of the team. I thought the attitude throughout the whole week was just fantastic. “That is really promising and it’s filled me with a huge amount of confidence. Jonny in particular was magnificent. He likes to stand up in those situations and hopefully he can keep showing the world how good he is.” Root scarcely dwelled on his own 109 in the second innings other than to say it atoned for his dismissal in the first innings, instead preferring to highlight the impressive nature of Crawley’s 121 that ended a 19-month wait for a second Test century and saw the 24-year-old address some of his past shortcomings. He said: “The period where I was most impressed with Zak was when he’d made 50 and Alzarri Joseph and Kemar Roach bowled a couple of really good spells on fourth stump. “Zak was very disciplined, left the ball extremely well, defended straight and waited for them to come to him. I think that shows great maturity and a massive step forward for him – to manage the situation as well as he did, even if the ball wasn’t going all over the place. That’s where we need to improve as a batting unit – not gifting opposition wickets – and he’s set an example to the guys around him.” Root played down concerns over a lack of threat with the ball offered by Chris Woakes and Craig Overton – two of the seamers charged with stepping up in the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – pointing to a pitch that forced the pair to focus chiefly on economy after a disappointing new ball burst on day two. Jack Leach was described as “incredible” after match figures of five for 136 from 74.3 overs that represents his heaviest workload in a Test match, while Ben Stokes also defied pre-match predictions after his comeback from a side strain to play a full part with the ball and bowl with impressive hostility. The key to this, he explained, was more honest conversations about his readiness for spells out in the middle. There is a quick turnaround before the second Test in Barbados on Thursday and thus Mark Wood, absent on the final day and experiencing “acute pain” when trying to test his elbow problem in the morning, seems unlikely to feature. England are holding off from calling up a replacement player from home, however, with Ollie Robinson starting to make encouraging strides after the back spasms that ruled him out here and Matt Fisher and Saqib Mahmood also in the squad.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root hopeful England have turned corner after improvement in Antigua,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/joe-root-hopeful-england-have-turned-corner-after-improvement
