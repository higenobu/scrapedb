1/25/2022,"An environmental activist who was deceived into a two-year intimate relationship by an undercover police officer has been awarded £229,000 in compensation after winning a landmark legal case. Kate Wilson won the compensation after a tribunal ruled in a scathing judgment that police had grossly violated her human rights in five ways.  She pursued a decade-long campaign to discover the truth about how she was deceived into the sexual relationship by the undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, who spent seven years infiltrating environmental groups. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) ordered the Metropolitan police and the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) to pay a total of £229,471 to Wilson “by way of just satisfaction for the breaches of her human rights”. Such awards by the IPT, which hears allegations of abuse by the state, are rare. In a ruling last September, three judges in the IPT found that Kennedy had “grossly debased, degraded and humiliated” Wilson by deceiving her into the relationship. Wilson’s relationship with Kennedy lasted between November 2003 and February 2005. Kennedy did not disclose to her that he was a police officer who had been sent to spy on her and the political groups she supported. She only discovered his real identity in 2010. Kennedy was part of a covert police operation that spied on more than 1,000 predominantly leftwing and progressive political groups over more than four decades. Many undercover officers deceived women they were spying on into sexual relationships during their covert deployments. These relationships are known to have occurred between the 1970s and 2010. The three IPT judges ruled that senior officers supervising Kennedy “either knew of the relationship [with Wilson], chose not to know of its existence, or were incompetent and negligent in not following up on the clear and obvious signs” of the relationship. On Tuesday, Wilson said: “The finding that these operations breached the rights to freedom of expression and assembly and were unlawful amounts to a long overdue recognition that spying on protest movement is political policing and has no place in a democratic society.” “It is important, because it goes beyond the scandal of undercover officers deceiving women into intimate relationships. Violating our political rights was the entire reason for these deployments and thousands of people will have had their political rights violated in this way.” The IPT judges praised her “tenacity and perseverance” in pursuing the complaint. She fought a significant portion of the case herself as she could not afford lawyers. Helen Ball, the Met’s assistant commissioner for professionalism, said: “We recognise the gravity of the judgment in this case, which outlined a series of serious failings that allowed Kennedy to remain deployed on a long-term undercover deployment without the appropriate level of supervision and oversight. This resulted in Ms Wilson’s human rights being breached.” In recent years, the Met has admitted the undercover officers formed “abusive and deceitful” relationships with at least 12 women, including Wilson, and paid them compensation, after they took legal action in the civil courts. Wilson is the only woman who has so far pursued her case in a different legal arena, the IPT. The conduct of the undercover officers is being examined in a slow-moving public inquiry which is headed by the retired judge Sir John Mitting. The inquiry, which was set up in 2014, is due to hold its next round of hearings in May.",News/UK news,"Activist deceived into relationship with Met officer wins £229,000 compensation",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/activist-deceived-relationship-met-police-officer-wins-compensation-kate-wilson
1/25/2022,"Bulgaria’s government has been accused of negligence for failing to prioritise over-65s and people with pre-existing health conditions in its Covid vaccine rollout, in a case that exposes the low uptake of jabs in one of the EU’s poorest member states. The Open Society Foundations (OSF) charitable group said it was filing a formal complaint to the human-rights focused Council of Europe, alleging that Bulgaria’s government had put lives at risk, possibly leading to thousands of avoidable deaths.  The complaint is targeted at the policies of Bulgaria’s previous government led by Boyko Borisov, who was ousted in elections last April. After eight months of political stalemate, Kiril Petkov, co-founder of the We Continue the Change party, became prime minister last month at the head of a centrist-liberal-socialist coalition. The OSF is urging the new government to implement an emergency action plan to vaccinate people over 60 and those with pre-existing conditions, such as respiratory diseases or conditions that compromise their immune systems. Only 36.9% of Bulgarians over 60 are fully vaccinated, the lowest in the EU where the average for this age group is 90.8% according to available data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The other outlier is Romania, where only 45.9% of over-60s are vaccinated. The fact the two Balkan states, which joined the EU in 2007, have the lowest vaccination rates in the bloc has been attributed to superstition, misinformation and deep distrust of governments and institutions. In comparison, Hungary has vaccinated 81.4% of over-60s, Poland 76% and Latvia 75%. In western Europe vaccination rates for this age group are above 90% in many countries, with near or universal coverage in Denmark and Portugal. According to the OSF, between January and May 2021, 8,813 people over 60 died from coronavirus in Bulgaria, more than 80% of Covid-related deaths. In May 2021, only one in five people over 65 had been vaccinated. Despite the well-known risks to senior citizens and people with pre-existing health conditions, they were behind health workers, teachers and essential workers in the queue for vaccinations. In February 2021, Bulgaria’s government opened access to jabs to the general population at a time when supplies were still scarce. Long queues formed outside vaccine centres, meaning older people and those with pre-existing conditions had to wait alongside healthier, younger groups. “By rolling out the vaccine in such a negligent manner, the Bulgarian government put lives at risk, leading to possibly thousands of avoidable deaths,” Maïté De Rue, a senior legal officer at the OSF, said. “Even today, only about one-third of the Bulgarian population above 60 years old have been fully vaccinated, far less than most other Council of Europe countries.” Bulgarian authorities, she said, had made “almost no effort” to inform people about the vaccine, and had failed to tackle disinformation or take every step to make jabs accessible. The complaint has been lodged at the Council of Europe’s European committee of social rights, which is responsible for upholding the charter of fundamental rights. The OSF alleges Bulgaria has violated two articles of the charter: the right to health protection and the principle of non-discrimination. Bulgaria’s health ministry has been contacted for comment.",News/World news,‘Putting lives at risk’: Bulgaria referred to rights body over Covid vaccine rollout,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/putting-lives-at-risk-bulgaria-referred-to-rights-body-over-covid-vaccine-rollout
1/25/2022,"“Virginity repair” surgery known as hymenoplasty has no place in the medical world, British healthcare professionals were warned today, as legislation to criminalise the practice was introduced by the government. An amendment added to the health and care bill on Monday will make it illegal to perform any procedure that aims to reconstruct the hymen, with or without consent.  Dozens of clinics, private hospitals and pharmacies have offered the controversial surgery with the promise of “restoring virginity” – with growing numbers of girls and young women coerced into undergoing the procedure. Scar tissue is used to construct a fake hymen with the aim of making a girl or woman bleed when she next has intercourse. There had been pressure to outlaw the surgery from campaigners, including doctors and midwives, since the government pledged to criminalise virginity testing last July. Both practices are considered forms of violence against women and girls. One British survivor of “honour”-based abuse who was harassed for months by her parents to have the surgery said the ban would provide vital protection to girls under family pressure. Hafsah, who did not want to give her real name, is in her 30s and was raped as a child. Afterwards, her Kurdish parents became obsessed with the idea of presenting her as “pure” on her wedding night and her father told her there was a surgery that would “fix her shame”. She explained: “The risk of being ostracised by my community because I didn’t want to go ahead with the surgery under my parents’ orders put me in an extremely dark frame of mind. I felt like I didn’t belong and I was abnormal. “I told them I didn’t want the surgery but for more than a year they used emotional blackmail to try to persuade me.” Hafsah explains: “If hymenoplasty had been illegal when I was a teenager it would have saved me a lot of emotional abuse. I’m sure it will be a great comfort to vulnerable girls in a similar position to know that the law is on their side. It could give them the strength to stand up for themselves.” Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said hymenoplasty can never be justified on health grounds. “We have been campaigning for the ban of both virginity testing and hymenoplasty alongside women’s health and rights charities, as they are inextricably linked forms of violence against women and girls. “We want to send a clear message to healthcare professionals that neither practice has any place in the medical world and should not be carried out under any circumstances. We will inform the General Medical Council if we are made aware of anyone carrying out these procedures, so they can take the appropriate action.” He added: “Women deserve to have ownership over their own sexual and reproductive health.” Diana Nammi, executive director at the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organisation, said: “Every woman and girl who faces this invasive surgery [does so] under duress, direct or indirect, to present as a ‘virgin’, and, in many cases, it is carried out to enable a forced marriage, organised by her family. “Hymenoplasty causes trauma and, in around half of cases, it fails to make the woman or girl bleed the next time she has intercourse, leaving her highly vulnerable to ‘honour’-based abuse or even ‘honour’ killing.” The government moved to ban hymenoplasty after consultation with an independent panel of experts. The minister for care and mental health, Gillian Keegan, said: “I am committed to safeguarding vulnerable women and girls in this country. That’s why we are making virginity testing illegal and why we have taken another significant step to also ban hymenoplasty in the health and care bill.” She said the abusive practices had no place in society, adding: “We will continue to work across government and with local communities and organisations to tackle the taboos and damaging preconceptions associated with virginity and a woman’s worth.”  In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

1/25/2022,"The leader of the Ulster Unionist party is fighting for his political future after a series of historical tweets emerged that have been branded misogynistic and racist. Doug Beattie said he is “deeply ashamed” over the “horrific” tweets and will consult his colleagues over whether he should step down.  The controversy started over the weekend, when he posted what he said was a joke involving the DUP Stormont minister Edwin Poots, his wife and a brothel. Poots said the tweet was “incredibly hurtful” on Saturday and Beattie apologised and deleted it the following day. Since then, other messages dating back over 10 years emerged, including comments about women, Muslims and the travelling community. In one, Beattie posted an image of a woman with two Christmas pudding designs on her sweater, saying: “Don’t be wearing a jumper like this then complain when I stare at your boobs.” Another included a reference to English football supporters dressing in historic crusader costumes and referenced Muslims being “victims”. The political storm is a major setback to the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), which is in contention to seriously dent the Democratic Unionist party as the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland in the assembly elections on 5 May. A survey over the weekend showed Sinn Féin in pole position to become the biggest single party at 25%, the DUP down one point at 17% and the UUP at 14%. Beattie, 56, told the BBC’s Nolan Show the tweets are “pretty horrific, pretty horrendous”. He said the tweets demonstrated a “clear failing in myself, I have to own up to that” and said he asked people to “look at me [as] the person I am now and maybe not judge me from 10 years ago”. “If the party want me to stay I will still be the leader next week, if they don’t want me to stay I will not be the party leader next week,” he said. He added: “I will speak to my MLA [member of the legislative assembly] group today and I will speak to my party officers … if either group feels I should step down then I will. “Likewise if they think I should refer myself to the party executive or the wider council on a vote of no confidence then I shall do that as well.” Beattie took over as leader of the party last May and was positioning it as an alternative to the DUP. He reached out to the LGBTQ community and promised continued dialogue on Brexit issues, striking a defining contrast to the DUP, which has threatened to quit Stormont if the Northern Ireland protocol is not radically changed or dumped. “I am deeply ashamed, deeply embarrassed by it. I can apologise day and night about this, it wont change what I did 10 years ago,” he said. “I think people can change. I want to effect change in Northern Ireland. I want to effect change in people and some of that change is within ourselves. I am not the person portrayed in these tweets today. I am not going to give any excuses for it.” The former soldier denied he was misogynistic or racist and in a personal statement on Monday urged people to see he was not the man of 10 years ago, saying he had striven to advocate for women ever since he entered politics.

1/25/2022,"There is a photograph that is often pasted on to telegraph poles and hung in city squares during protests across Pakistan. It is of a woman, her hair dishevelled, her lips severely parched, her head at a strange angle. It is also a picture of a very tired woman. In Pakistan, you’ll find hundreds of women who, after a very hard life, giving birth and raising children, and then losing them to state violence, begin to look like that.The woman is Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and mother of three who is serving an 86-year sentence in a Texas prison for attempting to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. Earlier this month, a British citizen, Malik Faisal Akram, held four people hostage in a Texas synagogue and demanded Siddiqui’s release. Akram was killed in a shootout and the media were once again full of Siddiqui’s story – with her presented variously as victim and terrorist, genius and pawn. So much of her story is unknown or contested that it can be co-opted by all sides to suit their own ends. In Pakistan, we trot her out when we need to remind ourselves of our failure as a nation. We bemoan the fact that a monster called the United States of America came stomping in, took away our daughter and locked her up for life. Occasionally, noises are made that she should be released in exchange for this prisoner or that hostage, then we forget her again.  According to Pakistan’s rulers, Siddiqui is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the west. A middle-class, very Muslim girl gets a PhD, raises her voice for oppressed Muslims everywhere and is punished. That narrative, of course, never includes the fact that, while the Americans have been accused of kidnapping her, so have our own intelligence agencies. Neither the Pakistani government nor US prosecutors have ever deigned to tell us how exactly she ended up being interrogated by two American soldiers in Afghanistan in 2008 in the first place, after disappearing, along with her three children, in Karachi five years earlier.There is another picture of Siddiqui, this time often used by western media – her graduation picture, where she is bright-eyed, smiling, full of reckless optimism. Along with that photograph goes the narrative that she was a kind of terrorist genius, buying night-vision goggles, smuggling diamonds to raise funds for al-Qaida, and loitering around a government building in Afghanistan with bomb-making materials and a map of New York landmarks. In this narrative, it is rarely mentioned that, while she appeared on the FBI’s most-wanted list, she was never charged with terrorism. Siddiqui is often held up as “ransom girl” by the Pakistani government and various jihadi groups. The former prime minister called her the “daughter of the nation”, while Imran Khan, the current premier, proposed that Pakistan might be willing to swap her for Shakil Afridi, who is imprisoned in Pakistan after being accused of helping the CIA track down Osama bin Laden. Aside from the fact that we apparently live in a world where the idea of justice has been reduced to a hostage swap, both prime ministers and many other rightwing parties that brandish Siddiqui’s pictures never seem to raise the question of how and why she left Pakistan, and where she was during those missing years. Is it perhaps because it might lead to another question: who is kidnapping and disappearing our citizens now that the US is not even paying us to do so? When the US agreed to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan under the Doha agreement in February 2020, as a pre-condition to negotiations the Taliban got thousands of their brothers released from Afghan jails. Siddiqui was a high-profile female jihadist who faced a trial criticised by many international human rights organisations, yet did the Taliban negotiators say “no Siddiqui, no deal”? They forgot to even bring her up as a bargaining chip when they had their enemies on their knees. What we know for sure is that, after years of disappearance, she turned up in a Ghazni police station in Afghanistan in July 2008 and was interrogated by Americans. She picked up a rifle and was injured in a scuffle. She was charged with assault and attempting to kill the American soldiers, and during her trial she was declared mentally unfit, and then fit again. Witnesses couldn’t agree how many people were in the room when the scuffle happened, and there were no fingerprints on the gun. So much of her story remains a mystery. Based on the facts we can establish, Siddiqui is no emblem of jihad. Nor is she an emblem for hardworking girls wanting to go to MIT and do PhDs, and have children. Whatever the truth of her story, its murkiness is instead a symbol of everything that is wrong with our justice system and with the delusions of jihadists. Mohammed Hanif is a Karachi-based author.

1/25/2022,"The International Monetary Fund has sharply cut its growth forecast for 2022 with a warning that higher-than-expected inflation and the Omicron variant have worsened the outlook for the global economy. In a quarterly update to predictions made in October 2021, the IMF said it anticipated growth of 4.4% this year – down 0.5 percentage points – and emphasised the risks were of a weaker performance.  The Washington-based organisation blamed the downgrade on rising cost pressures and the rapid spread of Omicron, and said while the 2022 outlook was markedly worse for the world’s two biggest economies – the US and China – few countries would be spared a slowdown. The UK is expected to grow by 4.7% in 2022, a cut of 0.3 points to the IMF’s forecast in its October 2021 World Economic Outlook. Despite the reduction, the IMF anticipates the UK growing faster this year than the other six members of the G7 industrial nations – the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. “News of the Omicron variant led to increased mobility restrictions and financial market volatility at the end of 2021. Supply disruptions have continued to weigh on activity”, the IMF said, noting bottlenecks had shaved between 0.5% and 1% off global growth in 2021. “Meanwhile, inflation has been higher and more broad-based than anticipated, particularly in the US. Adding to these pressures, the retrenchment in China’s real estate sector appears to be more drawn out, and the recovery in private consumption is weaker than previously expected.” The IMF publishes its world economic outlook each April and October, with updates in January and July. After pencilling in 2022 world growth of almost 5% in October, it has now cut its baseline forecast for every G7 country apart from Japan. The biggest downgrade has been to the US – where the IMF’s growth forecast has been shaved by 1.2 points to 4%, but there were also cuts of 0.8 points for Germany and Canada, and 0.4 points for France and Italy. While China’s growth forecast has been reduced by 0.8% to 4.8%, India is expected to expand by 9.0% – an upward revision of 0.5 points since October. “Risks to the global baseline are tilted to the downside”, the IMF said. “The emergence of new Covid-19 variants could prolong the pandemic and induce renewed economic disruptions. Moreover, supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, and localised wage pressures mean uncertainty around inflation and policy paths is high.” The IMF used the update to repeat its call for more equal vaccine coverage, noting the fully vaccinated share of the population was about 70% for high-income countries, but below 4% for low-income countries. It set a target of vaccinating 40% of the world’s population by the end of 2021 but this was missed in 86 countries. “With the pandemic continuing to maintain its grip, the emphasis on an effective global health strategy is more salient than ever. Worldwide access to vaccines, tests, and treatments is essential to reduce the risk of further dangerous Covid-19 variants.” The IMF said its forecasts were based on Covid-19 health problems declining to low levels by the end of 2022, a pickup in vaccination rates and therapies becoming more effective.",News/Business,"Inflation and Omicron will dent world growth in 2022, says IMF",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/inflation-and-omicron-will-dent-world-growth-in-2022-says-imf
1/25/2022,"I’m not drinking, but have lots of good bottles of wine. What recipes are worth using them in?Jo, Cardiff “My strongest advice would be to hold on to them, take a picture, hug it, but don’t waste them on cooking,” says Luca Dusi, co-founder of London wine bar and shop Passione Vino. But I won’t call it a day just yet. “Cooking is all based on detail,” Dusi adds. “The recipe is the main body for the success of a dish, but the quality of the ingredients and their origin play a major part.” Wine in the context of cooking, of course, becomes an ingredient and the Guardian’s Fiona Beckett’s mantra is: “If you wouldn’t drink it, don’t cook with it.” (Hello, corked and “cooking” wine.)  That isn’t to say you should crack open your best bottle, mind, especially if you’re planning on pouring it all into a coq au vin, say. Pegs Quinn, chef and co-owner of Sonny Stores in Bristol, says: “There’s a certain level I would go to in terms of cost – about £8 as a starting point – but if you cook down wine, you’re going to lose a lot of the characteristics you’d enjoy from drinking it instead.” Bert Blaize, co-author of Which Wine When, goes a step farther: “I don’t think it matters what wine you use; it’s all about the cooking and preparation, so save the good stuff for when you can drink or gift it.” Plus, if Jo is off booze completely, it’s worth remembering that not all the alcohol will burn away anyway (depending on how much you’re using and how long you’re cooking it for). When it comes to those better bottles, Beckett writes: “The only time I’d use a better wine is if I was cooking something for a short period and wanted the flavour of the wine to come through.” Quinn, meanwhile, suggests a dish from his former haunt, The River Cafe: “Veal shin cooked in barbera with sage, pancetta, tomato and loads of garlic is an absolute banger. Do that with risotto bianco or polenta and greens, and you’ll make me very happy.” Blaize recalls a meal from Piedmont that used wine like a seasoning. “I ate some really simple but delicious cheese tortellini, which didn’t come with a sauce. They recommended adding a splash of red and eating it all together.” Alternatively, if you’ve got any pedro ximénez sherry knocking around, Blaize pours it over vanilla ice-cream and dried fruit for rum-and-raisin vibes. It’s also worth considering what style of wine you use, Quinn says: “The floral characteristics of riesling, for instance, will kill the subtle flavour of pear, say.” Instead, try a “fresher, dry white” such as soave. For anything tomato-based, Quinn leans towards the likes of “sweeter, juicier” nero d’avola, while a punchy chianti pairs well with irony flavours, such as chicken livers. But back to Jo’s “good” bottles. Rules are, of course, made to be broken, and Dusi sanctions one exception: “If you have a good bottle, we’ll allow you to use one glass in the cooking, but you have to drink the rest. It will help your tastebuds get ready for the food, too.”  Got a culinary dilemma?

1/25/2022,"This is an action thriller set in a secret Guantánamo-style black-ops facility where “terrorists” are tortured in the name of America’s homeland security and an extraction goes very wrong. It has risibly cliched dialogue and wooden, poorly directed acting from a B-to-G list cast, but it appears to be shot in one continuous take and strictly as an example of choreography and technical skill it’s pretty nifty. I would bet a box of popcorn there are a few sneaky invisible edits in there: for example when a suicide bomb goes off and the smoke clears to reveal devastation surely carefully arranged by set dressers, strewn with actors made up to look fatally wounded by shrapnel and debris. Nevertheless, with One Shot director James Nunn has crafted something as weirdly mesmeric as it is schlocky. The action starts in a military helicopter flying to a remote island belonging to some unnamed Nato country. (It was apparently shot in Suffolk, which would explain the presence of comically quaint pebble-dash on the walls.) A gaggle of Navy Seals, led by Scott Adkins’ head honcho Jake Harris (these protagonist hero guys are always named Jake or Jack), are escorting a CIA analyst Zoe Anderson (Ashley Greene). Anderson has arrived at the site to take a man named Amin Mansur (British actor Waleed Elgadi, giving the best performance in the film) back to Washington DC with her. Supposedly, former businessman Mansur knows the location of a dirty bomb with radioactive material that’s going to go off very soon, although he furiously protests his innocence and the guys running the site, led by Ryan Phillippe’s embittered senior officer, aren’t keen to comply unless the paperwork gets cleared. But suddenly, a truck breaks through the amusingly flimsy chainlink fence with what must surely be over a hundred trained mercenaries crammed inside (judging by the body count by the end of the film).  From this point on, the camera dodges and weaves about, following the different factions as they all shoot and row and blow each other up. The sound mix is a bit odd because every sound is equally loud, be it the purring phut-phut-phut of a machine gun or a shouted command or a platitudinous word of comfort to a dying comrade. But the digital cinematography is very crisp and the lighting adjusts seamlessly from indoor to outdoor settings. Maybe this is one big product demo for the camera technology?

1/25/2022,"Josephine Okokon, head of St Martins-in-the-Field high school for girls, London My race became an issue very early in my career as a teacher and I began to discover these subtle, covert barriers. I was often the only female teacher of colour and I soon began to see the white teachers getting more encouragement, more support and more mentoring than me. I was left to fend for myself.  Whenever I tried to put myself forward for promotion, I was told that I needed more experience but I’d look at the white teachers who had moved up and think, they’ve got the same, if not slightly less experience than me. I always had to go over and above to show that I could do the job well. But even though I worked so hard, I still had to keep moving to different schools to make sure I didn’t get stuck. It’s been incredibly frustrating and disappointing but I’ve taken pay cuts to get out of schools where I was told that I “didn’t fit the mould” or when I’ve found myself pushed towards pastoral roles instead of the academic route. As I gradually worked my way up, I found that if there was any multicultural mix in the school at all, it stopped at the middle leadership. After that level, school governors are the ones making the recruitment decisions. The only jobs I ever got at senior leadership level were when the governor panels were diverse: I never got the job if the panel was all-white – which almost all of the panels were. I sat in front of panel after panel of white men, hearing in their questions and the tone they used towards me that they couldn’t perceive that a black woman could do the job. I began to be very strategic with my applications. I researched 26 deputy head jobs but, after visiting the schools and speaking with the senior leadership teams, there were only six I felt I even stood a chance of getting – purely because of my skin colour. It was worse for headship roles. I looked at 23 jobs and, after researching each one, felt there were just four where my application would have been welcomed. I was offered two of those roles. Funmi Alder, head of Bearwood primary school, Berkshire There is absolutely systemic racism in the teaching profession, which make it very hard to progress in your career. I know a disproportionate number of very good teachers of colour who would make amazing headteachers but seem to be stuck in middle leadership posts. It doesn’t become easier when you become a headteacher. If anything, your position becomes more precarious because the higher you go, the more people have a problem with taking direction from those who don’t look like them. This is why new black headteachers have to work much harder than their white counterparts in developing relationships with staff with the sad reality being, that some will never accept you. I’ve done my own research and found a disproportionate number of cases where a board of governors have decided to get rid of a perfectly competent black headteacher, perhaps because the area is gentrifying and they think a white head will attract a different class of parent. Governors are enormously powerful and largely unchecked. If they want to get rid of a head, they can. I’ve also spoken to a lot of heads of colour who have decided to move on because the governors have made their position so uncomfortable. I know of cases where the heads have chosen to leave despite having really good Ofsted reports, because the governors have made ill-founded criticisms then gone off on fishing expeditions among the teaching staff, to find other faults to lay at the head’s door. The problem is that these heads have had to sign non-disclosure agreements, so they’re not allowed to talk about it. Anne Hamilton, headteacher at the Evelina hospital school, London When I was doing my national professional qualification for headship (NPQH), my mentor – a white head – told me she didn’t know where I could get a headship. Now, why did this white woman imply that I would never be a head? I had got on to this prestigious course and she had been chosen as my mentor. It was her role to give me everything I needed to do a good job when I became a head, not to tell me to give up. If I’d listened to her, I would still be a deputy head instead of a head entering her 10th year with a number of outstanding Ofsted reports behind her. Even as things were, it took me at least 15 years longer to be a head than it would have done, had I not been black. When I was a teacher, the leadership of every school I taught in, bar one, was entirely white – as was the teaching staff. I found this meant my voice wasn’t heard when discussions about the school were made and I wasn’t offered the opportunities to progress in my career that my caucasian teacher peers were. I had to keep moving schools to move up and avoid becoming like so many colleagues of colour, who have got stuck as teachers when their ambition was to go further. Becoming a head hasn’t been the end of the problems. I’m convinced my race has a big part to play in that. It’s never explicit racism but as a person of colour, I’m attuned to the micro-aggressions: the signs of the lack of respect, the lack of trust. The subtle undermining, challenging, second-guessing and constant questioning. The requirement for me to apply pressure to get anything done. Ross Ashcroft, headteacher, Cherry Oak primary school, Birmingham One clear example of unconscious bias is the number of times I have turned up to greet a visitor in reception in a suit and tie, and they presume I’m a teaching assistant. Almost every non-white leader of education I know, has had the same experience numerous times. But I don’t know of a single white leaders in education who have ever been mistaken for a teaching assistant; not once. I’ve been accused many times of being too aggressive, when I know that I haven’t been but that it’s an easy racial slur to throw at a person of colour. I’ve even had an executive head say to me, when I didn’t agree with him about something, “This is why your kind don’t make it in leadership roles.” Going for headship interviews as a candidate of colour is a difficult and upsetting experience. I’ve often been told that I didn’t get the job because the governing board said I “wasn’t the best fit” or that “they weren’t sure whether they could work with me” despite me scoring top marks in all the tasks and having no areas identified for improvement in the interviews. I’ve spent pretty much my whole career in pastoral, behavioural and safeguarding. It wasn’t what I necessarily wanted but being nudged or pushed towards these specialisms is a common theme among teachers of colour, especially black men. I can only assume that’s because BAME men are inherently thought of as being intimidating and confrontational. It means we often end up being glorified bouncers rather than teachers. Because we’re given these non-academic specialisms, the knock-on effect is that we can hit a brick wall when applying for headships because most senior leadership roles require specialist experience in curriculum areas. Appearance is also a hard one for teachers of colour. Very early in my career I was asked by my manager if I thought having canerows in my hair was “appropriate or professional”. These were professionally done, in straight lines and not patterned. I asked another member of staff who was also a teacher, with bright pink hair, a nose piercing and several visible tattoos, if management had ever asked her about professionalism. She said that they hadn’t, ever.",News/World news,‘There is absolutely systemic racism’: BAME headteachers share their views ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/there-is-absolutely-systemic-racism-bame-headteachers-share-their-views
1/25/2022,"Cardi B has been awarded $1.25m (£929,000) in damages as well as medical expenses of $250,000 in a libel lawsuit against a celebrity gossip blogger who claimed that the rapper was a prostitute who used cocaine and had contracted sexually transmitted infections. Cardi B, born Belcalis Almánzar, sued the blogger known as Tasha K in 2019 for posting several videos that spread “malicious rumours”.  A federal jury found Tasha K, born Latasha Kebe, liable on two counts of slander, one count of libel and one of invasion of privacy (incidentally the name of Cardi B’s 2018 debut album). Kebe’s YouTube channel, UnWineWithTashaK, has a million subscribers. Lawyers for Cardi B also cited a video in which Kebe claimed that the rapper’s first-born child would have intellectual disabilities. Cardi B testified that the videos made her feel “extremely suicidal” and said “only an evil person could do that”. The rapper’s lawsuit said the videos would damage her reputation and her business prospects and that Kebe was “obsessed with slandering” her and using her name to get views for her content. In response to the verdict, Kebe tweeted: “My Husband, Attorney’s [sic], & I fought really hard. I want to thank them for their long hours and sleepless nights … it’s only up from here.” According to the rapper’s lawsuit, many of Kebe’s videos about Cardi B remain on her YouTube channel despite receiving a cease-and-desist letter in 2018, shortly after she began posting about her. The lawsuit, filed in Kebe’s home state of Georgia, also included a guest on the Tasha K channel, Starmarie Ebony Jones, who claimed to be an old friend of the rapper. She was exempt from this lawsuit after moving to New York, where last year she was also found liable to Cardi B on counts of libel, slander and invasion of privacy. Earlier this month, Cardi B offered to pay the burial costs for the 17 people killed in a fire in a Bronx high-rise building. “I’m extremely proud to be from the Bronx and I have lots of family and friends who live and work there still. So, when I heard about the fire and all of the victims, I knew I needed to do something to help,” she said in a statement. “I cannot begin to imagine the pain and anguish that the families of the victims are experiencing, but I hope that not having to worry about the costs associated with burying their loved ones will help as they move forward and heal. I send my prayers and condolences to everyone affected by this horrific tragedy.”",Arts/Music,Cardi B awarded almost £1m in damages in libel case against gossip blogger,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/25/cardi-b-awarded-1m-in-damages-libel-tasha-k

1/25/2022,"A congressman from New Jersey has disclosed that he is receiving calls from viewers of Tucker Carlson’s primetime Fox News show, expressing distress at the Biden administration’s backing of Ukraine in the tense military stand-off with Russia.  Democratic representative Tom Malinowski said in a tweet his office was fielding calls from Carlson viewers “upset that we’re not siding with Russia in its threats to invade Ukraine”. The callers, he said, “want me to support Russia’s ‘reasonable’ positions”. News of the effect of Carlson’s broadcasts doubting support for Ukraine came as the Pentagon placed 8,500 troops on high alert ready to deploy to Europe, amid fears that a Russian invasion could be imminent. Nato allies have been struggling to project unity in opposition to the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s belligerent amassing of more than 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border. Carlson, the top-rated host on Rupert Murdoch’s rightwing news channel, has been using his nightly bully pulpit to question the merits of Washington’s backing through Nato of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s expansionist threat. On Monday night, his show screened an image of the White House with the words “War Machine” stamped over it. The host accused “neocons” in the Biden administration of “betraying our country’s interests” and said a massive lobbying campaign by Ukrainian politicians and American defense contractors was behind the strategy. Ukraine was “strategically irrelevant” to the US, Carlson said. In his analysis of the crisis Carlson made no mention of Putin or his ambition to push back Nato from eastern and central Europe, nor of Ukraine’s standing as a sovereign nation which achieved independence 30 years ago. Ukraine is a country bigger in land mass than France, with a similar population to Spain, now facing an unprovoked invasion from the neighbouring power. Carlson has used his show to express contentious views on Europe before. For a week in August, he relocated Tucker Carlson Tonight to Budapest from where he broadcast glowing reports on the authoritarian leadership of Viktor Orbán. This week he indicated that he plans to return to Hungary soon for more broadcasts praising the government’s tough stance on immigration. Speaking to the Hill, Malinowski said: “People get their opinions by watching the news, that’s nothing new. What is new is we have at least one talkshow host with a huge captive audience that is not exposed to any counter-programming elsewhere. “I find that very concerning.”",News/World news,"Tucker Carlson viewers calling me to say US should back Russia, Democrat says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/tucker-carlson-russia-ukraine-democrats

1/25/2022,"Crystal Palace and Valencia have approached Manchester United over taking Donny van de Beek on loan. Ralf Rangnick is reluctant to allow the midfielder to join Palace but the club will not give up on their attempts to sign him. Any loan would not include an option to buy because United intend to keep Van de Beek next season, even though he has not started a Premier League game during this campaign and got only four league starts in 2020-21. The Netherlands international wants to play more regularly and would welcome a move until May.  Van de Beek joined United from Ajax for an initial £34.7m in August 2020 but neither Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the manager when he signed, nor Rangnick, who is in interim charge, has entrusted him with regular appearances. The 24-year-old played in all three of Michael Carrick’s games as caretaker manager from late November, albeit as a late substitute in two of them. Valencia are 10th in La Liga having lost two and drawn one of their past three league games, last weekend collapsing dramatically to be beaten 3-2 at Atlético Madrid. Van de Beek’s clubmate Anthony Martial flew to Seville on Tuesday to complete his loan move to Sevilla for the rest of the season.

1/25/2022,"Mohammad Haque, an Android engineer, first discovered computers when his father bought their first one in 1995, in Bangladesh. It was a marvel then and he still laughs when he remembers his mother hearing about ‘computer viruses’ for the first time (the room was apparently thoroughly cleaned two to three times a day). When he finally got to use the computer, Mohammad discovered he had a love for building things and writing commands. It started as a hobby but by the time he got to university he was ready to start a degree in Computer Science. He soon followed that up with a masters at the University of Greenwich. What drew you to software development on Android in the first place?  I had an interest in small computing devices and that led me to do my masters in mobile computing. After I finished my masters in 2006 I started my career as web developer during which time smartphones started making an appearance. I found them incredibly interesting (just like another computer but on a much smaller scale) which also meant you could still write code for it. I leant more towards Android than iOS because it felt like it was a more open and adventurous landscape. So, in 2010 I got my first job as an Android Developer. How did you end up at the Guardian? I’d been working for a magazine publishing company for a few years and, in that time, I developed a great interest in content based apps. I built my own news aggregator app, specifically for a Bangladeshi audience, which is still popular. In doing this I realised that I had something of a passion for news and wanted to carve out a new path for myself. Coincidentally it was about that time that I was in touch with someone from the Guardian through LinkedIn who was hiring Android Software Engineers. I was already quite aware of the Guardian through my English lessons back home in Bangladesh- many of the courses would use news publications like the Guardian as learning materials all the time. I thought it was a very reputable news organisation so I decided to apply. Where can I find open positions? Apply for one of our open positions here. What can I expect from the interview process? We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process. Similar to other organisations, there is a CV screening, phone interview, coding exercise and a face to face interview. Read more about what to expect and apply now here. - What does a typical day look like for you? Well, I became a father three months ago, which is very exciting. Because of that, I decided I needed to spend some more time at home. So now, with the support of my manager, I work compressed hours and get every second Friday off. My working day typically starts at 10am when I check my inbox and complete any urgent tasks. Then I have a morning standup with my team to check in on each other. Usually after that I work on tickets. In my team we follow an agile ‘sprint’ methodology where every two weeks we decide on the goals we need to achieve, work on related tasks and release updates to the app at the end of the sprint. It’s a great way of working because it allows you to make quick changes and deliver a result on a regular basis. We also try to explore different exciting technologies together on a regular basis. Of course I also attend the occasional meeting. One of my favourites is the Product and Engineering ‘All Hands’ which is a fortnightly departmental meeting and an opportunity to share news, celebrate success, learn a little bit more about other parts of the business and – most importantly – meet any new starters. We are also hiring at the moment so I also have quite a few interviews I attend as well. I enjoy being part of the process and getting to meet potential new team members. What do you enjoy the most about working here? My favourite part is feeling like you can affect real change as an individual and that you’re not just another cog in the machine. Our department runs hack days about twice a year and it’s always a great opportunity to be innovative, work on anything that you’re passionate about, and sometimes even see your work go into production. ‘Read it to me’ is one of those examples in the Android Guardian news app where you can choose a list of news articles which the app then will read to you as if it were an audio playlist. That came out of a hack day and it was brilliant to have been a part of that. I’d like to add as well that as an introvert, as well as a practicing Muslim, I can honestly say that the Guardian feels like home. If you’re on the quiet side you are always allowed the space and opportunity to speak. Though I may not speak up often, I do always feel heard. Being a religious man, and knowing how my religion has been often portrayed in the media, I have also never felt discriminated against here. We even have a prayer room in the office which I take full advantage of any time I’m in. There is a great respect and fellowship between colleagues here. You are accepted for who you are and you never feel left out in any way. Development of digital products is central to the Guardian. You could be building the products that showcase our progressive and independent journalism, crafting the tools that journalists use to write their stories, developing the services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe, or safeguarding our financial future.

1/25/2022,"Why is Nish Kumar such a bete noir for angry rightwingers everywhere? Everybody hates him, he cries from the stage tonight, in a show that takes stock of his life as a partisan political comic who has brown skin. Its case study is a 2019 charity gig (think “millionaires in ballrooms”) where Kumar, anti-Brexit gags blazing, had a bread roll thrown at him before being booed off stage. The incident, much embellished in the press, triggered death threats, which in turn prompted a reckoning for Kumar with his brittle mental health. This may sound like a more sobering show than you’d expect from Kumar. But it isn’t. It’s more personal, perhaps – he’s seldom before spoken about his mental fragility, not least because (as he says here) he was totally in denial about it. But the keynote is still uproarious and self-mocking, as the 36-year-old holds himself up for relentless ridicule: as the comic self-sabotaging in front of his “pre-gout” audience; as the messianic ego fantasising his own tragic assassination; and as the shmuck trying to impress people by pretending to have read Tess of the d’Urbervilles.  Save for Kumar’s opening 10 minutes, which leathers the government for its “incompetence, corruption and ideology”, and takes particular aim at the myth of Rishi Sunak’s competence, we’re not in a world of Mash Report-style topical satire. Instead, the show unspools its tale of the gig-gone-wrong and its aftermath by way of “a silly window on to something more serious” – specifically, how non-white people, public figures included, are now being screened for their supposed anti-Britishness. The set has its less effective moments. A routine about the inanity of national anthems is over-illustrated with a surfeit of caterwauling examples. Too many jokes, no matter their subject, reach for knob-gag punchlines. Maybe that stems from an anxiety that his serious concerns might capsize the comedy – which is unwarranted, but understandable. Certainly, Kumar’s chilling argument about our slide towards nativism, and the insights he affords into life on the receiving end of death threats, will linger even after the considerable laughter subsides.  Your Power, Your Control is touring until 17 May.",Arts/Stage,"Nish Kumar: Your Power, Your Control review – this time it’s personal",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/25/nish-kumar-your-power-your-control-review-this-time-its-personal
