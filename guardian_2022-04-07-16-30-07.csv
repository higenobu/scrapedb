4/7/2022,"In 1881, two young British princes serving as midshipmen in the Royal Navy visited Japan, where they had a meeting with the emperor. This encounter wasn’t the most significant between the royal families of Britain and Japan, or the most extravagant – the princes bought a metal teapot and cups as a gift for their father in a nascent tourist market – but it was emblematic of the long and complex interaction between the two countries. While in Japan, the princes, aged just 16 and 17, got tattoos on their arms: a couple of storks for Prince Albert and a dragon and a tiger for the future George V, Prince George. “Tattoos were part of naval culture and were a British aristocratic fashion in the late 19th century,” explains Rachel Peat, the curator of a new exhibition, Japan: Courts and Culture, which opened at the Queen’s Gallery this week. “But in Japan, tattooing had very different connotations. It has been both a revered art form and at various times illegal in Japanese history, so there is a mystique and almost danger to getting one, which might well have been part of the allure for the tourists.” The sense of something distant, desirable and difficult to access has been a key part of the western fascination for Japanese art, culture and objects. It is evidenced in this first exhibition dedicated to works of art from Japan in the royal collection, for which the Queen’s galleries have been specially redesigned. While it is not a comprehensive survey of Japanese art – no calligraphy or kimonos and only one netsuke miniature sculpture – it reveals an engrossing story of diplomacy, taste and power through artistry and craftsmanship. The first royal contact came in 1613, with an exchange of gifts that included a set of samurai armour, shortly before Japan closed itself to western influence for more than 200 years. Not that this put an end to the attraction for all things Japanese. If anything, the closure of Japan made its products all the more fashionable and sought after, and, via Chinese and Dutch merchants, the royal family continued to build its collection of porcelain and lacquer products, whose secrets of manufacture were still unknown in the west. The reopening of Japan in the 19th century prompted a renewal of royal visits and a new appreciation and understanding of Japanese art in the west, and the start of the 20th century saw warm relations between the countries. The rupture of the second world war was healed in the 1950s with a coronation gift from Emperor Hirohito to the new British queen and was widely regarded as an attempt to use art to symbolise a new era of cooperation. “These objects are normally dispersed across 15 different historic and royal residences,” says Peat. “So bringing them together and seeing them as a whole is quite something. Many of the objects are gifts directly commissioned by the imperial family, and in some cases even designed by them. The result is work of the most exquisite quality, but also work that reveals a fascinating history – complete with peaks and troughs – of an ever-changing relationship not only between courts, but between cultures.” Folding screen painting, 1860 This painting depicting Mount Fuji in the spring – one of a pair sent to Queen Victoria in 1860 – was thought to be lost, but was rediscovered during preparations for the exhibition. It is made of silk with hinges of paper and gold leaf, and is extremely fragile. The screens are considered to be paintings not furniture, and would be displayed flat to best show the work of the artists. It was among the first diplomatic gifts to be made after Japan reopened to the world following more than 200 years of isolation. Pair of pastille burners in the form of hares, 1680–1720 (main picture) These decorative porcelain figures represent the year of the rabbit and draw on wider eastern mythology about rabbits or hares being associated with the moon and notions of immortality. They also function as incense burners, with the smoke emerging through holes in the rockwork stumps on which the hares sit. Armour from the Myōchin school, 1537–1850 This samurai armour is constructed from leather, doeskin, horsehair, bear fur, gilt copper, gold filigree and thousands of tiny iron pieces laced together with vibrant blue and red silk to make a flexible covering that is wrapped round the body. It is likely that elements from several suits of armour were used to make this suit, which was presented to Queen Victoria’s son Alfred in 1869. He was the first overseas royal of any nationality to visit modern Japan. Cosmetic box and cover, c.1890–1905 This wooden box decorated with black, gold and silver lacquer was the first diplomatic gift after the second world war, given to the Queen by Hirohito, the Emperor Shōwa, to mark her coronation in 1953. It was made by Shirayama Shōsai who was one of the leading artists during a golden age of lacquer work in the early 20th century. Here he has depicted a heron, whose feathers are picked out in silver lacquer, accented with gold streaks.

4/7/2022,"You don’t need to prove you have been vaccinated to get into the Masters this year, don’t need to show a negative test or wear a face covering. “Feels like a normal Masters again,” said Rory McIlroy. And he’s right, around about here it’s almost like the past two years never happened. Almost. There is one big little difference. They’re all out of Georgia peach ice cream sandwiches at the concession stands. Serious business this. The sandwiches were the outstanding achievement of the last Augusta National chairman, Billy Payne, and all the justification needed to explain his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Payne’s successor, Fred Ridley, was asked about them on Wednesday morning, and replied, with appropriate gravitas: “We have encountered supply chain issues, just like everyone, in everything we’ve done.” Ridley talked through a couple of other changes, trivial things in comparison, such as the major renovations to the course. According to McIlroy, the 11th “is basically a new hole”, and the 15th is different, too. The club have lengthened both. At 11 they have extended the pond, removed one group of the trees and planted another further down the right side of the fairway and at 15 they have reshaped the green. They often tinker with the course, but these changes are a little more drastic than usual, the idea, as always, is to make sure it is still a course that offers the right balance between risk and reward. What the club have not done is the one change everyone was expecting them to make at the 13th. The club’s co-founder Bobby Jones loved that hole, which he said offers players “a tempting and dangerous” decision about whether to bend the tee-shot around the corner so they can reach the green in two. At least, that’s what it’s supposed to do. These days the 13th feels toothless. The players hit it so long off the tee they are left with a short iron into the green. The club brought a patch of land behind the tee-box off the neighbouring Augusta Country Club, which everyone assumed meant they were going to be able to lengthen the hole. They haven’t done it yet. Ridley knows there is a problem. The club have been talking for years about fixing it and he reiterated it on Wednesday. “The 13th hole does not have the same challenges that it had historically.” The reason they are reluctant to do anything about it, he said, is that it’s such a classic hole. “Probably along with 12, and maybe 15, those three holes are where the most history has been made at Augusta National.” It is where Arnold Palmer made an eagle with a second ball after a long dispute with a rules official when he won in 1958; where Curtis Strange blew a two-shot Sunday lead by hitting it into the creek in 1985; and where Jack Nicklaus picked up a crucial birdie in ’86. “I can just remember as a young guy watching the Masters, some of the triumphs and tragedies there,” Ridley said. “So that probably has been a counter to doing anything.” The worry is they will end up like the one of those amateur artists who decides it is a good idea to try to touch up a fading masterpiece. Ridley is clearly daunted by the prospect of tampering with it. And maybe he is right to be. The club have always caught between the old and the new, the desire to do right by the traditions, and to keep improving, too. There are times when they do get it wrong. Ridley’s recent decision to allow the media group Dude Perfect to shoot a YouTube film with Bryson DeChambeau at Amen Corner felt like a misstep. Ridley was asked how he imagined Jones would feel if he came back to see Augusta. “I hope he would be proud,” he said. “I hope that he would feel that we continue to carry the tradition and values we thought were so important in the game.” Just so long as he wasn’t here the day DeChambeau was tossing Frisbees around Amen Corner for the sake of a viral video. But Ridley said, Dude Perfect “has 57 million followers on YouTube and that got my attention”. The clip ended up “the No 1 YouTube video at the time”. That is quite a change for a club who refused to televise the front nine for so many years.",Sport/Sport,Masters normality makes welcome return to a rejigged Augusta | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/07/masters-augusta-national-golf
4/7/2022,"West Ham are “massive” to quote the chant of the moment – and so, surprisingly, was the London Stadium in the memorable Europa League win against Sevilla. Six years after moving from Upton Park, the club’s troubled new ground had changed from corporate dome to a cauldron of noise. Is Stratford finally starting to feel like home for Hammers fans? For all Karren Brady’s promises of a successful migration, it did not start well in 2016, with fans who preferred to stand put next to fans who wanted to sit and fights breaking out in an early game against Watford. The stewarding was poor and in a League Cup tie against Chelsea rival fans used the circular concourse to cause aggravation. It seemed difficult to get a chant going all around the vast stadium. The diehards had many complaints: the distance from the pitch, plastic fans, the long walk from Stratford and the sale of popcorn. It was forgotten that sometimes Upton Park could be quiet, too. The club improved the stewarding and moved fans to more appropriate areas, but many problems remained. The nadir for the London Stadium was the pitch invasion during a 3-0 home defeat to Burnley in March 2018. David Moyes was in his first spell as manager with the club, as ever fighting relegation rather than moving to the promised next level. One middle-aged fan planted a corner flag in the centre circle. With the stewards as proactive as the West Ham defence, Mark Noble found himself acting as a makeshift bouncer, manhandling one miscreant and inspiring the Guardian cartoonist David Squires to draw Noble singing “I’m forever throwing Herberts, stewards vanish in thin air”. Several hundred fans gathered around the directors’ box chanting: “You’ve destroyed our club” at owners David Sullivan and David Gold. There didn’t seem any coming back from that. Another problem was how to cover the athletics track. When Sofiane Feghouli scored against NK Domzale in the first Europa League match there and kissed the massive green carpet around the pitch, it highlighted how the playing area looked like one giant chunk of AstroTurf. The then manager Slaven Bilic complained in 2017 that it made it psychologically difficult for his players to track back: “You look up and it is not easy, because everything is green ahead of you, to appreciate exactly where is the end of the pitch.” For a long period there was a standoff between West Ham and the stadium’s owners, the London Legacy Development Corporation, which would not allow a claret carpet to be installed over the running track area. Eventually, relations improved and the carpet finally arrived in April 2019. It was not, as some feared, a shagpile offcut from Sullivan’s home, but a claret surround with the club’s name emblazoned at the sides. Michail Antonio was so impressed he celebrated a goal against Leicester by lying down and fondly stroking the carpet. Renaming the East Stand the Billy Bonds Stand was another positive move. Bonds came on to the pitch before the game against Newcastle and was moved to tears by the reception he received. But even the Irons’ magic carpet couldn’t prevent the Manuel Pellegrini years turning sour. Moyes returned and West Ham were out of the relegation zone on goal difference when lockdown happened. They played their final games behind closed doors and stayed up. In the Covid season of 2020-21 Moyes started to make dramatic progress. West Ham finished an improbable sixth and the fans had a team they could be proud of, if only on TV. When 10,000 fans were allowed for the final game of the season against Southampton they discovered the stands at either end had been squared off, making it much more like a football ground. When this season began with a 4-1 home demolition of Leicester the fans realised they were grateful to be back watching West Ham, whatever stadium they were in. It felt like a homecoming. Fans were more used to their pubs and matchday routes. The incremental improvements had worked: the carpet, the squared ends, playing music outside the stadium, the razzle-dazzle before matches of flame throwers, DJs, bubble machines and light shows. The ground was slowly developing an identity. Home wins against Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea created the best atmosphere since the last season at the Boleyn. And selling popcorn really didn’t matter much. Memories are being made, such as a tearful Andriy Yarmolenko scoring against Villa and raising his hands to the sky. The Sevilla match put it up a notch again. When the two goals went in under the lights the whole place was bouncing. The London Stadium will never be as intimate as Upton Park and the stands at the sides really could do with being closer to the pitch. But opposition teams do not fancy playing there now and 60,000 fans turn up every game. A new generation don’t even remember the Boleyn. It has been a long journey, but it does feel like the Hammers finally have a ground that is not only literally massive, but also has the power to intimidate once more.

4/7/2022,"A Melbourne mother who was suffering severe postpartum depression when she killed her three-month-old daughter by placing her in front of a train has been spared jail. Melissa Arbuckle, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of infanticide over her daughter Lily’s death at a train station in Upwey, in Melbourne’s east, on 11 July last year. Arbuckle had laid beside her daughter on the tracks but survived the accident with fractures and internal bleeding. She was later diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis, including auditory hallucinations. Lily’s father, who has requested not to be named, told the court he loved his daughter more than life itself and had struggled to find light in his life since the incident. Justice Jane Dixon told the Victorian supreme court she believed it was “extremely unlikely” Arbuckle would re-offend and released her on an adjourned undertaking for three years. This allows her to live unsupervised in the community, but will require future appearances before court to ensure she is compliant. “The facts of this case plainly reveal extenuating circumstances, and your character and sensible cooperation with treatment and supervision are already in evidence,” Dixon said. “The fact that the severity of your postpartum depression was overlooked is an unfortunate feature that this case has in common with certain other cases of infanticide.” Dixon noted Arbuckle’s “bright prospects” for rehabilitation were not challenged by the prosecution. The court heard Arbuckle’s’s postpartum depression, suicidal ideations and psychosis had subsided after medication and psychiatric community-based treatment. Dixon told the court Arbuckle’s psychologist believed imprisonment would have a “significant and detrimental” impact on her mental health. Dixon said that when considering an appropriate sentence, she had taken into account the victim impact statements of Lily’s father, her great-aunt and the train driver who activated the emergency brakes and shut his eyes before impact. The driver said the incident had changed his life, with police sirens and baby noises now triggering severe distress. The court heard this week that Arbuckle, who was on bail awaiting sentencing, had a “significantly disturbed mind” at the time of the incident. Her defence barrister, Megan Tittensor SC, said the new mother – who had a perfectionist personality – mistakenly believed Lily was suffering from shaken baby syndrome and that it was inevitable she would die. The court heard she had a “fixated delusional belief” she had harmed her child and they were both broken. Arbuckle, a well respected vet, took her daughter for a walk in a pram before she began searching for train speeds and timetables on her mobile. Just after 5pm she was seen holding her daughter and using her arm to wave at the passing train. Minutes later, she placed Lily on the train tracks on the Belgrave line and laid down beside her. Lily died after being airlifted to hospital. Tittensor said Arbuckle did not plan on having another child and suffers immense remorse for the loss of her daughter. Clinical psychologist and the chief executive of Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia (PANDA), Julie Borninkhof, said there was no “simplified link” between depression and postnatal psychosis. “It’s a trajectory that is a very unique one and impacted by many things,” Borninkhof said. She said people’s experiences of postnatal psychosis can be impacted by a specific trigger. “Often a worrying thought or experience or exposure to something leads to a hyper-vigilance which is where the individual’s fixation or deluded thoughts or behaviour stems from.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to PANDA, 15% to 22% of mothers experience some form of anxiety or depression during the perinatal period – during pregnancy and up to one year into their child’s life. About 10% of fathers experience the same conditions. Between 0.1% and 0.2% of mothers experience postnatal psychosis, according to a 2017 study in BMC Psychiatry. Symptoms include sudden and dramatic changes in a person’s thinking, behaviour, mood and sleep patterns, and normally emerge in the first four weeks after birth. In Victoria, infanticide carries a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and serves as an alternative to murder. At the time of the conduct, the accused’s balance of mind must be deemed disturbed by the effect of giving birth or a disorder consequent of her giving birth to the child. Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales are the only jurisdictions in Australia that recognise it is a separate offence. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

4/7/2022,"Australia’s ambassador to Myanmar met alleged war criminal and coup leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Wednesday, in a meeting the junta claims discussed “enhancement of cooperation” between the two countries. Pictures published by the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper show Australia’s ambassador, Andrea Faulkner, and military attache, meeting with the coup leader in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing led the Myanmar military’s pogrom against the ethnic minority Rohingya in 2017, which killed more than 25,000 people and forced more than 700,000 to flee the country, and he engineered a military coup in February 2021, later declaring himself prime minister. Min Aung Hlaing has been recommended by the UN for investigation and prosecution for war crimes and genocide, and personally sanctioned by the US, EU, UK and Canada, but not by Australia. Advocates for Myanmar’s elected government argued the meeting between the coup leader and the representative of a western democracy, would be used as a propaganda tool by the junta to legitimise its unlawful control of Myanmar. Justice for Myanmar’s Yadanar Maung described Australia’s decision to take the meeting as “an act of betrayal” of the Myanmar people. The meeting has been prominently reported by Myanmar’s state-controlled media, in Burmese, and in English for international audiences. Several pictures of the meeting have been published, including one of the Senior General presenting the ambassador with a painting as a gift. The regime reported that Wednesday’s meeting, in the parlour of Min Aung Hlaing’s office, discussed “the further maintenance of good relations between two countries, enhancement of cooperation in various sectors between governments and peoples of both countries”. It described the CRPH, the elected exiled Myanmar parliament, and the NUG, the exiled National Unity Government , as “terrorists”. Before Senate estimates on Thursday, Katrina Cooper, the deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was questioned by Greens senator Janet Rice over the junta’s reports that the meeting discussed “cooperation in various sectors” and “maintenance of good relations”. Cooper would not comment on the junta’s characterisation of the meeting, but said there were no areas of cooperation with the junta and that the ambassador “asked for a number of things”. “She reiterated Australia’s concern about the situation in Myanmar, she urged the Myanmar military to cease violence, release arbitrary detainees, engage in dialogue and ensure unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The meeting between Australia’s ambassador, who is finishing her posting, and Min Aung Hlaing on Wednesday was one of at least eight meetings or phone calls Australian diplomats and defence officials have had with junta representatives since the coup last February, estimates heard. Rice asked if engaging with the junta risked legitimising its control of the country. Cooper defended Australia’s position, arguing its “limited” engagement with the regime “give us an opportunity to speak directly to the regime”, including to call for an end to violence and grant humanitarian access. “We don’t consider that the engagement we’ve had to date legitimises the current regime.” But Yadanar Maung said the military junta was a terrorist organisation and ‘Australia’s continued engagement with it was “an act of betrayal to its own democracy”. She said the meeting would be used to legitimise the military’s forcible seizure of control of the country. “The latest meeting has given fodder for the junta’s domestic propaganda and is part of a pattern of complicity that stands out from Australia’s democratic allies. Australia has still failed to impose any targeted sanctions on the Myanmar junta and military businesses in response to the coup attempt and the military’s ongoing atrocities, and Australia’s Future Fund continues to invest in companies doing business with the military, including an arms supplier.” Analysis prepared by the Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) shows the US, the UK, Canada and the EU have imposed sanctions against a total of 196 individuals and 172 entities, including subsidiaries, as of February. The chief executive of Acfid, Marc Purcell, said Australia’s failure to impose any additional sanctions against the generals since the coup 14 months ago was “increasingly glaring” compared with actions taken by other like-minded countries. Cooper said the government weighed up “a number of important considerations” when deciding on possible sanctions, including consular matters such as the ongoing “arbitrary detention” of the Australian academic, Prof Sean Turnell. Turnell was an economic adviser to the democratically elected Myanmar government.",News/Australia news,Australia stays silent on outcome of meeting with Myanmar coup leader,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/australia-stays-silent-on-outcome-of-meeting-with-myanmar-coup-leader
4/7/2022,"More than 100 journalists, politicians and campaigners have signed an open letter warning that the UK’s freedom of information (FoI) laws are being undermined by a lack of resources and government departments obstructing lawful requests. The signatories include the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, Katharine Viner, the editor of the Observer, Paul Webster, as well as the shadow solicitor general, Andy Slaughter, the former Brexit secretary David Davis, and the former Green party leader Caroline Lucas. The letter, which was coordinated by the online news organisation openDemocracy, is addressed to the new information commissioner, John Edwards, who is responsible for enforcing FoI law, which grants members of the public the legal right to request official information from public bodies. Edwards’ organisation, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), reviews complaints against public bodies that have refused FoI requests and can order them to release material if they have failed to comply with the law. However, there is growing concern among journalists and researchers that the UK’s FoI system is increasingly being frustrated by under-resourcing and deliberate non-compliance by government departments. The Campaign for Freedom of Information recently reported that backlogs at the ICO had become so extensive that it was taking an entire year for case officers to be assigned to review complaints. Last year a judge accused the Cabinet Office of having “misled” a tribunal about the operation of an alleged blacklisting system for FoI requests from journalists, called Clearing House, and described a “profound lack of transparency” surrounding the unit. The open letter calls for the ICO to assign more resources to FoI casework, monitoring of public bodies that fail to comply with the law, and stronger enforcement protocols for government bodies that repeatedly flout the law. It also recommends the extension of FoI to cover private companies that provide public services. “As the British public is still being kept in the dark over Partygate, the importance of transparency has rarely been more obvious,” said Peter Geoghegan, the editor-in-chief of openDemocracy. “FoI is a key tool for holding public bodies to account, but currently the Information Commissioner’s Office is not ensuring that the Freedom of Information Act delivers. We welcome the new information commissioner’s listening exercise and are keen to share our views on how FoI can be better policed.” Viner said: “Journalism in the public interest often depends on freedom of information laws, which help the public understand the decisions made by the authorities. Such laws are essential to a well-functioning democracy. “When the government fails to meet its transparency commitments, it is essential that the ICO is able to step in to make sure ministers and public bodies comply with the law.”",News/Politics,"UK’s transparency laws are being undermined, warn journalists ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/uk-foi-transparency-laws-are-being-undermined-warn-journalists
