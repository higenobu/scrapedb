4/19/2022,"For as long as I can remember, Will Smith has been the “nice guy”. The 53-year-old actor has spent the last three decades crafting himself into the perfect image of the ever-pleasant, non-threatening Black man. From curse-free rap lyrics to his tender, nuanced portrayals of complicated characters, Smith has been a darling of mainstream Hollywood for a very long time. And prior to the last few years, he was one of a few celebrities who had made it to the peak of their careers virtually scandal-free. In him, white Hollywood found a Black man who was equal parts insanely talented and widely marketable, according to their standards of propriety and respectability. Sadly, that respectability factor isn’t just desirable, it has long been crucial to the success of many Black actors over the years. So when British-American actor of Nigerian descent David Oyelowo wrote a guest column in the Hollywood Reporter last week suggesting that Smith’s actions – he slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars after Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia – could “have a negative effect on the ongoing push for inclusion” in Hollywood, I wasn’t surprised that he was willing to throw his colleague under the bus like that. “The moment I slowly realized the nature of what had just occurred on the stage at the Dolby Theater,” he wrote, “I was confronted by the same rising anxiety all Black people feel when the face that flashes up on the news after a crime is reported, is a Black one. You find yourself thinking, ‘What does this mean for us?’ ‘What does that mean for me?’” As a Black person, I can confirm that when I see a Black face on my TV screen in relation to a crime, my first thought is not what it means for me or how it makes me look. And in expressing his anxieties over what this would mean for our collective image as Black people, the Selma star placed years of white supremacist stereotyping squarely on Smith’s back. It’s a trap that many highly visible Black men have fallen into; being blamed for actions have historically been over-scrutinized, demonized and criminalized by whiteness, depriving us of the fullness of our humanity. Oyelowo’s piece also describes an incident after the Oscars in which he was confronted by an older white man who had “relish in his demeanor” as he stated that Smith “should have been dragged right out of there”. So if I’ve got this straight, that person’s blatant prejudice is somehow Smith’s fault? Give me a break. Oyelowo’s reflection conveniently ignores the centuries of racism that have engendered an interaction like this, and instead focuses on the conduct of the Black people who are being subjected to this racial bias. But make no mistake, the actor’s desire for Smith to perform gentility for whiteness is something that many Black men like him have intentionally relied on for years in order to enter into, and remain a part of predominantly white spaces. Statements like his reek of a desperation to protect that fragile dynamic, rather than confront the systems that make pandering to whiteness necessary in the first place. Sadly, as we saw in the aftermath of the Oscar’s, being an “exception” to the Black stereotype certainly doesn’t shield you from racism and abuse when you are seen to step out of line. Where is the grace for Will Smith? Where is the forgiveness? Where was the nuanced consideration for the fact that his wife was just humiliated in front of the world over an illness that she has no control over. One of the backlash against Smith took into account his history in the industry, and all the goodwill he’d built up over the years. All it took was one small mistake – one I might add, he has apologised and been thoroughly punished for – for him to be labelled violent, and become a pariah among the very people who claimed to love him all these years. If this doesn’t signal to Black celebrities that chasing white approval is a wholly empty, draining and fruitless endeavor, then I simply don’t know what will.

4/19/2022,"Hundreds of Ukrainians are believed to be living and working informally in Britain after escaping from farms they were working at, with many claiming to have been subjected to conditions of modern slavery. Ukrainians made up by far the largest proportion of workers in the UK on seasonal worker visas in 2021. Of the 29,631 visas issued under the T5 seasonal work scheme, two-thirds (19,920) were given to Ukrainians. The Scottish Refugee Council estimates there are up to 6,000 currently in the UK. The farm workersare not eligible for the two main government schemes that support Ukrainian refugees – the family scheme and the community sponsorship scheme. From 3 May, the Ukraine extension scheme will be open for applications. This will allow people to stay for three years and switch to a different visa route, allowing them to seek alternative employment. However, it does not apply to those not working on farms at the time applications are made. The Guardian has spoken to one Ukrainian worker who is in a state of acute distress about her situation after fleeing conditions on farms that she said were “akin to modern-day slavery”. She is an IT expert with two university degrees and came to the UK with her partner, who has almost finished his training to become a doctor, in the hope of earning money. She has provided an account almost 3,000 words long to the Work Rights Centre, a charity that helps migrants to access employment justice. It details appalling working conditions on the farms she and her partner worked on from August 2021 until they escaped in January. She and her partner are now doing cleaning and construction work jobs respectively in the underground economy. “We have come across many, many other Ukrainians who, like us, have run away from farms, cannot return to Ukraine and so have been forced to work here illegally,” she said. “I feel like I am a hostage in the UK. My parents have told me I must not go back to Ukraine under any circumstances because our city is being shelled. I feel trapped.” She added: “Nobody cares what happens to seasonal workers. I thought our rights would be well protected in the UK but this has not happened. Working on the farm is probably one of the worst experiences and worst treatment of my life.” She and her boyfriend worked on a cherry farm where they were not allowed to wear gloves, leading to their hands bleeding and skin beginning to peel off. She said workers on one farm staged a protest over the poor conditions and were punished by being suspended for a week. “They set unachievable targets,” she said. “Through threats and humiliation, people were forced to work tirelessly wearing off the skin on their hands and feet until it bleeds. If a person fell off a stepladder they were sent to the campsite to recover on their own or flew home.” On the huge farm workers’ campsite she and her partner were living on, all but 38 workers fled. She said: “People left to work illegally in the cities in order to solve their financial problems and protect their wellbeing. I will never go to work on any of the farms again – there are no happy stories. Everyone runs away.” A review by the Home Office and the Department for Food, the Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) published at the end of last year found that seasonal workers on a post-Brexit pilot scheme launched in 2019 to harvest fruit and vegetables were subjected to “unacceptable” welfare conditions. Issues cited by some workers included a lack of health and safety equipment, racism, and accommodation without bathrooms, running water or kitchens. Graham O’Neill, the policy manager at the Scottish Refugee Council, said: “It is dreadful that hundreds of Ukrainians here, worried sick about family, friends and war crimes at home, now find themselves destitute, their seasonal visas expired due to having to flee conditions on farms.” He called on the home secretary to give seasonal workers the right to remain in the UK and bring family members to safety here. Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, the director of the Work Rights Centre, said: “I’m extremely concerned for the safety of Ukrainians who had to flee exploitative work conditions on British farms and have since become undocumented.” She said many had resorted to working precariously in the underground economy. “The Home Office should acknowledge that the war in Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis, and offer protection to all Ukrainians in the UK, documented or otherwise,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “Ukrainians on seasonal worker visas can apply for three years’ leave under the Ukraine extension scheme. Under no circumstances should any seasonal workers in the agricultural sector be forced to work in exploitative conditions. We strongly advise any people in these circumstances to report issues to the police so steps can be taken for their safeguarding and wellbeing.”",News/UK news,Ukrainian workers flee ‘modern slavery’ conditions on UK farms,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/19/ukrainian-workers-flee-modern-slavery-conditions-on-uk-farms
4/19/2022,"Rolls-Royce is to start building parts for its small modular nuclear reactors in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval from the British government by 2024, one of its directors has said. Paul Stein, the chairman of Rolls-Royce SMR, a subsidiary of the FTSE 100 engineering company, said he hoped to be providing power to the UK’s national grid by 2029. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are seen by their proponents as a way to build nuclear power plants in factories, a method that could be cheaper and quicker than traditional designs. The technology, based on the reactors used in nuclear submarines, is seen by Rolls-Royce as a potential earner far beyond any previous business such as jet engines or diesel motors. The government under Boris Johnson put nuclear power at the centre of its energy strategy announced earlier this month, in response to climate concerns and a desire to ditch Russian gas. SMRs are expected to play an inportant role in an expansion of nuclear to supply a quarter of the UK’s energy needs. Lower costs would be crucial in justifying the nuclear push, given that onshore wind is seen as much cheaper and quicker to install. Speaking to Reuters in an interview conducted virtually, Stein said the regulatory “process has been kicked off, and will likely be complete in the middle of 2024. We are trying to work with the UK government, and others to get going now placing orders, so we can get power on grid by 2029.” Other companies are also planning to build SMRs, including the US’s Westinghouse.",News/Business,Rolls-Royce expects UK approval for small nuclear reactors by mid-2024,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024
4/19/2022,"Bonuses should be banned for water company bosses until sewage spills into rivers stop, the Liberal Democrats are to demand. Executives were awarded £27m in bonuses over the past two years despite pumping out raw sewage into waterways 1,000 times a day, analysis by the party has found. The former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron is tabling a 10-minute rule bill that will also ask for mandatory targets and timescales for the end of sewage discharges into waterways and coastal areas. It would require quarterly reports on the impact of sewage discharges on the environment, and place a representative of environmental groups on water company boards. Companies House records show that executives at England’s water and sewage companies were paid £48m in 2020 and 2021, including £27.6m in bonuses, benefits and incentives. This is despite recent reports from the Environment Agency showing 772,000 sewage dumping events took place in 2020 and 2021 – more than 1,000 a day. Campaigners have suggested that the money spent on bonuses would be better spent on infrastructure to prevent sewage spills, which can harm wildlife as well as human health. The party has called for the executives to hand back last year’s bonuses and for funds to be used to clean up sewage spills. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said: “The Conservatives are allowing water companies to pump raw sewage into our precious rivers and lakes while awarding themselves obscene bonuses. Just like the millions paid out to bankers during the financial crisis, the public will find this hard to stomach. “Liberal Democrat plans for a sewage bonus ban would stop water company execs being paid a penny in bonuses more until our waterways are protected from sewage dumps. These bosses should be made to hand back the millions of pounds already received in bonuses to help clean up their mess. “It’s time to send a message to the Conservatives that they cannot let water company bosses get away with pumping raw sewage into our rivers and beaches any longer.” The companies with the biggest executive payouts include United Utilities, which was responsible for the most spills over 2020 and 2021, which paid bonuses of nearly £6m. Severn Trent awarded executives £5.5m in bonuses while dumping sewage 120,000 times. Meanwhile, Yorkshire Water, which dumped sewage 135,000 times, handed out bonuses of £3.3m. This bill is likely to stir up tension among Conservatives. The government was last year forced into a U-turn after Tory MPs voted not to ban sewage spills into rivers. The government later wrote its own legislation putting a legal duty on water companies to prevent sewage spills. The environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “A holistic approach to cleaning up our rivers is a top priority for Conservatives and we have introduced the strongest measures ever to tackle this and sewage discharges through the Environment Act and the government direction to Ofwat.”",News/Environment,"Ban bonuses for water firm bosses until sewage spills stopped, urge Lib Dems",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/ban-bonuses-for-water-firm-bosses-until-sewage-spills-stopped-urge-lib-dems
4/19/2022,"Good morning. Russia has begun its long-expected large-scale military action to seize the east of Ukraine, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. “Now we can already state that the Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,” he said in a video address late on Monday night. Zelenskiy said a “significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive”. He added: “No matter how many soldiers are driven there, we will defend ourselves. We will fight. We will not give up anything Ukrainian.” Echoing his comments, Kyiv’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said: “The second phase of the war has started.” Why is Donbas so important to Vladimir Putin? The Russian president has declared his intention to seize Donbas, which is already partly controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Control of Donbas would allow Moscow to create a southern corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula. What is Biden doing? The US president will hold a call today with allies to discuss the Ukraine crisis, including on how to coordinate on holding Russia accountable, the White House said. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 55 of the invasion. A federal judge in Florida has struck down Joe Biden’s national mask mandate covering airplanes, airports and other public transportation, prompting the White House to announce the rule would not be enforced while federal agencies decide how to respond to the judge’s order. The ruling appeared to free operators to make their own decisions about mask requirements, with several airlines announcing they would drop mandates, but other transport networks including the New York City subway planning to keep them in place. The mandate was overturned on Monday by the US district judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa, who judged the rule as exceeding the authority of US health officials in the coronavirus pandemic. She added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had failed to justify its decision and did not follow proper rule-making procedures. What did the judge say? In her 59-page ruling, Mizelle said the only remedy was to vacate the rule entirely because it would be impossible to end it for the limited group who objected to it in the lawsuit. An influential conservative group that includes two Trump allies who helped push lies about voter fraud in 2020 is spearheading “election integrity” summits in battleground states, advocating for expanded poll-watching, “clean” voter rolls and other measures watchdogs say could curb voting rights to help Republican candidates. The Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI) “election integrity network” is run by the veteran GOP lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who helped to spread misinformation about supposed election fraud in 2020. Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s last White House chief of staff, is a senior partner of the CPI and reportedly had a lead role in at least one of its summits. Mitchell, CPI’s senior legal fellow, has hosted multi-day summits, seeking to mobilize hundreds of conservative activists for elections this year in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania, all states that Trump lost to Joe Biden, and Florida, which he won. What have voting rights watchdogs said about the summits? “Ongoing efforts to promote false claims of widespread voter fraud are dangerous and damaging to our democracy,” Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice, said. “There is a multi-pronged attack on the core principles of our democracy in the name of election integrity. Federal authorities said they would not criminally charge Jason Van Dyke, the former Chicago police officer convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting death of Laquan McDonald. The US attorney’s office in Chicago said the decision had been made after consulting with the McDonald family. Shanghai is preparing to ease its lockdown over the city’s 24 million people with authorities hoping Covid transmissions will mostly be limited to quarantine facilities, as factories return to production in closed-loop systems, with Tesla staff reportedly told to sleep on site. Emmanuel Macron has consolidated his lead over Marine Le Pen as France’s presidential race enters its final week, according to polls, suggesting harsher scrutiny of the far-right challenger’s plans may be shifting the race’s dynamic. Both candidates have opted for light agendas before a TV debate tomorrow. The bald eagle, America’s national bird, is the latest to fall prey to the highly contagious bird flu that has been sweeping across the US, affecting birds in a majority of states. The US is enduring the worst bird flu outbreak since 2015 in terms of domestic poultry deaths, according to government data. A Kentucky man was awarded $450,000 in a lawsuit against his former employer, after the company disregarded his wish not to be given a birthday party due to his anxiety disorder. In August 2019, Gravity Diagnostics, a medical laboratory, ignored Kevin Berling’s request and as a result, he suffered a panic attack. The next day, according to Berling’s lawsuit, Berling was “confronted and criticized” for “stealing other co-workers’ joy”. He was terminated from his job the following week. The US has the highest maternal mortality rate among industrialized countries. Since 2000, the maternal mortality rate has risen nearly 60%, making it worse now than it was decades earlier. More than half of these deaths are preventable. For Black women in Congress, maternal mortality hits close to home. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Black women die at three times the rate of white women. The Black Maternal Health Caucus seeks change. The first weekend of the returning California mega-festival brought with it a host of big names and a crowd of fans eager for fun. From the top down, though, it’s been a peculiar year for the lack of heritage acts, writes Kate Hutchinson. Or even ones who have put out more than two albums. Both Harry Styles on Friday and Billie Eilish on Saturday turf out bombastic shows but neither have the discography that is the stuff of true festival legend (though they do both bring out more seasoned guests: Shania Twain and Damon Albarn, respectively). The billowing black smoke that has cloaked the US Pacific north-west during wildfire disasters in past years has caused atmospheric carbon monoxide levels to spike, with the contaminants offsetting recent reductions in emissions, scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research have found. As the American west faces increasing threats from big blazes that are fueled by a climate that’s growing warmer and drier, researchers have documented the impact of smoke on public health. A merino sheep named Shrekapo who grew an enormous fleece while evading capture in New Zealand is 18.6kg lighter after its first shave. Shrekapo, who had spent the last three years on the run, was spotted hiding in the rocks last week, carrying nearly half its bodyweight in wool. The four-year-old is the latest in a series of elusive sheep to have developed overgrown fleeces, entering an unofficial leaderboard of shaggy heavyweight champions across New Zealand and Australia including: Chris, Shrek, Ewenice, Baarack and Shaun the Sheep.

4/19/2022,"Last week, as I sat at a desk in a hotel room in lower Manhattan where I was traveling for work, my phone buzzed. A friend who knew I was in New York had texted to ask if I was all right. Bewildered, I sent a question mark back in response, and turned to Twitter for real-time answers as to what was going on. And there was the news: a man had opened fire inside a subway car as it pulled into a station in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood, shooting what we’d eventually learn to be 10 people, and injuring more than a dozen others either with bullet grazes or smoke inhalation from smoke grenades he’d thrown. (Mercifully, no one was killed, and reports are that no one still hospitalized has life-threatening injuries.) In the aftermath, the shooter vanished as if a ghost. The New York police department (NYPD) – the largest police department in the US and one of the biggest in the world – commenced a manhunt for the shooter. Later in the day, they identified first as a “person of interest” and then as their suspect 62-year-old Frank R James, who had allegedly driven from Milwaukee to Philadelphia in recent months, and then from Philadelphia to New York, where he carried out the shooting. Twenty-nine hours after the morning rush hour attack, police arrested James in Manhattan’s East Village after people in the area (perhaps as well, apparently, as James himself) called in tips to say that he’d been spotted at a local McDonald’s. “We got him,” New York mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD officer, said after the arrest. “We got him.” Adams’ grim victory lap on Wednesday after James’s arrest was not his first statement about the subway shooting. On Tuesday afternoon – as a municipal police department with 36,000 officers and a $10.4bn budget struggled to locate a sexagenarian with a bad back (according to James’s sister) after he had shot up a train car at a subway station that maintains a constant police presence in order to surveil and punish people for trying to evade the $2.75 fare – Adams furiously pledged to double the number of police officers employed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The MTA governs New York’s public transit system, and employs about 3,500 police officers. In 2019, using numbers that are now a few years old and thus almost assuredly low, the Citizens Budget Committee calculated that the cost of each newly hired MTA police officer would be about $93,000 in their first year (salary plus benefits), and more than $200,000 by their 10th year of employment. In one fell swoop, in other words, Adams promised to increase annual spending on policing New York’s subways by about $300m a year – a figure that will eventually grow to more than $700m annually. This is to say nothing about the many hundreds of millions New York already annually spends on MTA police or the $10.4bn it dedicates to its municipal police. The cognitive dissonance is deafening. The entire, terrifying episode that unfolded across 29 hours in New York was a testament to the futility of spending more money on police, and to the lie that police “keep us safe”. The NYPD is the most heavily resourced police department in this country. And yet, as a demonstration of its priorities, many of its officers, upon demand of the mayor, spent countless hours last week engaged in high-profile sweeps arresting shelterless people, destroying their property, and in turn arresting those who showed up to protest their targeting of some of our society’s most vulnerable people. Less than a week later, when given an opening to demonstrate their actual ability to keep New Yorkers safe from the threat of what officials for hours on end deemed an “active shooter” situation, the department failed, completely and utterly. “We”, by which Eric Adams meant his administration and the police department it directs, did not “get him”, by which Adams meant James. In the end, it was citizen tips, not helicopter scans or massive station sweeps or the fact that – at least to my eyes, walking around Manhattan on that terrible, bright and beautiful spring day – the city was spending even more on overtime for more police to position themselves in more places than it typically does on a typical day. The police finally just blew up New Yorkers’ cellphones with screeching alerts Wednesday morning, with Frank James’s photo and information. This hardly seems like an instrument of “public safety” worth $10, let alone $10m. And I shudder to think of what the NYPD deputizing all people in New York to be on the lookout for a 60-something Black man meant for the privacies and bodily integrities of the many thousands of men who live in the city and fit that description. Meanwhile, we are left to marvel at the fact that the MTA assigns police officers to Brooklyn stations like Sunset Park relentlessly, and yet they, too, could do nothing to prevent Tuesday’s attack from happening. When we are told that police organizations like the MTA’s force exist to “keep us safe”, what are we to make of the fact that they quite clearly cannot or do not in moments of legitimate crisis, but that, as evidence suggests, they primarily engage in punishing low-income people of color for fare evasion? American cities are in an arms race against themselves when it comes to their police departments. With reports of rising crime in a range of cities over the last two years, politicians in most corners of the political spectrum have argued, as Joe Biden has, that we must “refund the police”, not defund them as community organizers have been demanding. The premise stands against the evidence, against history. There is precisely no causal relationship between spending money on police and “public safety”. For generations, when “crime” has gone up, spending on police has gone up. When “crime” has gone down, spending on police has gone up. When “crime” has stagnated, spending on police has gone up. This is an endless cycle of spending – costly not just in dollars but in lives lost to police violence, arrest, and incarceration – that stretches back longer than I’ve been alive, longer than most people reading this have been alive. For generations, New York and other cities have continued to throw money hand over fist, good over bad, to their police departments, in moments of crisis, as well as in moments of comparative calm. All this spending – which robs citizens of important social services, since police spending comes at the cost of public goods – is functionally unjustifiable. The amount of money we spend on police has no demonstrably measurable positive impact on “public safety”. Exactly none. And yet we are expected to believe that propositions like that of Eric Adams – to double the number of transit police in New York City in the face of Tuesday’s incident – will magically change that pattern. When the city that spends more on its police than any other in this country not only cannot keep a person from shooting up a train station, but also cannot find him for more than a day and cannot do so without asking every living, breathing person with a cell phone to help them do so, we are asked to believe that the solution is to simply give more money over to the police. I can think of few contexts in which Americans’ perceptions of something and the reality of that thing are more devastatingly, more expensively disjointed.

4/19/2022,"Bangkok’s famous Mae Varee mango sticky rice shop has barely kept up with demand over recent days. At one point, so many delivery drivers had lined up outside to collect orders that the police arrived, concerned that their bikes were blocking the traffic. “Yesterday we needed to close the delivery orders from time to time because we couldn’t prepare [the rice] in time,” said Naparom Suntiparadorn, whose family own the shop. On Sunday, delivery orders were six or seven times higher than usual. The frenzy came after the 19-year-old rapper Milli became the first Thai to perform solo at Coachella festival in California, and marked the occasion by eating the sweet treat on stage. Her performance, including the way she mocked cliched stereotypes of Thailand (“I don’t ride an elephant”) and the Thai government, was applauded by many young Thais. “The country is good, people are good, our food is good but the government is bood [rotten],” she said. Across Thailand, demand for mango sticky rice, one of the country’s best known desserts, has since rocketed. One popular food delivery app told Thai media that orders more than tripled in the 24 hours after Milli’s performance. Social media have been filled with images of the dessert: one meme replaced Bangkok’s Democracy Monument with an enormous mound of sticky rice, shielded by four slices of mango. The government has sought to capitalise on the trend, despite Milli’s strong criticism of its leadership. The prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the culture ministry may propose recognition of mango sticky rice – khao nieo mamuang, in Thai – as an item of Thai cultural heritage through Unesco. “It’s important for Thailand to use its soft power abroad. We have plenty of resources that can be promoted on the international stage,” Prayuth said, according to the Bangkok Post. Awkwardly for Prayuth, last year Milli – whose real name is Danupha Khanatheerakul – was fined 2,000 baht (about £45) for a “public insult” after she criticised the government’s Covid response. For shops that sell the dessert, however, the buzz is a welcome relief. Before the pandemic, most of Mae Varee’s customers were tourists, Naparom said, but it has been relying on local customers as the travel sector is yet to recover. She said the shop used the best ingredients from all over the country. “The rice needs to be in perfect shape, with no cracking. We clean it well and steam it. The coconut is from Surat Thani province. We simmer it. It tastes sweet, but not too sweet, and aromatic. Our mango is also aromatic. It has a natural sweetness. Our signature is we sprinkle crispy mung beans on top.” Naparom would welcome Unesco recognition. “I guess it’s like a Thai massage in that you need to come here to Thailand to experience it,” she said. “It won’t taste the same if you eat it anywhere else.”",News/World news,Thai mango sticky rice sales surge after sweet treat’s Coachella cameo,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/thailand-mango-sticky-rice-coachella-cameo-milli
4/19/2022,"Taking self-love to new heights, Canadian provocateur Bruce LaBruce’s zany 70s-set family affair drips with blasphemous, outrageous delights. The tongue-in-cheek opening leaps straight out of a retro softcore magazine: clad in tight jeans and biker jacket, hunky Dominic (Félix-Antoine Duval) discreetly eyes a mischievous young lady at the laundromat before the pair disrobe and writhe around on a table like rabbits in heat. As strangers gather to stare at the salacious hanky-panky, Dominic is suddenly snapped out of his daydream. The scene might simply be a sticky reverie, but it also establishes how Saint-Narcisse portrays sex as a spectacle, a sensual yet comical tableau served to titillate and amuse all at once. With the swagger of Marlon Brando in The Wild One, Dominic hops on his bike and embarks on a road trip strung with high and low cultural references, as he searches for his long lost twin. Not only does Dominic reunite with his lesbian witch mother – you read that right – but he also locates his brother Daniel in a monastery, where he suffers daily molestations from a depraved priest. Playing the dual roles of Dominic and Daniel, Duval is especially adept at navigating the film’s complex web of campness and sincerity; when the twins finally meet face to face, their encounter brims with both winking lust and genuine pathos. While the frenetic layering of the parodic, the pornographic, and the sublime might leave viewers gasping for air, Saint-Narcisse is a welcome blast of subversive naughtiness, proving that a film can tackle social taboos while refusing to brand itself with facile markers of respectability.

4/19/2022,"In the first year of the pandemic, homicides throughout the US increased by 30%, the most dramatic one-year rise since the FBI began keeping crime data. The increase was driven by a significant rise in gun violence, with shootings ticking up in cities big and small, in states led by Republicans and Democrats alike. Since then, curbing the rise in shootings has become a central topic among candidates vying for midterm election success. It has also prompted policy shifts from mayors across the country and recall challenges for progressive prosecutors in San Francisco and Los Angeles. As in previous decades, the impact of the rise in violence has been most felt in America’s Black and brown communities. Homicides in 2020 were concentrated among Black Americans who, despite making up 14% of the population, represented more than half of the 2020 victims, according to the FBI data. Gun violence is the leading cause of death for Black males ages 15-34, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And yet media coverage of the gun violence crisis still rarely acknowledges Black and Latino men as its primary victims. Meanwhile, academics and activists alike warn that tough-on-crime policies heralded by some as a response will only serve to criminalize the same people who deal with the most loss of life and community trauma. The Guardian spoke with Henrika McCoy, a social worker in Chicago and associate professor at the Jane Addams College of Social Work. McCoy researches victimization among young Black men and boys and hopes that an increased focus on the violence Black people face can help expand the public’s perception of who a victim is. She argues that racist stereotypes contribute to the idea that Black homicide victims, especially if they’re young and male, don’t merit the same level of compassion as white victims. “We don’t, as a group, harken a lot of sympathy,” McCoy says of Black Americans. “So more often than not, people think that if something happened to us, we deserved it.” Though Black and Latino people are more likely to be victims and survivors of violence, it seems that the traditional face of crime victimhood is still quite white and conservative. Why is that? I think the overarching reason Black victims are overlooked is that it’s assumed that Black people are expendable. So when violence happens to us, it doesn’t matter. It should be something that is expected. This country was founded on expending Black bodies to the benefit of forwarding a country. So, from the beginning, our losses of life haven’t held the same weight. And as a group we don’t garner a lot of sympathy because more often than not, people assume: “Well, they were probably doing something anyway. So why should we care?” People assume that we must have done something for harm to happen to us, even though we know that predominantly that is not true. Have you seen a shift in the perception that Black and Latino crime survivors are deserving of compassion and attention? That’s complicated. What has shifted is that there are more people talking about their experiences. And because of that, people who aren’t as close to the issue get to see more, which seems big because, for them, these are new voices. But I don’t think the stories are new and the number of current voices are nowhere commensurate to the actual number of incidents that happen. I just think that some of them are harder to avoid. Still, people find a way to minimize what happened as well as its impact on communities. What do officials and the public miss out on when the stories of Black people who have dealt with violence first-hand are obscured? I think the young Black and brown men who experience this victimization miss out on a range of things, from being able to develop relationships that provide a safe haven to creating positive relationships. On a more societal level, we are not built for repetitive trauma, so we end up forgetting that the homicide victim we’re reading about is a person. We end up assuming that since this happens every day, it doesn’t have a real impact in communities. By making that assumption, we give ourselves permission to not try to understand or to be engaged and be involved. I understand that we all need a break from devastating news, but if you can’t hear a story and understand where humans are involved, we have a problem. Finally, elevating the voices and experiences of people in the communities where gun violence happens most can help officials look at this issue and see how it overlaps and intersects with broader pieces of the puzzle, like child welfare and the juvenile legal system. Often, when I interview Black parents after their child was shot and killed, they emphasize that their child didn’t deserve what happened to them. Why do you think that is? We know in this society that if you see someone who’s Black and male, stereotypes that aren’t true are automatically piled on to them. So often there’s this justification, that because these are young people who may have done something wrong at one point in their lives, they’re not allowed to move on from certain stereotypes. And it seems that some people receive forgiveness and opportunities to grow and other people don’t. So when we see parents crying on the news, it’s because they know they have to fight the existing stereotypes that are piled on. I think it’s a reflex. People feel like if they don’t tell the world that their child was loved and didn’t deserve to be killed, they will just be another Black kid who did something wrong and doesn’t matter. On the flip side, what can the perspectives of the most underrepresented crime survivors teach people? When we hear from families of homicide victims, we can begin to understand whose life we lost. Just because they’re Black or brown doesn’t mean they didn’t have anything to contribute. We have to know who those individuals were, and that they contributed something. Everybody contributes something to the world. This person could have been a brilliant student or a talented musician and neighborhood volunteer. We can also begin to ask ourselves what we could have changed in the life of the person who shot them. Did the suspect in a drive-by whose sibling was killed and they were angry but never received the therapeutic services they needed, so they took out a gun? Finally, what needs to be done to change the perception of Black homicide victims and crime survivors so their experiences are given the same weight as those of white and affluent victims? I was working on a manuscript about the world 400 years from now. Kids are sitting in a school and gun violence seems foreign to them. Everything that we’re talking about in terms of racism, structural racism and social terms is foreign to them. They are shocked when they see the news coverage and read stories about what happened. And I thought to myself, “Well, what would it take to get there?” And I honestly don’t know. I don’t think it’ll happen in my lifetime, and that’s sad to say, but I just don’t. I think the goal is to figure out how we can help inch it forward.",News/US news,Why America overlooks those most hurt by gun violence: ‘Black people are seen as expendable’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/henrika-mccoy-violent-crime-us-stereotypes-interview
