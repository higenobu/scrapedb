4/14/2022,"An Alaskan guide was filming a survival video in Juneau, Alaska, for her 170,000 TikTok followers when she suddenly heard a landslide heading toward her. Buy, sell or hold? How to decide what to do with a plummeting stock The woman, who goes by the Dirty Explorer (@thedirtyexplorer) on TikTok, stopped filming her video and looked up, terrified, when she heard a landslide approaching. She quickly picked up her phone and kept recording as she ran as fast as she could away from her filming spot. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: At one point, according to the text overlay, she thinks the landslide is either stopping or slowing down, but viewers can hear the sudden increase in sound that indicates the main slide is just beginning. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, sounds like a faint rumbling or trees cracking indicate an approaching landslide. It’s advised that if you think a landslide is coming, you should leave your location — even without your belongings — and run out of its path. If that’s not possible, try to protect your head. Halfway through the TikTok, @thedirtyexplorer waved her arms and yelled “Stop!” to a nearby truck on the road. “Stop!” she screamed. “Stop your car!” She explained in the text overlay that the truck was about to encounter a blind turn while traveling at 50 miles per hour that would’ve put it right in the landslide danger zone. “Literally, 30 seconds and [I would] get f***ing killed,” the truck driver told @thedirtyexplorer. “Can we think about that?” “I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she responded. Commenters were amazed by @thedirtyexplorer’s quick thinking and reaction. “Impeccable decision making,” one said. “This is what survival instinct looks like,” another agreed. “Great job.” “The adrenaline must have been REAL,” someone wrote. “So glad you quickly recognized what was going on and acted.” In a follow-up video, @thedirtyexplorer showed the aftermath of the landslide and wrote, “If you think you ran far enough, no you didn’t.” She also took the opportunity to make a point about man-made climate change continuing to impact people every day. A study analyzing the High Mountain Asia region of China, Tibet and Nepal found a link between more frequent and intense rainfalls — a result of climate change — could cause more landslides in the area. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed in 2021 that climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. There has also been a significant increase in “heavy precipitation” — instances where rainfall or snowfall exceeds what is normal for the area — since the 1980s.

Artillery 155 millimeters, artillery shells, 152 millimeters, as many as possible. Multiple launch rocket systems, Grad, Smerch, Tornado, or M142 HIMARS. Armored vehicles, APC infantry, fighting vehicles, others. Tanks T-72 or similar tanks from the USA or Germany. Air defense systems as S-300, BUK, or Western equivalents. Military aircraft must have to d-block our cities and save millions of Ukrainians, as well as millions of Europeans. Freedom must be armed better than tyranny.

4/14/2022,"A dolphin died on a Texas beach after authorities say people harassed her and rode her in the ocean. The death of the dolphin on Quintana Beach led to a reminder from the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network not to interfere with stranded dolphins. The non-profit group said the dolphin was stranded alive on Sunday, April 10, and beach goers pushed it back to sea. Some of them reportedly swam with and rode the sick animal. “She ultimately stranded and was further harassed by a crowd of people on the beach, where she later died before rescuers could arrive on scene,” the group said. Those who harass wild dolphins are subjected to fines of up to $11,000 and jail time of a year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. “We encourage you to observe them from a distance of at least 50 yards,” NOAA said. NOAA announced in July 2021 that Texas Parks and Wildlife officials, as well as its own personnel, would increase patrolling of North Padre Island due to the harassment of a dolphin. That dolphin, NOAA said, was the victim of people swimming with, riding, jumping on and petting. When people interact with dolphins, McClatchy News reported at the time, the animals become comfortable and are more likely to approach things it associates with humans, such as boats. This could lead dolphins to being hit by boats or getting stuck in fishing equipment. “We view this as a human behavior problem,” TMMSN said last year, McClatchy News reported. “We know if people change their behavior, the dolphin’s behavior will also change, and we can prevent future injuries to people and the dolphin.” If you see a stranded dolphin, the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network encourages you to call 1-800-962-6625 for guidance on what to do before authorities arrive. To report harassment of marine mammals, contact NOAA’s Fisheries’ Enforcement hotline at 1-800-853-1964. People keep riding friendly dolphin in Texas.

4/14/2022,"A Ukrainian pilot who is frequently up in the sky trying to defend his country’s airspace from the Russian military says what Ukraine really needs to turn the tide is more advanced aircraft and weaponry – or else their pilots will continue to be ""just targets"" for the technologically-superior invading forces. The 29-year-old fighter pilot, who identified himself only by his call sign ""Juice"", made the remark to the Washington Post after Poland – and now Slovakia – floated plans of providing Soviet-era MiG-29 jets to Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s military. ""We’re ready to be killed,"" Juice told the newspaper, describing how the MiG-29 jets he flies makes him and his colleagues ""just targets"" for Russia’s more advanced aircraft. ""But we don’t want this, of course. We want to kill Russians and take down their bombers that are killing our cities and our families."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""We have losses almost everyday in our air force,"" he reportedly added. ""You won’t see this on TV because everything is classified right now, but actually we have a lot of losses. That’s why we need to be technically equal with the Russians. Just our mental advantage is not enough to fight with these technologies."" The newspaper reports that allies have been considering sending MiG-29s to Ukraine because it’s what the country’s military is familiar with using – and retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Herbert Carlisle added that if they received American-manufactured F-16s, their pilots and operational crews would have to learn ""significantly different"" flight systems and maintenance procedures. But Juice and another Ukrainian pilot told the Washington Post that the learning curve isn’t as steep as it sounds, with the latter saying it could probably take two weeks for Ukraine's military to get up to speed with using F-series aircraft. Juice also said Ukraine’s military has been improvising in the skies to make up for the differences in technology, sometimes leading Russian pilots into areas where air defense systems are ready to strike. ""We are just trying to do something nonstandard, and sometimes it’s successful and sometimes it’s not,"" Juice told the Washington Post. ""Sometimes they’re just stupid and Russians are just showing their incompetence and underestimating our training. ""But in general, we cannot gain a real air superiority, unfortunately,"" he said, adding that Western countries should supply Ukraine with more advanced air-defense systems if they can’t receive updated planes.",World/Fox News,Ukrainian pilot reveals what his country's military really needs in fight against Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-pilot-reveals-country-apos-132347352.html
4/14/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday told Ukraine to ""watch out"" after its former Soviet neighbour captured pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk, turning down Kyiv's offer of a swap with a warning that those holding him might soon be detained themselves. Medvedchuk, one of President Vladimir Putin's close allies in Ukraine, was shown handcuffed and wearing the uniform of a Ukrainian soldier on Tuesday in a picture tweeted by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy proposed swapping Medvedchuk, while Ukraine's SBU domestic security service cast him as a traitor whose future would be in shackles. ""Those freaks who call themselves the Ukrainian authorities say that they want to beat testimony out of Viktor Medvedchuk, 'quickly and fairly', convict him, and then exchange him for prisoners,"" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said. ""These people should watch out and lock the doors well at night to make sure they do not become the people who are going to be exchanged themselves,"" said Medvedev, a close Putin ally who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012. In February, Ukraine said Medvedchuk, leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party, escaped from house arrest. Authorities last year opened a treason case against Medvedchuk, who denies wrongdoing. The Kremlin said the court case against Medvedchuk was politically motivated and denied that he had any communication back channel to the Russian leadership. ""He had no backstage relationship with Russia,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""We will follow the fate of Viktor Medvedchuk - and we also call on European politicians to do the same as they are always so concerned about freedom of speech,"" Peskov said. Ukraine's SBU warned all ""pro-Russian traitors and agents of the Russian secret services"" that they would be brought to justice ""for all the crimes of the present day"". Thousands of people in Ukraine have been killed and nearly 10 million displaced after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, raising fears of a wider confrontation between the United States and Russia - the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says what he calls the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to act to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine against persecution. Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and dismisses Putin's claims of genocide as nonsense. Asked about the Ukrainian proposal to swap Medvedchuk for Ukrainians being held by Russia, Peskov said Medvedchuk was a Ukrainian citizen and a foreign politician.
