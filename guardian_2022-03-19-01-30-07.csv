3/19/2022,"Red Bull confirmed they have the upper hand as Formula One’s new era of regulations opened with the first practice sessions of the new season in Bahrain, while Mercedes continued to struggle. Reigning world champion Max Verstappen topped the time sheets in second practice while Lewis Hamilton could manage only ninth quickest. In the first practice session, Pierre Gasly had been quickest for AlphaTauri. However in the more representative twilight running, identical to race conditions, Verstappen was on top, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in second. Hamilton, suffering with the porpoising that has plagued Mercedes in pre-season was more than a second back on Verstappen, although his teammate George Russell did go fourth fastest. The uphill struggle Mercedes expected to open the season appears all too real. Meanwhile, a number of drivers in Bahrain also called for transparency in insisting the FIA should publish the report into the controversial events of last year’s season-deciding final race in Abu Dhabi. Verstappen passed Hamilton for the win at Yas Marina circuit on the final lap to seal his first title and deny the Briton his eighth. Verstappen did so after race director Michael Masi had intervened in adapting safety car rules to the circumstances. Masi has since been removed from his post and the FIA have issued clarifications on some of the rules in question. They have undertaken a full enquiry into what happened which is due to be revealed to the World Motor Sport Council on Saturday. However whether its findings will be made public remains a decision the WMSC have yet to make. It remains contentious since the FIA’s actions all point toward admissions that mistakes, which cost Hamilton the championship, were made. “I think it’s important that, as a sport, we are transparent,” said Hamilton. “I had a good meeting with Mohammed [Ben Sulayem, FIA president] last night who agreed that’s the direction we should take as a sport and so we’re looking forward to seeing it come out and for people to know that the sport is transparent and we are learning from what’s happened in the past and we’ll make improvements moving forwards.” Several drivers including Ferrari’s Leclerc and Carlos Sainz echoed Hamilton’s opinions. Verstappen however was less concerned. “I don’t think we need a full report,” he said.",Sport/Sport,Max Verstappen fastest in F1 Bahrain GP practice while Lewis Hamilton struggles,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/max-verstappen-fastest-in-f1-bahrain-gp-practice-while-lewis-hamilton-struggles
3/19/2022,"Angry protests against P&O Ferries have taken place at ports across the UK after the sacking without notice of 800 workers in a move the archbishop of Canterbury denounced as a sin. Trade unions leaders and politicians of all sides joined sacked P&O workers in Hull, Dover, Liverpool and Larne to protest against the company’s decision to replace all its crew with cheaper agency workers. The local Conservative MP, Natalie Elphicke, and the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell led a march in Dover with the leaders of the RMT and Nautilus International unions. They carried a banner that read “Save P&O jobs, save Britain’s ferries”. Despite speaking out against P&O and holding up a RMT poster against the “jobs carve up”, Elphicke was barracked by some of the protesters. “You voted for hire and rehire,” one shouted. “Tory anti-union laws allow bosses to get away with this”, another said. “Nonsense, it’s bad business behaviour,” Elphicke replied before leaving the demonstration. The demonstrations against P&O were backed by a strongly-worded joint statement by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the bishop of Dover, Rose Hudson-Wilkin. “Ill treating workers is not just business. In God’s eyes, it is sin,” it said. The statement noted that P&O’s owners, DP World, had made record profits last year and added: “The move is cynically timed for a moment when world attention is on Ukraine. Done without warning or consultation it is inhumane treats human beings as a commodity of no basic value or dignity and is completely unethical.” The bishops urged ministers to make forceful representations to the government of Dubai and to stop P&O operating until proper consultation had been carried out. In Hull around 200 protesters gathered outside the ferry terminal compound before marching onto the site and banging on the doors of the terminal building. Union officials, the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Labour’s Hull East MP Karl Turner addressed the rally. Among the protesters was the Labour leader of Hull city council, Daren Hale. “This is devastating news for the city and there is real anger in the community toward P&O,” he said. He argued that Brexit was partly to blame. “In the cruise industries there’s already a use of very cheap Filipino labour. One of the promises of Brexit, that we would be able to stop protect workers terms and conditions, has failed at the first hurdle,” he said. “The government promised this would be one of the benefits, so they need to now legislate or step in. There have been words of outrage, but what we want is action not words.” A letter from P&O’s chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, leaked to the Mirror revealed that the company hoped to halve its labour costs by replacing unionised UK seafarers with cheaper employees hired through the company International Ferry Management. Rosemary Pantelakis, Hull city council’s lead member for employment issues who was also at the protest, said: “I’d like to know what sort of employment regulations these people are operating by. When you have a redundancy it means the post is not there. “But there’s people that have been hired to replace those workers in the same job. It’s absolutely outrageous. Those workers were employed on European rights, and those rights are not there anymore.” Speaking at a protest in Liverpool, Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, also called for government intervention. “I say to the prime minister, you have to step in and you have to deliver on your commitment to strengthen employment law so this kind of gangster practice can’t be allowed to happen any more,” he said. In Dover, the leader of the Fire Brigades Union, Matt Wrack, offered sacked P&O workers the full support of the trade union movement. Addressing the protest he said: “You tell us what you want this movement to do and we’ll do it. And if that means occupying streets and ships we will be there to support you.” The leader of the Labour group in the Kent council of Medway, Vince Maple, said he had also joined the Dover protest in solidarity with P&O workers. “I’m concerned that there will be massive ripples across the whole county at a time when everyone is struggling. As a former trade union officer I accept you may have to have difficult negotiations to make things viable. But what happened yesterday was the complete opposite of that.” Maple also called on the golfer Ian Poulter, who is an ambassador for DP World, to end his association with the company. “I’m not sure whether Ian Poulter would agree with what’s happened, I hope he wouldn’t, but that’s why I’ve asked the question,” he said. “I haven’t had a reply yet.”   ",News/Business,Angry protests against P&O Ferries take place at ports across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/angry-protests-against-po-ferries-take-place-at-ports-across-uk
3/19/2022,"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City could claim the Treble this season but the manager understands how tough it will be given that only Manchester United have achieved the feat among English clubs. City lead the Premier League from Liverpool by a point with nine games left, travel to Southampton for Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final and were paired with Atlético Madrid in Friday’s draw for the Champions League last eight. Liverpool, who have won the Carabao Cup, could complete a clean sweep of all four competitions. In 2017-18 Guardiola’s side became the first to win all three domestic trophies. Asked about the Treble, he said: “If United did it once, then it happened and someone else can do it. People said we could not win three domestic titles ever, it was impossible, and we did it. So when it happens, another team can do it. It would not be easy but you can do it, of course. “In September, October, November, it is more difficult but when there are two months left and still you can be there to win the titles, yeah it’s possible. On the other hand, it’s happened once so that shows how difficult it is.” Guardiola brushed aside whether City would be motivated to win the FA Cup, considered the least important of the three trophies. “How do you ask me this?” he said. “We show in these six years [with him manager] how we play every game like it’s the last game of our lives. We respect the FA Cup greatly. It’s great. We know how difficult it will be away at Southampton but I trust my players a lot. “I am a manager who trusts these players to try to win every competition. So we will try to be who we are, like we did, for example, against Southampton and Crystal Palace even though we dropped points against them. I want to do it with these players – I would not change one single player to try and do all of these things in these next two months ahead.”",Sport/Football,‘It’s possible’: Pep Guardiola on Manchester City’s push for Treble,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-treble-possible
3/19/2022,"Netflix’s Big Mouth set out to perform a very specific task. An animated comedy featuring teenagers who are visited by hormone monsters, it planted its flag as a frank exploration of puberty as it objectively is; an awkward, horny, non-stop body horror nightmare. However, over the course of its five seasons, Big Mouth took its eye off the ball just a little. As the episodes wore on, you sensed that the creators were starting to lose interest in their human teenage characters, while growing more and more enamoured with the flamboyantly crude monsters that came to represent all their various adolescent desires and urges. This was reflected in the acclaim it received; for the past two years, Maya Rudolph has won Emmys for her portrayal of Connie the Hormone Monstress, a sort of horned griffin who – among other things – exists to teach teenagers how to masturbate. Which brings us to Human Resources, a new Big Mouth spin-off, designed to show what the monsters do when the children aren’t around. Think of it as a workplace comedy or, as one character says before the opening titles of the very first episode, “‘Big Mouth meets The Office’ is how we sold it”. However, fans of The Office probably shouldn’t get too excited by the comparison because, unless my memory has failed me, no episode of The Office ever revolved around an employee slipping and injuring himself in a giant pool of ejaculate. In short, despite the change of location, the unrelenting crudeness of Big Mouth remains completely intact. This is a series where a giant spider will drop a bowl of hot soup on his crotch and yell: “Ow, my spider dick!” It’s a series where a small army of detached penises will have a birthday party. You probably already had a good idea about whether or not you were going to invest your time in Human Resources, but those last two sentences have probably hardened it into concrete resolve. You are either in, or irreparably out. Hopefully it’s the former, though. Because, once you’ve got past the sex stuff and dick jokes and swear words, which appear to have been tossed into the script at random, Human Resources becomes quite sweet and – very occasionally – quite profound. Now that the overwhelming bulk of the characters are monsters designed to reflect various aspects of the human personality, they are all very clearly defined. There are creatures who represent love, shame, ambition, logic, and addiction. Each of them isa little one-dimensional, but this is deliberate, and the joy of the show comes from watching them at work: finding a human and quarrelling with each other about how they should make it behave. In that sense, you should try to think of it as a riff on Pixar’s Inside Out, albeit a riff on Inside Out that you would deliberately go out of your way to avoid in a pub. It’s worth mentioning the cast, too, which is just phenomenal: Nick Kroll, Maya Rudolph, Randall Park, Ali Wong and David Thewlis are joined by Jermaine Clement, Maria Bamford, Thandiwe Newton, Jean Smart, Henry Winkler and – slightly incredibly – Dame Helen Mirren as Shame Wizard, Rita St Swithens. Seemingly, even the tiniest walk-on role has been given to a figure of immense talent. It’s remarkable. That said, I’m not sure whether Human Resources would – or should – replace Big Mouth in the affections of its viewers. The broader remit means that the new show gets to splash around in a wider spectrum of the human experience, giving us episodes about weddings and childbirth and parenting. But this means that it also lacks the laser focus of its parent show. Big Mouth has been able to mine 51 episodes from the horrors of puberty, but Human Resources deals with childbirth in one quick scene. As such, it all feels a bit more surface level and a lot less rich. Despite this, there’s still plenty to enjoy about the new show. Admittedly, that enjoyment will hinge upon the amount of satisfaction you are able to achieve from hearing Thandiwe Newton refer to herself as a “hairy insatiable jizz monster”. If that’s a lot, though, Human Resources is yours for the taking.",Arts/Television & radio,Dame Helen Mirren as the Shame Wizard: Human Resources is Big Mouth’s star-packed spin-off,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/18/dame-helen-mirren-as-shame-wizard-human-resources-is-big-mouths-star-packed-spin-off
3/19/2022,"Is Hollywood finally changing? In 1987, Marlee Matlin made history by becoming the first (and still only) deaf actor to win an Oscar, picking up best actress for Children of a Lesser God. This year Matlin is not nominated, but her film Coda is up for three awards: best picture; best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for her co-star and on-screen husband, the deaf actor Troy Kotsur (he’s the leading contender after trousering the Bafta on Sunday). On paper, Coda doesn’t look like a gamechanger. It’s a familiar-feeling, coming-of-age indie about 17-year-old high school senior Ruby (played by British newcomer Emilia Jones), a talented singer from a tightknit family. Ruby is torn between dreams of a music scholarship and staying in Massachusetts to work on her family’s fishing boat. The title is an acronym for “child of deaf adults”, and Ruby is the only hearing member of her family; her parents (played by Matlin and Kotsur) and brother are deaf. Coda premiered at Sundance last year to a standing ovation, sparking a bidding war that ended with Apple forking out a record $25m. After that it seemed to run out of steam (blame the pandemic), dropping on Apple TV+ and limited cinemas in August 2021. But in recent weeks, pundits have been speculating about its chances as a shock best picture winner – a potential spoiler to pip frontrunner The Power of the Dog. The comeback started when Coda bagged the big prize at the Screen Actors Guild awards for outstanding performance by a cast. Still, there is some sniffiness out there towards Coda as best picture material: the feeling that it’s too blatant a crowdpleaser, machine tooled to leave viewers with a warm, squishy feeling. I get the resistance. The film doesn’t dig too deeply into its characters. You’ll recognise Ruby’s embarrassing hippy parents from a dozen past indies: Jackie (Matlin) and Frank (Kotsur) smoke doobies and have loud afternoon sex while she’s in the next bedroom. Her high school singing teacher is cartoonish Mr V (Eugenio Derbez), a typical inspiring disciplinarian who demands the highest standards from pupils. So yes, it hits familiar beats. But Coda is a landmark in deaf culture and representation on the big screen. Writer-director Sian Heder (who is hearing) adapted the script from a 2014 French film La Famille Bélier, which controversially cast hearing actors. In Coda, the deaf characters are played by deaf actors – that’s three out of four of the leading roles. When I interviewed Matlin last year, she told me she threatened to quit when a financier asked for a big-name hearing actor to play her on-screen husband. So the role went to veteran deaf actor Kotsur. The scene in which he tells a government fishing official where to stick it in expletive-filled American Sign Language (ASL), on its own justifies the win coming his way. (The captions can’t do justice to his sign: making his hand into a testicle that turns into a grenade, then pulling the pin). And isn’t just the watershed value that makes Coda best-picture worthy. There are moments in it that have really stuck with me. In one emotional scene, Ruby asks Jackie: “Do you ever wish I was deaf?” Jackie sighs, and tells Ruby about how, when she was a tiny baby in hospital, the doctors gave her a hearing test. “I prayed that you would be deaf,” Jackie says, admitting she was anxious she wouldn’t connect with her hearing daughter. In another scene Mr V asks Ruby how she feels when she sings. She shrugs an inarticulate teenage shrug, thinks about it then answers in her first language, ASL. It’s gorgeous. Half of the dialogue is in ASL. As well as casting deaf actors, Heder hired two directors of artistic sign language to collaborate on the script, Alexandria Wailes and Anne Tomasetti. There were sign language consultants on set, making sure the actors’ signing stayed in frame. One of them said that in a deaf house, the sofa would be facing the front door, so the front room was rearranged. Can Coda really win best picture? The number-crunching awards geeks who take the Oscars as seriously as a presidential race think not. The statistics are against it. But it would be a popular choice. And the acceptance speech would be a corker. Here’s a taste of what we could expect, from Matlin’s acceptance at the SAG awards: “This validates the fact that we, deaf actors, can work just like anybody else. We look forward to more opportunities for deaf actors,” she said, before teaching the audience ASL for “I love you”. In the past Hollywood rewarded non-disabled actors giving sensitive portrayals of disability with awards love. A win for Coda would show that movies can reflect our changing world.",Arts/Film,Why Coda should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/18/why-coda-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/19/2022,"The draw for the rounds of Big Cup that don’t involve Paris Saint-Germain was made on Friday morning. At first glance, the runes read nicely for Liverpool, who face Benfica in the quarters, then possibly Bayern Munich in the semis and Real Madrid in the Stade de France showpiece. Could this be some sort of omen? Liverpool won the League Cup in 1981, you see, then went on to beat Bayern in the Big Cup semis and Madrid in the final … which, yes, you’ve got there before us, was held in Paris. Something something Coronation Street and royal family blah, and there you have it. Eerie or what? Holders Chelsea and Manchester City might not be quite so ready and willing to channel the spirit of 1980-81, however. City did get to a final that season, that is true, but only to haplessly put through their own net before conceding one of the greatest goals of all time. Ricky Villa’s weaving run in that FA Cup final replay was unarguably City’s greatest inadvertent contribution made to the culture that season, though the sublime genius of the Granada documentary City! runs it close. Seriously, if you haven’t seen it, set aside an hour, we guarantee you’ll enjoy it, even if you won’t get the rich smell of fag-ash and pomade out of your nostrils for a week. Chelsea’s 1981 wasn’t quite so glamorous. They were in the old Second Division at the time, having failed to win promotion the season before, Devon Loch-ing it during the run-in. Picking themselves up to try again, they embarked on a nine-game goalless streak and ended up 12th. To think the current generation are feeling sorry for themselves following the fall of the Roman empire. Anyway, their 2022 model could meet City in this year’s semis, providing they get past Real Madrid and Pep’s lot beat Atlético. That would be a mouth-watering repeat of last year’s final, wouldn’t it, which Chelsea won 1-0 thanks to Antonio Rüdiger’s challenge on Kevin De Bruyne. But the events of 1980-81 will surely encourage West Ham United. Euro Vase was lifted that season by Ipswich Town – for reasons too boring to go into, Alan Brazil wore just a dressing gown when he picked up his medal, a mental image you can enjoy all weekend – and West Ham’s magnificent performance against six-time winners Sevilla showed that another surprise English triumph is eminently possible. The Hammers face Lyon in this year’s quarters, then maybe the rabble masquerading as Barcelona in the semis, before a possible final showdown with O’Rangers, winners of … the 1981 Scottish Cup. Wow.

Russia’s participation in the Human Rights World Cup is almost certainly over after a move to delay their suspension while an appeal was heard was rejected. Middlesbrough boss Chris Wilder insists Chelsea don’t need anybody’s sympathy as he attempts to dump them out of the FA Cup quarter-finals. “For me, the noise that’s been coming out if it – the club is not in jeopardy, is it?” he tooted. “It’s not a situation like a Macclesfield or a Bury in the football pyramid, what happened and shouldn’t really have happened.

3/19/2022,"A Spanish man who had eaten hash cakes before he was pulled over by police for driving erratically has been fined €2,001 (£1,680) after failing to convince officers he had immunity because he was a diplomat for an “individual and mobile” republic. Earlier this month, Guardia Civil officers in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja ordered the 28-year-old to pull over after noticing that his Volkswagen Golf was zigzagging across the road and that he was on his mobile. “Once the vehicle had been intercepted, the officers asked the driver for his identity documents, to which he responded by showing a driving licence and ID card from the ‘Errant Republic of Menda Lerenda’,” the force said in a statement. Although the “republic” bills itself online as “an individual and mobile sovereignty recognised by other states capable of acting with complete independence in strict compliance with international law”, the officers were not impressed by his documents or his claims of diplomatic immunity. “The driver ignored repeated requests to show credible identification and began to show the officers a lack of respect,” the statement continued. “He claimed to have immunity on the grounds that he was a member of the sovereign diplomatic service of the aforementioned republic.” After being subjected to a drug test, the man tested positive for THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, and told the officers “it was due to the marijuana madeleines he had eaten”. Further checks revealed that the car’s ITV (the Spanish equivalent of the MOT) had expired. The driver had nine points docked from his licence and was fined €601 for disobeying the police and providing false or inaccurate information, €1,000 for drug-driving, €200 for driving while on the phone, and another €200 for failing to have a valid ITV. His car was also impounded. It is not the first time people have used Menda Lerenda IDs to try to avoid legal problems. In October 2020, a man wanted for traffic offences was arrested after showing officers in the north-west Galicia region a Menda Lerenda driving licence before attempting to flee. A few months later, another man in the same region produced a Menda Lerenda ID when stopped during a routine Covid check. He was taken to a police station, where it emerged that he was wanted by the authorities for refusing to send his children to school. According to its website, the Republic of Errant Menda Lerenda is a micronation, officially proclaimed in 1999, that defines an individual person as an independent republic in themselves and recognises their national territory as the space they occupy at “each moment”. Certified identification as a sovereign republic can be bought online for €76.25 (£64).",News/World news,Spanish driver who ate hash cakes claims diplomatic immunity from non-existent state,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/spanish-driver-hash-cakes-claims-diplomatic-immunity-menda-lerenda
3/19/2022,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, numerous fundraisers have been launched to help Ukrainians in need, from GoFundMe campaigns to Airbnb bookings. But one Chicago artist chose a singular figure in the crisis and began to design a Lego-style figurine of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Joe Trupia is the owner of Citizen Brick, a toy manufacturing company. At Citizen Brick, Trupia takes “the iconic LEGO® mini-figure and print[s] his own (wildly inappropriate) unique designs on them”. Although he has no personal connections to the war, Trupia felt compelled to help. “I just felt that I had to act using what I had,” he told the Washington Post. As a result, he decided to design two types of models he thought symbolized the country’s “bravery in the face of tyranny”: the Ukrainian president – and, more controversially perhaps, tiny toy molotov cocktails. Zelenskiy’s figurine features the president with his current signature appearance – a military green T-shirt and jacket, black boots, neat short hair and stubble, with an expression somehow combining fatigue, outrage and defiance on its little plastic face. “He’s a guy who could’ve fled the country with a suitcase full of money and instead he’s sticking by his people … I was just so impressed by his steadfastness and the hope he seems to give to people,” Trupia told the Post. The molotov cocktail is chosen as a sign of desperate rebellion by ordinary people with few weapons to unleash against a much more powerful foe. The small items comprise a green bottle with the Ukrainian flag and a plastic orange “flame”. “The irony of selling a little toy incendiary device in order to buy medical supplies for refugees isn’t lost on me,” said Trupia. Since Citizen Brick’s first sale on 5 March, with the Zelenskiy figurine going for $100 and the molotov cocktails for $10 each, the company has raised $145,388, selling out each batch within a matter of hours. On Thursday, Citizen Brick announced that it has sold out every Zelenskiy figurine and petrol bomb and donated the proceeds to the charity organization Direct Relief, which is responding to Ukraine’s humanitarian appeals. Due to limited supply of necessary parts, the manufacturer will no longer be creating more figurines. “I really wish we could do more, but we weren’t really outfitted for that,” Trupia said. Citizen Brick is not tied to Lego but the Danish toy giant apparently tolerates its small-scale activities, and itself has made a multimillion donation of aid to Ukraine as well as suspending sales in Russia, the Post further reported. Meanwhile, Lost Worlds, a North Carolina brewery has started to sell 32-ounce take-home beer flasks with labels in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine’s flag but featuring a picture of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sales of which will be donated to the National Bank of Ukraine’s Fund for Refugees, Axios reported.

3/19/2022,"Every time I look at the pictures of Mariupol or Kharkiv, I see a corner of Whitechapel in east London. I reacted the same way to images of Aleppo and, before that, Falluja and, before that, Grozny, because buildings crushed to rubble have a sad habit of looking the same. It brings back a memory – or rather something fainter: an inherited memory, one that was passed to me. Its origin is 27 March 1945; the 77th anniversary is a little over a week away. Early that morning, at 7.21am, a V2 rocket landed on Hughes Mansions, a block of flats on Vallance Road in the East End. It killed 134 people, more or less instantly. Among them were two sisters, Rivvi and Feige (pronounced fay-ghee). Feige Hocherman was 33 and she left behind two children, a son not yet 11 and a daughter aged eight and a quarter. The little girl was my mother, Sara. The war was in its final weeks and the bomb that fell that morning would be the very last V2 to land on London. It wasn’t a targeted missile, though if it had been it could hardly have delighted its masters more. For of the 134 people killed by that Nazi rocket, 120 were Jews. It meant that, as a very young child, I somehow thought “Vallance Road” belonged alongside Belsen or Auschwitz in the small lexicon of words to be spoken only in whispers, each of them bywords for terror and grief. I was well into my 30s before I ever went close to that place. And yet, though I did not witness it and though I only ever saw the physical destruction that bomb wreaked through grainy archive photographs, I can honestly say that event shaped my life. Because it shaped my mother’s life. It made her who she was. There were the direct legacies, of course. For many decades, my mother was implacable in her anger towards the Germans, because it was a German rocket that had killed her mother. There would be no German products in our house; no German car. She was no less unbending on the necessity of Israel. For the Nazis, the identity of the victims of Hughes Mansions was no more than a lucky accident; but the fact remained that my mother had lost her mother to a Nazi operation that killed Jews en masse: she had felt the breath of the Shoah on her neck. Like many others, she would never lose the conviction that Jews would always need a place they could call their own and a means to defend themselves. The experience of such intense hurt so young had another, perhaps less predictable consequence: it opened up deep reservoirs of empathy for the suffering of others. “I feel your pain,” has become a joke phrase. But my mother really did feel your pain, even if you were someone she had only just met and whose life she had only glimpsed. Why do I say all this now, nearly 80 years later? Because, as I look at the terrible destruction of Mariupol and the burning ruins of Kharkiv, I remember that the damage done by a rocket or artillery shell cannot be measured in the stark numbers of a death toll or, still less, the impact on infrastructure – though I saw this week that the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after Vladimir Putin has rained fire on that country is estimated at $100bn (£76bn) and it is rising every day. Instead the cost is measured in the aftershocks felt by those who survive the blast: the injured and the maimed, those whose homes are smashed, those children who once had a mother or father but who, in the briefest of moments, had them taken away by a bolt from the sky. That kind of bomb damage cannot be repaired with concrete. It lives on in the children of the dead, and in their children. I know, because it lives on in me. And yet the conclusion I draw from this is not the pacifist’s resolve that no bullet must ever be fired, no missile must ever be launched. For this, too, I learned from my mother: that while war is evil, the greater evil is murderous aggression that goes unchecked. No one would dare say “stop the war” to Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the people he leads, because that would be to demand that Ukrainians allow their children to keep being killed, their bodies tossed into mass graves at speed because it’s too dangerous to linger in the open, even when one of those bodies belongs to a six-year-old girl, buried in the pyjamas she wore when she was hit, patterned with cartoon unicorns. When a killer has his hands around your neck, choking the life out of you, what you need is the strength in your arms to get him off. This is what the Ukrainians are demanding the west give them. It is the right not to make war, but to repel aggression. It is the right to defend oneself against missiles that flatten an apartment building or destroy a theatre, whose basement shields up to 1,500 people, most of them old or very young. It is the right to protect a city where the last inhabitants melt snow to drink, and burn furniture to ward off the icy cold or cook what scraps of food they can find. Given that the west won’t do it, for fear of tangling with a nuclear state, Ukrainians want the equipment – above all the aircraft – to do it for themselves. It’s such an elemental need, and yet many struggle to comprehend it. There are plenty in western Europe and the US who took, or perhaps still take, a dim view of Nato, regarding it as a cold war throwback or an arm of western imperialism and militarism. But Ukrainians saw it differently: for them Nato was the body that might protect them from the neighbourhood bully who had already proved, just eight years ago, his determination to hurt them and take what was theirs. Most Ukrainians saw the European Union the same way. Those in Britain who so casually disdained our membership of the EU or Nato betray an unwitting but unappealing strain of privilege, akin to the trust fund millionaire who insists they never think about money. It’s easy to dismiss something precious when you have lots of it. That goes for individuals with wealth, but also for those countries or peoples who have only ever known the security of having a state of their own, whose borders are stable and where the notion of an enemy attack is all but unimaginable (or forgotten). My mother took none of those things for granted, and because she didn’t neither do I. In eight decades’ time, there will be Ukrainians in middle age who feel the same way, because of events happening right now. The reverberations will keep sounding, through the generations. That is why even short wars last so long. I am the son of that terrified little girl and I always will be. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.
