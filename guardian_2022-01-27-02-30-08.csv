1/27/2022,"The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver and campaigners aiming to improve the quality of school lunches are to meet with the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, after Oliver teamed up with the leaders of hundreds of schools urging the government to tackle the rise in child obesity since the Covid pandemic. Oliver’s charity Bite Back 2030, with headteachers and academy trust executives, wrote to Zahawi to lobby for changes to the government’s planned food strategy, and to call for schools in England to publish annual food reports showing what progress they have made in meeting standards on health and nutrition.  Oliver – who helped start a national debate over unhealthy school lunches when he exposed the spread of Turkey Twizzlers as part of the 2005 TV series Jamie’s School Dinners – said the quality of food was unreliable in too many schools and still needed to be improved. “Whether your child gets good food at school is currently a postcode lottery. That’s why I’m supporting a growing army of teachers, young people and charities who are all calling on Nadhim Zahawi to make it policy that every school publishes their annual plan so every child gets healthy nutritious food at school, no matter where they live,” Oliver said. The letter drew a quick response from Zahawi after Oliver tweeted about the issue on Wednesday, with the education secretary thanking him “for raising this important issue” and offering to arrange a meeting. The letter was backed by executives representing many of England’s largest multi-academy trusts – including Ark, Star Academies and Ormiston Academies Trust – totalling more than 600 individual schools. “We know that a major driver of poor Covid-19 outcomes in the UK has been our spiralling obesity rates,” the letter to Zahawi states. “The causes of childhood obesity and health inequalities are of course complex, but we believe – as school leaders – that with young people in school 190 days of the year, schools should be supported to do everything we can to set the stage for dietary health. That means government taking the opportunity – as it formulates its levelling up strategy and food strategy – to rethink, review and reform how the school food system works in England.” The letter follows a recent report compiled by Bite Back that highlighted the vastly different experiences of food offered at secondary schools, with pupils on free school meals reporting they were given fewer choices. One student said: “There aren’t any healthy options, to be fair. My school used to do salad bowls and fruit bowls, but they’ve stopped that now and it is literally just junk food.” Critics say one reason for the decline in food quality and choice has been the Department for Education’s failure to increase payments for school food, including infant free school meals available for all children in the first years of primary school. The government pays just £2.34 for each child’s food per day, a rate that has barely changed since 2011.",News/Education,Jamie Oliver to meet education secretary over school food plans,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/26/jamie-oliver-education-secretary-school-food-plans
1/27/2022,"A postmortem has confirmed that an elderly Palestinian-American man who died after being detained in an Israeli raid suffered a “stress-induced sudden cardiac arrest stemming from external violence”, after witnesses challenged soldiers’ accounts of events in the high-profile incident. Omar Abdalmajeed As’ad, 78, was detained in his village of Jiljilya in the occupied West Bank at an impromptu road checkpoint on 12 January and “apprehended after resisting a check”, according to an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) statement. He was handcuffed, gagged and blindfolded for between 20 minutes to an hour, and his body discovered by local residents and others detained in the raid after the soldiers left.  A copy of the Palestinian justice ministry-commissioned autopsy, released on Wednesday and seen by the Guardian, said that As’ad had internal bleeding in his eyelids as a result of pressure on his eyes, abrasions and bruises, and redness around the wrists as a result of being cuffed with zip ties. It also noted he had several pre-existing heart problems. Palestinian officials had previously alleged that As’ad had been beaten. According to initial military investigation findings leaked to Israeli news outlets, the soldiers involved in the incident realised As’ad had gone quiet and thought he looked a little “stoned” before “falling asleep”. After the zip ties were cut, the soldiers left without checking his wellbeing, despite the fact a military medic was nearby, Haaretz reported. In interviews, several witnesses have said that As’ad had clearly lost consciousness and stopped breathing before the soldiers left. They also said he was left lying on the ground, rather than sitting in a chair, in the construction site where he was held. A separate report on the Ynet news website on a leaked military summary of events suggested that none of the troops involved “would be indicted, nor have they been suspended”. It also quoted military lawyers representing the soldiers as saying As’ad had been “lawfully detained during the operation in accordance with procedures” and “his death is not related to the conduct of the military force”. IDF international spokesperson Lt Col Amnon Shefler said on Wednesday that he had no immediate comment on the autopsy’s findings. “The investigations are continuing. If we find wrongdoing, then of course we will demand answers from the soldiers, and if needed they will be punished as according to our protocols and our values,” he said. In a previous statement, the military said As’ad was alive when the soldiers released him, but that the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division was reviewing the incident. As’ad and his wife emigrated to the US in the 1970s, running a grocery store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin before retiring and returning to the West Bank a decade ago. The 78-year-old’s US citizenship means that his case has received more international attention than most violent incidents and civilian deaths related to Israel’s military occupation of the Palestinian territories. In 2021, security forces killed 41 Palestinians in the West Bank who were not involved in attacking or allegedly attacking Israelis, according to human rights group B’Tselem. The US state department has asked Israel for “clarification” on As’ad’s death, while his family and several members of Congress have demanded a US-led investigation.",News/World news,"Man, 78, died of stress-induced heart attack after Israeli detention, says autopsy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/man-78-died-of-stress-induced-heart-attack-after-israeli-detention-says-autopsy
1/27/2022,"Concern that rising inflation is having a disproportionate impact on people in poorer households in the UK has prompted government number crunchers to provide a more detailed breakdown of the cost of living. The Office for National Statistics said it accepted that every person had their own inflation rate and it would do more to capture the impact of price increases on different income groups.  Mike Hardie, the head of inflation statistics at the ONS, said in a blog the published annual inflation rate – currently 5.4% – was an average for all households. “But everyone has their own personal inflation rate. Some people may spend a larger proportion of their income on gas and electricity, or petrol if you commute via car daily.” The move was welcomed by the food writer and activist Jack Monroe, who has exposed how prices for cheaper food products have soared as availability fell, contributing to rising hunger and poverty. Monroe, who is drawing up an inflation index to track basic food prices, tweeted: “Delighted to be able to tell you that the @ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances.” Delighted to be able to tell you that the @ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances 👊 #VimesBootsIndex Writing in last week’s Observer, Monroe said: “In 2012, 10 stock cubes from Sainsbury’s Basics range were 10p. In 2022, those same stock cubes are 39p, but only available in chicken or beef. The cheapest vegetable stock cubes are, inexplicably, £1 for 10. “Last year the Smart Price pasta in my local Asda was 29p for 500g. Today it is unavailable, so the cheapest bag is 70p; a 141% price rise for the same product in more colourful packaging.” Terry Pratchett’s estate has authorised Monroe to use the Vimes Boots index as the name of the new price index, which is intended to document the “insidiously creeping prices” of basic food products. The index, Monroe said, would be called the Vimes Boots index in honour of Pratchett’s creation Sam Vimes, who in the Discworld novel Men at Arms lays out the “Sam Vimes ‘Boots’ theory of socioeconomic unfairness”. The author’s daughter, the writer Rhianna Pratchett, said her father would have been proud to see his work used in this way by the anti-poverty campaigner. The ONS previously published a more detailed breakdown of inflation but it was suspended during the Covid pandemic because so many items were unavailable. During the previous economic downturn, the financial crisis of 2008-09, when inflation also surged, the ONS said poorer households were more severely affected. “Given the level of interest in the cost of living and inflation we are planning to restart this series,” Hardie said. Over the longer term, he added, the ONS was “transforming” the way it measured prices in order to understand people’s spending patterns in a more detailed and timely way. The ONS measures inflation by looking at the cost of 700 items from a number of price points. “We are currently developing radical new plans to increase the number of price points dramatically each month from 180,000 to hundreds of millions, using prices sent to us directly from supermarket checkouts,” Hardie said. “This will mean we won’t just include one apple in a shop … but how much every apple costs, and how many of each type were purchased, in many more shops in every area of the country.”",News/Business,Cost-of-living crisis: ONS to revise inflation calculations after Jack Monroe campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/cost-of-living-crisis-ons-inflation-jack-monroe
1/27/2022,"Jesse Lingard feels let down and disrespected by Manchester United after a proposed loan to Newcastle was on the verge of collapse because of the terms demanded by his boyhood club. For the deal to happen as it stands, Newcastle could end up paying more than £15m to take Lingard for the rest of the season. United are demanding a £2.5m loan fee, full coverage of the player’s wages and a £12m bonus if the Saudi Arabian-owned club avoid relegation from the Premier League.  Unless a compromise is reached Lingard faces having to finish the campaign at Old Trafford even though Ralf Rangnick has told him he is not in his plans. The forward has also been a target for Tottenham and West Ham but United will not allow him to go on loan to any club battling with them for a top-four finish. Lingard believes he has not been shown the respect he deserves after 21 years at United. He feels the club are upset at his refusal to sign a contract beyond this season and are acting accordingly. The 29-year-old is also dismayed because he thought he had received a promise last summer from Ole Gunnar Solskjær that he would get more first-team chances. Despite the club’s often poor form he has barely featured, including more recently under Rangnick.

1/27/2022,"The Greek prime minister has apologised for the state’s lack of preparedness to deal with a snowstorm that left thousands of people stranded in their cars in Athens. The unprecedented spectacle of elite forces being called in to evacuate motorists trapped in vehicles along the capital’s main ring road left the government reeling as the damage was still being calculated in the wake of Monday’s storm.  With blackouts reported citywide, Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the public’s anger. “I would like to start with a personal and sincere apology to our fellow citizens who suffered for many hours trapped on Attiki Odos,” he said in televised comments. “There were mistakes and shortcomings which have to be fixed.” An estimated 4,000 drivers were left stranded in cars for hours in sub-zero temperatures as the storm pounded Athens. Those who were not evacuated by the army sought refuge in Athens international airport or struggled to walk to their homes through the snow. On Wednesday, scores of cars abandoned by owners remained stuck on the ring road while power cuts in the wider Athens region affected thousands of households for a third day. Mitsotakis, echoing ministers, lay the blame for much of the debacle with the private operator of the Attiki Odos motorway system, which has been criticised for allowing cars on to its road, but he admitted it was also time to boost climate crisis defences. Like Turkey, also hit by the storm, Greece experienced devastating forest fires last year with the loss of hundreds of homes and livestock. “It’s true that a Mediterranean country’s infrastructure is not always adapted to conditions of heavy snowfall,” said the leader. “It is equally true, however, that the state mechanism is not yet at the point of readiness that phenomena of such great intensity require.” In a country of hyper-partisan media coverage where Mitsotakis’ centre-right government is rarely censured, the criticism has been impossible to ignore. Outlets have condemned the authorities’ slow response to the blizzard, calling the chaotic scenes in an EU member state inexcusable. All non-essential services, including the entire public sector, were shut down, with the government declaring a public holiday on Tuesday and Wednesday. Schools are not expected to reopen until Friday after authorities announced that snow was still blocking access to many of the facilities. This is the second consecutive year – and only the second time since 1968 – that Athens, more usually accustomed to the difficulties of extreme heat, has been pummelled by a snowstorm of such vigour. As much as 50cm of snow fell in 12 hours in some parts of the capital. Indicative of the storm’s intensity, tornadoes were reported off islands and coastal areas, with almost all of Athens, from the Acropolis in the ancient city centre to seaside suburbs in the south-east, being blanketed white. Meteorologists were also unsparing on Wednesday in chastising the state’s response. Kostas Lagouvardos, who heads the National Observatory of Athens, said the storm had been accurately predicted well in advance and that officials had ignored the forecasts. “There is no excuse,” he said. “Unlike 20 years ago we have the tools and methods to accurately forecast such events and this was very well forecast. Once again we have seen the state being reluctant to listen to the scientists and that is dangerous when we are talking about the safety of people and their property.”",News/World news,Greek PM faces blizzard of anger as thousands stranded in Athens snow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/greek-pm-faces-blizzard-of-anger-as-thousands-stranded-in-athens-snow
1/27/2022,"Launceston is one of Australia’s oldest and perhaps most characterful cities. It’s full of Georgian, Victorian and Federation-era buildings largely untouched by wrecking balls or developers, often bearing their year of construction a century ago or more. With manicured lawns, flowerbeds and a classically inspired 1859 fountain, Prince’s Square pulls all that heritage charm together. But this week things are a little different. The bitumen around the fountain is painted with giant red letters spelling out messages of sin, theft and scars, while a foreboding soundscape envelops parkgoers.  A collaboration project between Aboriginal Tasmanian artist Kartanya Maynard and Kuku Yalandji, Waanji, Yidinji and Gugu Yimithirr artist Vernon Ah Kee, Waranta Takamuna! (we rise) is a simple but moving intervention: it’s disrupting the heritage facade of the square, the city and the colony from the inside out. For Maynard, Prince’s Square is “dripping in colonialism”. “When I look at parks like Prince’s Square I see this deep, deep manipulation of the landscape into something almost too unreal – everything’s a little too perfect, and for me that’s deeply uncomfortable,” she tells Guardian Australia. “One of the trees in the park is even planted by one of Queen Victoria’s kids.” Alongside Ah Kee’s Shakespeare and Kipling-quoting text, Maynard uses sound to reach into the past. “Waranta Takamuna! was our opportunity to look at Launceston, this space, and what it means to Tasmanian Aboriginal people,” she says. The 10-minute audio loop passes through different time periods and emotions, from the early violence of the Black War (the brutal colonial genocide of First Nations people which took place in Tasmania in the 1800s) to waves of assimilation, as Maynard’s ancestors were removed to islands in the Bass Strait by authorities or abducted by sealers. We hear screams, tears and desperate pleas. And then, a campfire singalong of survival and community forged on those islands. “It’s not just a song – it’s a feeling,” Maynard says of Born On Old Cape Barren, sung by the late songman Uncle Ronnie Summer. Maynard herself performs the version heard in the square. “In one of the soundscapes I talk about how my heart was broken before I was even born, and pieces of it were left in all different places: one of them being Cape Barren Island, another being Launceston, Hobart, South Australia. Waranta Takamuna! is a love letter to the island, but it’s also a love letter to talking truth to the hardships of how we got there and how we got taken from there.” This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. The hills and plains between Launceston and Hobart also bear the mark of colonisation, its pre-invasion landscape cleared and replanted into pastoral vistas. In another installation for Mona Foma, metal silhouettes appear to the east as you drive down the Midland Highway – a woman with a child atop a golden hill, and violent scenes between colonisers and Aboriginal men. Trawlwoolway artist Julie Gough based these figures on a series of illustrated boards produced to accompany a 1828 proclamation by Lieutenant Governor George Arthur. Purporting to explain British justice to First Nations peoples and illiterate colonists alike, around 100 copies were painted and nailed to trees around the island. Today, in Gough’s installation The Missing, the images distill truths and fictions about its past in ways language cannot. “It’s not my artwork – it’s a government document that I’ve released again, like a reissue,” Gough says. “It’s coming back to create a bigger conversation across a landscape that has been absorbed and owned by newcomers, colonists, particularly since the 1820s. So in a way I’m subverting the government’s intended use of it to remind everyone whose country it is.” In an audio tour accompanying the route, Gough narrates the experience as we drive through the “epicentre of violence”, and the psychic and physical scars left upon the landscape. “Those figures are looking out at something that’s quite different to when they were first produced, as panels to be [nailed] on trees – there’s not that many trees down in the Midlands of the island now.” The silhouette of the woman and child might appear less violent than other figures in the series – but not to Gough. It’s from the first scene of the proclamation boards, depicting Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal men and women in European dress, with an Aboriginal woman holding a white child and vice versa. “That to me is incredibly violent, but it doesn’t appear violent,” she says. “It’s meant to be, ‘we’ll live happily ever after’, but we don’t know what happened to around 200 Aboriginal children taken by colonists up to the 1850s who were intended to become domestic and agricultural servants. Many of them are unaccounted for. We are the collateral damage of that, those of us that come from children who were living with colonists. One of my ancestors was such a child, Dalrymple Briggs, so that figure, of the woman and child, is close to my heart.” It’s something of a reclaiming, too. For over a decade, the route between Launceston and Hobart has been dotted with 16 silhouettes created by local artists Folko Kooper and Maureen Craig. Featuring convicts, soldiers, settlers and surveyors, they portray an Anglocentric view of the region’s folkloric history – something that had long troubled Gough. “They were a scratch I couldn’t itch,” she says. Gough and project curator Trudi Brinckman consulted Kooper and Craig before embarking on the project. “They were fully supportive of this new inclusion, for a more expansive dialogue and mentioned they had attempted all those years ago, to work with people, to come up with Aboriginal figures,” Gough says. “But it just wasn’t the time. “Now when I’m driving this highway and seeing those figures, I’m like, wow, we are tearing open that wound to be able to heal it better.” At the other end of the highway, another work by Maynard and Ah Kee – titled Warr! – will take over the Parliament House gardens for the festival’s Hobart leg. Following the controversy that engulfed Mona Foma’s winter counterpart Dark Mofo in the wake of Spanish artist Santiago Sierra’s ultimately cancelled Union Flag project, works like The Missing, Warr! and Waranta Takamuna! underscore the value of empowering Aboriginal artists to tell their own stories. Gough doesn’t know how long her figures will stay in place, and doesn’t mind either: “I hate the word permanent – it’s like the statues of colonial monsters in public parks. Let the landscape be permanent; let us humans work out how to be less so. Let nature be able to work on things.” Mona Foma 2022 continues in Hobart from 28-30 January.

1/27/2022,"Western Australian universities have “been thrown into chaos” by the decision to keep the state’s border closed, industry insiders say, with thousands of international students caught in limbo by the snap decision. The state was set to reopen its border to travellers without quarantine from 5 February, but at a late-night press conference last week the premier, Mark McGowan, announced that had been postponed due to the spread of the Omicron Covid variant.  The announcement has caused a furore in the university sector, which argues the decision means it will continue to bleed revenue while other states, which have open borders, scoop up enrolments from stranded students. At the end of 2021, more than 30% of all international students studying in Western Australia – just under 7,000 – remained outside the country. But the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) warned “hundreds” of students had already arrived in the country and were now stuck in the eastern states. Catriona Jackson, the chief executive of Universities Australia, said the state’s universities had worked hard in the lead up to 5 February to ensure a smooth transition. “Staff and students alike are understandably disappointed by the recent decision to indefinitely delay the planned reopening,” she said. “They deserve a concrete roadmap to plan their safe return to WA’s universities, just as their peers have had in other states and territories.” One staff member from a major university, who asked not to be named, said the decision had thrown the sector “into chaos”. “Teachers had their inboxes full with students panicked,” he said. “Many students were already on their way and are experiencing distress and dislocation. But perhaps even more significantly, why would any overseas student ever trust WA in the future as a study destination?” There were concerns among staff that because the sector would continue to lose revenue, it could result in job losses and cuts to research and courses. “The resulting impact on WA university funding is likely to be enormous,” the staff member said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It is difficult to estimate the exact financial impact of the border decision but published financial results show total operating revenue for the university sector declined by 5.0%, or $1.84bn, to $34.9bn in 2020. On top of this, international education contributed more than $1.2bn to the WA economy in 2019, compared to $1.046bn in 2020. Andre, who asked for his real name not to be used, had been studying at a WA university from his home in South Africa since 2020.

If it is rejected he will travel to Sydney with his partner, who is a doctor. He said he had tried to apply for universities in eastern states but it was hard to transfer the course work he had already done. “It’s just disappointing that you kind of get lured into a false promise that shouldn’t have been made.” Phil Honeywood, the CEO of IEAA, said because universities were “given an iron-clad promise by Mark McGowan” that overseas students would be allowed in, many of them had already arrived in the country. “Acting on this promise, they now have hundreds of students who have arrived in Sydney and Melbourne waiting to cross the state border,” Honeywood said. “There is no fallback plan from the state government as to what should be done with these now stranded young people.” He said the organisation was working with the Department of Home Affairs and had received assurances that course commencement dates would be extended for any student who had to stay in the eastern states until they could get into WA.

1/27/2022,"Fish grow slower when exposed to higher temperatures and a common chemical in plastic, according to new research. It suggests that a combination of plastic pollution and global heating could have concerning impacts on marine populations. Scientists at the University of Sydney have found that fish exposed to the industrial chemical bisphenol A – commonly known as BPA – require more energy to grow in high-temperature waters.  BPA is a common chemical used in plastics manufacturing and is known to disrupt hormone signalling, with impacts in marine animals on metabolism and growth. In humans, it has also been linked to reproductive and developmental dysfunction. Millions of tonnes of the compound are produced globally each year. The researchers exposed zebrafish to a level of BPA commonly found in waterways. They discovered that the chemical decreased the amount of energy the fish needed to grow at 24C, but hampered growth for those in 30C water – a temperature the animals would be likely to experience more often in their natural habitat under global heating. The study’s corresponding author, Frank Seebacher, a professor of biology at the University of Sydney, said the finding urgently highlighted the need for both climate change mitigation and plastic waste reduction. “The combination of high temperatures and BPA increases the energetic cost of growth – how much food animals have to eat to produce a given amount of biomass,” he said, adding the problem would be more pronounced for larger fish and predator species. “Because there’s a trophic cascade … [higher up the food chain] you’d expect to find fewer and smaller animals,” he said. “There’s a potential problem for sustainability in catch rates, if that combination [of warming and BPA] results in reduced stock.” Seebacher said BPA was released into the marine environment from manufacturing effluent as well as from plastics breaking down. “Wherever you have lots of manufacturing plants, lots of plastic pollution, you will find reasonably high levels of BPA,” he said, estimating such concentrations to be four to five times higher than the level used in their study. The researchers also modelled the risk of warming and plastic pollution in coastal areas in combination with current fishing intensity. Their analysis predicted that south-east Asia had the highest risk of decreased fish biomass as a result of warming and pollution. “Southern North America and northern South America [are also] going to be really affected,” Seebacher said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One limitation of their findings is that the team conducted the study in zebrafish, a small freshwater species commonly used as a model organism in scientific research. Seebacher said he expected the findings to be similar in other fish species, although more research would be needed to determine this for certain. “All the endocrine systems … are highly conserved amongst vertebrates, so it’s unlikely that you’d have a massive divergence among vertebrates in how they respond [to BPA], but the possibility exists and has to be verified,” he said. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",News/Environment,"Fish growth slowed by high temperatures and plastic chemical BPA, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/fish-growth-slowed-by-high-temperatures-and-plastic-chemical-bpa-research-shows
1/27/2022,"Sitting third in Group B, one point off second-place as the third phase of AFC World Cup qualification enters the home straight, the Socceroos find themselves walking a tightrope as they prepare for pivotal games against Vietnam and Oman. Not helping their precarious position is the absence of Graham Arnold who will miss at least the first of four crucial upcoming fixtures that will likely come to define perceptions of his coaching career. Wins against Vietnam in Melbourne on Thursday night and Oman next week, along with victories over Japan and Saudi Arabia in the next international window, would guarantee the Socceroos an automatic qualification slot for Qatar 2022 and avoid a sudden-death playoff against a South American nation. Alternatively, as unpalatable such a playoff is, a win over Oman, even in the event that wins over Japan and/or Saudi Arabia are not forthcoming in March, would go a long way to ensuring that the Socceroos would not suffer the ignominy of falling into fourth and missing out entirely.  Unfortunate as it is, Arnold’s diagnosis is nonetheless an apropos twist in the tale of this qualification cycle, which will be forever framed as the Covid campaign – the most logistically challenging any Australian side has ever been handed. Numerous players and staff have contracted the virus, rendering them both unavailable for individual windows and, for some players, left them with lingering effects that have hampered their fitness and form. With Australia’s borders shut and other nations introducing arduous quarantine requirements, the external effects of Covid have also led to various players at A-League Men clubs and figures such as Aaron Mooy withdrawing from consideration for selection. The border situation has also meant the Socceroos have been forced to stage all but one of their last 10 qualifiers outside Australia, robbing them of one of Asia’s strongest home-field advantages. Further, thanks to the side’s reliance on commercial airlines during a time of mass-flight cancellations and disrupted services, the team have often had little time together to train and prepare for games as a unit. A lack of flights from Qatar to Japan forced them to split into two separate travelling parties that arrived on separate days in between their 3-1 win over Oman and 2-1 loss to Japan. It has been a management nightmare. These are all mitigating factors that must be acknowledged, yet they do not fully explain the precipitous state in which the Socceroos find themselves. The off-field aspects do not help, but there are undeniable on-field foibles – aspects that Arnold as coach retains significant influence over – that have put the side at this crossroads. Whereas Australia have consistently seen more of the ball than almost every other AFC side in qualifying, their ability to consistently create high-quality, rather than simply high-volume, chances has remained a vexatious problem. An increasingly blunt attack has relied heavily upon the likes of Tom Rogić and Ajdin Hrustić to provide a creative spark and in the absence of immediate breakthroughs or moments of magic from that duo, conservatism in approach and an over-reliance on speculative crosses and set pieces have come to the fore. In the Socceroos’ last fixture – an arduous 1-1 draw against China – Arnold’s side had 65% of possession but could only muster the same amount of shots and had fewer attempted dribbles than their foes. They did, however, cross the ball 34 times. These issues have been present since they returned to action but, given that most were exhibited during an 11-game winning streak largely against weaker opposition, there was a prevailing lack of appetite amongst the Australian footballing zeitgeist to properly confront them. The motivations not to look a gift horse in the mouth or not judge the national team too hard in a time of hardship are obvious. But there is now the possibility that reality may bite at the most crucial of junctures. In recent months, as concerns have grown, Arnold has, not unfairly, consistently pointed to the challenges his side have been forced to overcome on the road Qatar. He proclaims his side will still qualify, but there is an air that the under-pressure coach’s famed veneer of impervious belief is wearing thin. He has also been quick to clarify his view that his career will not be defined by what happens in the coming months, and has spoken of the developmental aspects of his role as both Socceroos and Olyroos coach. Yet, now in his second stint as Socceroos boss, his legacy in the eyes of many rests on the upcoming games. The 58-year-old has been working with a handicap, but any Australia coach’s tenure will always be defined by their ability to deliver World Cup qualification.

Under the program 6.6m concession card holders in Australia can access up to 10 free RATs over a three month period, but the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has told the Guardian the scheme leads to a loss for individual chemists.  The shortage of tests across the country has driven up wholesale prices. The tests currently cost the pharmacies up to $17.50 each but the government is providing only a $10 reimbursement, the guild said. Prof Trent Twomey, the national president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, said while wholesale prices have increased, there hasn’t been a subsequent adjustment to the reimbursement. “The reimbursed price set by the government has clearly been calculated on the wholesale cost of the tests around early December. The wholesale prices have gone up because of the demand, and distributors are chartering jets to bring the product in, and then employing staff at weekends and on overtime to process orders which are dispatched by express courier services. “They are also competing with overseas markets for the product,” he said. “All of these factors come at a cost which is passed along in wholesale prices to pharmacists.” Twomey said some pharmacies have struggled to afford tests under the concession scheme. “If the government wants to improve accessibility they can improve the timeframe they reimburse pharmacies. At the moment the government won’t be making the first payments until the end of February.” “Many small pharmacies can’t afford to wait this long.” The guild has established a Rapid Antigen Test finder for concession card holders which lists local pharmacies that have tests in stock. The site initially struggled under the demand, but Twomey said it has since stabilised and is available to use. Ian Yates, the chief executive of the charity Council on the Ageing Australia (COTA Australia), said that pensioners had found access to the tests a “mixed bag”. “What we are seeing is that some people have been able to obtain the RATs without difficulty and others are having trouble. It varies from area to area. “We understand both from the government and the pharmacy guild that some areas have reasonable supplies and others are struggling and waiting on supplies,” he said. “We do have an overall concern that there’s not enough RATs for aged care, and at-home care, and the concession scheme, but we know they’re coming.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The federal government has previously indicated that testing supplies will improve in the coming weeks, with 16m tests expected to arrive at pharmacies before the end of January. But Dr Cassandra Goldie, the CEO of the Australian Council of Social Service, said she was “deeply concerned” at the current state of stock. “People are telling us that getting RATs continues to be a massive problem – free or paid,” she said. “The biggest problem is that chemists are out of stock. We haven’t heard directly from anyone who was able to get a free rapid antigen testing kit; mostly people’s experience is that the chemists near them have signs out saying they are sold out. “This is consistent with what pharmacies are reporting – and only 900 out of 6,000 pharmacies signed up to the program.” Goldie says the shortage of tests and the lack of access has resulted in many concession card holders – some of the most vulnerable people in the country – having to remain isolated at home. “People on $45/day can’t waste money travelling around looking farther afield for chemists. They can’t afford to run a car or go through their precious petrol. “People tell us they are feeling forgotten and fed up. The lack of accessible and free RATs is forcing people to stay home and stay isolated.” The tests provide a means for vulnerable communities to ensure their safety, as well as those of their families and carers, allowing people to protect their incomes. Acoss is calling on the government to establish a Covid Rapid Response Group that would include unions, businesses and public health experts to help coordinate the pandemic response. “The federal government must acknowledge that supply is an ongoing problem and ensure there are enough free RATs readily available for people with concession cards so that people can easily access tests,” Goldie said.",News/Australia news,Australian pharmacies take a loss under government scheme for concession card holders as RAT prices skyrocket,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/australian-pharmacies-take-a-loss-under-government-scheme-for-concession-card-holders-as-rat-prices-skyrocket
1/27/2022,"A world-first shipment of liquid hydrogen from Australia was declared momentous – a pivotal moment as the world clambers for clean liquid fuels to bring global greenhouse gas emissions to zero Prime minister Scott Morrison said the consignment – loaded on to a purpose-built Japanese ship at the Port of Hastings in Victoria – marked the beginning of a new clean energy export industry for Australia.  Despite the celebratory fanfare and two government ministers at the port for a photo-op, the reality is something different. Experts say the climate credentials of the technology being used to produce the hydrogen – using brown coal – are highly questionable. “The project’s current configuration is not clean. In fact, it is incredibly dirty,” said Kobad Bhavnagri, head of industrial decarbonisation at Bloomberg NEF. So what is actually happening? The Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) project is a $500m pilot that launched in 2018. The Australian government has given $57m to the project so far. This week the Suiso Frontier will depart Victoria with the first load of super-cooled liquid hydrogen ever to be transported by sea. Temperature Check asked how much hydrogen was loaded, but HESC didn’t respond. A fact sheet has said the pilot phase would produce up to three tonnes (global demand for hydrogen is currently about 90 million tonnes). Energy minister Angus Taylor said the shipment demonstrated the project could be “a major source of clean energy”. Both the government and HESC said a commercial phase of the project would produce 225,000 tonnes of “carbon neutral” hydrogen a year. Even if the project backers decide to move to a commercial phase (and that is a huge if), studies show hydrogen produced using the same method would be dirtier than if it was produced from gas and much dirtier than making hydrogen from renewables. The HESC consortium of five Japanese companies, together with AGL, won’t decide to go ahead with a commercial scale operation until an assessment of the pilot phase, expected to be complete next year. To bring emissions down, HESC says a commercial operation would capture CO2 released during one of the stages of production (the gasification phase carried out in the Latrobe Valley) and then use the Victorian government’s CarbonNet project to store the CO2. But the CarbonNet project – which is targeting potential geological formations off the Victorian coast – doesn’t yet exist and, if it does go ahead, the Victorian government says it won’t start operating until the end of this decade. All of this raises the prospect of coal-based hydrogen – which the Morrison government is happy to describe as “clean” – hitting a global market at a time when some analysts believe it will be already priced out by zero-emissions hydrogen derived from renewable energy. Bhavnagri told Temperature Check he doubts using coal to make hydrogen could have any commercial success. He said assuming the project could capture and store a significant amount of CO2, the carbon footprint of the hydrogen would still be higher than producing hydrogen from gas with CCS and “much higher than producing it from renewables”. “If it’s more complex and more costly and more polluting than making hydrogen from renewables, why would you do it?” A quick hydrogen production 101 might help here. There are broadly three ways hydrogen is being produced. One uses steam to separate hydrogen from “natural” gas. Another uses oxygen and coal under high pressures. A third passes electricity through water in an electrolyser, producing hydrogen and “waste” oxygen. The first two methods generate high levels of CO2 – more than if you just burned the fossil fuel. But that pollution can potentially be lowered if the CO2 can be captured and stored. The electrolysis method can produce genuinely clean hydrogen with almost no emissions if the electricity comes from renewables. The HESC pilot used the coal gasification method and is proposing to add carbon capture and storage if moved to a commercial scale. A pilot coal gasification and refining plant has been built at Loy Yang and a demonstration plant to cool the hydrogen was built at the port. Dr Fiona Beck, an expert on the nascent hydrogen industry as a way to cut emissions, says there is no agreed definition for “clean” hydrogen. But she says turning fossil fuels into hydrogen is always going to be dirtier than using renewable energy. In a study published late last year, Beck and colleagues at the Australian National University compared the amount of CO2 released when hydrogen is produced using different methods. Using the same approach as is proposed for the HESC project, hydrogen from brown coal would release 40kg of CO2 for each unit of energy (a gigajoule). Beck says hydrogen with those levels of emissions would be too dirty to be considered “low carbon” under a Europe-based certification scheme for hydrogen. Crucially, that level of emissions also presumes 90% of the CO2 released from the brown coal during the gasification phase can be captured and permanently stored. Beck says: “That’s very ambitious and while it’s theoretically possible, there is no large-scale commercial plant to have demonstrated anywhere near that sort of capture rate.” She says one positive aspect of the trial is the development of a ship that can carry liquid hydrogen. “It’s important to get the ship and also the port facilities working, even on a pilot scale,” she said. The ship is also a trial version, with a tank installed that can carry 1,250 cubic metres of hydrogen that’s cooled to -253C. Cooling the gas turns it into a liquid that is then one 800th of its original volume. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has said a commercial-size ship it wants to build would have a 160,000 cubic metre capacity – about 120 times bigger than the ship that docked at Port of Hastings. Among this sea of uncertainty around the project was one statistic repeated in the government’s media release and from the project itself. If the HESC project did move to a commercial phase, it could produce 225,000 tonnes of “carbon neutral liquefied hydrogen” annually that would “help reduce global emissions by around 1.8 million tonnes per year.” Greenhouse gas emissions from producing hydrogen from coal are generated all the way along the supply chain – from the mining of the coal, to gasification, trucking, liquifaction and shipping. Temperature Check asked HESC to explain how the hydrogen would be “carbon neutral” and which steps in the supply chain would be included, but details were not provided. This column also asked the office of Angus Taylor what the estimated savings were based on, but did not receive a response before publishing. But in any case, should we be impressed by an annual saving of 1.8m tonnes of CO2? The gasification of the coal and the refining of the hydrogen is taking place at a facility next door to AGL’s Loy Yang coal power station in the Latrobe Valley. According to the Clean Energy Regulator, that power station is currently emitting 16.9m tonnes of CO2 a year. So the power station emits more than nine times as much CO2 as the HESC project says it might save each year if it goes ahead. A HESC statement said using Latrobe Valley coal with CCS at scale and improvements to the liquefaction process, “should have a significant cost and scale advantage over hydrogen produced with electrolysis.” The statement said “biomass” was blended with coal to increase the purity of the hydrogen, but when asked, HESC did not say what that biomass was. “The HESC pilot has furthered Australia’s knowledge of hydrogen production, liquefaction, storage and transport. This technical knowledge, and the infrastructure from a commercial scale HESC project, paves the way for future hydrogen projects of all types as part of Australia’s transition to lower emissions. “The next phase for the project is to examine in detail all elements of the HESC pilot. This analysis will determine a potential path to commercialisation and is anticipated to continue through to mid 2023.” In an editorial, the Australian Financial Review declared the hydrogen shipment an “important milestone” and an occasion that “may prove as important” to the country’s prosperity as its first shipment of iron ore in the 1960s. But the newspaper made a declaration that making hydrogen from coal or gas with the emissions either captured or offset “is currently the only technological [sic] possible and cost-effective method of hydrogen production.” Really? Hydrogen is already being produced using electrolysers powered by renewable energy. Remembering the HESC plan for “clean hydrogen” relies on a CCS project that doesn’t yet exist and may not start operations until 2030, the International Energy Agency says right now electrolysers “have reached enough maturity to scale up manufacturing and deployment to significantly reduce costs”. There was record deployments of electrolysers in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The IEA has put the current cost per kg of hydrogen using coal with CCS at between US$2.13 and $2.63. Using electrolysers, the IEA has put current costs in a range between US$2.35 and $6.38. Analysis from BNEF predicts that by 2030, the cost of hydrogen from renewables could be as low as $1 per kg.",News/Environment,Coal-based liquid hydrogen pivotal for green energy?

1/27/2022,"The latest Australian inflation figures showing strong prices growth in the past six months have once again put interest rate rises into the frame. A rate rise during a May election campaign is raised as a possibility, but the Reserve Bank might be a lot less willing to move than speculators believe. This year, inflation has been all the economic rage. In America, questions about it led to US president Biden referring to a Fox News journalist as a “dumb son of a bitch” while here in Australia we are at a point where, if the market is to be believed, a rate rise could occur by May.  Tuesday’s consumer price index figures showed prices grew by 1.3% in the last three months of 2021, and 3.5% through the whole year. Underlying inflation – which the Reserve Bank is more concerned about when it comes to setting interest rates – at 2.6% was nicely within the RBA’s target band of 2%-3%: If the graph does not display please click here As a result, the market now expects the Reserve Bank to raise the cash rate to 0.25% by May and up to 1% by the end of the year: If the graph does not display please click here But whether the Reserve Bank will actually increase rates is something a bit more complicated than just hoping money market speculators have got it right. Mostly it comes down to whether inflation needs to be tempered, and whether raising interest rates will do anything to temper that inflation. You can see why economists around the world are rather fixated on inflation at the moment. In the US prices rose in 2021 by 6.7% – and US prices often lead the rest of the world, including Australia: If the graph does not display please click here A key reason is items such as oil. Petrol prices were a major contributor to overall inflation. Since the start of the pandemic, petrol prices have risen around 70%: If the graph does not display please click here That is overwhelmingly driven by the world oil price: If the graph does not display please click here Nothing the RBA does with the cash rate will affect how much we pay for petrol. But then there are house prices. These were also a big contributor to price rises both in the December quarter and throughout 2021: If the graph does not display please click here Here the Reserve Bank can definitely influence prices. But as I noted earlier this month, housing finance has already come off the boil. It might be the case that raising the cash rate now would do little to influence house prices given the withdrawal of stimulus measures designed to prop up the housing market, such as the homebuilder program, is already doing that. And while house prices do need to be tempered, the RBA has more tools at its disposal than just interest rates. Together with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) it can further tighten lending standards, it can end its bond buying program and it can also give guidance about a change in approach that can attempt to “talk down” the market. Because, while house prices have gone mad, rather interestingly the annual growth of “non-tradable” items (those items not influenced by international prices) actually fell in the December quarter from 3.2% to 2.8%. They are now well down on the June 2021 quarter peak of 4%: If the graph does not display please click here This matters because since 2000, the Reserve Bank has only once raised the cash rate in a period when non-tradable items rose by less than 3% – and that was straight after the GFC. Given the price growth of these items is actually falling, that suggests there is little need for the RBA to hit the brakes. Similarly, out of the 88 sub-groups in the CPI basket, only around 30% are growing by more than 3% annually – that is well below the level we saw before the GFC when the RBA was hiking rates: If the graph does not display please click here But all of this ignores the big factor that is driving inflation: supply blockages. Anyone who has bought something from overseas, tried to buy a new car, or even hoped to buy meat at a supermarket, knows what I am talking about. Inflation is driven by two things: increased demand – more people wanting to buy something – and reduced supply – less availability of a thing the people want to buy. If overly strong demand is the problem, then raising interest rates makes sense; if it is a lack of supply, then raising interest rates might just reduce a demand that is not actually all that strong. For this a better guide is not prices but wages. And here we would be well served to actually listen to what the RBA says. In the minutes of its December board meeting, the board concluded it “will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3% target range. This will require the labour market to be tight enough to generate wages growth that is materially higher than it is currently.” “This,” the board concluded, “is likely to take some time and the board is prepared to be patient.” Until wages are growing by at least at 3% we probably should not get too excited about possible rate rises.",News/Business,The market thinks rates are about to go up because of inflation.

1/27/2022,"There’s something about that red dot. The ping. That little shudder of your phone. All those tiny, quiet gestures which together, form a cacophony, making your phone screech: “Something happened. Look at me! Right now! And then again! And sometime later! But still soon! Really soon! OK? OK?” Australians in 2020 spent, on average, an hour and 46 minutes a day on social media. That, according to my rudimentary calculations, is equivalent to more than 26 days a year on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, et al. This, I’d suggest, is too many days.  I say this from a place of experience, not judgment. The ease of opening up Instagram’s mottled icon or Facebook’s austere blue square was beyond my ability to resist. And after spending time on the apps, I’d leave no wiser, healthier or happier. I gained nothing from this time. I lost too many days. Yet I’d return, again and again. Research last year showed that half of Australians had gone off social media at some point – possibly due to its time-sucking joylessness. But also possibly for the myriad other problems social media use is associated with that we keep finding more of every year. Going off social media, however, a was not an option for me. Facebook in particular is where birthday parties are organised (and cancelled), or where friends announce they’ve got Covid. It is how I keep track of who has procreated. Some friends occasionally share beautiful updates on Instagram that I enjoy. The problem wasn’t social media necessarily, but how and when I used it. The vast bulk of traffic to social media sites comes from our mobile phones – from our couches, our bedsides, our commutes, when we have them. So, I figured, what if I removed the convenience? Would my social media use become less frequent? Less mindless? Less … compulsive? Yes. I took social media apps off my phone, and took back precious minutes, hours, days of my life. It takes almost no effort – just hover over the app and press ‘uninstall’. Then – blip! – it’s gone. No more red dots, no more pings. For a more thorough cleanse, you might want to log out of your browser version of the sites too, so every compulsive check triggers an annoying log-in process. I still access Facebook perhaps twice a week on a laptop, but leave quickly, caught up and surprised at how little I missed between days. I’ll sign into Instagram on my phone about the same amount. Before logging on, which takes relatively more effort, I have to ask myself a critical question: “Why am I doing this?” Which, in the end, is not a bad place to start.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: delete your social media apps and claw back precious days of your life,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/27/easy-wins-delete-your-social-media-apps-and-claw-back-precious-days-of-your-life
1/27/2022,"The Morrison government has tipped an extra $2bn into the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) with critics concerned the funds could be spent supporting fossil fuel projects. The northern Australia minister, David Littleproud, when announcing the $2bn cash injection on Tuesday did not rule out Naif using it for the development of the Beetaloo gas basin.  The Greens and the Australia Institute have called for rule changes to prevent the Naif being used for fossil fuel projects. Labor has criticised the fund’s track record of having spent less than 10% of its initial $5bn but has not supported changing the rules. Littleproud said $3.2bn had already been committed to projects and the extra $2bn would continue investment “across all sectors, from mining and agriculture to renewable energy, education and tourism”. The Naif has come under fire over its governance arrangements which include a ministerial veto on projects, controversially used in May to nix a $280m windfarm and battery project in northern Queensland. Rod Campbell, the research director at the Australia Institute, said “the idea of more money to develop northern Australia isn’t a bad idea” but Naif “hasn’t really demonstrated that they have a capacity to put this money to good use in the past five years or so”. “Naif has shown itself to be very supportive of fossil industries,” he said, citing $300m for the Darwin ship lift and $16.8m for the Onslow marine support base, both of which support the oil and gas industries. Littleproud gained responsibility for Naif in a July 2021 reshuffle but before that it was overseen by Keith Pitt, who is still the resources minister and has called for a $250bn loan facility to underwrite fossil fuel financing and insurance. The Greens senator Larissa Waters said the Naif was “little more than a slush fund for coal and gas corporations”. “The last thing northern Australia or the rest of the country needs is the government stuffing another $2bn into the pockets of multinational climate-wreckers,” she told Guardian Australia. “There are incredible opportunities to fund sustainable, job-creating projects in northern Australia, but Morrison never misses an opportunity to give public money to his fossil fuel mates.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Waters took aim at Labor and the Coalition for blocking the Greens’ attempt to stop Naif being used for coal and gas – suggesting this would be a key demand if her party held the balance of power after the election. Labor’s shadow minister for northern Australia, Murray Watt, said that “while funding has been ‘committed’ for a raft of projects, the most recent government figures show that only $427.6m has hit the ground to create jobs and build projects across our north”. “It’s no wonder the Naif is better known as the ‘No Actual Infrastructure Fund’ in the north,” Watt said. “How can we believe the government will spend $2bn more when it’s spent less than a quarter of that in seven years?” On Tuesday, Littleproud explained that less had been spent than committed because applicants must “use their own money first before they use Australian taxpayers’” money.

He also noted the four “corridors of growth” identified by the government were mining, agriculture, tourism and defence. Littleproud said there would be no “discriminating” about which states projects were located in because “Naif will not make a decision predicated on an election because it’s independent of the government”.",News/Australia news,Morrison government urged to stop using northern Australia fund for fossil fuel projects,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/morrison-government-urged-to-stop-using-northern-australia-fund-for-fossil-fuel-projects
1/27/2022,"Three Coalition senators have joined growing calls from the crossbench and Labor to hold a royal commission or similar inquiry into Australia’s Covid pandemic response. Nationals Matt Canavan and Sam McMahon and Liberal Gerard Rennick – three of the five Coalition senators who crossed the floor to vote against vaccination mandates – have backed the idea, which also received in-principle support from the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese.  Last week the independent senator Rex Patrick wrote to the prime minister asking him to consider establishing a commission before he calls the 2022 election and to set aside money for it in the budget. The independent MP Zali Steggall is already working on draft terms of reference. Patrick and Steggall’s call for the work to begin pre-election puts them ahead of the curve, but support across the political spectrum is broad, including Labor, Coalition dissidents, independents and One Nation. Canavan told Guardian Australia “we need a full and comprehensive inquiry but I think that needs to wait until the pandemic is over”. Canavan said he was “not fussed” about the form of inquiry “providing it has the appropriate power to take evidence from all levels of government, not just the commonwealth, given how involved the states have been with the coronavirus response”. Rennick, who has vowed to continue to withhold support for government legislation over the pandemic response, told Guardian Australia there “definitely needs to be a review into the way everything happened”. He cited his concerns about the compensation scheme for vaccine injuries and the approval process for children’s vaccines, which health authorities have said are both safe and effective. “It needs to look at the roles and responsibilities of state and federal government as well – the blame game needs to end,” Rennick said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesman for McMahon, who lost her preselection to Liberal Jacinta Price and has been approached to defect to the Liberal Democrats, confirmed she also backed a royal commission. On Tuesday Albanese said “an assessment” of the Covid response would be appropriate after “the heat of the pandemic” had passed. “Whether that be a royal commission or some form of inquiry, that will need to happen,” he told the National Press Club. Labor’s Katy Gallagher, who chairs the Senate’s Covid committee and has accused the government of obstructing its access to information, said on Wednesday “at the right point in time … there will have to be some assessment of all of the decisions taken”, including $337bn in spending. On 19 January, Patrick wrote to Scott Morrison arguing it would be “extraordinary” if a royal commission weren’t called, asking him to consult Labor, the states and territories on terms of reference. He noted that despite the successes of the pandemic response, there had been extensive criticism of the “implementation of border controls and quarantine measures, the procurement and distribution of vaccines, the extent and duration of economic support measures, implementation of support for the aged care sector, and the acquisition and availability of rapid antigen tests”.

Independent MP Helen Haines said the next parliament should “ensure an independent and thorough inquiry”. She noted that in 2020 she and other crossbenchers had pushed for a joint select committee which, unlike the Senate committee, would have been able to compel ministers from the lower house to appear. Pauline Hanson voiced her support for a royal commission at the Prayer and Pushback event earlier in January, claiming without evidence that Australians had been “lied to with the number of deaths” caused by Covid-19. The Labor MPs Julian Hill, Anika Wells, Patrick Gorman and Anne Aly went public with their support for a royal commission in August. Hill told Guardian Australia “clearly there will need to be a properly constituted thoughtful inquiry – not as a political witch-hunt – but to learn the lessons of this pandemic for future generations”. “It could start to be thought about over the next few months but it’s still premature still to kick it off – it can be dealt with after the election.” The independent senator Jacqui Lambie was open to the idea but agreed it was too soon. “You don’t read the entrails while the chicken’s still clucking,” she said. Patrick said the date of the election had “no relevance” to when a royal commission was called and that some elements of the pandemic response had “by and large concluded” and can be studied now – such as business support, and the international border controls. “We don’t know when the pandemic will end,” he said, suggesting that there were lessons that could be learned now that “may be useful moving forward”, such as how to handle outbreaks in aged care. In August when asked about the former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott’s call for a Covid royal commission, Morrison said he would not be “drawn into those things” because “we’re managing the pandemic right now, and this pandemic still has quite a long way to go”. “So I’m sure at some time in the future there’ll be a time to talk about those reviews or whatever form they might take,” he said.",News/Australia news,Coalition senators join growing calls for inquiry into Australia’s Covid response,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/coalition-senators-join-growing-calls-for-inquiry-into-australias-covid-response
1/27/2022,"“Get out of my way, it’s a code brown.” “What’s a code brown?”  “You can smell it.” Doctors of my generation grew up with a code brown that signalled an unfortunate case of faecal incontinence. The odour from the patient’s soiled clothes would engulf the ward only to be swiftly overpowered by the pungent hospital grade “air freshener”. The hassled nurse scurried in with glove and gown while doctors continued their rounds. Out of respect for the poor patient, everyone acted completely unbothered. Last week, those same doctors and nurses witnessed the arrival of a real code brown in Victoria, an emergency alert usually reserved for mass casualties. In the face of rising Covid cases, the announcement aims to ease the burden on health services by streamlining systems and redeploying staff to serve the most critical patients. When the code takes effect, I am in clinic, doing what I have done for the last 20 years – seeing cancer patients. The past two years have been a nervous time, but some things have stayed the same. New discoveries have worked at keeping more people well for longer. Important surgeries have eased suffering. Vulnerable patients have defied prediction and lived to see another day. Gratitude and resilience haven’t receded from fashion. Most of all, healthcare workers, from cleaner to consultant, have regarded their work as a mission and kept going. But with an enduring pandemic now underlined with a code brown, the mood has changed. Physical exhaustion is remediable with rest but moral distress clings to you. I receive an email “just letting you know” that a chemotherapy patient is still awaiting an urgent appointment. The details of one high-risk patient blur with another, my heart falters. In quick succession, my anxiety switches from the patient and the relatives to my duty of care and the nurse who needs my help to do her job safely. I squeeze in that patient but what about all the others? Who is advocating for them? What if they die from avoidable causes? It’s enough to lose sleep over. Patients’ calls for help are increasingly desperate. When can they see a doctor? Will that doctor know their history? Does it matter that their scan is delayed? These questions aren’t new but after two years of interrupted care, they have taken on a new urgency. And with thousands of professionals away, no one is making bold commitments about timely or ideal patient care. Where once we pulled strings for our neediest patients, we are now reduced to worrying with them and apologising for our impotence. For doctors who have long harnessed their privileged position in the healthcare system for public good, this new lack of agency is an especially bitter pill to swallow. A code brown entails moving staff at short notice. Taking a cue from another oncologist, I try preparing one of my oldest patients. “Listen, if you come back next month and I am not here, don’t worry because our discussions are on the computer, and you can use a phone interpreter.” Some years ago, I told her she had months to live. Then she responded to a new drug but is convinced that I personally vanquished her disease. “If you go, I will follow you.” “It doesn’t work like that.” “I will empty my bank account to see you,” pleads her husband. “It’s not about money,” I say, embarrassed. “Then what are you hiding?” I am hiding nothing – indeed, our dilemma is in plain sight. We see patients not knowing when we might get sick, furloughed or redeployed. Overnight, we discover that a ward has been closed or a theatre list cancelled. We are encouraging patients to stay at home, suspecting that it may not be the best place for them but hoping that home beats being in a tense hospital with limited staff and no visitors. In the grip of a code brown, the wheels of healthcare continue to turn but every turn feels unsettling. We know that the true cost of the pandemic cannot be counted only by lives lost or dollars spent. For providers, the true cost includes the countless calls we made that didn’t feel quite right, the ethical dilemmas we grappled with, and the nagging thought that in a chain of decisions, the one we took personally helped or harmed someone. This daily moral reckoning we share with our colleagues around the world is the hardest work of all. And still, amid the gloom there are embers of optimism because those who serve patients are generally committed and resilient and already thinking about the next challenge. The code might have brought us to our knees, but it is also a chance to rethink medicine. Aspects of the healthcare system struggled because they were never robust – and while it is easy to invoke a lack of funding for every problem, we must also consider a failure of vision and planning. The pandemic may have been unforeseen but not so an ageing nation, a highly multicultural population with mixed needs, poor health literacy, scientifically naïve politicians, hierarchies that allow managers to overrule clinicians, and most importantly, a chronically poor nexus between community and hospital-based care. If we didn’t anticipate all these problems coming to a head together, we must never have an excuse again. The big picture of healthcare demands constant attention and background planning that is not the stuff of headlines but vital to good outcomes. Case numbers may have peaked and this emergency will eventually expire. One day in the future, a seasoned nurse will announce a code brown and a young doctor will grow pale at the memory of disturbance and dislocation. Someone will smile and say, “No, it’s not that kind of code brown.” We will relax, hold our noses, and keep going.",Opinion/Opinion,"In the grip of a code brown, the mood has changed for health providers – and it’s unsettling | Ranjana Srivastava",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/in-the-grip-of-a-code-brown-the-mood-has-changed-for-health-providers-and-its-unsettling
1/27/2022,"Subsidence from an underground coalmine is leading to extensive surface cracking in a supposedly protected region of New South Wales, stoking locals’ fears that rare rock formations could end up as rubble. Centennial Coal officials are scheduled to meet government regulators on Thursday to discuss remediation for the extensive fracturing of stunning weathered sandstone shapes and cliffs within the 3,650 hectare Mugii Murum-Ban state conservation area, near Capertee, north-west of Sydney. The miner concedes the cracks exceed permitted levels.  Repairing the damage “is very hard”, said Mary Thirlwall, a resident involved in landcare who has helped raise the alarm. “You can’t jack up a mountain, you know, or fill in the cracks really that easily.” Whether Centennial receives any penalty for breaching the terms of its planning approval for the Mount Airly mine is being watched closely by conservation groups. Its many unusual rocks have been described as the “three hundred sisters”, echoing the more famous “three sisters” at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. The nearby Gardens of Stone, a larger area of the remarkable, pagoda-like structures, was granted similar state conservation status last November. It too has had coalmining underneath and faces other development threats if tourism projects take off. Centennial has been approved to mine in the Mount Airly region out to 2037. The next stage within the Mugii Murum-Ban area would be to extract coal under the adjacent Genowlan mesa, an even larger rocky landscape that could be more vulnerable to cliff collapses if there is similar fracturing as that at Mount Airly, according to Thirlwall. “Airly and Genowlan are just iconic mesas,” she said. “It’s just a very special area.” A visit last weekend to explore for fractures found extensive fresh cracks, many of them marked out by equipment set up to monitor subsidence impacts after coal had been removed from seams about 300m below. Some of the fractures extended dozens if not 100m or more, splitting huge boulders and also more delicate rock features. “It’s scary how high we are above the mine, and it’s still cracking,” said Yuri Bolotin, a leading Blue Mountains and Wollemi conservationist and author of many guides, including a newly published one on Mugii Murum-Ban, A Bushwalking Paradise. “This whole thing could come down, and become a pile of rubble,” he said, standing in front of extensive cracks that had working their way up an entire cliff. Bolotin had stumbled across some of the cracks in early January during a regular bushwalk with friends to take in the beautiful scenery. “Here’s a crack that wasn’t on my agenda,” he said, finding a new one during last weekend’s visit. “Imagine if we spent a whole day here.” Walking trails were signposted but there were no warning signs alerting walkers of the dangers of fractured rocks or the potential for more sinkholes forming. Two areas off one fire track were fenced off with orange plastic mesh. These spots contained deep, long sinkholes, one of them apparently at least four metres deep. A single paper sign, found on the ground near the main track, stated that the Airly Subsidence Monitoring Program was collecting “adequate pre-mining baseline data”, as well as ongoing measuring of changes. Centennial itself has not disputed the cracks were caused by its longwall mining to remove panels of coal in the 1.8m tonne a year operation. It also accepts the fractures far exceed the consent condition that requires surface subsidence be limited to 125mm. Cracking damage associated with the above mine subsidence has been measured as up to 700mm wide and 3m deep, according to the Blue Mountains Conservation Society. “Centennial became aware of an exceedance at its Airly mine in January 2020 and subsequently notified all stakeholders, including the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE),” a spokesperson for Centennial said. “Centennial’s Airly Community Consultative Committee (CCC) has been briefed on this issue and has been kept updated throughout.” That committee, though, is not scheduled to meet until April, one member said. “Centennial has undertaken a review of Airly’s mine design and installed a 60-metre wide maingate pillar to prevent future subsidence incidents,” the official said. “Moving forward, Airly mine designs will be based on assessments undertaken by SCT Operations, an independent specialist geotechnology consultancy.” A spokesperson for the parks service said the division would work with the NSW resources regulator and the company “with a view to ensuring all appropriate measures are taken to prevent and remediate damage in accordance with conditions of approval”. Guardian Australia approached the new environment minister, James Griffin, and the resource minister and deputy premier, Paul Toole, for comment. In a letter to the government earlier this month, the Blue Mountains Conservation Society appealed for greater protection of an area that contains hundreds of pagoda rock formations and is home to rare and threatened species. The Planning Assessment Committee (PAC) in its 2016 approval for Airly mine extension recognised the area as having “spectacular geodiversity with majestic cliffs and rock formations that are considered highly significant and delight the local community and visitors alike”, the letter noted. A repeat of the damage to Genowlan could be devastating for its pagoda-studded ridge lines and the fact it contains the only known population of the critically endangered Genowlan Point subspecies of Pultanaea, with just 15 known plants, it cited the committee as saying. “Alteration of habitat following subsidence due to longwall mining … [is] a key threat to the species,” the approval consent noted. The NSW independent MP Justin Field said it was time to consider whether mining could coexist with state conservation areas. “Time and again we see mining conditions are breached or are found to be inadequate after the damage is done to sensitive landscapes and waterways,” Field said. “It raises serious questions about the ability of the planning system to identify and manage mining risks in state conservation areas.”",News/Australia news,‘It’s cracking’: fear rare rock formations at risk from NSW coalmine,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/its-cracking-fear-rare-rock-formations-at-risk-from-nsw-coalmine
1/27/2022,"“I think it’s real,” Curtin University student Tyrone O’Doherty told his supervisors when he spotted the anomaly. And it was real, as it turns out. The object beaming out from space was also “spooky”, and “in our galactic back yard”.  An Australian team studying the universe’s radio waves has discovered a new type of beam that comes and goes, one of the brightest radio sources in the sky. The details of the discovery were published in Nature on Thursday. When something in space switches on and off it’s called a “transient”. It might come from a pulsar, which flashes on and off in milliseconds or seconds. Or a supernova that might appear for a few days before disappearing again. “What we found, though, is something that switches on and off every 20 minutes,” astrophysicist Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker said. “It was kind of spooky for an astronomer because there’s nothing known in the sky that does that. And it’s really quite close to us – about 4,000 light years away. It’s in our galactic backyard.” Hurley-Walker is from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research’s Curtin University node. She was also O’Doherty’s supervisor, and the lead author on the Nature article. She uses the Murchison Widefield Array in outback Western Australia, a radio telescope, to survey the sky. For his honours thesis, O’Doherty joined her team and had created some coding software to search through data for transients. “He found something,” she said. Pictures from the array show the Milky Way, with a bright dot marking the location of the object. “Just to the right, there’s a source that is a supermassive black hole, throwing jets of radio waves into space at nearly the speed of light. “Admittedly, it’s further away. But this radio transient that we saw is about as bright as that. So that’s really extreme. And we did not expect to find anything so bright.” Using the frequencies of the radio waves, she worked out the object is not very far away – as space goes. Its behaviour matches something that has been predicted to exist, but never observed – an “ultra-long period magnetar”, a type of slowly spinning neutron star. Or it could be that a collapsed star became a white dwarf pulsar, but that is very unlikely. Whatever it is, it’s “really extreme physics”, Hurley-Walker said. “And, of course, it could be something that we’ve never even thought of.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For O’Doherty, creating the software was the thesis – actually using it to find the object was a bonus. “In the closing weeks of the project I was going through them to see if I had anything real … I found this one candidate that looked real at first,” said O’Doherty, who is now doing his PhD. “I kept doing more and more tests and it kept continuing to appear real, which was awesome. Then I detected it again. I 100% confirmed it was real and not just a one-off thing.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Hurley-Walker said the mission was now to try to find more of the objects. Meanwhile, the world’s largest radio telescope is being built, with the low-frequency part of it destined for the WA desert. That will mean far more data and more discoveries. “We will be making new discoveries, things we didn’t predict, all the time,” Hurley-Walker said. “The universe is full of wonders.”",News/Australia news,Australian scientists discover ‘spooky’ object beaming out from space that flashes on and off,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/australian-scientists-discover-spooky-object-beaming-out-from-space-that-flashes-on-and-off
1/27/2022,"Astronomers have discovered a mysterious object emitting a radio wave beam that pulsed every 20 minutes. The team behind the discovery believe the object could be a new class of slowly rotating neutron star with an ultra-powerful magnetic field. The repeating signals were detected during the first three months of 2018, but then disappeared, suggesting they were linked to a dramatic, one-off event, such as a starquake.  “It was kind of spooky for an astronomer because there’s nothing known in the sky that does that,” said Natasha Hurley-Walker, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, who led the team that made the discovery. Despite the unusual nature of the signal, the team believe the source is likely to be a spinning object rather than a technologically advanced civilisation reaching out across the cosmos. “It’s definitely not aliens,” said Hurley-Walker. The team briefly considered this possibility, but ruled it out after determining that the signal – one of the brightest radio sources in the sky – was detectable across a broad spectrum of frequencies, meaning that an immense amount of energy would have been required to produce it. The object, believed to be about 4,000 light years away in the plane of the Milky Way, also matches a predicted astronomical object called an “ultra-long period magnetar”, a class of neutron star with the most powerful magnetic field of any known object in the universe. “It’s a type of slowly spinning neutron star that has been predicted to exist, theoretically,” said Hurley-Walker. “But nobody expected to directly detect one like this because we didn’t expect them to be so bright.” A neutron star is the dark, dense remnant left behind after a supermassive star casts off its outer material in a supernova and undergoes gravitational collapse. Reduced to the size of a small city, neutron stars initially spin incredibly quickly – just as a figure skater accelerates in a spin as they pull their arms in to be more compact. Fast-spinning neutron stars are detectable as pulsars that flash on and off within milliseconds or seconds. Over time, the neutron star would lose energy and slow down. “But as they slow down you’d expect them to fade away,” said Prof Andrew Norton, an astrophysicist at Open University. “Once they drop below a theoretical calculation known as the death line, you shouldn’t be able to see them.” Astronomers are perplexed as to why the newly found object – if it is a magnetar – was still emitting enough energy to be detectable when it was observed between January and March 2018. “Somehow it’s converting magnetic energy to radio waves much more effectively than anything we’ve seen before,” said Hurley-Walker. Another question is why the signal then vanished. One possibility is that the signals are linked to a transient event such as a starquake, in which the neutron star’s incredibly dense crust undergoes a sudden adjustment releasing a large blast of energy into space and, potentially, repeated pulses of radio waves after the event. The findings are published in the journal Nature.",News/Science,Astronomers discover mysterious pulsing object that may be new class of star,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/astronomers-discover-mysterious-pulsing-object-new-class-of-star
