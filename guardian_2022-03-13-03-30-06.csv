3/13/2022,"Nottingham Forest made sure it is not only Liverpool they have in their sights, in next Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final, but the Championship’s play-off places as well as Keinan Davis’s two goals took them within two points of the top six. The striker, on loan from Aston Villa, set Forest on their way by scoring after 17 seconds, with their quickest league goal since Jack Lester in 2020, and effectively sealed Reading’s third successive defeat with another midway through the second half. Ryan Yates and Sam Surridge embellished what turned into a comfortable win. Reading’s buffer from the relegation zone is now down to four points and while they threatened briefly in the latter part of the first half, they were grateful Barnsley below them were pegged back by Fulham. Straight from kick-off, Davis, back in the starting lineup, was granted both space and time to collect Djed Spence’s pass from the right, he then turned and rifled in his third goal since January. With only two wins in 16 games, Reading’s confidence could have been on the floor. Instead, they gradually earned a foothold in the game, with Tom Ince increasingly prominent as he roamed in from the right wing. Indeed, Forest started to look nervy, even though they had twice as much possession, as goalkeeper Ethan Horvath had to save, at pointblank range, from Michael Morrison and, shortly before half-time, Yakou Méïté stormed in to head narrowly wide of the far post after brilliant work by Ince down the left wing. Forest had to reshuffle four minutes before half-time as Max Lowe went off injured. Jack Colback went across to left wing-back, the excellent James Garner dropped into central midfield and Cafú came on behind the front two of Davis and Brennan Johnson. Steve Cooper evidently steadied the ship at half-time because Forest came out much more dynamically in the second half. Spence was more advanced with his forays from the right, Garner’s deliveries into the box were every bit as devilish and the whole team seemed to play higher up. The City Ground rediscovered their voice and it was no surprise when Davis doubled the advantage with his second goal. Receiving Joe Worrall’s pass, the former England Under-20 striker bustled his way into the penalty area before opening up his body to fire a powerful left-footed shot in off the far post. He was cautioned when celebrating for taking off his shirt but with it the pressure also lifted. Yates got in on the act 10 minutes from time as, receiving the ball back from Spence, he shot home from 25 yards out into the bottom corner. Then Forest’s strength in depth shone through as Xande Silva, one substitute, crossed from the right to Sam Surridge, another, to sidefoot home with first-time confidence. Wednesday’s game at home with play-off rivals QPR looms large for Forest before they can contemplate their first Cup quarter-final since 1996. It could be quite a week.",Sport/Football,Keinan Davis double leads Nottingham Forest’s rout of Reading,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/nottingham-forest-reading-championship-match-report
3/13/2022,"Nothing is won in the early stages of the season but the smiles on the faces of Ian Watson and his Huddersfield players at full-time told you everything about the optimism surrounding the Giants. Those closest to the club have been of the belief this kind of start – four wins in five, their best in the Super League era – has been coming for a number of years. A litany of promising youngsters have broken into the first team, and the one missing piece always felt like a coach with the ability to mould a squad with spending power and unbridled potential into contenders. Under Watson, a man who has taken Salford to both of the sport’s major finals against the odds, the signs are more encouraging than they have been for quite some time. Yes, they were given a real scare here when a commanding 18-point half-time deficit was spectacularly overturned by a Castleford side who had offered almost nothing offensively in the first half, and even less in the way of hope to their large travelling support. But when they fought back to lead 24-18, Huddersfield were presented with a real test of their mettle and their attitude. It was one they ultimately passed. Four wins from five is by no means enough to guarantee the Giants’ place among the contenders for the title come the business end of the season. But the manner in how they won here, emerging through a tough period to triumph, suggests they certainly have some of the credentials required to last the distance. “It shows there’s a resilience within the group,” Watson said. “They’re playing for the team as well as each other.” The other underlying theme of the afternoon as it has been elsewhere this season, was discipline. The crackdown on late and dangerous tackles has resulted in a swathe of yellow cards in 2022, and there were four in this game, two for either side. The periods where both Castleford and Huddersfield were reduced to 12 men were vital, not least when George Lawler was sin-binned in the final quarter. That gave the space for Huddersfield to level at 24-24 with Ricky Leutele’s try, before the centre followed suit four minutes later to put the hosts ahead once again. This time, it was a lead they would not surrender, with Leutele’s hat-trick in the dying moments securing victory. “We’re going to start training with seven men,” Castleford’s coach, Lee Radford, joked when asked about the clampdown from the authorities. He will be encouraged in the manner of his side’s comeback, but not their first-half display. It is now just one win from five this season for Castleford, and after tries for Owen Trout, Luke Yates and Jermaine McGillvary in the opening half, they never really looked likely of troubling Huddersfield. However, Danny Levi’s sin-binning – an incredibly harsh one on reflection – tipped the momentum in Castleford’s favour. While Levi was off the field, Jake Trueman and Mahe Fonua crossed for tries, and when McGillvary was sent to the bin they struck again after Greg Eden raced across the line. Suddenly it was 18-18 and shortly after Eden’s try he broke free again, this time sending Trueman over for his second. Incredibly, Castleford were now ahead. But when Lawler became the fourth player to see yellow, the pendulum swung back in Huddersfield’s favour. They kept their composure and ruthlessly punished the Tigers, with Leutele the chief beneficiary. Whisper it quietly but there may well be something special brewing in the town where rugby league was formed.",Sport/Sport,Huddersfield’s Ricky Leutele hits hat-trick to seal thriller against Castleford,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/huddersfield-castleford-super-league-rugby-league-match-report
3/13/2022,"In March 2000, five of Russia’s richest oligarchs met in a suite at the Dorchester Hotel in London to discuss a multibillion-pound merger involving some of the biggest assets in the world aluminium industry. The tycoons - one of whom arrived from a legal hearing in the House of Lords - discussed Russian politics, the aluminium wars in their country in the 1990s and the creation of the industrial giant Rusal. A decade later, that hotel summit was at the centre of a £3bn high court battle between two of those present, Roman Abramovich and Boris Berezovsky, over the allocation of the abundant resources from the privatisation of Russia’s state-controlled industry, including the aluminium merger. It was the most costly private litigation battle ever fought in the British courts. The legal costs in the 2012 case were estimated at up to £100m. While Abramovich won the legal case – in which Berezovsky demanded compensation for his alleged stake in the aluminium assets – the roots of these global riches, and those involved in managing them, are now coming under intense regulatory scrutiny from financial officials tasked with imposing sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime. Two of the men at the Dorchester meeting on 13 March 2000 have since died. Berezovsky was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire mansion in March 2013 with a ligature around his neck. A coroner recorded an open verdict. The Georgian-born oligarch Badri Patarkatsishvili, who was also present, died in February 2008 from a suspected heart attack. Two others who were at the summit, Abramovich and the billionaire Oleg Deripaska, the founder of Rusal, were last week put on the UK sanctions list. Abramovich’s British assets – including Chelsea football club – have been frozen. The Premier League has disqualified Abramovich as a director of the club Abramovich and Deripaska were among seven oligarchs targeted in the move: they are said by the government to be worth a combined £15bn. Foreign secretary Liz Truss said officials would continue to “ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds”. The fifth person present at the 2000 meeting was Soviet-born billionaire Eugene Shvidler, one of the major shareholders in the London-listed global steel company Evraz and a close friend of Abramovich. Shvidler was also chairman of Millhouse LLC, Abramovich’s Moscow-based investment company, but stepped down last week after sanctions were imposed on the Chelsea owner. Shvidler has kept a low profile for most of his business career, but is now in the spotlight after being named in the sanctions documents over his “close ties” to Abramovich. A private jet, a Bombardier Global 6500, suspected of being linked to him was impounded last week at Farnborough airport. Ministers are making it a criminal offence for planes owned or chartered by Russians to enter UK airspace. Shvidler has been described as Abramovich’s “right-hand man”, and the pair have often been spotted together, including on a trip in July 2015 to the Isle of Arran in Scotland . While Abramovich can be urbane and charming, Shvidler is described as more blunt in business dealings. “He can be the bad cop to his good cop,” said one person who has met him. Asked last week whether Shvidler thought he might be at risk of sanctions, a spokesperson said: “Mr Shvidler is not, and has never been, a citizen of the Russian Federation. Mr Shvidler is not a public person and is not party to the current events. Mr Shvidler was born in the USSR and left in 1989 as a stateless refugee. He settled in the US and became a US citizen in 1994. Since 2010, Mr Shvidler has also been a citizen of the UK, having arrived under the UK highly skilled visa programme.” Shvidler’s personal wealth has been estimated by Forbes at £1.3bn. He has a home in Surrey and is reported to own a super yacht, Le Grand Bleu, said to be a gift from Abramovich. His other properties have included a Bordeaux vineyard called Château Thénac, a house in Colorado; and a £19m New York apartment. He also previously owned a property in Belgravia, London, which was sold in December 2012 for £55m to a company in the British Virgin Islands. Shvidler and Abramovich built their fortunes after the privatisation of Russian oil company Sibneft in 1996. Shvidler was appointed president of Sibneft in July 1998. In the 2012 court case, the judge considered that Abramovich accepted that he would not have won control of Sibneft without corrupt payments to Berezovksy to influence President Boris Yeltsin over the assets’ future. Shvidler stood down last week as a director of Evraz, along with nine other non-executive directors, including Sir Michael Peat, a former private secretary to Prince Charles. Abramovich is one of its company’s major shareholders and trading in Evraz shares was suspended by the Financial Conduct Authority, pending clarification of the impact of the sanctions. The company was accused by the government of potentially threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including the possible supply of steel to the Russian military which may have been used for tanks. Evraz denied the claims and said it did not expect its business to be hit with sanctions. It said it supplied steel for construction projects only and it had not been used in Russian tanks. Shvidler’s spokesperson described the government allegations as “baseless”. Shvidler is also previously a director of the investment advisory firm MC Peat & Co, which was set up by Sir Michael Peat’s son, Charlie. He stood down in May 2013. Bill Browder, the financier and critic of the Kremlin, said last week he welcomed the action against Abramovich and other oligarchs, but the sanctions now needed to be widened. He said there should be investigations into the “junior partners of these big oligarchs” and “family members of the oligarchy who may be holding assets on their behalf.” The spokesperson for Shvidler said: “Mr Shvidler would like to make it clear that, like the rest of us in Europe, he is hoping and praying for peace and an end to the senseless violence in Ukraine. We all hope that the war can be brought to an immediate end.”",News/World news,Why has Abramovich’s billionaire friend been left off the UK sanctions list?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/why-has-abramovichs-billionaire-friend-been-left-off-the-uk-sanctions-list
