1/2/2022,"A clock that is the sole surviving object from a second world war Jewish hideout will go on display at Amsterdam’s Dutch Resistance Museum this year. The round mantelpiece clock may have been one of the last things people saw as they were seized by the Nazis and sent to death camps.  Along with scores of family photographs, documents and a book of poetry, the clock belonged to the family of Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper, a Holocaust survivor and resistance fighter. The family artefacts help tell the story of Dutch Jewish resistance to the Nazis, so often overshadowed by the horrific history of the large numbers sent to their death. About three-quarters of Dutch Jews were murdered during the second world war, the highest death rate in western Europe. “That is a factor why people thought that the Jewish resistance was next to non-existent,” said Filip Bloem, collection manager at the museum. “But if you look more precisely you see there were many Jews, thousands and thousands of Jews, in hiding.” After the Nazis invaded, Marianne Brandes-Brilleslijper, known to everyone as Janny, refused to get a Jewish ID card and started working for the resistance, stencilling messages on pillars and posts, moving illegal parcels and documents, often hidden under the mattress of her pram carrying one of her children. When the net began to tighten, she and her husband Bob, and their two children, Robbie and Liselotte, moved to a villa in the woods outside Amsterdam. She lived there with her parents, her sister Lien’s family, other Jewish people and resistance fighters. At its peak, 17 permanent residents lived at ’t Hooge Nest (the High Nest), a tale recounted by Roxane van Iperen in her bestselling book of the same name, published in English as The Sisters of Auschwitz. Hidden away from the main road, the villa became an unlikely haven for culture, as the residents put on concerts, wrote music and distributed resistance papers. “Yiddish culture and other arts flourish at the High Nest. There is dance, music, song and recitation. Simon drums, Puck plays the violin and Jaap builds Kathinka a little piano,” wrote van Iperen. It did not last. The group was betrayed in the summer of 1944. Janny had been out shopping when the Nazis arrived. Laden with heavy bags of wheat, she asked four-year-old Robbie to run ahead for help with the shopping. It was only when she got to the door that she saw the big Chinese vase in the window was gone – the warning signal. “She knew it was wrong, but I was already running into the house,” said Robert Brandes, now 82, recounting one of his few memories of life in the High Nest. “She couldn’t call me back and I was already in the house and she knew it was lost. They hit my mother. I can still remember.” Janny, her family and the other Jewish occupants were sent to the Dutch transit camp of Westerbork. (Robbie and Liselotte were spared as Janny’s husband was not Jewish). At Westerbork, they met another Amsterdam family who had been discovered, after two years hiding in the secret annexe: Anne Frank, her sister Margot and their parents. The Brilleslijpers and the Franks were put on the last transport to leave the Netherlands for Auschwitz. As the war entered its final stages, Janny, Lien and the Frank sisters were sent by train, then forced on a death march to Bergen-Belsen. At this overcrowded, disease-ridden camp – “a runaway fair of insane, sick and dying people” wrote van Iperen – Janny worked as a nurse, although there were no medicines. She urged friends, family acquaintances to live, pre-chewing stale bread for the weakest, scavenging tiny scraps of food, closing eyes. She was one of the last to see the Frank sisters alive. Janny and Lien survived the war. Robert remembers the day his mother came to the family’s rented house on the Amstel in Amsterdam. “I cried out to the whole street, look ‘My mother is back, come see everyone my mother is back.’” One of the exhibits donated to the museum is a letter from Robert’s father to Janny, telling of his joy that she survived. “Darling, I thought I would sink through the floor for joy. I just didn’t know what to say or to do. Robby is still the sweet boy you knew. Our darling Liselotte resembles my sweet wife more and more.” Janny’s father’s identity card, with a large J stamped on it, is also on display. Joseph Brilleslijper, his wife Fietje and their son Jaap, died at Auschwitz. Janny devoted her life to the recognition of war victims. She died in 2003. The collection also includes a poetry album belonging to Lien Brilleslijper, a booklet where family and friends would write life lessons in verse. “When you read it now with the knowledge that many of them didn’t survive the war, that is bittersweet,” Bloem said. The documents and photos will be available on digital display on the museum’s website in the spring, while the clock is due to join the permanent collection from October.

1/2/2022,"Singer-songwriter Moses Sumney, 29, grew up between Ghana and California and studied creative writing and poetry at UCLA. His piercing falsetto and genre-defying music have brought him critical acclaim, starting with his self-recorded 2014 EP Mid-City Island, followed in 2017 by his debut album, Aromanticism, and the 2020 double album Græ. Sumney has collaborated with musicians including Bon Iver and James Blake and toured with Solange and Sufjan Stevens. His latest project is Blackalachia, a self-directed concert film created in association with WePresent, shot over two days in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, where he lives.  Selling Sunset (Netflix) I pity anyone who hasn’t seen this show. It’s a reality show about a real estate agency in west Hollywood, and it follows the lives and deals of the people who work there, predominantly the female staff who are all ridiculously Barbie-ish – essentially “career Barbie on crack”. It’s incredible. I love reality TV – it tells us a lot about humanity. Reality shows are always inherently dated, so they’re a great capsule of the modern era. Don’t Be So Hard On Your Own Beauty by Yeule I don’t know what it is about this song, but I’m addicted to it. Yeule is a Singaporean artist based in London who’s kind of new on the scene, and this song is just so hypnotising – it hints and winks at hyperpop while being an absolutely heart-shattering folk tune. It’s a beautiful amalgamation of a lot of different genres, and it’s stunning. I have a lot of playlists – for driving, for chilling at night, a morning playlist, a folk playlist – and this is in all of them. How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell I’m currently reading this – I put off reading it because it looks like a self-help book – but it’s really fascinating. The author is an artist who works largely in digital art and the book is about how to free yourself from the capitalist trappings of the workforce – not necessarily saying “quit your job”, but suggesting a new path for work. It asks the question: how can we construct our identities apart from defining ourselves by what we do and by our income? It’s a very radical book, and it’s often a hard read. But it has been mind-shifting. Western North Carolina I’ve been travelling a lot for work, so I’ve been thinking about how much I would prefer to spend my time in western North Carolina, particularly in the mountains, where I live. I think it’s the most beautiful place in the world. I first arrived in Asheville when I was on tour and knew immediately I wanted to live here. You turn around, 360 degrees in any direction, and you’re surrounded by trees, by the sound of animals, and that’s really a rare feeling for anyone who’s spent most of their life, as I have, living in the city. Eve’s Bayou (Kasi Lemmons, 1997) This stars a young Jurnee Smollett, who recently had a resurgence with Lovecraft Country. She’s 10 years old in the film, which is set in a fictional small town in Louisiana. Samuel L Jackson stars as the patriarch of the family, who is maybe cheating on his wife, his daughter sets out to kill him and punish him, perhaps through witchcraft. It was incredibly critically acclaimed and subsequently snubbed by every major award ceremony. It’s a gorgeous, heartbreaking film. I first saw it last year and I think about it every day. Balenciaga The couture line that Balenciaga launched this summer is another thing that has permanent residency in my brain. I think that what Demna [Gvasalia, creative director] is doing with sculpture and architecture through fashion is some of the most interesting theatre of our time. It’s like a marriage of Romantic and gothic style – it’s a bit ecclesiastical, almost monastic, and I want it all.

1/2/2022,"It sounds troublingly shallow, but when I saw the tweet that said “Holy shit, ANTM [America’s Next Top Model] is on Amazon Prime” my heart soared. I am not one who can pretend the pandemic isn’t still raging but, in that fleeting moment, I felt a spiritual lightness I hadn’t experienced since 2019. I dropped everything to binge the episodes, then fell deep into a rabbit hole of detective work: where are the contestants now? Are they on Instagram? I found a whole subsection of TikTok dedicated to calling out where the show was problematic, and YouTuber Oliver Twixt has a highly viewed series of interviews with ANTM contestants levelling accusations of maltreatment at the show’s producers. Whatever the reason, ANTM is back in the cultural sphere.  For the uninitiated, ANTM premiered in 2003 and continued for 24 series or “cycles”, until its last gasp in 2018. Each season, young wannabe models competed for a modelling contract. They were mentored by supermodel Tyra Banks and her fellow judges, including runway coach Miss J Alexander who participated in 18 cycles. Way back in 2003, we weren’t where we are now in terms of trans or non-binary representation. Cycle 1 contestant Robin Manning christened Alexander “Miss J” to differentiate them from creative director “Mr” Jay Manuel. As we’re now in 2021, I ask Miss J to clarify the pronoun situation. “Miss J answers to all and any pronouns ... Just respect me – call me what you want – but don’t forget to sign that cheque.” There’s something pleasingly quaint about the fact Miss J flip-flopped his pronouns and gender expression – often wearing self-made dresses on the judging panel – without having to label himself as trans, non-binary or a drag queen. Nowadays he would be asked to define himself; here I am, literally doing just that. Miss J appeared in hundreds of episodes, so it’s not surprising that his decade on the show is something of a blur to him. “I look back on that time as me, doing me, being me,” he says. “Feeling fierce and fabulous. Being creative. I created my wardrobe.” But not all the memories are good ones. “I think about the girls, what they went through and how they were treated. I look at the backlash and I do wonder if we knew what we were putting them through.” Indeed. Some moments have aged terribly. Yes, I’m thinking of the two occasions when white models donned blackface for photoshoots. The show is also guilty of cultural insensitivity - visits to overseas destinations were treated as an excuse to caricature indigenous peoples – and pressuring contestants to lose weight. Miss J is philosophical: “I can’t speak on the photoshoots because I wasn’t on [them].” I suggest it’s slightly unfair to judge TV from 15 years ago by today’s more enlightened standards. Miss J agrees. “Did we mean harm? No. I didn’t understand it, why [the blackface] photoshoot happened. Was the idea to make them feel what it’s liked to be mixed? I would have asked them what the takeaway was. But it wouldn’t fly right now.” Some of the former contestants have been less than complimentary about the show, since it re-entered the spotlight. “Some of the girls got upset because they didn’t make it,” says Miss J. “They were competing with other girls and only one girl can win. So now they feel they didn’t get the support they needed. But these girls watched the show. They knew the formula.” And there definitely was a formula. Audiences came to recognise that if a contestant spoke about her home life, it was almost certainly because she was returning to it by the conclusion of that episode. You could also set your watch by the moment when a pretty prom queen-type entered the salon for “makeover week”. Nothing beats the feeling when the stylist takes that Rapunzel-length ponytail in hand and cruelly snips it off while the poor model wails. TV gold. “It was as good for me as it was for you!” Miss J laughs. I’m always surprised that the contestants were surprised. Surely they’d seen the show before? “They knew what they were getting into. They knew we were gonna chop that shit off! Why talk shit about it online?” A few contestants went on to greatness: Winnie Harlow and Leila Goldkuhl notably escaped the “curse” of Top Model, and worked with Calvin Klein and Chanel among others. But most (including a smattering of male models) returned to small-town obscurity. For some, their post-show destiny involved prison (Renee Alway) or addiction (Jael Strauss); one former contestant was murdered (Mirjana Puhar). Even with the criticisms of exploitation directed at talent shows, Miss J thinks there’s still life in the old format. “The fashion world has changed,” he says. “Plus-size models on the catwalk; dark-skinned models are totally taking over. Black Lives Matter has meant everyone wants a Black girl in their campaign. There’s a lot of trans models – and no-one knows. Some are out, some aren’t.” In fairness to ANTM, they were ahead of the curve there. Trans model and actor Isis King competed on the show in 2008, one of the first prominent trans women of colour to break through into the mainstream. But post #MeToo, and with a far greater awareness of the exploitation of young models, is it OK to portray the world of fashion as even dimly aspirational? Would it be safe even? “It can be, because right now everything is microscopically watched,” says Miss J. “We need to change our tone and language. It needs to be a safe space for all of us.” Despite everything, I really, really hope they bring it back. I want more. I’m sorry, I can’t help it; I do. I wonder if, when we dig out the comfort blankets of our past, it’s a subconscious desire to flee back. I watched ANTM in my early 20s when I was truly free for the first time in my life. It was pre-mortgages, pre-pandemic, before my transition and all the transphobia that came with it. Truly, a simpler time.

1/2/2022,"The architectural quirks and flaws of a given space are harnessed to explore the tensions within the family inhabiting it: Stephen Karam’s The Humans is the latest in a long line of films to employ a device that was most recently used to impressive effect in Sean Durkin’s The Nest. But while Durkin’s picture was strikingly cinematic in its approach, The Humans struggles to escape its theatrical origins – the film is adapted from Karam’s own Tony award-winning stage play.  It’s not the most visually arresting work, but the sound design team excel – the prewar apartment in lower Manhattan creaks and groans its displeasure during a dysfunctional family Thanksgiving. The casting is also first-rate, with Richard Jenkins and a wounded, garrulous Jayne Houdyshell the standouts.

1/2/2022,"Ilike to imagine Jamie Dornan – you might anticipate a full stop there, but do carry on – having the same issues as the rest of us over Christmas, craving a second to switch off and so switching the television on. Perhaps he, too, spent time staring at a hectic page on a streaming service, wondering for so long what to watch that scrolling became the activity and then it was time for bed, the evening having been filled by an endless click of the down button, interrupted only by arguments about whether The Wolf of Wall Street or Zero Dark Thirty is more festive or should we do a Girls5eva or three instead? (The answer is always yes.)  In an interview with the Radio Times, Dornan pointed out that viewers are “spoilt for choice” these days and that it is always easy to give up on a new series quickly and move on to the next. “Which I think is a bit dangerous,” he said, arguing that it is often worth giving something a chance or more than one episode. It brought to mind Succession, of course it did, which, in its first season, was far from the ubiquitous must-see it has become. I’d heard it was “slow”, put it off, until I didn’t. The BBC’s new adaptation of Around the World in 80 Days is a certifiable slow starter, but it gets better and I hope viewers offer it their patience. They are under no obligation to, of course. There is an avalanche of choice, though that in itself can be overwhelming, which, granted, is a wild indulgence to grumble about. It is the “my diamond shoes are too tight” of complaints, to borrow a line from Friends, which has inflated its own popularity using the air pump of streaming and remains as popular as it was when it first appeared, if not far more so. Which makes me wonder if the sheer amount of shows we have to choose from drives many viewers back to old familiars or comfort viewing. Certainly, it seems that older shows remain popular. Netflix reports that The Salisbury Poisonings, Downton Abbey and Ackley Bridge have been among its most viewed series in recent weeks, though it’s impossible to know if viewers are rewatching or discovering for the first time. Is it the fact that they are inherently known, already tested on audiences, which makes them an easier choice? It’s hard to tell. But Dornan is right: our already-stretched attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. If we demand instant gratification from television, it will lead to television that is eager to please and that is rarely a good thing. The great vinyl revival shows no sign of stopping. The British Phonographic Industry has estimated that more than 5m vinyl albums were bought in the UK in 2021, accounting for almost one in four album purchases, the highest proportion since 1990. Abba’s Voyage is on track to be the bestselling vinyl of the year, followed by Adele, Fleetwood Mac, Ed Sheeran and Amy Winehouse. It’s a funny old list, a hodgepodge of huge stars, suggesting the decline of that image of the crate-digger sifting through rare cuts in a dusty old shop, affirming that the popularity of vinyl is built on pop. It also points to the collapse of distinct musical eras. Over Christmas, I watched my young niece and nephew dancing to their favourite songs, loaded up on YouTube, one after the other, and it was an odyssey through the decades that reached a climax with Shakira’s 2010 World Cup anthem Waka Waka. It was a concoction of everything from pop’s beginnings to its present and was not particularly shaped by the time in which they live. For smaller and newer artists, though, who are far more reliant on the income from record sales in order to have a hope of surviving, getting vinyl produced last year was difficult, if not impossible, owing to a lack of infrastructure, supply chain issues and the sheer dominance of the big guns at the top, who have gobbled up production capacity. A new plant, Press On Vinyl, is about to open in Middlesbrough and one can only hope the appetite for vinyl leads to more places that are capable of making it. I have an awful habit of lurking on the internet, rather than getting involved in it. I do it on Reddit to the extent that I had to delete the app, because it was filling all the time I’d saved by deleting the Facebook app and then Twitter. But my favourite place to lurk is Goodreads, where readers leave sometimes devastatingly honest, incredibly well-considered reviews of books they have read. Its users have just voted for their favourite books of 2021, giving Sally Rooney’s novel Beautiful World, Where Are You the best fiction prize. Its novelist character Alice would, I’m sure, accept the award, but feel terribly bad about it. Forget all those literary panels of six, with a prize winner here and an academic there. This is the real deal, a voting panel consisting of more than 4.7 million readers who truly know their stuff. Whenever I have finished a novel (never before, it’s full of spoilers), I check in with Goodreads to see how much people liked it, or not, and I always feel a little crushed if something I adored gets pummelled.

1/2/2022,"England’s New Year’s Eve celebrations on Friday were not quite the damp squib many were expecting, with partygoers taking to city centres across the country to celebrate the end of 2021. In Leeds, queues of revellers lined the streets, in stark contrast to the Christmas period, when the city centre had been virtually empty because of concerns over the highly infectious Omicron variant.  On Greek Street, a tartan-clad bagpiper hired by a restaurant played Auld Lang Syne as groups of people of all ages went from bar to bar. Sophie Kramer and David Brown had come from Bradford for a New Year’s Eve night out with some friends. Being young and double-jabbed, they felt there was little risk for them. “I’m not worried, not at all,” said 24-year-old Kramer. “We’ve both had Covid before and we just really need a night out, to be honest. I know that sounds stupid because it’s a pandemic, but everyone’s mental health has been so bad this year. That’s important too. It’s not just about Covid.” Brown agreed. He said the couple had wanted to avoid self-isolation over Christmas but were less concerned about needing to isolate now. He said: “We were a bit more careful before but the Omicron variant isn’t supposed to be as bad, so I think it’s worth the risk.” Robert and Sheila Brine had a similar attitude. They had been for dinner and were heading to the casino before going home before midnight. “We’re not worried. We’ve got our masks, we’re triple-jabbed we’ve just got to get on with it,” Robert said. Ryan and Keely O’Shea were also going for dinner, in a change to their original plans. “We were supposed to be having a bit of a do but we’ve cancelled it because a lot of our friends didn’t want to be in a confined space with other people, which is understandable,” said Ryan. “I don’t know anyone who hasn’t been jabbed. I didn’t get it right away because I wanted to see what happened but I’m glad I’ve got it now. It gives you some confidence to go out and live a normal life.” His hesitancy was due to having very little trust in the Conservatives, he said. “I have trouble believing the government. But I always did. Now at least I think other people feel the same.” The pair said the UK government was being shown up by the devolved countries, which were handling the pandemic better. “I don’t understand why there are no rules in England but other places have got them,” Ryan added. Nightclubs in Wales were closed and indoor events were restricted to 50 people, leaving streets empty. Meanwhile in Scotland, despite the cancellation of large-scale Hogmanay events and being urged by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to “stay at home as much as possible”, about 1,000 people of all ages climbed to the top of Calton Hill in Edinburgh to make the traditional countdown to the bells at midnight. Sturgeon said the restrictions were aimed at cutting down transmission of the Omicron variant and because “large events put an additional burden on emergency services”.",News/UK news,New Year’s Eve revellers in England take to streets despite Omicron concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/new-years-eve-revellers-england-omicron-concerns
1/2/2022,"Doctors and health officials have warned that the rising number of Covid-19 infections poses a significant threat to the UK’s ability to run trains, buses, hospitals and other key services. More and more people face going into quarantine and that could have grave consequences, they say. As a result, isolation times for those testing positive for Sars-CoV-2 have been cut from 10 to seven days to reduce the pressure on industry.  But is this reduction justified? Or is there room for even further quarantine cuts to be made, as has been done in the US? These are critical questions whose answers could determine how quickly the nation emerges from the wave of Covid-19 cases it is now experiencing. In England and Northern Ireland, if you’ve tested positive or have symptoms, you can now stop self-isolating after seven days, instead of 10, if you get two negative lateral flow test results on days six and seven. In Scotland and Wales, the 10-day limit is still in force. “We know that people who get Covid-19 are most infectious early on around symptom onset, and that the risk of transmission declines pretty quickly after that,” says epidemiologist Billy Quilty, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “By the time someone finds out that they are infected by developing symptoms or testing positive, it’s already been two or three days since they were exposed, and they may have already been infectious for a day or two. So after five days of isolation, they’re really on day seven or eight of their infection. As a result, we estimate that there is a low risk associated with isolation periods of five days or more.” Scientists say Omicron may infect people more quickly, but possibly for a shorter period than previous variants. “However, we need to find out if that is the case as soon as possible,” said Quilty. “We also need to make sure that people are not isolating for an unnecessarily long time, especially if this becomes a very acute staffing crisis.” The need for further research is also backed by epidemiologist Prof Dame Anne Johnson, of University College London. “There is a large variability in how infectious people are and how much virus they shed. So we need more studies to understand when it’s reasonable for people to be released from quarantine – though we need to face the fact that we cannot eliminate all risk.” Johnson added that she wanted to see more data on the distribution of viral loads in different people according to their symptoms and at different times of their infection. “We need to better understand how infectious individuals are likely to be at different times and to know when infectivity drops off,” she said. Most scientists are now more optimistic about the likely impact of Omicron, though they worry about the short-term effect it might have on hospitalisations. “In a population that was previously unexposed to a virus, it takes time – through natural infections and vaccines – to get to the situation where you have gradually built up immunity in the population to the extent that people will be getting infected without much impact,” said Johnson. “That is the general direction we are travelling in – as long as we don’t get a new variant that is so different it causes a lot of disease.”",News/World news,"What are the current rules on self-isolation for Covid in UK, and what does the science say?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/what-are-the-current-rules-on-self-isolation-for-covid-in-uk-and-what-does-the-science-say
1/2/2022,"One can only hope the Arteta residence has thick walls. Arsenal’s manager, absent after testing positive for Covid-19, had said he would “need a big room” before watching this fixture from home and it would be a wonder if there was much of it left by the time his players walked off. This should have been a moment of arrival for his young team and, when the dust has settled, may still feel like one: they outplayed a flat Manchester City for sustained periods, leading at the break through Bukayo Saka, but ended up with nothing after Rodri’s added-time winner. Arsenal had been dominant until two rushes of blood in the 15 minutes after half-time, Granit Xhaka conceding a penalty that Riyad Mahrez dispatched and Gabriel almost instantly being dismissed for two stupid bookings. City pickpocketed their 11th straight win but, had Arsenal managed to keep that many players on the pitch, Arteta’s frustration would surely have been minimal.  It was a measure of Arsenal’s first-half performance that Saka’s goal, the end product after 15 minutes of intense pressure, was overwhelmingly deserved. After a tentative start they had grasped the initiative and bested City in a way rarely seen: their tempo and aggression were matched by smart, pinpoint passing between the lines and an increasingly agitated Pep Guardiola must have sensed his players were being overrun. The sequence that picked the lock was characteristically sweeping, beginning when Ben White won possession and continuing with a precise ball from Martin Ødegaard out to Kieran Tierney. With City backing off, the left-back had time to assess his options and slid a considered pass across to Saka, who swept in first-time from 15 yards. Saka was mobbed by his teammates and serenaded by a crowd who, from the moment a guttural roar greeted his first run at Nathan Aké, appeared to sense it could be his day. His performance had been irrepressible and so had that of Gabriel Martinelli, a whirl of energy and application out on the left. The Brazilian curled inches wide six minutes before half-time, quickly following that with an electric run and angled shot past the far post. City could have faced a mountain to climb at the interval. That was all the more notable given the opposite is usually true. By the 20th minute Arsenal could have chosen to take succour from the fact they were not behind. It is no secret that they have struggled in this fixture for the best part of a decade and, on City’s previous six visits, they had been in front at that point. The mood music around this meeting had been markedly more optimistic and the happier tone was justified. Both teams could have scored in those initial skirmishes but it was the hosts who had greater encouragement. They bayed for a penalty when, at the end of a brilliant move, Ødegaard was tackled by Ederson. The City keeper had, as VAR correctly determined, taken the ball before making contact with the playmaker’s leg but it was a close-run thing. On the quarter-hour an offside-looking Martinelli was sent away by Thomas Partey but Ederson repelled his toe-poked effort. City had twice forced Gabriel into important defensive interventions before ruing Rúben Dias’s waywardness when, beating Aaron Ramsdale to the ball, he headed wide. But from then on they were swamped: Arsenal, driven on by Thomas Partey, had begun forcing them into hacked clearances long before Saka’s breakthrough and the pattern had not shifted by the change of ends. Nor did it alter until City were gifted their equaliser. Arsenal had continued to force errors from the moment proceedings restarted, Lacazette robbing Dias and forcing Rodri to salvage the situation with a thundering challenge on Martinelli. When a slow, bedraggled away side finally managed an attack, it paid off. At first glance Bernardo Silva had crumpled too easily as he looked to wriggle past Xhaka, but the City player’s protestations were particularly vehement and the video technology bore them out. Xhaka had needlessly taken a chunk of his shirt; Stuart Attwell eventually awarded the spot kick, via a look at his monitor, and Mahrez dispatched it without fuss. A cue for things to settle down? No chance. Seconds later Arsenal should have been back ahead when Laporte headed over a stranded Ederson and demanded a heroic last-ditch clearance from Aké, only for Martinelli to be following up. Somehow he shot over and, from the resulting goal kick, the scales tilted firmly towards City. Gabriel had been booked for attempting to scuff the penalty spot amid a spate of handbags before Mahrez stepped up; it was a daft offence and meant his next one, clipping Gabriel Jesus after he had controlled Ederson’s clearance, was simply exasperating. Attwell had no choice but to dismiss him; Arsenal would have to hang on and, in an increasingly furious atmosphere, the referee faced a battle to maintain control too. City probed without looking like scoring but, with the clock past 90, Rodri squeezed an undeserved winner past Ramsdale after Aymeric Laporte’s shot was blocked.

Those experts argue that the US has reached a stage in the pandemic where reports of dramatic surges in case counts prompt unnecessary worries and that government officials and the public should instead review death and hospitalization data when considering precautions. Case counts “are causing a lot of panic and fear, but they don’t reflect what they used to, which was that hospitalizations would track with cases”, said Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. However, other infectious disease experts say that while they are encouraged by data from South Africa showing that its recent Omicron wave was not accompanied by a significant increase in deaths, the virus continues to strain hospitals in the US, therefore the number of Covid cases remains a vital measurement. The US on Thursday had more than 580,000 new Covid cases, the second time this week that the country has broken its record for daily Covid cases, according to New York Times data. But over the past two weeks, while the number of Covid cases in the United States has increased by 181%, the number of hospitalizations has increased by 19% and the number of deaths has decreased by 5%. “It seems to be less virulent for two reasons,” said Gandhi. “One, we seem to have so much more immunity in December 2021” that during previous waves, and “there are now five laboratory studies that show that it doesn’t seem to infect lungs very well”. In reporting data on Covid, health departments should now take the same approach as they do with influenza, Gandhi said. That means releasing hospitalization and death data but not numbers concerning case counts because, like with the flu, it’s not possible to eliminate the virus, therefore we should only focus on its severity, she said. “Once you have accepted the virus is endemic, just like influenza, then you never track cases because we never screen like this for any other viruses, we track what is causing disease and getting people hospitalized,” Gandhi said. Other countries are now implementing an approach that is not focused on case counts. For example, in Canada, which has also seen record numbers of Covid cases recently, Dr Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference Thursday that the government agency would no longer focus on daily case counts. “We no longer need to identify and have public health manage every single case of the variant because for most people, that will result in relatively mild illness, so we need to focus our efforts and resources on our most vulnerable groups,” said Strang. “Omicron is all around us and we have to recognize that you could be exposed anywhere … It’s about managing and slowing down the spread but not eliminating it.” The Philippines government also announced this week that it would stop posting case updates on social media, which was similar to an approach employed by Singapore, according to Hawaii Public Radio. But in the US, there are parts of the country where hospitals remains overwhelmed, largely because of unvaccinated patients with Covid. In Maryland, for example, which saw a more than 500% increase in Covid cases and 50% increase in hospitalizations, at least six hospitals have implemented crisis-mode standards of care, according to the Baltimore Sun. At Johns Hopkins Bayview medical center, which saw a 360% increase in patients hospitalized with Covid in December, that means rescheduling elective surgical procedures and opening additional space to treat Covid patients. Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, still sees case counts as an “important leading indicator”, he said. “With Omicron are surges are so big, even if it’s on average … much less severe than previous variants, the sheer number of cases is such that hospital systems are going to be overwhelmed and there is risks to individuals because it’s so likely you will be infected.” Mara Aspinall, a biomedical diagnostics professor at Arizona State University, also said case count data remains important because it prevents the public from overreacting or underreacting to the pandemic. “The challenge we have had this whole time is finding that balance between keeping our physical health in check, but our mental health and the economy moving forward, and it’s all with the best information” that we are able to do that, Aspinall said. For Gandhi, that balances lies in health departments tracking case counts internally and only alerting the public on hospitalizations and deaths. “The reason we tracked cases is because we were hoping we could eliminate the virus, but it’s not in the nature of the virus to eliminate it,” said Gandhi. “The country hasn’t totally transitioned to this idea that we can’t eliminate it.”",News/US news,US experts question whether counting Covid cases is still the right approach,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/us-covid-case-counts-omicron
1/2/2022,"The UK’s vaccine rollout has largely been a success: more than 90% of the population aged 12 and over has now had at least one dose, with just over half having had a second dose and the booster. However, there are thousands of people who still haven’t had a jab, despite estimates suggesting that 90% of the most severely ill Covid patients in hospital at the moment are unvaccinated.  A number of strategies are being employed to convince those who have so fare avoided it get vaccinated, with outreach groups and GPs working to encourage take-up. The Observer spoke to three people who have, in recent weeks, changed their minds. Here, they explain their initial hesitancy and the reasons for their change of heart. Ecology student Jess said she “wasn’t against the vaccine” and had received her first and second doses. But she had decided not to get the booster. In August 2021, shortly after having her second jab, she had a miscarriage at eight weeks pregnant. “I was worried the vaccine had contributed to my miscarriage and became wary of getting a booster once I found out I was pregnant again” she said. She considered waiting until she had given birth to have her booster, but the became concerned about Omicron and about the number of unvaccinated pregnant women ending up in intensive care. “I realised that my hesitance was based on grief and worry,” she said. “Just looking at the data proved that Covid is a much greater risk than any of my worst fears about the vaccine affecting my pregnancy.” She changed her mind and had the booster. “I don’t want to get Covid while I am pregnant and be in a situation that could potentially be harmful to me and the baby. “I’m a scientist and I know that if there was something seriously wrong with the vaccines, fellow scientists would stop at nothing to discover it and improve our understanding of them. “I understand the visceral response and fear of vaccination, but we need to be realistic about how serious Covid can be and recognise how hard scientists and doctors have worked to keep us safe. No matter how I look at it now, getting vaccinated is worth it.” Kevin has had a phobia of needles from an early age. “I just hate them. I forged my mum’s signature when I was 14 to avoid getting the TB vaccination, saying she didn’t want me to have it. They wrote to her six months later, I was found out, and they dragged me into Birmingham kicking and screaming to have it.” His plan was to remain unvaccinated, taking precautions to avoid infecting himself and his elderly parents, who live nearby. The emergence of the Omicron variant made Kevin reassess his approach, as he was concerned by its rate of transmission. “I was reading that just a whiff of an infected person’s breath would be enough to contract it. I’ve dodged it for this length of time and thought, how much longer can I go on? “I booked an appointment about a month ago and chickened out. I then rearranged that one and finally went along. I just concentrated on the fact that it was a good thing. I hardly slept the night before. “On the day, I didn’t even realise she had done it. It helped that I walked into the place not wearing glasses so I couldn’t see anything anyway. There was one person taking my details, the other had a hypodermic needle. “I was talking to the one with a laptop about my phobia and, without me noticing, it was done. I didn’t feel a thing. I have my second booked for February and plan to get a booster.” Adam (not his real name) lost faith in the government in 2020, largely because of Dominic Cummings and the Barnard Castle affair. “I just thought if they can lie about something of this magnitude, what else can they lie about?” He then became sceptical because of the speed of the vaccination programme rollout. “I felt like it was quite rushed to begin with. There wasn’t much research published or data coming out, which led me to believe that it was being pushed out for other reasons – not just to save lives, but to save the economy, which to some extent I understand, but I feel like saving lives is much more important. Damage to the economy can be repaired, but you can’t bring back someone who has passed away.” Over time Adam, who works for his family’s wealth management business, came to believe in the benefits of vaccination by following hospitalisation figures in trusted news sources. “I was hesitant about getting my first vaccine, which I didn’t have until about three months ago. I had my second dose three weeks ago. “The hospitalisation numbers for people who were vaccinated compared with people who were unvaccinated were scary. At the same time, I felt like there was a bit more control on the misinformation that was being put out there. “The information that was published was worrying, so I thought it was best in the long run to get the vaccine, rather than not, despite what my feelings were at the time.”",News/World news,"Grief, needle phobia, lack of trust: why we refused Covid jabs – and what changed our minds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/needle-phobia-refused-covid-jabs-refuseniks-vaccination
