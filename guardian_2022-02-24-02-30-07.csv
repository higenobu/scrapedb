2/24/2022,"A video of a local television reporter in Ohio being surprised at work by his mother has gone viral, striking a chord with parents and their children alike. ABC 6 reporter Myles Harris was preparing to shoot a story with his back to a road when he turned to look at traffic and appeared to recognize an approaching vehicle.  With an exasperated flap of his arms and a put-upon frown, Harris then suddenly turned to camera. “That’s my mom. Hold on,” he tells the cameraman. A black car then rolls up with the window down and Harris’s mother greets him with an enthusiastic shout: “Hi, baby!” “I’m trying to work right now!” Harris responds before his mother and the cameraman – and eventually Harris himself – burst into laughter. The clip, published by the TV station, rapidly went viral as social media video accounts picked it up. The video ended with Harris telling his mother: “Don’t be holding up traffic, because you got cars behind you.” His mother replies “alright” and blows him a kiss before driving away again out of shot.",News/US news,Video of Ohio reporter surprised at work by his mother goes viral,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/ohio-reporter-mother-video-viral
2/24/2022,"The French and British drugmakers Sanofi and GSK are ready to seek approval from regulators for their Covid-19 vaccine after reporting positive results from late-stage clinical trials. The firms are hoping to catch up with rivals after falling far behind in the race to develop Covid-19 shots. Their product was delayed by an early dosing error during trials, initially disappointing results in older people and other issues. It will be available as a two-dose vaccine and as a booster.  The companies will now file for approval from regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, while a rolling review with the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is already under way. Sanofi developed the jab, while GSK, the world’s biggest vaccine maker by sales, is supplying its adjuvant technology, to boost the body’s immune response. It relies on a conventional protein-based approach, compared with the newer mRNA technology used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which makes it easier to store and transport. The companies said the phase 3 efficacy trials showed that two doses of the jab provided 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisations; 75% efficacy against moderate or severe Covid-19 disease; and 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic Covid-19 disease. They said the latter is in line with expected vaccine effectiveness given the emergence of several variants of concern, such as Omicron, and similar to other vaccines. A separate trial showed that the jab boosted antibody levels against the virus 18- to 30 times across all age groups, when used in people who had been given two doses of other vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech, Modern and Oxford/AstraZeneca shots. Thomas Triomphe, the executive vice-president of Sanofi Vaccines, said: “The Sanofi-GSK vaccine demonstrates a universal ability to boost all platforms and across all ages. “We also observed robust efficacy of the vaccine as a primary series in today’s challenging epidemiological environment. No other global phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorised vaccines.” Roger Connor, the president of GSK’s vaccines arm, said: “We are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period.”",News/Business,Sanofi and GSK seek approval for Covid-19 vaccine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/sanofi-and-gsk-seek-approval-for-covid-19-vaccine
2/24/2022,"Residents in areas of England affected by flooding have been urged to remain vigilant as two severe “danger to life” warnings remained in place after heavy rainfall. They came as the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings for Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland which included predictions of heavy snow, gusty winds and the chance of the relatively rare phenomenon of thundersnow.  Three back-to-back storms, Dudley, Eunice and Franklin, have combined over the past week to bring travel chaos, injury, power cuts, tree loss and flooding to parts of the UK. At least three people are known to have died as a result of Eunice. The worst of the weather appears over for now but anxiety remains high for flooded areas. The two severe flood warnings are in Bewdley, Worcestershire, and the historic village of Ironbridge, Shropshire. In Bewdley search and rescue teams were out checking properties and speaking to residents after temporary flood defences were breached after heavy rain on Tuesday afternoon. The Environment Agency said the water level peaked on Wednesday lunchtime at 5.33m and levels are forecast to “remain high for a prolonged period”. Nick Green, area incident manager for the Environment Agency for the West Midlands, said it had been “incredibly frightening” for the community in Bewdley, which has faced regular flooding in recent decades. He said: “We could really see the anxiety and the worry that they had knowing that the river was going to rise and the impact that it could have on their lives.” Dan Bond, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “We are still facing a significant flooding risk, and we are urging people to remain vigilant and take extreme care. The Met Office says the phenomenon is meteorologically identical to the thunder and lightning storms that take place in summer, just with snow instead of rain or hail. This means it can look and sound different. Lightning reflecting off snowflakes appears brighter, and the thunder is muffled by snow drifts. During a summer storm, the thunder can be heard many miles away, but during a thundersnow event it will only be heard if you are within 2-3 miles of it. Thundersnow is rarer than regular thunderstorms, since elevated convection – moist air rising into the troposphere to produce thunderstorms – rarely happens at temperatures that support snowfall.Thunderstorms develop when a front of warm air collides with colder air making the atmosphere unstable. As warm air rises it cools and condenses, forming small droplets of water to create a cumulonimbus cloud in less than an hour. As the warm air continues to rise, the water droplets form ice crystals, and circulating air in the clouds causes water  to freeze on the surface of the droplet or crystal. Eventually, the droplets become too heavy to be supported by the updraughts of air and they fall as hail. Lightning is formed when the negative charge of the hail rubs against smaller, positively charged ice crystals and they discharge in a flash of lightning. The rapid expansion and heating of air caused by the lightning produces the accompanying loud clap of thunder. “Last weekend’s heavy rainfall on already wet areas continues to cause river flooding along the River Severn and is likely to continue over the next few days.” In Ironbridge councillor Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin Council, said the water was just 20cm away from breaching barriers. “It’s only through the grace of God that these barriers have not been topped again.” The Met Office yellow warning for Scotland and Northern Ireland is in place between 5pm on Wednesday until 8pm Thursday. The warning has changed from snow and wind to snow and lightning. The latter means there is a chance of thundersnow,where snow dampens the sound of the thunder and reflects the lightning, making it seem brighter. All of the UK will feel colder on Thursday as a cold front sweeps through. The recent storms led to 1.48m households and businesses losing power. The Energy Networks Association said on Wednesday that 1,400 customers were still waiting for it to be restored.",News/Environment,‘Danger to life’ warnings in West Midlands after flooding,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/danger-to-life-warnings-in-west-midlands-after-flooding
2/24/2022,"A small but growing number of Ukrainians living in Britain are making plans to go back to their homeland to fight the Russian army if its invasion of the country escalates, community leaders have said. They said Ukrainian expats, including veterans of the war with Russia since 2014, would take up arms to defend the country in response to the build-up of Russian troops along and inside eastern Ukraine’s borders.  Wolodymyr Pawluk, chair of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said many military veterans living in Britain were thinking of going back, with a minority having already decided to do so. “In London, I can only say a handful have said that they will go back,” said Pawluk, 58. “There are many more that I’ve also heard will go, although I don’t know them personally.” Marta Mulyak, the head of the London branch of Plast National Scout Organisation of Ukraine, said: “I do hear men who live not only here but in other European countries saying: ‘Well, if it comes to war, we want to go there. We want to be part of that defence.’” Mulyak, 39, who stressed that the scouting movement was not involved in these plans, added: “The reality is that no one except Ukrainians will defend Ukrainian land.” She said some of her friends and family members in Ukraine’s eastern region had recently joined a new territorial defence force set up by the government in January, whose civilian members will help to combat Russian troops. “Some of my cousins are thinking about it. Some of my friends have already joined. A lot of my friends already joined the regular army. All the men that I speak with in Ukraine say that we will defend our country.” Olesya Khromeychuk, director of cultural centre the Ukrainian Institute London, also said she expected her friends in Ukraine to join the territorial defence force, adding that some of the artists she has worked with spent last weekend tidying up a bomb shelter. The historian added that the escalation of hostilities had brought back painful memories of family loss. “Just imagining what sort of bloodshed this is likely to cause is awful. I lost my brother, who was serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, at the frontline in 2017. Volodya was 42 when he was killed by shrapnel in the Luhansk region. He lived in western Europe but moved back to join up.” Khromeychuk, 38, who wrote about her brother’s death in her recently published book, A Loss, added: “It’s been a tough few months, because I had to remind everybody that we’ve been in this for eight years. Thousands of people have died. I was really hoping that this would become a matter for memoirs, not for news stories. But that’s not going be the case for some time.” Like many others in the Ukrainian diaspora, Tetyana Vovnyanko, who lives in London, is anxiously monitoring the threat to her family. Vovnyanko, 48, said her brother and most of her other relatives live near Vrubivka, a village between Kyiv and Odessa, which Russian-owned news agencies yesterday reported was shelled by “Russian mercenaries”. She added: “This morning [Tuesday], I spoke with them, and I listened to the Ukrainian analytics, and they said that one of the possible strikes and plans, which Putin has in his mind, will be for the invasion to have Kyiv under Russian troops’ control, and possibly they will be moving towards the town where my family lives. That made me very anxious and nervous.” Vovnyanko, co-founder of British-Ukrainian Aid, which supports people suffering from the armed conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, said the charity might now pivot towards providing medical supplies and warm clothing to territorial defence forces. “If there will be a battle or invasion, they will be helping out the wounded as well.” Petro Chymera, 32, head of the Ukrainian Youth Association in Bradford, said his family were preparing contingency plans to help his sister-in-law’s family in Sumy, a city in north-east Ukraine, seek refuge in the UK. “With it being a frontline town, if there was to be an invasion, there’s that worry and that fear, and contingency plans as to [whether it is] possible to the head to the west of Ukraine towards Kyiv, or, in my family’s case, whether they could come over here.” Musician Peter Solowka, whose band The Ukrainians, was formed a year before Ukraine declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, said the country’s culture of resistance would continue amid the worsening hostilities. The former Wedding Present guitarist, 62, from Oldham, whose father was Ukrainian, said: “The history of Ukrainian culture and music refers to people fighting against oppression. People going off to fight and you cry as you leave your family because you might not come back. “It’s not going to go away just because some tanks turn up in the capital city. There’s been hundreds of years of this culture surviving that sort of thing.”",News/World news,Ukrainians in UK making plans to return home to take up arms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/ukrainians-in-uk-making-plans-to-return-home-to-take-up-arms
2/24/2022,"Thank you Simon Tisdall (The long, bloody history of proxy wars should be a warning to Johnson in Ukraine, 20 February). Boris Johnson’s perennial boosterism is never truthful and I hope this particular mad idea never sees the light of day. Yes, bring Ukraine into Nato and answer Putin’s accusation head-on, or stay entirely out of the argument and protect those states who are already in Nato against the certain interference that will follow. The much criticised offer of helmets by the German government is of the same substance as Johnson’s rhetoric. A proxy war would destroy Ukrainians’ westward, anti-Putin-kleptocracy ambitions.Anthony O’NeillGlasgow   Congratulations to Simon Tisdall for his straight-talking article, largely backing up the wise piece by Simon Jenkins last month (Britain should stay well out of Russia’s border dispute with Ukraine, 20 January). The way out of this crisis isn’t by Johnsonian grandstanding, but by patient diplomacy, as Emmanuel Macron evidently realises, and from the starting point of the Minsk II accords – agreed at the time by Ukraine, but in seven years never implemented. It will happen neither by surrendering to, nor utterly rejecting, the Kremlin’s maximalist demands, but step by step, starting with the running sore of Donbas. It’s clear from Vasyl Filipchuk’s and others’ comments (Ukraine’s leader stood on platform of peace, but finds himself on brink of war, 20 February) that far-sighted Ukrainians realise this too.Robin Milner-GullandWashington, West Sussex  In characterising a hypothetical Ukrainian war of resistance against Russian occupation as a “proxy war” on the part of Britain and other western countries, Simon Tisdall is falling into the colonialist mindset of denying Ukrainians’ own agency and imagining that they would not fight such a war without western support. This is delusional. The idea that postcolonial Ukraine would not fight a war of resistance against an occupation by their former imperial rulers is as ridiculous as the idea that Ireland, Kenya or Vietnam – among many others – would not fight an occupation by theirs. If Russia occupies, there will be a war of resistance until Russia leaves, irrespective of the opinions and actions of foreign governments. Britain can choose to stand up against Russia by arming Ukraine, supporting its entry into Nato and increasing sanctions against Russia, or it can choose to stay neutral in the face of oppression. Either way, Ukrainians will keep fighting for their independence as colonised people always have done and always will do. There can be no peace without justice, in Ukraine or anywhere else.Adam LawsonHackney, London  Short of full-scale invasion at this point, Vladimir Putin may be content to take back Ukraine one bite at a time. He is likely to pause now and see whether the full weight of western sanctions is applied. He can reasonably expect that differences between the US and EU countries will hamper this. If this is the case, he may be willing to delay. A lot can happen in the next few years to his advantage, not least the coming upheaval in the US elections, which could bring a new administration more inclined to let western Europe defend itself. As we are all aware, Putin has wider ambitions than Ukraine and we are entering into an uncertain, if not perilous decade for democracy.David CopseyBrighton  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/24/2022,"As a retired economics teacher who served for 10 years as an examinations officer and a further decade as an exams inspector, I feel able to comment on the current fiasco (Students and teachers in England decry ‘virtually useless’ exams previews, 17 February). The disparity across the student population, both in terms of face to face teaching and individual circumstances, such as computer access and home environment, requires a different approach. Announcing a restricted list of topics four months before the exams is an enormous disadvantage to those who have not yet been able to cover those topics.  A much fairer system would be to set a choice of questions within each of the topics across the whole syllabus. Students and teachers would then be able to choose to answer questions on those parts of the syllabus that they have been able to cover. Students who have been able to study the whole of the syllabus would still have an advantage, but it would not be so great. This system would not wholly compensate in those subjects where there is progressive learning (eg foreign languages); nor would it compensate for the lack of opportunity to develop skills, such as essay writing – but it would be a lot better than what is currently being offered.Dennis JohnsonKempston, Bedford  Managing to avoid the highly regulated and recently reformed A-levels by using Pre-U exams, largely set and marked by teachers in the independent sector, private schools have repeatedly inflated their results, and neither the DfE nor Ofqual seems sufficiently bothered about maintaining even the appearance of a level playing field to intervene.

2/24/2022,"Is he going to look anything like the picture online? Are we going to have anything to talk about? Is this dress too revealing? What if he is an anti-vaxxer? These are all normal anxieties that come with the territory of online dating. Anxieties that I used to smooth over with a few large glasses of white wine before a date. But now … Now is new; now is different. I’ve been out of the dating game for a decade, and in the meantime I quit drinking. Every first date I ever had was in a pub – usually my local, so I had the added safety buffer of knowing all the regulars and the barman. What are you supposed to do on a date if not drink? How do you get up the nerve to kiss them? What am I meant to do if not drink until they get funny or handsome enough for the aforementioned kissing?  There were a bunch of factors at play when I re-entered the dating world last April. We were still in a distanced, “wearing masks in restaurants when walking to your table” type of world. And everyone was out of practice with human contact, let alone first dates. Social anxiety and awkwardness were radiating from people that had been locked inside with their cats or toddlers for a year. I was not yet confident enough with my sobriety to wear it proudly and treat it like a superpower. It was more a tick box at the end of my Bumble profile than something I accentuated, and my initial dates reflected that. I was still trying to date in pubs, like a drinker, rather than doing other activities where we could engage with each other without sharing a bottle or three of wine. I was camouflaging this huge change in my behaviour and life by trying to keep up with their drinking pace with non-alcoholic beers. But I was not enjoying myself at all. I wasn’t looking to date someone else who was sober, but I also didn’t want to date anyone who socially drank like I used to – that is to say, excessively. I didn’t want to sell a false bill of goods, either. I am not someone who goes to museums or the Proms. And pretending to like those things more than I do would end up with those same out-of-sorts feelings. I thought dog walks might be the key to my dating. I have an elderly cavalier King Charles spaniel, McNulty, whom I adore. Dog walks are incredible with people who you are connected to and want to spend hours with. But they are awful for a 45-minute stroll around the heath with a stranger, because there is no eye contact and you are often stopping to pick up dog poo. I ended up going on 18 first dates in April and May last year and didn’t say yes to any second dates. The main thing that was wrong with all of my initial sober dates was me. I was unsure of myself. I was like Bambi, unsteady on my new spindly legs, which meant I had lost a lot of my bravado and charm. I wasn’t owning this new phase of my life. I was just trying to act as if I hadn’t changed at all, and it was not working. So I took a hiatus. I took some time off to own the fact I am a non-drinker and that I don’t want dates that primarily revolve around cocktails. I run food festivals. I love trying new places. Let’s explore restaurants and cuisines that I haven’t experienced. Take me to a trattoria or an oyster bar. Let’s share small plates and connect that way. We can go to a farmers’ market and eat unpasteurised cheese or try guacamole with crickets. Come and watch American football with me – I’ll explain the rules. But be warned: I will always have McNulty in tow. My profile now clearly says that I quit drinking in April 2020. I am upfront in my messaging before meeting anyone that I am not a drinker. I also don’t respond to anyone who is pictured chugging beers or lists wine or cocktails as their interests. I have no problem with drinkers; it’s just not how I want to spend my time, and I have no interest in changing anyone else. Last week, a guy with whom I had been exchanging messages once again ignored that I had told him seven or eight times that I don’t drink. When I called him on it, his response was: “Sorry, I don’t have a record of people I speak to and their individual dietary requirements.” I think I will give that one a miss. I am now once again unapologetically brash and brazen, and me. And still worried that their picture is going to be old and they won’t wear a mask. But the dates are definitely improving. Dru Jaeger, Club Soda co-founder and author of How to Be a Mindful Drinker, gives his tips on sober dating: Consider how you’re presenting yourself on your dating profile. That picture of yourself holding a big cocktail may not tell the story of who you are now. Dating doesn’t equal drinking, so choose venues and activities that you enjoy as a non-drinker. If you do opt for bars and restaurants, check menus in advance to make sure there are good alcohol-free options. Don’t feel under pressure to justify not drinking. You don’t owe your date an explanation. Be unapologetic. If they’re adamant that they’ll only date a drinker, consider it a lucky escape.",Lifestyle/Life and style,I have finally learned how to date without drinking.

2/24/2022,"Nadia Khomami (New play to tell story of Brexit’s ‘bloody difficult women’, 21 February) quotes the actor Jessica Turner – who plays Theresa May in Tim Walker’s play Bloody Difficult Women – as saying the piece feels “very relevant now”. It has struck me as astonishing that theatre has had so little to say about the current crisis in our politics, but maybe in its enfeebled state after the pandemic – with so many venues now relying on government subsidies – it’s been cowed into submission.  This has been a betrayal of what theatre ultimately ought to be about. Throughout history, the arts have often been a bulwark against dodgy governments and fascism. I think in this regard of Arthur Miller daring to write The Crucible in 1953 as a savage and brave indictment of McCarthyism, when the US government persecuted people accused of being communists. I applaud, therefore, Riverside Studios in west London for daring to put on this dramatisation of Gina Miller’s court case against May’s government and for bringing the story bang up to date. I can find no other play like it anywhere. I shall go to see it with high hopes that it will restore my faith in theatre – that it has not yet totally given up on talking about what’s happening in our society and daring to challenge the existing awful order.Muhammed Raza HussainLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/24/2022,"With his incursion into Donetsk and Luhansk, Vladimir Putin has broken international law and destroyed the best negotiating track, the Minsk agreement. That is clear. What is also clear is why he did it. An increasing number of politicians and media analysts claim Putin may be mentally unstable, or that he is isolated in a bubble of yes-men who don’t warn him of dangers ahead. Many commentators say he is trying to restore the Soviet Union or recreate a Russian sphere of influence on his country’s borders, and that this week’s intrusion into eastern Ukraine is the first step towards an all-out attack on Kyiv to topple its government and even move against the Baltic states. None of these assertions is necessarily true.  The Russian president is a rational man with his own analysis of recent European history. Coming from a former Communist, his blaming of Lenin for giving excessive scope to local nationalism in drawing up the Soviet constitution is remarkable. Similarly, his criticism of the way national elites destroyed the Soviet Union in its final years is sharp. Does he want to turn the clock back? People often quote his statement “the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. But it bears pointing out that he enlarged on it later, saying: “Anyone who doesn’t regret the passing of the Soviet Union has no heart. Anyone who wants it restored has no brains.” It is crucially important for those who might seek to end or ameliorate this crisis to first understand his mindset. What happened this week is that Putin lost his patience, and his temper. He is furious with the Ukraine government. He feels it repeatedly rejected the Minsk aagreement, which would give the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk substantial autonomy. He is angry with France and Germany, the co-signatories, and the United States, for not pressing Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to implement them. He is equally angry with the Americans for not taking on board Russia’s security concerns about Nato’s expansion and the deployment of offensive missiles close to Russia’s borders. To those who say Nato is entitled to invite any state to join, Putin argues that the “open door” policy is conditioned by a second principle, which Nato states have accepted: namely that the enhancement of a state’s security should not be to the detriment of the security of other states (such as Russia). As recently as 2010 Barack Obama put his signature to the principle at a summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The summit’s declaration includes a wonderfully idealistic ambition: “We recommit ourselves to the vision of a free, democratic, common and indivisible Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok”. This echoes Mikhail Gorbachev’s plea, when the cold war division of Europe ended, for Russia and other European states to live together in a “common European home”. We now suffer in the shadow of the thwarting of that dream. For Putin, Obama’s signing of the OSCE statement is proof of the hypocrisy that goes back to earlier US presidents, who showed the dishonesty of Nato’s “open door” policy by rejecting Russia’s repeated feelers about joining the alliance. In his speech this week, the Russian leader said he had asked Bill Clinton about the possibility of membership but was fobbed off with the argument that Russia was too big. In 2000, during his first weeks as president, Putin was asked by David Frost on the BBC if it was possible Russia could join Nato. He replied: “I would not rule such a possibility out, if and when Russia’s views are taken into account as those of an equal partner.” George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, recently recalled meeting Putin during his time at Nato: “Putin said, ‘When are you going to invite us to join Nato?’ And [Robertson] said: ‘Well, we don’t invite people to join Nato, they apply to join Nato.’” From outside the alliance, Putin has seen it expand continually. He says he does not seek a revived Soviet Union but a buffer zone that would be, as he put it in a long essay last year, “not anti-Russia”. John Kennedy wanted a similar cordon sanitaire when Khrushchev tried to put nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. Putin suggested on Tuesday that Ukraine should return to the strategy of neutrality that was in the Ukrainian constitution until the “coup” that toppled the Yanukovych government in 2014, and brought pro-US nationalists to power. After all, a majority of Ukrainian MPs then believed that the country’s fragile unity would be more secure if it was not pulled and pushed by rival pressures from Moscow and the west. Nato’s stance over membership for Ukraine was what sparked Russia’s takeover of Crimea in 2014. Putin feared the port of Sevastopol, home of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, would soon belong to the Americans. The western narrative sees Crimea as the first use of force to change territorial borders in Europe since the second world war. Putin sees this as selective amnesia, forgetting that Nato bombed Serbia in 1999 to detach Kosovo and make it an independent state. Convinced that Nato will never reject Ukraine’s membership, Putin has now taken his own steps to block it. By invading Donetsk and Luhansk, he has created a “frozen conflict”, knowing the alliance cannot admit countries that don’t control all their borders. Frozen conflicts already cripple Georgia and Moldova, which are also split by pro-Russian statelets. Now Ukraine joins the list. There is speculation about what will happen next but from his standpoint, it is not actually necessary to send troops further into the country. He has already taken what he needs. Jonathan Steele is a former Moscow correspondent for the Guardian",Opinion/Opinion,Understanding Putin’s narrative about Ukraine is the master key to this crisis | Jonathan Steele,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/23/putin-narrative-ukraine-master-key-crisis-nato-expansionism-frozen-conflict
2/24/2022,"Be ready for a long haul. That was the subtext of Boris Johnson’s message to MPs as he committed to toughening up sanctions against Russia. The warning to prepare for a “protracted struggle” was both timely and appropriate. There will be no quick knockout blow because Vladimir Putin has had time to prepare and is well dug-in.  On the face of it, it should be an unequal fight. Russia is the world’s biggest landmass but has annual output smaller than Italy’s. Income a head is about a quarter of that in the UK. Russia’s economy has gone through distinct phases since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s: an initial shock treatment that resulted in a savage recession and culminated in a financial crisis in 1998; a strong recovery in the first decade of the 21st century on the back of booming oil and gas exports; and a recent period of stagnation as the failure to diversify the economy took its toll. After growing by 7% a year on average in the decade leading up to the global financial crash of 2008, the Russian economy was expanding by only about 2% annually in the three years leading up to the pandemic. The upshot is that – in some respects at least – the economy has not really moved on since the days of the Soviet Union. Russia is still rich in natural resources and human capital but performs sluggishly and has only limited ties with the west. Dr Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at the investment bank Berenberg, said Russia was a major military power and energy producer, but not a relevant market for most countries. Germany, for example, exports far more to Poland than it does to Russia. But, as those who have taken on Russia in the past have found to their cost, appearances can be deceptive and there are a number of reasons why a swift victory by the west looks unlikely. Firstly, Putin has been actively seeking to insulate Russia from the west ever since the invasion of the Crimea in 2014. Western imports of meat, fruit, vegetables and dairy were banned when sanctions were imposed. Secondly, self-sufficiency has been accompanied by an attempt at diversification, with a deliberate policy pivot towards China. An agreement with Beijing – again in 2014 – paved the way for the construction of the Power of Siberia – a gas pipeline linking the two countries that opened in 2019. China is the world’s second-biggest economy and its heavy demand for energy has been one of the factor pushing up global energy prices over the past year. Putin has already given approval for Power of Siberia 2. Thirdly, Russia has used the money received from its oil and gas exports to build up substantial financial defences. Moscow is sitting on foreign currency reserves of about $500bn (£369m) and, by international standards, has extremely low levels of national debt. Whereas the pandemic has sent the UK’s national debt to GDP ratio spiralling above 100%, in Russia it is below 20%. That financial firepower may well blunt one of the weapons the west intends to deploy in response to the crisis in Ukraine: a ban on Russia issuing or trading its sovereign debt in London and New York. The amount of bonds Russia needs to sell is relatively small, and only 10% of the total was bought by non-residents last year. Finally, Putin has some weapons of his own that he may be tempted to use in retaliation against western sanctions. Russia provides 40% of the EU’s oil and coal, and 20% of its gas. It is the world’s biggest exporter of fertiliser and of palladium, a crucial component for the auto industry because it is needed to make catalytic converters. The Kiel Institute, a German thinktank, says stopping gas exports would knock 3% off Russian GDP while ending oil exports would result in a 1.2% hit. While western countries would be able to source their energy elsewhere, a reduction in supply would inevitably lead to rising oil and gas prices. Even during the tensest periods of the cold war, the Soviet Union continued to supply energy to the west. Cutting off oil and gas supplies would come at a heavy cost but be an example of a strategy deployed before in the country’s history: scorched-earth policy.",News/World news,Why a swift economic victory against Russia looks unlikely,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/why-a-swift-economic-victory-against-russia-unlikely-sanctions
2/24/2022,"Joe Biden has interviewed at least three potential supreme court nominees and is expected to reveal his decision by the end of this month, according to multiple sources close to the president. Ketanji Brown Jackson, Leondra Kruger and J. Michelle Childs – all Black women – were among the contenders who spoke with the president, those familiar with the matter told CNN and the Washington Post.  Jackson, who has widely been considered the frontrunner, currently sits on the US court of appeals for the DC circuit after replacing the attorney general, Merrick Garland, in June 2021. Kruger is an associate justice of the California supreme court and has served as the acting principal deputy solicitor general under the Barack Obama administration. Childs currently sits on the US district court for the district of South Carolina and was previously nominated by Biden for a seat on the DC circuit court of appeals. The impending retirement of supreme court associate justice Stephen Breyer has given Biden has the opportunity to fulfill one of his campaign promises: to appoint a Black woman to the supreme court. On Sunday evening Cedric L Richmond, director of the White House office of public engagement, told members of the organization Win With Black Women that “we’re close”. “We know what some of the attacks are going to be: not qualified, affirmative action pick… Well, it wasn’t ‘affirmative action pick’ when we just picked friends, white friends of the president, for all these decades. You know, it was just patronage or whatever they wanted to call it,” Richmond said, according to a source who has direct knowledge of the private conference call. Biden, who is dealing with a growing crisis between Ukraine and Russia, has set the end of February as his deadline to pick a nominee. According to CNN, White House officials have reached out to liberal groups to inform them that Biden will not be shifting from his timeline and urged them to support “top tier” candidates against critics’ attacks. In a statement on Tuesday, Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, said Biden has not yet made a decision. “The President has not yet chosen a nominee. He continues to evaluate eminently qualified individuals in the mold of Justice [Stephen] Breyer who have the strongest records, intellect, character, and dedication to the rule of law that anyone could ask for - and all of whom would be deserving of bipartisan support. He looks forward to announcing a nominee this month.”",News/Law,Biden interviews three Black women as potential supreme court picks – reports,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/23/supreme-court-nominations-latest-biden-interviews-black-female-judges
2/24/2022,"Ukrainians are buying guns, ammunition and sniper rifles ahead of a possible Russian invasion, with long queues inside weapons stores on Wednesday. With a state of emergency set to be unveiled, the country’s parliament approved a draft law that gives Ukrainians permission to carry firearms. Previously they were forbidden from leaving home with lethal weapons.  Most Ukrainians – boys and girls – learn how to shoot at school. About 400,000 people are estimated to have combat experience, following Vladimir Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the Moscow-supported armed uprising in the east. But the threat in recent days of a possible attack on Kyiv has caused an unprecedented rush to buy arms. Gun shops have sold out of some weapons, such as AR-10 and AR-15 assault rifles, with business now exceptionally busy. “Of course I’m worried about the situation,” Dariia Olexandrivna said, speaking in the basement Praporshyk gun store, in central Kyiv’s Pushkin street. “I’m hoping for the best but preparing for everything.” Olexandrivna said she and her husband began taking shooting lessons six months ago, when tensions with Moscow grew. They owned two handguns. She had come to buy 400 rubber bullets. “I saw Putin’s speech on Monday. I think he’s stupid enough to do it. He hates Ukrainian people,” she said. Two weeks ago she packed the car with clothes, medicines, food, water and extra shoes. “My two children speak only Ukrainian. They don’t speak any Russian. If it’s no longer safe for us we will leave,” she said. Where would she go? “The west of the country, somewhere,” she replied. Over the past 24 hours the Ukrainian government has taken enhanced security measures, having previously downplayed the likelihood of conflict. Restrictions on movement, mass gatherings, political meetings, and concerts and sports matches, are being proposed. In a speech on Tuesday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the mobilisation of reserves – beginning with 36,000 people, with veterans recalled to active duty. He also told Ukrainian citizens to leave Russia. Dmytro Skatrovsky said he had not been notified by text but had turned up anyway outside the Svyatoshynskyi recruitment centre, in western Kyiv. He spent three years in the army and took part in the 2014 battle to evict separatists from the port city of Mariupol, he said. “I’ve bought two sniper complexes with good optics,” he added. “I’ve also ordered a drone on Amazon. It hasn’t turned up yet.” Skatrovsky said a group of friends had chipped in to get the rifles – at a cost of $10,000 (£7,370). US contacts had paid $2,300 for the drone, he said. The Ukrainian military gave veterans guns, but the process was slow and bureaucratic, he explained. “We can win against Russia. This isn’t 2014,” he said. “We have heavy weapons, thanks to US and UK. If they come we will shoot at them from every window.” Territorial defence courses, where ordinary citizens can learn to shoot are heavily oversubscribed. Buying a gun is legal so long as it more than 80cm in length, with weapons freely available. Police confirm Ukrainians are buying large amounts of ammunition. In February alone 10,000 firearms were registered. Overall, the country has more than 700,000 legal gun owners, the Kyiv defence reporter Illia Ponomarenko tweeted on Wednesday. In 🇺🇦Ukraine, large amounts of ammo is being purchased by civilians, police say.10,000 firearms items have been registered in February alone. In general, the country has over 700,000 legal gun owners. At the Stvol gun store around a dozen men were waiting patiently in front of a glass counter. The shop sells rifles, pistols, knives, and camping gear, as well as cumbersome safes and a medium-sized brass model of a wild boar. The owner said he had been told not to speak. One customer, Zhenya Nedashkvskyi, said he had dropped in to buy a pump action shotgun. “It won’t stop the Russians,” he admitted. “I want to protect my house from looters. The situation has become hot. It could get worse.” Nedashkvskyi said he would like to protect his elderly parents who live in the city of Smila in the Cherkasy region, about 200km (124 miles) south of the capital. He said he had his eye on a Turkish-made Veryon model, costing 17,520 Ukrainian hryvnia – about $600. “I’ll get that or similar,” he said. Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said guns had long been part of national culture. “People are not storming petrol stations or stores but they are buying weapons to protect themselves. That’s a good sign.” He added: It shows that the country is not scared. The nation is ready to fight, if it needs to.” A few shoppers, however, said they were not worried about the situation or the prospect of a looming Kremlin offensive. Alex – a 23-year-old casino manager, who declined to give his second name – said he was buying a sniper file for his father, a keen hunter. “I’m still calm,” he said. He added: “Guns are popular in Ukraine. We all get classes at school on how to shoot. My father has a big collection of weapons already. The rifle is a gift for him.” Asked what would happen if Russian troops did turn up, he said: “I think our people will shoot back.”",News/World news,Business brisk at Kyiv gun shops as Ukrainians rush to buy arms ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/business-brisk-at-kyiv-gun-shops-as-ukrainians-rush-to-buy-arms
2/24/2022,"The former On the Buses and EastEnders actor Anna Karen has died in a fire at her east London home. Firefighters rushed to the blaze on the ground floor of a terrace house in Windsor Road, Ilford, shortly after 10.30pm on Tuesday.  It took them less than an hour to bring the fire under control but, by that time, Karen was already dead. The cause remains under investigation. Karen, 85, was best known for playing Olive in the 1970s sitcom On the Buses, as well as her recurring role as Aunt Sal, the sister of Peggy Mitchell, played by Barbara Windsor, in EastEnders. She was a lifelong friend of Windsor, who died in December 2020. Karen’s friends and former colleagues paid tribute to the actor. The singer Cheryl Baker tweeted: “I have just heard the awful news that my fabulous mate, #AnnaKaren has died in a house fire. “What an horrific way to die, I can’t bear to think about it. I adored her – she was an absolute treasure, both on and off the screen.” The EastEnders star Rita Simons, who played Roxy Mitchell, said: “I just heard the awful news about the wonderful Anna Karen. Horrific and awful and so so sad. She was one of the best. Sleep well lovely Anna. Sending all my love to her family and friends.” The broadcaster Kay Burley said: “Terribly sad news that Anna Karen – Olive from On the Buses – has died in tragic circumstances. May she rest in peace. She was 85.” Neighbours raised the alarm after seeing smoke billowing from her front door, the MailOnline reported. Sivalai Pavananthakumar, 33, told the website: “There was a lot of smoke, and flames, people in the street had seen what was happening and came out to try and help. “The fire brigade and police were here quickly and kicked down the door, there was so much smoke.” He added: “I recognised her and would see her every day when I took my children to school. She was a nice old lady and always said hello.” Another neighbour added: “I knew her from EastEnders, it was like having a celebrity living in the street. She was a lovely old lady and always spoke to everyone.” A London fire brigade spokesperson said three fire engines and about 20 firefighters from Ilford and Barking attended the blaze.",News/UK news,EastEnders and On the Buses star Anna Karen dies in London house fire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/23/eastenders-and-on-the-buses-star-anna-karen-dies-in-london-house-fire
2/24/2022,"“The thing we all knew was going to happen continues to happen at a slightly faster pace,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday evening, hours after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, in a sharp escalation of already sky-high tensions.  Putin had already unilaterally declared the breakaway Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics on Monday. “Smart – he declares them independent and then when he sends troops in, he can technically say, ‘That’s not an invasion of Ukraine, because that’s not Ukraine any more,’” the Late Show host said. “And at this point, Putin’s most important weapon is his Sharpie” for redrawing the map. Putin has claimed the troops are for carrying out “peacekeeping functions” – “and it’s true,” said Colbert, describing the logic as: “I keep this piece of Ukraine, I keep that piece of Ukraine, I keep all the pieces of Ukraine, I am piece-keeping.” In response to aggression along the border with Ukraine, the US government had imposed some economic sanctions, barring new investment, trade and financing by US persons to, from, or in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. “Well, that’s a disaster for anyone invested in the Ukrainian coffee chain Dunkin’ Donetsk,” Colbert joked. But on Tuesday, Joe Biden changed tune: the US government imposed full blockage sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions and on their sovereign debt, which cut off the Kremlin from western financing. “So that means no Russian money can come into the US. There goes Tucker Carlson’s sponsors,” Colbert quipped. In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked the botched launch of Donald Trump’s app Truth Social, which is supposed to be his alternative to Twitter. “You’re not going to believe this but the rollout did not go well,” Kimmel explained. “Some might even call it a total disaster. “Truth Social has been such a disappointment so far that Trump may have to rename it to Don Jr.” The app’s initial sign-up function failed for many people, with an error message that read: “Something went wrong, please try again.” “Which applies to so many things Trump is involved with,” said Kimmel. “Then they changed it to say they put you on a waitlist, because of what they claimed was massive demand. “It’s like if Trump designed a bridge that collapsed and said, ‘Oh, the bridge was just too popular. Too many people wanted to drive on my fantastic bridge,’” he joked. That wasn’t the only snafu; as Kimmel pointed out, the Truth Social logo was copied from the logo for a British company called Trailar. “You know, there’s a lot of conversation about Trump being a fascist and trying to overthrow an election, all that stuff, and rightfully so,” said Kimmel, ‘“but I think we sometimes forget: he’s a terrible business man, too.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers laughed at Putin’s labeling of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine as “peacekeepers” – “specifically, they’re keeping this piece,” he said. He also characterized severe new economic sanctions on Russia in response to the troop movement as: “From now on, Russia doesn’t get the new Wordle until noon. “Russian Wordle is very easy,” he added, “because it’s always ‘Putin’.” Meyers also touched on a New York Times op-ed titled “Ignoring a text message or email isn’t always rude. Sometimes it’s necessary.” “I think I speak for everyone when I say: k,” he noted. And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon also discussed the Russian invasion of proxy states in eastern Ukraine. “Biden gave a speech at the White House and said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has officially begun,” Fallon noted. “Biden said: ‘We will not put up with Russian aggression, especially on such an important national holiday: Twosday.’” Biden also announced tough new sanctions, with the EU expected to follow suit. “Yeah, nothing stops a dictator in his tracks like raising his ATM fees,” Fallon joked. On a lighter note, the AP international reporter Philip Crowther went viral for posting a video in which he reported from Kiev, Ukraine in six different languages: French, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German and Luxembourgish. “He also knows six different ways to say, ‘I’m ready to leave Ukraine now, this could be a Zoom,’” Fallon quipped.",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Russia sanctions: ‘There goes Tucker Carlson’s sponsors’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/23/stephen-colbert-russia-sanctions-late-show-recap
2/24/2022,"Two men in their late 30s and three teenagers were like “a pack” as they hunted down a 14-year-old boy in broad daylight before he was fatally stabbed, a murder trial has heard. One of the attackers shouted that they were “going to get the black bastard” as they chased Dea-John Reid through the Kingstanding area of Birmingham, the court heard.  An elderly woman screamed: “They have stabbed him, they have stabbed him,” after the attack, which took place in front of several witnesses, Birmingham crown court heard on Wednesday. George Khan, 39, and Michael Shields, 36, are on trial with three teenagers who were aged 14, 14 and 16 at the time of the incident last May. They all deny murder. Footage of the moment Dea-John was stabbed on College Road was played to the jury. The prosecution said it showed all five defendants chasing him and then running away after it happened. Prosecutor Richard Wormald QC said: “The evidence you are about to hear shows that acting as a group, they went to look for Dea-John Reid and after finding him in a park in Kingstanding, chased and caught up with him. He was then stabbed in the chest. “The prosecution’s case is that all five are responsible for his murder because the evidence quite clearly shows that all five acted together. They acted collectively. “It can be inferred from the evidence that all must have intended to cause Dea-John serious harm, and each knew when they began their pursuit of him that such harm was likely.” The now 15-year-old boy who is alleged to have stabbed Dea-John was motivated by “revenge” for an incident that took place earlier in the day, the court heard. He armed himself with a kitchen knife before Khan allegedly drove all five to “hunt him down”. Wormald said of Khan and Shields. “They are much older – in their late 30s – and as you listen to the evidence you may think that their behaviour in positively participating in the attack is nothing short of a disgrace.” He continued: “The killing happened in broad daylight. It was a revenge attack for events that had happened earlier in the day involving the three younger defendants. They sought help in the form of the two older male defendants.” Wormald said Khan “actively encouraged the attack” once Dea-John was found. “It was a group attack, during which they each played their part, running after Dea-John Reid, blocking off his escape routes and enabling [one of the youths] to chase down and fatally stab Dea-John Reid to the left side of his chest. “The defendants acted like a pack, chasing down their prey.” None of the group offered support or comfort to the boy, Wormald told jurors. “They simply left him to die.” Wormald said one witness who had just got off a bus in College Road recalled seeing “about five guys chasing a black boy, with one of them shouting that they were ‘going to get the black bastard’”. Another witness had spoken of how he saw Dea-John “hold his stomach and collapse” after seeing two white males chase him. The incident took place on 31 May last year. Shields, of Castle Bromwich, and Khan, of Birmingham, and the three youths, who cannot be named because of their age, all deny murder. Hollie Davies, 36, of Birmingham, denies assisting an offender.

2/24/2022,"I work in a recruitment company. I am male. I enjoy my job, I’m quite driven and I’m looking to get promoted within the company. The issue is that I’m starting to notice that my female peers aren’t treated as nicely as us men and I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid I will be made redundant if I speak up as they’ve been making redundancies getting rid of the “inconvenient” people. I’ve witnessed my female colleagues being put in a position where they had to justify their actions that were the same as other male colleagues. Female managers have to put extra effort into putting their point across and the HR is barely existent. I’d gladly speak to the CEO, but he acts like a bully. I’ve witnessed him excluding people in the pettiest ways. He’d buy everyone coffee, except for one person. It bothers me, but I’m not feeling safe enough to discuss this in the office. I’m afraid I’ll be seen as weak and inconvenient.** Edited for brevity.  Eleanor says: It’s good that you’ve noticed this and named it for what it is. A lot of people would prefer not to – they’d find ways to topiary the evidence into something that looks less unfair, choosing to believe it’s a coincidence that the “bad workers” or “difficult people” are women. The question of what to do next depends on what your goal is, and it’s worth being really specific. One goal might be to confront the people responsible for this culture so they feel challenged and held accountable – like someone’s seen them in their piggish unfairness. It’s delicious to fantasise about that goal, imagining exactly what you’d say – or even tastier, what they’d say – when you held up the mirror to their behaviour. I think that’s the sort of goal you’re wondering about whether to pursue; you talk about “speaking up”, going to see the CEO, discussing it in the office or even with HR. Unfortunately, this kind of change has a high “degree of difficulty”. Think about what we already know: we know the people responsible for this are bad at responding to evidence (otherwise they wouldn’t have this attitude towards women); we know they’re bad at handling conflict (otherwise they wouldn’t pick on people in these petty ways); we know they’re uninterested in the possibility of improving (otherwise there’d be a feedback system or an avenue for anonymous reporting). With those as our data points for the psychology of the culprits, I’m pessimistic that you’d be able to talk – or confront – them into changing. Besides, if trying to extract accountability from them puts them in a bad mood, it’ll be the women around you who suffer its spray. But you can still hold on to the goal to change things. Here’s a lesson many people learn when they have to band together under an oppressive eye: you don’t have to announce what you’re doing for it to be an effective form of resistance. I wonder if you could make it your goal to change things in ways that will – by design – escape the culprits’ notice. I promise you the women in the office are wise to what’s going on. Given that, how can you materially make their lives easier? Are there tasks you can take off their plate; private ways you can give credit for work well done? Are there moments you can increase airtime for women in an interaction – “I think Sandra mentioned this earlier, but …?” Instead of trying to cut the unfairness off at the source, you could start by trying to minimise its impact on particular people. It takes very little to privately signal to someone “I saw that too”, but to that person, the sense of being seen is anything but small. In time, these small acts of solidarity might embolden you to do more. The way gender warps your workplace is going to be a lot more complicated than some sexist “bad apples”: together you’ll be fighting a robust history of pay gaps, harassment, stereotyping, and worse. But if you focus on lessening the way those things affect specific people you might find it less daunting to start making change.

2/24/2022,"Rosie Batty has been talking about family violence since 2014, which is when her only son, Luke, was murdered by his father at a cricket match. With no experience being in the public eye, the single mother learned fast who to trust in the media and who to avoid. During her 12 months as the Australian of the Year in 2015, she spoke in public about the culture of violence 300 times.  Seven years later, Batty is joining the ranks of the media, asking other accidental heroes to open up on a new series of the ABC’s interview show One Plus One. “When Luke first got killed, I think you’re in shock, and there’s a whole stack of media and you just talk to anybody,” Batty said ahead of Thursday’s One Plus One launch. “And then you start to recognise some really stupid questions and you could feel your irritation and impatience start to come in. And you think, you know what? I really need to really be mindful of who I am speaking to.” Batty’s advocacy and bravery, driven by the horrific circumstances of her 11-year-old son’s death, forced governments to seriously rethink their approach to tackling family violence and made her a household name. Her most bruising media experience came early on when she found herself listening through an earpiece to comments made on TV by News Corp Australia columnist Joe Hildebrand, who said there was no excuse for not reporting child abuse. Waiting in the wings to talk about her fundraising efforts, Batty was asked by Studio 10 producers to respond to Hildebrand live on air. “I just heard victim-blaming statements and I was so, so angry,” Batty says now. She came on via a live cross and said: “This is beyond my comprehension that again the woman who’s the victim is punished.” She told Hildebrand he was “so misguided”. “I came off air thinking, oh my God, what did I do? I’m really embarrassed that I’d been so angry.” Hildebrand later apologised for upsetting Batty but did not resile from insisting women should report their partners for child abuse. So when Karl Stefanovic’s ill-fated panel show The Verdict came calling years later Batty just laughed. They wanted her to be on a panel with Mark Latham who had criticised her publicly. “Karl invited me on and I thought – don’t be so pathetic. I just couldn’t be bothered. I think I learned a long time ago to let other people have those divisive conversations. I learned how to pick my times to speak.” It wasn’t the media attention that wore Batty down, so much as the persistent pleas for help from members of the public who were facing family violence. “One of the most overwhelming parts that you can’t sustain is people reaching out to you in crisis with some really horrific stories which you can’t really fix and you can’t necessarily save or intervene,” she says. “Concerned parents, grandmothers or family members reaching out to me as if I would have another suggestion of what they can do. And at end of the day, as imperfect as the system we have is, it is what we have.” Batty says hosting One Plus One is a “good fit” for her because she genuinely loves talking to people. “I’m not trying to be Stan Grant, I am just trying to give people the space and time they need and know when to relate and join in with a comment.” The series kicks off on Thursday with another former Australian of the Year, Richard “Harry” Harris, who helped rescue the boys’ soccer team stuck in a Thai cave, and includes comedian Hannah Gadsby, writer and artist Amani Haydar, cook and food writer Stephanie Alexander, performer and domestic violence campaigner Russell Vickery and Frances Rings, the incoming artistic director of Bangarra Dance Theatre. She will also be talking to gun control advocate Walter Mikac, who lost his wife and two children in the massacre at Port Arthur. “If anyone would understand my pain and my journey, it would be him,” Batty says. So, has all the talking made any difference, five years on from the Victorian royal commission into family violence? “If you lodge a breach of an intervention order with Victoria police now it is much more likely to be taken seriously,” she says. “We have improved enormously from previous generations when family violence was seen as an interruption to police business. What keeps me motivated to keep going is when you look back you can see that you are constantly moving forward. It doesn’t feel like that at the time but you are.” One Plus One starts Thursday 24 February at 9.30pm on ABC.",News/Media,Rosie Batty will avoid ‘divisive conversations’ when hosting ABC’s One Plus One ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/24/rosie-batty-plans-to-avoid-divisive-conversations-when-hosting-abcs-one-plus-one
2/24/2022,"Rising global temperatures have shifted at least twice the amount of freshwater from warm regions towards the Earth’s poles than previously thought as the water cycle intensifies, according to new analysis. Climate change has intensified the global water cycle by up to 7.4% – compared to previous modelling estimates of 2% to 4%, research published in the journal Nature suggests.  The water cycle describes the movement of water on Earth – it evaporates, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain or snow and falls again to the surface. “When we learn about the water cycle, traditionally we think of it as some unchanging process which is constantly filling and refilling our dams, our lakes, and our water sources,” the study’s lead author, Dr Taimoor Sohail of the University of New South Wales, said. But scientists have long known that rising global temperatures are intensifying the global water cycle, with dry subtropical regions likely to get drier as freshwater moves towards wet regions. Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report concluded that climate change will cause long-term changes to the water cycle, resulting in stronger and more frequent droughts and extreme rainfall events. Sohail said the volume of extra freshwater that had already been pushed to the poles as a result of an intensifying water cycle was far greater than previous climate models suggest. “Those dire predictions that were laid out in the IPCC will potentially be even more intense,” he said. The scientists estimate the volume of extra freshwater that shifted from warmer regions between 1970 and 2014 is between 46,000 and 77,000 cubic kms. “That’s 123 times the [volume of] Sydney Harbour,” Sohail said. “We’re seeing higher water cycle intensification than we were expecting, and that means we need to move even more quickly towards a path of net zero emissions.” The team used ocean salinity as a proxy for rainfall in their research. “The ocean is actually more salty in some places and less salty in other places,” Sohail said. “Where rain falls on the ocean, it tends to dilute the water so it becomes less saline … Where there is net evaporation, you end up getting salt left behind.” The researchers had to account for the mixing of water due to ocean currents. “We developed a new method that basically tracks … how the ocean is moving around with reference to this freshening or salinification,” Sohail said. “It’s kind of like a rain gauge that’s in constant motion.” Dr Richard Matear, a chief research scientist in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, who was not involved in the research, said the study suggested existing climate modelling has underestimated the potential impacts of climate change on the water cycle. “There’s been a dramatic uplift in our ability to monitor the ocean,” he said. “Observational datasets [like those used in the study] are really ripe for revisiting how global warming is changing the climate system, and the implications it might have on important things like the hydrological cycle.”",News/Environment,"Climate change is intensifying Earth’s water cycle at twice the predicted rate, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/climate-change-is-intensifying-earths-water-cycle-at-twice-the-predicted-rate-research-shows
2/24/2022,"A fifth of Australia’s major coal, gas and oil facilities emit significantly more greenhouse gas than originally estimated in government approval processes, an investigation has found. In the worst cases, some fossil fuel developments now emit more than 20 times what was expected before they were given the green light, according to a report by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF).  Campaigners say the emissions blowout, documented in an 18-month project by ACF researchers and Australian National University students, demonstrates a lack of proper regulation of carbon pollution at a state or federal level. While emissions estimates are included in many development applications, there is no requirement that companies keep their carbon pollution to the estimated level. The ACF lead environmental investigator, Annica Schoo, said it was evidence policies that were promised to keep a lid on industrial emissions, such as the federal government’s safeguard mechanism, were not effective in their current form. She said that no state or federal authority was dealing with the issue adequately despite some attempts by the New South Wales independent planning commission. “These emissions blowouts matter because the extra pollution is supercharging our climate problem,” she said. “I don’t think we can expect companies to know exactly what their emissions are going to be in advance, but I think it needs to be in the ballpark of what is approved. One in five polluting significantly more than estimated is not in the ballpark. “When a company says it will knock down three trees and it knocks down four, that’s a problem that regulators deal with. Why isn’t carbon emitted into the atmosphere being treated in the same way?” The most significant gap between estimated and actual emissions was found to be at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in northern Western Australia. Over four years it released the equivalent of 16m tonnes more carbon dioxide than the company forecast in an environmental impact statement submitted to the state government, according to the ACF report. The emissions at Gorgon have even exceeded what the company said would be the worst case scenario if a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at the site – under which emissions from a gas well are pumped back underground, not released into the atmosphere – had not worked. A Chevron spokesperson did not directly respond to questions on the difference between Gorgon’s estimated emissions at the approval stage and in practice, but said after a delayed start it had now stored 5.5m tonnes in total. It was the main reason that emissions at Gorgon fell 30% in 2019-20, the spokesperson said. Jackson Balme, one of the ANU students involved in the investigation, said they read environment impact statements for hundreds of projects to compare emissions estimates with actual recorded carbon pollution, but only 48 had complete data. They contacted the owners of 11 facilities that had underestimated their carbon pollution but only one responded, and it was deemed not to have provided sufficient information to explain the discrepancy. ACF said their findings were verified by its investigations team, including former federal department staff members. Guardian Australia asked the Morrison government and relevant federal departments and agencies a series of questions about the ACF report. A spokesperson from the Clean Energy Regulator said: “The Clean Energy Regulator has looked at the report. It contains errors of fact and analytical flaws. We will respond to those in due course.” Examples of emissions discrepancies cited in the report include Anglo American’s Grosvenor metallurgical coalmine in central Queensland which started mining again this week, 21 months after a gas explosion seriously injured five workers. The coalmine was previously emitting about double the emissions that were estimated when it was approved. Schoo said it was a clear example of the failure of the safeguard mechanism, which the Coalition promised would prevent increases in industrial emissions effectively wiping out cuts from a taxpayer-funded offset scheme, the $4.5bn emissions reduction fund. In practice, companies have often been allowed to increase their carbon pollution under the safeguard without penalty. Analysis by the research firm RepuTex found emissions covered by the safeguard had increased 7% since it began in 2016. Industry representatives and climate activists have said it made the scheme a waste of time. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ACF report said an Anglo American emissions reduction project next to the Grosvenor mine that captures methane – a potent greenhouse gas – and burns it to make electricity had received about $5m from the government to avoid about 460,000 tonnes of emissions. At the same time, the mine was found to have emitted 2.5m tonnes more than would have been expected when it was approved. Its emissions limit under the safeguard mechanism – known as a baseline – had been set above the initial estimate. This was allowed because the limit was set independently of the pre-development estimate. “It’s a really good example of the safeguard mechanism failing,” Schoo said. “We’re spending a lot of taxpayer’s money on the emissions reduction fund, on offsets, but we are not dealing with this really low-hanging fruit when it comes to preventing carbon pollution entering the atmosphere in the first place.”",News/Environment,"A fifth of Australia’s fossil fuel facilities emit more greenhouse gas than originally estimated, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/a-fifth-of-australias-fossil-fuel-facilities-emit-more-greenhouse-gas-than-originally-estimated-report-says
2/24/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was convinced of only one thing this week as news came of an $8bn bid to buy the country’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter in order to shut its coal plants early. “Let me be really clear about something,” Morrison said. “We need to ensure that our coal-fired generation of electricity runs to its life, because if it doesn’t, electricity prices go up, they don’t go down.”  A more unequivocal statement would be hard to come by. But is Morrison right? “There might be some truth to it, but that fundamentally creates the wrong picture,” says Tony Wood, an energy and climate policy expert at the Grattan Institute. So what’s actually happening? Last weekend it emerged that tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset management company Brookfield had launched their extraordinary takeover bid for energy generator and retailer AGL. The AGL board knocked the bid back, and now the Cannon-Brookes consortium is weighing up its next steps. Wood says if AGL was taken over under a rough timeframe set out by Cannon-Brookes, this would give Australia’s energy market about eight years’ notice to plan and prepare (that’s a lot longer than the statutory three and half years). “So even if there is a price increase – and it’s not clear there would be – then what happens to replace those coal plants is what will dictate prices. But prices don’t always just go up – that’s not true. But there is an underlying market reaction.” Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert at the University of Melbourne says Morrison’s statement had an inbuilt assumption that “nothing else gets built to replace the coal plants” when that isn’t what is being proposed. But first, what does Cannon-Brookes want to do? AGL has three large coal-fired power plants that currently emit about 40.5m tonnes of CO2 a year, according to data from the Clean Energy Regulator. Two of them – Loy Yang A in Victoria and Bayswater in New South Wales – occupy the top two places on a list of the country’s highest emitting power stations. Loy Yang A is Victoria’s biggest power station and releases 16.6 Mt of CO2 into the atmosphere a year from burning brown coal. Earlier this year AGL said it would bring forward its planned closure from 2048 to 2045. AGL’s black coal power station at Bayswater – the state’s biggest power asset – emits 14 Mt a year. The company wants to close it between 2030 and 2033 – at least two years ahead of a previous 2035 plan. A third power station – Liddel, close to Bayswater – will start shutting this year, meaning an end to the 9.9Mt of CO2 that’s released annually from burning black coal. Cannon-Brookes – an outspoken advocate for climate action and renewable energy – and his partners want all the coal plants closed by about 2030. He says the consortium has $20bn to spend to replace the electricity generated by the coal plants with renewable energy and storage, saying confidently this would lower prices, not lift them. From a climate change perspective, the broad challenge facing governments around the world is to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When Morrison said this week the government was “very committed” to running coal plants until the end of their lives, it’s a good time to remember the government has signed an international climate agreement “to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible.” The ongoing AGL story came after a major announcement last week that Origin was to bring forward the closure of its Eraring coal plant station – Australia’s biggest power station – to 2025. That’s seven years earlier than expected. This set up the intriguing dynamic of Australia’s emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, expressing his “bitter disappointment” that a plant that pumps out 13 Mt of CO2 a year was going to close early. Taylor also took the opportunity to remind Australians that after the sudden 2017 closure of the Hazelwood coal plant in Victoria – at the time the country’s dirtiest power station – power prices went up by 85%. Cause = effect? The conclusion some might draw is closing a coal plant earlier than expected causes prices to go up. But McConnell says the Hazelwood story is an “ingrained narrative” that’s too simplistic and mostly wrong. Power prices did go up around the time of the Hazelwood closure but McConnell says the dominant cause was the international price of gas and the way Australia’s electricity market works. McConnell led a study looking at those price rises. He says while Hazelwood closing did have some direct effect, what was far more important was that owners of coal plants in the electricity market knew that gas was expensive. This led some to strategically “shadow price” their gas-fired competitors to make offers to supply electricity at higher costs that were just short of the price of gas. McConnell adds it’s a more complicated set of events than the simpler idea of one thing (the closure of Hazelwood) leading to another (higher prices). “It’s more complex to explain that opening up the gas export market to international prices then flowed into the domestic electricity market. But that’s much closer to the truth of what happened.”",News/Environment,Scott Morrison says closing coal power stations will drive up electricity prices.

2/24/2022,"Three days on from the spectacular shutdown of Sydney’s train system, significant questions have emerged about the role played by the transport minister, David Elliott. While the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, insisted on Wednesday that he still had confidence in Elliott, he rebuked his failure to tell members of the government of the looming crisis and for the decision to go to bed while the department scrambled to resolve industrial action taken by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU).  “The minister will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7,” Perrottet said. “That’s my expectation as premier.” Substantial gaps and contradictions remain in the timeline leading up to the decision to close the network. Transport for NSW has refused to answer questions about when the minister was briefed, and Elliott has at times offered contradictory statements about when he was informed. The Guardian has attempted to summarise the key questions raised this week, and what we know about the situation to date. The events leading up to the decision to close the network have become a matter of contention, and Elliott has offered different versions of what occurred. At a press conference on Tuesday, Elliott said that he had gone to bed between 11pm and 12am on Sunday night, and had not been aware of the looming shutdown when he went to sleep. However, at an earlier press conference on Monday he told reporters he had become aware of it “late last night”. “That could have been very early this morning, it’s been a very long evening,” he said. It was certainly after 11pm that he went to sleep, because at 11.10pm he posted a photo to his personal Facebook account of NSW police officers attending a Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras event. Some officers in the photo were dressed as nuns, and in his post Elliott accused them of mocking and vilifying the Catholic church. “A sad day,” he wrote. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Elliott has not revealed when his last contact with the department was, but Labor has pointed to a leaked text message sent by his chief of staff to senior transport officials at 10.43pm stating he had “been briefed and is happy with our position” as proof the minister must have known more. However, Elliott denied the message showed he was told about the shutdown, saying the text referred only to “significant interruptions” on the network and not a full shutdown. While he admitted he had an “inkling” of what may occur, he defended not informing the premier or other members of the government about the shutdown “because I had no confirmation and I didn’t know exactly what action Transport for NSW would be taking”. As Elliott slept, the transport department continued to scramble. While Elliott has denied being aware of the shutdown, he has insisted he would have followed departmental advice that running the rail network under conditions imposed by the RTBU would be unsafe. He has said the key decision-maker was the Sydney Trains chief executive, Matt Longland, who reportedly made the decision to close the network at 12.43am. However, in its 1.50am statement Transport for NSW said it had been “clear at midnight” that it would not be possible to “safely operate train services”. Crucially, under NSW law transport officials are required to inform the minister before any significant developments in relation to the transit network, and the government is now investigating whether that notification occurred.

The RTBU and the government have been locked in an ongoing industrial dispute for months, and the union first flagged on Wednesday last week its intention to begin further action due to what it called “pushback” on its key demands around pay, privatisation and safety. The union flagged a series of planned industrial actions including a ban on overtime, changes to master rosters and altered working conditions. On Friday the government filed a dispute in the Fair Work Commission seeking to halt planned industrial action by the RTBU, citing “significant disruptions to customer journeys” and “economic harm” to the state’s economy. The Transport for NSW secretary, Rob Sharp, said the government was seeking to avoid “difficulties the travelling public will face over the next two weeks”, but did not flag the potential for a network-wide shutdown. The RTBU secretary, Alex Claassens, told the Guardian negotiations in the commission began on Saturday morning. At the same time, Elliott was in Darwin in his capacity as veterans affairs minister. On Saturday he posted a photo to his personal Facebook account drinking a beer with the prime minister, Scott Morrison. In the commission, both sides believed they had struck a deal by about 8pm on Saturday night. The union said it agreed to drop some of its planned actions, including a ban on overtime and to only work to a “master roster”. At 8.33pm the union released a statement saying the agreement “provides Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink the ability to safely run services from Monday”. However, it said it did “not mean an end to protected industrial action”. The exact wording of the agreement reached on Saturday was not released, but both parties have offered differing versions of what followed. What is known is that by Sunday evening, the government had decided to return to the commission. Both Elliott and Perrottet accused the union of not appearing at Sunday’s negotiations, although Elliott himself was not here. Claassens was also absent, though lawyers and other union representatives were present. The government accused the union of going back on the terms of the Saturday deal. The industrial relations minister, Damien Tudehope, told the ABC that the RTBU had “walked away” from the deal. But others have offered conflicting views. Elliott himself blamed a “misinterpretation” of what had been agreed to on Saturday evening, and the union denies it changed its mind. The sticking point appeared to be a disagreement over which rosters would be used as the basis of the industrial action. In any case, the failure to reach a new agreement prompted a flurry of action within the transport department. In the meantime, Elliott attended events commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Darwin bombing at about 11am eastern time and returned to Sydney later on Sunday afternoon. His office did not respond to questions about when he landed. It remains unclear. On Wednesday, Perrottet said he still had confidence in Elliott despite issuing a stinging rebuke to the minister’s decision to go to bed on Sunday night. He also labelled the disruptions on the network as “pathetic” and said he should have been informed about the closure, while continuing to blame the union. “Obviously what we saw on the train network on Monday was chaos,” he said. But he also revealed that he has launched an investigation into the events leading up to the shutdown, and in particular whether the department adequately informed the minister of the decision. That investigation may be able to answer outstanding questions about what the minister was told and when, although Perrottet has now instructed that briefs on major interruptions to the rail service must be made in writing, suggesting there may have been a series of verbal conversations in the lead up to the shutdown. Elliott is known to have a frosty relationship with his transport secretary, Sharp, and the outcome of the investigation could prove crucial to a number of officials’ futures. On Tuesday, Elliott revealed the government had withdrawn its case against the RTBU in the fair work commission and said he had met with union officials in the hope of a speedier return to full services. But by Wednesday afternoon the network was still running limited services, and the union suggested it was unlikely that it would end its industrial action until Monday.",News/Australia news,Five key questions about the Sydney train network fiasco,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/five-key-questions-about-the-sydney-train-network-fiasco
2/24/2022,"The Morrison government has awarded over half a million dollars in funding for the installation of fibre-to-the-premises NBN to a single business in the electorate of the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, despite the government having previously argued against taxpayer funded fibre upgrades. Fruit and vegetable grower Costa Group, which on Tuesday reported a 2021 yearly net profit after tax of $64m, is listed in documents provided to Senate estimates as the sole beneficiary of a planned upgrade from satellite NBN services to a full fibre to premises service. The upgrade is for the company’s tomato glasshouse facility in Guyra, in the New England electorate, as part of the federal government’s regional connectivity program.  NBN Co will switch the business over at a cost of $520,018, with the company needing to install fibre along the New England Highway to connect Costa’s facility. This is despite the NBN Co estimating that the average cost per premises for fibre-to-the-premises is $4,395. The company is also spending about $1,500 per premises to upgrade select homes across the country from fibre-to-the-node to fibre-to-the-premises. When Joyce announced a range of funding under the program in April last year, while sitting on the backbench and not responsible for decisions such as this, he said of the Costa project that “more residents and businesses in New England will enjoy the benefits and opportunities that improved digital connectivity brings.” However, according to documents provided to Senate estimates by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, the upgrade covers just the Costa facility, with no other premises included. Other fibre upgrade projects funded in the $117m first round of the program listed cover hundreds of premises each that are subsequently able to connect to the NBN via a full-fibre connection. Round one of the regional connectivity program funded thousands of premises in regional parts of Australia to convert from connecting to the NBN via satellite to a full fibre connection at a cost of close to $40m for taxpayers, according to calculations made by Guardian Australia. A spokesperson for Joyce confirmed the then backbencher wrote a letter of support for Costa’s application. “This was done in his capacity as federal member for New England and in recognition of the benefits the project could deliver to the region, of which there were plenty,” the spokesperson said. “Any suggestion Mr Joyce acted inappropriately is off-base and only serves to perpetuate the anti-regions campaign the Labor party is running.” In Joyce’s register of interests, he discloses his partner, Vikki Campion, has shares in Costa Group, although the register does not indicate how many shares she holds. Asked whether he disclosed the shares in the letter supporting the project, the spokesperson for Joyce said: “Any suggestion Mr Joyce acted inappropriately is off base and only serves to perpetuate the anti-regions campaign the Labor Party is running.” The Guardian does not suggest any impropriety by Mr Joyce or Ms Campion. The funding decision was made by the former regional communications minister Mark Coulton, in consultation with the communications minister, Paul Fletcher. Coulton’s successor, Bridget McKenzie, passed on questions about the grant to the department. A spokesperson for the department said the objective of the program is to “use a place-based approach to target telecommunications infrastructure investment that will provide economic opportunities and improve participation in the digital economy for regional communities and businesses” and all proposals are competitively assessed by the department before funding recommendations are made to the decision maker. “The Connecting Costa Group – Growing the Guyra project, jointly funded by the Australian government and NBN Co under Round 1 of the RCP, will upgrade the NBN access technology at the Costa Group hydroponic tomato glasshouse facility from Sky Muster Satellite to fibre to the premises,” the spokesperson said. “As one of the largest businesses in the region, and the major employer in the area, the proposed solution will provide significant economic benefits to the local economy through increased employment opportunities and an increase in regional output.” The spokesperson said despite the project only connecting Costa “other business along the fibre footpath could take advantage of this investment”, suggesting businesses could later seek to get their own fibre upgrade. The use of taxpayer funds to upgrade fibre came in stark contrast to the government’s public comments about using taxpayer funds for NBN upgrades. In November, when Labor promised to add another 1.4m premises to the government’s existing plans to upgrade more homes to fibre across the country, Fletcher accused the opposition of wasting taxpayers money with the upgrade. “It’s clear that what Labor proposes here is more wasteful government spending of taxpayers’ money. That’s what Labor does – because that’s what Labor is good at,” he said. Joyce’s spokesperson said any funding for improved connectivity in the bush is a good thing. “Regional businesses deserve the same standard of digital connectivity that companies in capital cities take for granted and this funding has helped deliver that.” Comment has been sought from Costa Group.",News/Technology,Coalition awards $520k for NBN upgrade to single business in Barnaby Joyce’s electorate ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/24/coalition-awards-520k-for-nbn-upgrade-to-single-business-in-barnaby-joyces-electorate
2/24/2022,"When Jannine Scott first joined her daughter Bethany on the national disability insurance scheme, it was “life-changing”. The scheme funded in-home support workers for Scott, who has a spinal cord condition, and even paid for a power wheelchair and other assistive technology.  “I am sitting in my wheelchair at the moment, and without that piece of equipment, I would have been housebound much, much sooner,” she said. “But the effort it takes to engage with this part of the government now is becoming wildly unreasonable.” Like a growing number of people who are complaining about what the federal opposition claims are “stealth” cuts to the NDIS, Scott said her NDIS experience took a dark turn in the middle of the year. In the latest case where the National Disability Insurance Agency had scrapped supports it had previously funded, Scott said cuts to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars had left the family struggling to cope with daily life. She is primary carer to two children including a three-year-old, Bethany, 11, and Scott’s mother, who has Alzheimer’s disease. Bethany, who is home-schooled, was diagnosed with autism at the very early age of 18 months, lives with epilepsy and a rare genetic condition that impacts her mobility. Scott got onto the scheme two years ago after a rare congenital spinal cord condition worsened to the point she found it hard to walk. Finding a clear explanation for her degenerating genetic condition has been a lifelong journey that continues to this day. “I first presented with symptoms when I was 16,” Scott, 42, said. “It’s been a gradual deterioration. I got to the point where I was unable to walk very far, I was having a lot of motor and sensory changes. Once they (the specialists) found this congenital spinal cord injury, it became a lot clearer that I need support.” Yet in June last year, after a year on the NDIS, Scott received shock news: the NDIA had refused to continue funding supports related to her spinal cord injury. They now claimed there was a lack of evidence it was permanent. That was despite the fact the agency had already paid for a power wheelchair, in-home carers, and other assistive technology in a previous plan. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Scott’s funding was instead allocated on the basis of her other psychosocial disabilities, and reduced by about $20,000 a year on a pro-rata basis. “It certainly feels very different from what it was when Bethany first started on the scheme,” Scott said. “It feels like every time you interact with them it’s combative rather than supportive.” But the bad news was only just beginning. In a letter sent to the family three months later, Bethany’s plan was also cut. Bethany’s “core supports” funding, used to pay for things such as in-home support workers, was slashed dramatically from $86,234 to $600 over 12 months. It meant there was no support at all for in-home care for Bethany, while Scott was also dealing with cuts to her NDIS plan. Those changes – contrary to the recommendations of Bethany’s paediatrician, according to a letter seen by Guardian Australia – were upheld by the NDIA in a new plan last month. The NDIA told Scott in a letter that support workers would not be funded because some of the tasks they assisted Bethany with were considered a “parental responsibility”. Scott said she was told that while Bethany’s funding should fall for this reason, her own package would increase to provide more help around the house. Except, of course, that three months earlier, Scott’s own plan had already been cut. Bethany’s funding was boosted for therapies, and for support to help with community engagement and skills building. But the plan initially stated it could no longer be used to fund Scott’s preferred allied health professional: a developmental educator that her daughter had been seeing for more than a year. After inquiries from Guardian Australia, the NDIA clarified the funding could be used “flexibly, including for a developmental educator”. A spokesperson for the NDIA said plans could go “up or down depending on an individual’s changing disability-related needs, that is how this insurance Scheme was designed”. “These are independent NDIS decisions based on specialist advice and the participant’s individual circumstances at that time,” the spokesperson said. “There are many factors that might result in a participant’s plan value changing depending on their support needs and changes in life circumstances. “It is important to note Ms Scott and [Bethany] continue to receive a significant amount of disability-related funding from the NDIS.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The spokesperson said if “sufficient evidence” was provided to the NDIA to “substantiate the requested levels of additional disability-related health support, the NDIA would then be able to consider changes to Ms Scott’s plan”. Last week, new figures revealed a 400% increase in the number of families challenging NDIA decisions at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the past six months. Scott was still fighting the cuts but was hoping to avoid what she described as the “cruel” AAT process. She said she now had “significant anxiety” dealing with the NDIA. “Anything that was making Bethany improve and making her have a better outcome in her life were taken away from her,” Scott said. “That was the opposite of what the NDIS was supposed to do. “[Bethany] has trouble with her physical mobility now, she can’t walk for long distances, she’s gone through a significant amount of weight loss and muscle loss over the past six months,” Scott said. She was increasingly “disengaged” and did not want to leave her bedroom. The family has been supported by Syndromes Without A Name (Swan), an organisation that supports families caring for a child with an undiagnosed or rare genetic condition. Its chief executive, Heather Renton, said more training was needed for NDIS planners to recognise undiagnosed or rare genetic conditions. In Scott’s case, the reduced hours of in-home care had coincided with “more significant mental and physical fatigue”. “I need help seven days a week and I don’t have the funding for that any more,” Scott added. “Simple day-to-day tasks like cooking and things like that, I can no longer do. Being Bethany’s primary carer, it makes it extremely difficult.”",News/Australia news,‘Wildly unreasonable’: agency slashes mother’s NDIS funding and then her daughter’s,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/wildly-unreasonable-agency-slashes-mothers-ndis-funding-and-then-her-daughters
2/24/2022,"On Wednesday, the bureau of statistics revealed that real wages in 2021 completely tanked. In what will likely be the last release of such data before the federal election, the wages price index for all employees in 2021 rose just 2.3%, well below the 3.5% increase in inflation. Just a couple of weeks ago the Australian reported business were warning that a “wages rush ‘risks jump in inflation’”.  It would be funny if it wasn’t so obtusely predictable. If there is one constant in our economic debate, it is that employer groups and certain members of the Coalition will continually warn that we are about to experience a wages breakout due to unions’ exaggerated pay claims. And, alas, another constant is that the wages breakout does not arrive. So it is again with the release of the wages figures for the last three months of 2021. Last year wages overall grew by 2.3% while private-sector wages were up 2.4%. That is, no better than occurred in the first quarter of 2019: If the graph does not display please click here And while the last half of 2021 did see a slight boost, even if we exclude the poor June quarter of last year, we are still looking at private-sector wage growth of only 2.5%: If the graph does not display please click here One problem is that the public sector, which traditionally bolstered wages, is now a drag. The decisions by state governments and the Morrison government to cap wages growth during the pandemic means that public-sector wages in the past year grew just 2.1%. The weak growth is hardly a sign of a breakout of wages and, worse, it also means that people’s wages are falling in real terms. In 2021, the consumer price index rose 3.5% – some 1.2% above wages. That real-wage fall is the worst this century outside of those that occurred when the GST was introduced. Personally, I prefer the RBA’s “trimmed mean” inflation measure when calculating real wages, because it is less erratic than the CPI and it is a bit much to expect wages will jump around every three months due to for example petrol prices soaring. But even here, real wages in both the private and public sectors fell in 2021: If the graph does not display please click here Given this is likely the last wages data before a May election (the next release is on 18 May, and 21 May is the last possible date for the election) it is a very poor showing for the Morrison government. Since September 2013, private-sector wages have grown just 1.4% above inflation, compared to the 4.2% they grew during the Rudd/Gillard governments – despite being in power for three fewer years. That 1.4% growth is so pathetic in reality, once you take into account taxation and the thresholds of government payments, it likely means that workers have not seen any increase in their purchasing power over the eight years of the Coalition government. Even in the construction sector, wages growth has slowed. In the September quarter there was a sharp 1.1% jump – the fastest quarterly rise since 2011 – but, in the last three months of 2021, construction workers wages grew just 0.4% – slower than the last quarter of 2019: If the graph does not display please click here The figures highlight that the link between unemployment and wages growth remains much reduced. If the graph does not display please click here It also suggests that the government’s predictions of wages growth getting back to 3% by the middle of 2024 while unemployment remains around 4.25% is rather fanciful. But the bigger problem is that workers are not getting rewarded for their efforts. Last week, before the Senate economics estimates committee, the head of the Treasury department, Dr Steven Kennedy, noted that so long as wages do not grow ahead of inflation and productivity then they would “put no pressure on inflation”. This is in line with the views of the governor of the Reserve Bank, that wages should grow at the level of inflation plus productivity – and ideally would be around 3.5% (2.5% inflation + 1% productivity growth) But wages are growing nowhere near that (and really have not for a long time): If the graph does not display please click here It clearly demonstrates wages are not putting pressure on inflation. Prices are not rising because of workers demanding higher pay, but mostly because of supply-side issues and some demand-driven aspects such as in the housing market. But because real wages are falling and not keeping up with productivity improvements, what is also happening is that employers are choosing to raise prices and take the increased profits rather than pay their workers more.
