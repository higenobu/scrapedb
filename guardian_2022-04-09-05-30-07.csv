4/9/2022,"Los Angeles jail guards have frequently punched incarcerated people in the head and subjected them to a “humiliating” group strip-search where they were forced to wait undressed for hours, according to a new report from court-appointed monitors documenting a range of abuses. The Los Angeles sheriff’s department (LASD), which oversees the largest local jail system in the country, appears to be routinely violating use-of-force policies, with supervisors failing to hold guards accountable and declining to provide information to the monitors tasked with reviewing the treatment of incarcerated people. The report, filed in federal court on Thursday, adds to a long string of scandals for the department. The monitors – first put in place in 2014 to settle a case involving beatings – suggested that some problems in the jails appeared to be getting worse after they visited the facilities in December 2021. The monitors, Robert Houston, a former corrections official, and Jeffrey Schwartz, a consultant, alleged that the use of “head shots”, meaning punches to the head, had been “relatively unchanged in the last two years or more, and may be increasing”. They also wrote that deputies who used force in violation of policy were at times sent to “remedial training” but that “actual discipline is seldom imposed”. And supervisors who failed to document violations were also “not held accountable” . The authors cited one incident in which a deputy approached a resident who had “walked away from him” while he was being escorted. “With no hesitation, Deputy Y grabbed [his] chest and slammed him into the wall. Deputy Y punched [him] 5‐9 times in the head, and Deputy Z punched [him] 6‐8 times in the head as they took [him] to the floor because they ‘feared’ that the Inmate might become assaultive”. The report also documented an incident on 7 September 2021, when there were reports that a firearm “might have been smuggled” into Men’s Central jail. Guards responded by instituting a “shakedown” and strip-search of residents. “They said they were taken out of their cells in the morning, given no explanation (except for one inmate who said he was told the reason for the search by a deputy), strip searched, then walked naked en masse through the jail and down to the room with the X‐ray machine,” the report said, citing complaints from jail residents. “Passing large numbers of male and female staff members, some of whom … mocked them or made other humiliating comments”. Those interviewed said they eventually got underwear, but still no shoes, and were taken to a yard where they were forced to wait for hours until they returned to their cells later that night. LASD did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report on Friday. The monitors said they had written officials in January to ask if this was standard procedure, and whether the residents were given food, water and access to bathrooms while waiting. According to the monitors, the department responded that it had completed a “report” about the incident with “corrective action plans”, but in the three months since, it had not sent documents or further information. The report raised further concerns about the department’s use of the “Wrap” device, which functions like a full-body restraining jacket and is used to “immobilize” people. The Wrap procedures pose a serious risk of asphyxiation, and “the continuing practice … cannot be justified”, the monitors said. The department had failed to fulfill its requirement to write a Wrap policy that the monitors had approved, and it had further misled the monitors about how the jail was using the device, the report alleged: “The practices used with Wrap appear to be almost diametrically opposed to the way in which the Department explained that Wrap was being used.” In 2018, a man in jail in northern California died of asphyxiation after being subjected to the Wrap device, sparking widespread scrutiny of the practice. The LA jails have for years been plagued by corruption and obstruction of justice scandals, with the former sheriff Lee Baca and his second in command both convicted in cases stemming from misconduct investigations. Guards in the Men’s Central jail have also long been accused of being part of a “deputy gang”, known for allegedly using excessive force. The department has also faced mounting questions this year about the death of a 27-year-old in solitary confinement. “These are not one-time incidents – this is the culture and history of the department,” said Mark-Anthony Clayton-Johnson, executive director of Dignity and Power Now, a group that has long been fighting to shut down the Men’s Central jail. He said the report reminded him of the misconduct allegations and obfuscation from department leaders in a 2012 case. “After 10 years of exposure, 10 years of scandal, 10 years of reform, this department has had a lot of opportunities to get this right … but has continued to revert back to some of the most vicious attacks on Black and brown people. “It is clear our loved ones are not safe in the custody of the sheriff’s department,” he added. Peter Eliasberg, chief counsel at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, said it was especially disturbing that the problems seemed to be escalating under sheriff Alex Villanueva, who was elected in 2018: “They are treating incarcerated people in the jails in a sub-human manner … There’s just an utter lack of accountability, which ultimately goes to the top.” Helen Jones, an organizer whose 22-year-old son died in LA sheriff’s custody in 2009, said she wasn’t surprised by the report: “It’s been this way for so long, it’s just the norm. It’s out of control, and there are no consequences.”",News/US news,"LA jail guards routinely punch incarcerated people in the head, monitors find",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/los-angeles-jail-sheriffs-department-violence-accusation
4/9/2022,"They could all feel the weight of history. Yet the mood was as light as spring air when Ketanji Brown Jackson looked out at the crowd of smiling faces. “It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the supreme court of the United States,” the judge said in bright sunshine. “But we’ve made it!” The audience on the South Lawn of the White House rose and clapped and hollered with a rare purity of emotion. Jackson added: “We’ve made it – all of us. All of us. And our children are telling me that they see now more than ever that here in America anything is possible.” It felt like the culmination of a journey. A day earlier, Jackson was confirmed by the Senate as the first African American female supreme court justice. In moving remarks on Friday, she spoke not only of her journey but that of her ancestors: the 400-year story of African Americans meeting slavery and segregation with resilience, creativity and hope. The atmosphere at the White House was joyful and celebratory – not a sentence there has been much cause to write over the past five years. No doom and gloom over Donald Trump’s lies, the deadly pandemic or the war in Ukraine. Instead, the marine band played songs from the shows, including West Side Story. (“I like to be in America…”) And after a week of sombre grey skies, lashing rain and surging coronavirus, the White House looked a little more majestic than usual in radiant sunlight. Fifty Stars and Stripes flags fluttered in a row. Birds could be heard singing. The relaxed, jovial crowd of hundreds erupted as Joe Biden, wearing shades, Vice-President Kamala Harris and Jackson strode to the podium, to the strains of “Hail to the chief”. But it was Jackson’s grace note at the end of the 45-minute pageant that will linger in the memory – and the heart – and be studied by future historians and, she evidently hoped, generations yet unborn. The 51-year-old invoked figures such as Martin Luther King, the civil rights leader, Thurgood Marshall, the first Black supreme court justice, and her “personal heroine”, Judge Constance Baker Motley, a former district court judge and New York state senator. “They and so many others did the heavy lifting that made this day possible. And for all the talk of this historic nomination and now confirmation, I think of them as the true path-breakers. I’m just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all.” Becoming tearful, putting a tissue to her nose, Jackson continued: “To be sure, I have worked hard to get to this point in my career and I have now achieved something far beyond anything my grandparents could have possibly ever imagined. But no one does this on their own. “The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion, and, in the poetic words of Dr Maya Angelou, I do so now, while ‘bringing the gifts my ancestors gave’.” There was applause and she took a deep breath. “‘I … I am the dream and the hope of the slave’.” It was a quotation from Angelou’s poem Still I Rise. A shiver of emotion ran through the crowd, which rose as one. It included Jesse Jackson, 80, a civil rights veteran who was there when King was assassinated. Her voice quivering with feeling that seemed to match the enormity of the moment, Jackson, watched by her parents, husband and daughters, went on. “So as I take on this new role, I strongly believe that this is a moment in which all Americans can take great pride. “We have come a long way toward perfecting our union. In my family, it took just one generation to go from segregation to the supreme court of the United States.” It was hard to believe this was the same country that less than two years ago staged a similar outdoor event for the justice nominated before Jackson, Amy Coney Barrett. On that grey day, Trump gloated at the prospect of tipping the court firmly in conservatives’ favour. The audience was appreciably less than diverse than for Jackson. It also proved to be a Covid super-spreader event. Time will tell if Friday goes the same way. Jackson is replacing the retiring Stephen Breyer, 83, and so liberals will remain firmly in the minority when, from October, she begins hearing vital cases on affirmative action, gay rights and voting rights. This week, Mitch McConnell refused to say whether he would even grant another Biden pick a hearing if Republicans regain the Senate majority. Friday’s heady euphoria was only a brief respite from demands for structural reform to restore balance to the court. But what a respite it was. Trump presented one vision of America, infused with white identity politics and great men of history. This presented another, more generous in spirt, more authentic to the nation’s true origin story. Biden said: “This is not only a sunny day. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. This is going to let so much sun shine on so many young women, so many young Black women, so many minorities that it’s real. It’s real! We’re going to look back – and nothing to do with me – we’re going to look back and see this as a moment of real change in American history.”",News/US news,Mood as light as spring air as Ketanji Brown Jackson delivers words to remember,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/ketanji-brown-jackson-white-house-joe-biden-supreme-court
4/9/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. On Monday, Daniel Boffey visited the devastated town of Bucha, speaking to the residents of blighted Vokzal’na Street as they emerged from their hideouts after Russian forces retreated. “We were in our cellar the whole time,” says Serhiy Savenko, 43, who lives with his mother, Larisa, 72, at No 35. “The Russians set up their weapons and a fire in the front garden. One came down to the cellar and saw us. He said to be quiet. He said he was a nice guy but his colleagues would get us on our knees and shoot us. They took our phones and said ‘no fires’, as if we could make some sort of signal.” Zinaida, 62, lives at No 31, and has been in her cellar since 5 March. She faces the prospect of telling her daughter that her husband is dead, killed by soldiers after going to pick up some items up from a neighbour’s house. “He walked just 20 metres from the house and the Russians killed him. No warning, no reason … How can I tell them?” If you want to read more about Bucha, journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk has written about how the atrocities there have changed the way Ukrainians look at the war. Shaun Walker visited the spa town of Trostianets on Tuesday, one of the very first places to fall into Russian hands when Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. There he found evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting during a month of occupation. Yet residents described an initial sense of guilt among Russian soldiers. “We were scared of them, but after a while we started pitying them. They had dirty faces, they stank and they looked completely lost,” says Yana Lugovets, who spent a month sleeping in the basement with her husband, daughter and friends. She said a soldier who had come to search the house they were staying in left without completing the task, his eyes filled with shame as her daughter cried out in fear at the intruder. Daria Sasina said soldiers who had broken into the beauty salon she ran were apologetic, saying: “Listen, I’m sorry. We didn’t know it would be like this.” However, after the Ukrainian army called in strikes, the Russians became more and more angry. Investigators are uncovering the scale of sexual violence committed in Ukraine, including gang-rapes, assaults at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children, writes Bethan McKernan in Lviv. Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes, and both Ukraine’s prosecutor general and the international criminal court have said they will open investigations. “Every break between curfew and bombing I was looking for emergency contraception instead of a basic first aid kit,” said Antonina Medvedchuk in Kyiv, who woke up to the sound of bombing on the day the war broke out. “My mother tried to reassure me: ‘This is not a war like that, they don’t exist any more, they are from old movies.’” Local authorities and organisations have been distributing medical, legal and psychological support and trying to find safe shelters for women and girls fleeing both the war and domestic violence. But the fighting has hampered the effort. “We have had several calls to our emergency hotline from women and girls seeking assistance, but in most cases it’s been impossible to help them physically. We haven’t been able to reach them because of the fighting,” said Kateryna Cherepakha, the president of charity La Strada Ukraine. After Joe Biden called for the prosecution of Vladimir Putin for war crimes following the discovery in Bucha of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, David Smith explained that bringing the Russian president to trial would be far from simple. The US, China, Russia and Ukraine are not members of the international criminal court, but dozens of prominent lawyers and politicians, including the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown, have launched a campaign to create a special tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Models include the tribunals set up to prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and during the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Even if it does go ahead, prosecution could take many years. On Thursday, Luke Harding in Lviv reported on the extraordinary story of Dmitry Yurin, a man who witnessed the bombing of the Drama Theatre in Mariupol and decided that he had to escape the city by any means necessary. “It was terrible, a massive blast, an enormous explosion. I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. “I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood.” Yurin’s plan involved wading into the frigid sea of Azov with four five-litre plastic bottles, for use as buoyancy aids, and swimming for two-and-a-half hours. His remarkable journey took him to the village of Melekine, where he staggered out of the sea and was rescued by an elderly couple who gave him vodka and borscht. Dan Sabbagh examines how Nato countries have been gradually stepping up their supply of weapons to Kyiv as the war in Ukraine enters a new phase and asks if the gradual escalation in arms deliveries can avoid a Russian retaliation and turn the tide on the battlefield. The next phase of the war – which could yet be decisive – is expected to unfold in the Donbas in the next month as Russian forces seek to capture Mariupol, create a land bridge to Crimea, expand the area of occupation in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk – and perhaps encircle Ukraine’s main fighting force ranged against it. It is a struggle that will unfold over the course of April, but it is probably not until the end of April that a clearer picture will emerge of the revised military balance. Meanwhile, the west’s aims are becoming less clear. Is the goal to allow Ukraine to force the Kremlin into peace talks – or try to inflict a more heavy defeat that would risk provoking an unpredictable Russian president?

4/9/2022,"Australia’s second biggest schools chaplaincy provider imposes a code that discriminates against staff based on relationship status and sexual conduct, a whistleblower has alleged. Caragh Larsen, a former Schools Ministry Group chaplain at two Adelaide public primary schools, said the code banning “cohabitation” and “sexually intrusive” behaviour left unmarried and LGBTQ+ staff vulnerable. Larsen’s job at one school was funded through the federal chaplaincy program, which gives $60m a year for chaplains connected to religious groups to provide pastoral care services in schools. The other position was funded by the South Australian government. Proselytising in public schools is banned, but Larsen said SMG chaplains were encouraged to speak about their faith with students, when asked, and praised for directing them to church youth groups. The SMG code states that “it is unacceptable for a pastoral care worker to initiate or become involved in relationships of a sexual or inappropriate nature with any person to whom they are not married”. That includes relationships which “involve cohabitation or any behaviour which is considered to be sexually intrusive by another person”. Larsen, a qualified counsellor, told Guardian Australia the clause meant “we had to be married, or living on our own”. Schools Ministry Group is the biggest chaplaincy provider in South Australia, providing 263 chaplains to schools according to its 2019 annual report. There is no breakdown of how many are federally funded, but it received $5.3m in overall government funding in the same year. SMG did not respond to questions about how “sexually intrusive” conduct was defined, or whether the code enabled discrimination on relationship status and lawful sexual conduct. It said its chaplains “must agree to uphold standards and to be part of a supportive faith community that aligns with our Christian values”. “This is not only reasonable but is consistent with the wellbeing model of providing social, emotional and spiritual support.” Larsen is a lifelong Christian who was hired by SMG to work in the schools in 2021 despite not belonging to a particular church group at the time. After she was employed, Larsen said, she faced “huge pressure” to join a church group. She said she relented by attending once a month to stop “horrible conversations about church”. Larsen said she felt “very uncomfortable” at regular meetings with other chaplains because she “realised they do have an agenda – they want a Christian presence in schools”. Larsen said it was clear chaplains could not initiate conversations about God, but the lines were “blurry”, and discussions were allowed if children asked chaplains them about their faith. Chaplains were told they could “pray at school, walking around praying over the school yard”. Larsen said she was “gobsmacked” when another chaplain said he had got children to attend his church’s youth group, and he was praised for it. “This was so wrong.” Larsen said in her experience a lot of Christians, though not all, believed homosexuality was a sin. “I worry about the young people in the schools that are being taken care of by pastoral care workers who think like that … it’s quite dangerous.” She said there was never any “overt homophobic talk” at SMG, but it bothered her that Christian staff likely believed it was a sin. “I worry about that sort of presence in schools, you’ve got vulnerable young people starting to identify as non-binary or gay, or in some circumstances trans.” Larsen said that when she discussed children’s behavioural issues – such as a distressed student throwing things in the classroom – an SMG manager told her that was a “demonic response” to the “presence of God” that chaplains brought into a school. “I felt physically unwell,” she said. “I know that child, I know the trauma and why they were acting like that. “[The SMG manager is] not in a place to speak like that. They have no idea about their trauma. This is dangerous.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning SMG said it was “unable to comment on or verify unfounded allegations and speculation”, but such comments were “not endorsed by SMG”. It said chaplains, engaged voluntarily by schools, “play a cooperative and important role” and were “trained in recognising mental health issues and referring them appropriately in accordance with commonwealth standards”. “Chaplains deal with students and the wider school community irrespective of their faith beliefs and … chaplains do not share faith beliefs unless requested by students. “In South Australia there has never been a complaint against a chaplain for proselytising.” The federal and South Australian education departments both said Larsen raised no complaints with them. The South Australian department said chaplaincy service providers “may have their own employment terms and conditions … that we do not place on our own employees” including “in relation to community work, personal relationships, and religious participation” . “The department’s national school chaplaincy procedure specifically identifies this as a potential issue and suggests schools consider whether a service provider’s employment conditions would affect the delivery of the program at the school.” “The Department for Education has confirmed with Schools Ministry Group that language in relation to ‘demonic response’ is not appropriate and should not be used in the context of the work of pastoral care workers.” It said it would make further inquiries into the allegation. The department said pastoral care workers were banned from proselytising, which “refers to any action that converts or attempts to convert a child or young person to share their beliefs”. “Each context will determine whether this requirement has been met.” The federal department said the states and territories were responsible for complaints about chaplaincy providers. “National school chaplains may be of any faith and are not permitted to proselytise, and must respect, accept and be sensitive to other people’s views, values and beliefs.” Larsen said in retrospect perhaps she should have made a complaint, but the public had a right to know how the chaplaincy program worked – because schools and parents had “no idea”.",News/Australia news,Schools chaplaincy provider bans cohabitation and ‘sexually intrusive’ behaviour in staff’s private life ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/schools-chaplaincy-provider-bans-cohabitation-and-sexually-intrusive-behaviour-in-staffs-private-life
4/9/2022,"Voters will be kept in the dark on how Scott Morrison’s government selected three potential bases for Australia’s planned nuclear-powered submarines, after the advice was blocked from release. With the prime minister preparing to formally call the election within days, Labor demanded the government reveal how it shortlisted the locations to prove the announcement was “not just a marketing ploy”. Morrison named Brisbane, Newcastle and Wollongong’s Port Kembla as three contenders for a new eastern submarine base, and revealed Aukus-related infrastructure works would cost up to $10bn, in a keynote national security speech last month. The government is expected to lock in one of these sites late next year, once further studies and negotiations are completed. Morrison said the “three preferred locations” were identified “following significant work by Defence reviewing 19 potential sites”, although a minister later said it was the cabinet’s national security committee that had “narrowed it down to three”. Guardian Australia applied to the Department of Defence under freedom of information laws seeking the site analysis. The request also covered any advice, briefings or submissions prepared for the defence minister, Peter Dutton, regarding the preferred locations. The department confirmed this week that it had found one document that fitted this description, but decided to deny access to it on a number of grounds, including the cabinet exemption. “The document in the scope of this request is exempt as it has been submitted to cabinet, or was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of submission for the consideration of cabinet,” the FOI decision maker said in a letter this week. “The document, if disclosed, would reveal a cabinet decision.” The decision contrasts with the previous release of a detailed 2011 Navy submarine basing study. The three potential sites Morrison announced last month – Port Kembla, Newcastle and Brisbane – were not among the top five options listed in that earlier study. Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, questioned whether the government was “hiding their advice because the prime minister has made a political decision in shortlisting three east coast submarine bases”. “To demonstrate this is not just a marketing ploy, the government must transparently answer questions about the way the sites have been chosen and who chose them,” O’Connor said. “Australians deserve to know if the government went through rigorous processes or if these bases have been chosen on a whim close to an election.” The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick said the document should be released, even if it was politically sensitive. Patrick said the latest advice was a matter of “great public interest”, particularly to the residents of Port Kembla, Newcastle and Brisbane. He said the government could not be taken on trust when it came to the process it used to select the three east coast sites. “The timing of this announcement just before an election and the fact that it departs from the Navy’s previous analysis is quite inexplicable,” Patrick said. The 2011 study said it “would be impractical” to develop a future submarine basing capability at Port Kembla, noting it had previously been found to be “a small and congested harbour with little space for substantial expansion”. A Defence spokesperson explained last month why some of the conclusions were no longer valid, saying changes in commercial activity at Port Kembla had released a large pocket of land “now potentially suitable for creation of a new naval base”. They also said Sydney Harbour – which was favoured in the 2011 study - was “not considered a viable long-term solution” for a permanent submarine base because of “limitations on berth space and shore facilities”. But the new advice is not being released. In addition to citing the cabinet rule, the department said the document contained information relating to Australia’s relationship with other governments. Releasing it could damage “international confidence and close relationships”. The FOI decision maker also said releasing the document could “diminish the commercial advantage” of those organisations or businesses “and could reveal potential market opportunities for competitors”. Defence did not respond to questions on Thursday or Friday, including on how the decision to keep the document confidential was consistent with the previous release of the 2011 study with redactions where appropriate. The unanswered questions also included whether Defence explicitly recommend that the three sites named by Morrison were the ones that should be shortlisted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison, who has been seeking to make national security a core part of his election campaign message, announced the base shortlist in a speech warning of the emergence of a new “arc of autocracy”, apparently referring to China and Russia. He has promoted the Aukus security partnership with the UK and the US as a signature achievement, although the submarine construction plans are still subject to a joint study that is due to be completed by early 2023.

4/9/2022,"The Morrison government has appointed more than 30 former Coalition ministers, MPs, staffers and donors to taxpayer-funded jobs in the last six months alone. Scott Morrison and senior ministers have defended the appointments, but Labor has argued it’s a case of history repeating after a large number of partisan appointments before the 2019 election and stacking of the administrative appeals tribunal with 85 people linked to the Coalition since 2013. On Friday evening the energy minister, Angus Taylor, reappointed his former energy adviser John Hirjee to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency board along with Anna Matysek, an economist and co-founder of BAEconomics, which has been critical of Labor’s climate policies. Taylor also appointed Matt Howell, the outgoing chief executive of Tomago Aluminium, Australia’s biggest power consumer, to the board of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Although not a Liberal, Howell has vocally backed the government’s investment in the Kurri Kurri gas power plant. Earlier, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, accused the government of delaying calling the election to allow it to “continue to make these extraordinary appointments to the AAT [Administrative Appeals Tribunal], to the Productivity Commission, to the Arts Council”, meaning the Australia Council for the Arts. “I mean, surely there are now no more Liberal former state MPs, federal MPs, local councillors or mayors to appoint to these bodies. Like enough, call the election, let the Australian people decide,” he said. Last week, the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, appointed six people with Liberal links to the AAT, which conducts merits reviews of government decisions. These included former NSW minister Pru Goward, a former chief of staff to Morrison and two former Western Australian state politicians who lost their seats at the 2021 election. Don Morris, a former Tasmanian legislative council member, and Donna Petrovich, a former Liberal MP, were reappointed to the tribunal at the same time. Cash has defended the appointments, saying that 15 of the 19 new appointments this round were of legally qualified people. On Wednesday, Cash told 6PR radio that “people who have served in government have a good understanding … of the way government works, they understand legislation”. “Appointments need to be made. This was the time to make these appointments. It just happens to coincide with an election.” Former NSW minister Don Harwin was appointed to the Australia Council board. The former federal minister John McVeigh was appointed to the Modernising Murray River Systems technical panel, while the head of the oil and gas lobby APPEA’s Andrew McConville became the chief executive of the the Murray Darling Basin Authority. In April, the former federal Liberal leader Brendan Nelson was appointed as a member of the council of the Australian War Memorial. The Morrison government appointed Timothy Longstaff, a former senior adviser to then trade minister Simon Birmingham and former finance minister Mathias Cormann, as a non-executive director of Snowy Hydro Limited and reappointed Scott Mitchell, a former WA Liberal government staffer, as a non executive director. Both are three-year appointments. The health minister, Greg Hunt, appointed his mental health and suicide prevention adviser, Michael Gardner, as the head of the National Suicide Prevention Office. Laura Inman, who reportedly attended a Liberal fundraiser while a Commonwealth Bank director, was appointed as a non‑executive director to Australia Post board for a three-year term. Penny Fowler, a donor to the Liberal party in 2004, was appointed as chair of the National Portrait Gallery board.

In December: The former Liberal party Victorian branch vice-president Caroline Elliott was appointed to the board of the National Film and Sound Archive along with Lucy Brogden, the wife of former NSW opposition leader John Brogden, both for a three-year term. Fiona Nash, the former Nationals deputy leader, became the first regional education commissioner Scott Ryan, the former Liberal senator and Senate president, was appointed as high commissioner to Canada Rebecca Frizelle, a donor to the LNP in 2020, was nominated to join the Brisbane 2032 organising committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games In November, the Morrison government appointed conservative legal academic Lorraine Finlay as the human rights commissioner, one of three appointments since 2013 that could trigger a downgrade to the Australia’s Human Rights Commission global accreditation. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the threatened downgrade was “a damning indictment on the Morrison government”. “The key concern that led to the threatened downgrade was the refusal of the Morrison government to adopt a transparent and independent process for appointing commissioners, similar to its undermining of the AAT with its constant stacking of Liberal mates,” he said. In October the former Liberal science and industry minister Ian Macfarlane was appointed for a three-year term to the science agency the CSIRO’s board.

4/9/2022,"The New South Wales government has abandoned its plan to ban dark roofs – aimed at reducing temperatures and energy costs for new homes – as the state’s new planning minister walks back ambitious sustainability measures announced by his predecessor. Former planning minister Rob Stokes previously announced he would be tasking the Department of Planning and Environment with implementing a requirement for lighter-coloured roofs in all new homes in the state, and that the policy feature would help NSW achieve its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. “This would have an enormous impact on the urban heat island effect in our city,” Stokes told a forum run by urban thinktank Committee for Sydney in November. “There are no practical reasons why we shouldn’t be ditching dark roofing on new homes permanently to ensure that future communities of Sydney’s west don’t experience the urban heat that many communities do now,” he said. The dark roof ban was one of many ideas announced by Stokes as part of his sustainable planning agenda, which also included a Design and Place State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp) as its centrepiece. The wide-ranging set of rules in the Design and Place Sepp – which is separate to the dark roof ban – were to push commercial buildings to be net zero carbon emissions from day one, see apartment blocks built with electric vehicle charging stations, require minimum tree cover for housing developments and push for walkable suburbs, among other requirements that had been praised by environmental groups. This week, the new planning minister, Anthony Roberts – who succeeded Stokes after he was demoted from the role by premier Dominic Perrottet – announced he would not introduce the Design and Place Sepp, after the cost and regulatory burden of adhering to the policy was fiercely criticised by property developers during its public exhibition period. Guardian Australia can reveal that while the plan to require lighter-coloured roofs was not part of the proposed Design and Place Sepp, the ban appears to have been another sustainability idea scrapped since its announcement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When Guardian Australia contacted Roberts’s office to clarify the status of the dark roof ban, his office referred questions to the NSW Department of Planning and Environment. A department policy director told Guardian Australia that no measures to ban dark roofs were on the horizon. Instead, the policy director said that updated energy efficiency rules for new dwellings had been proposed to disincentivise, not ban, dark roofs. The rules would force developers wanting to build a home with dark roofing to include greater efficiencies in other features of the dwelling to offset its negative impact – such as insulation or a reflective finish on a roof surface to reduce solar absorbency – to achieve a passable Building Sustainability Index (Basix) score needed for planning approval. Dr Sebastian Pfautsch, an associate professor of urban studies at Western Sydney University who has studied urban heat, said that the fact the government had stalled in banning dark roofs reflected “the absurdity of where developers place their preferences these days”. Pfautsch said the benefit of lighter roofs was “undisputed among anyone who has any idea of how heat works”.

In western Sydney, a light-coloured roof could reduce temperatures inside the home by 4C on average and up to 10C during a heatwave, compared with darker roofing, according to research commissioned by the federal government. Street temperatures can increase by up to 4C during a heatwave because of the heat island effect. Pfautsch said air conditioning also contributes to the heat island effect because systems pump out hot air on to streets – an increasingly common reliance in new housing developments on the outskirts of major cities which lack significant natural shade and tree cover. “It’s a vicious cycle, because even if planners offset the effect of a dark roof inside the home with insulation, it still has an effect on making the surrounding environment hotter – you’re radiating the heat,” he said. “It’s so disappointing to think of how many hundreds of thousands of homes are going to be built like this,” Pfautsch said. Sam Kernaghan, the Committee for Sydney’s resilience program director, said “removing the ban on dark roofs for new housing would be a significant step in the wrong direction”. “Of all the things that can be done about the problem of living with extreme heat in western Sydney, the easiest is requiring light-coloured roofs. It’s not the whole solution, but it’s a step in the right direction,” he said. “The NSW government needs to stay the course on dark roofs, and send a clear message to residents of new growth areas that they care about the quality of housing being built across Sydney, not just the quantity,” Kernaghan said. Paul Scully, the NSW Labor opposition planning spokesperson, said “the NSW government needs to come clean with precisely which planning policies it remains committed to and how scrapping measures aimed at addressing climate change in the built environment will achieve their net zero by 2050 target”. “Another week, another component of the NSW government’s net zero commitment appears to have fallen by the way side,” Scully said.",News/Australia news,Plan to ban dark roofs abandoned as NSW government walks back sustainability measures,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/plan-to-ban-dark-roofs-abandoned-as-nsw-government-walks-back-sustainability-measures
4/9/2022,"The Australian government knowingly relied on discredited evidence obtained under torture to keep a refugee in detention for a decade, despite being repeatedly told the detention was unjustified and the allegations untrue. Sayed Abdellatif, falsely labelled the “pool fence” terrorist by then opposition leader Tony Abbott, has spent more than 10 years in immigration detention in Australia without ever being accused of or charged with a crime, because spy agency Asio had a “predetermined view” of him, called him a “liar”, and relied on evidence it knew to be discredited, a federal court judge has found. In a 133-page judgment, justice Debra Mortimer set aside the “adverse security assessments” made by Asio against Abdellatif, which were used to block his claim for asylum. She found the assessments were “legally unreasonable”, riddled with errors, and denied him procedural fairness. Mortimer also criticised some of Asio’s interrogation techniques as “unreasonable and unrealistic”, including conducting an eight-hour, 700-question interview during Ramadan when Abdellatif could not eat or drink. The judgment could lead to Abdellatif’s release from detention after more than a decade. Overturning the security assessments clears a path for the immigration minister to grant Abdellatif a protection visa. His wife and six children already live in the Australian community. Abdellatif, an Egyptian national, has been exiled from his homeland for 26 years after being convicted in absentia in a discredited mass trial in Cairo in 1999 for offences he never committed. The evidence used to convict Abdellatif of murder, firearms offences and membership of terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad was obtained under “severe torture”, including of his father – a fact known and admitted by the Australian government since 2015, but disregarded. A 2013 Guardian investigation of the court transcripts from Cairo’s supreme military court found the evidence was obtained using torture, including electric shocks, and some of the charges were never alleged against Abdellatif in court. An Interpol red notice – treated as the equivalent of an arrest warrant by many countries – was withdrawn in 2018 after an application by Fair Trials International. The government’s own independent reviewer of Asio security assessments described Asio’s reliance on the discredited trial evidence as “a travesty of justice”. Abdellatif arrived in Australia by boat in 2012, seeking asylum with his wife and children. Australia recognised he and his family had a “well-founded fear of being persecuted”, and was legally obliged to protect them. In 2013, then opposition leader Tony Abbott called Abdellatif a “jihadist” and a “pool fence terrorist”, seeking to condemn the Gillard government as weak on border protection because authorities had missed the Interpol red notice issued in his name. Abdellatif was moved into high security detention at Villawood and separated from his family, who were later granted visas to live in Australia. The basis for the allegation was the alleged membership of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Abdellatif has consistently denied ever being a member, and no evidence has been presented he has ever been involved with the group. He was questioned extensively about his work for Islamic charities while in exile, but consistently denied any link with any extremist organisations or holding any ideological affinity with them. Over a three years, the Guardian has shown: Mortimer says she found Abdellatif gave his evidence “in a serious and careful manner”, and that she found him reliable and truthful. “I found him to be a witness who was speaking from his own recollection, and a person who has been significantly affected by his experiences of a tragically long executive detention in Australia.” Abdellatif has been subjected to several interviews by Asio officers and has had three adverse security assessments made against him, in 2014, 2018 and 2020. Mortimer found the 2018 Asio assessment involved a denial of procedural fairness because it relied on discredited evidence extracted through torture or “pre-prepared” by Egyptian authorities. The federal court judgment also shed light on Asio’s interrogation techniques. Mortimer was critical of the manner in which Asio questioned Abdellatif, noting his first interview on 10 July 2013 lasted from 9.35am to 5.05pm and was conducted during Ramadan, when Abdellatif was fasting. The interview lasted more than eight hours, with two breaks, and involved more than 700 often “repetitious” questions. In this same interview, Asio officers used different aliases, even for the same officer. One officer states “my name is Jacki, just in case you have forgotten”. However, no officer by the name of Jacki interviewed Abdellatif on that occasion. Asio also gave Abdellatif false information, Mortimer found. In one interview, Abdellatif likened his interrogations to being targeted by the Egyptian military regime. “Asio is trying to pressure me mentally while I’m in the detention centre … either to admit something, to confess something I did not do, or I will be under this torture and this mental stress, pressure, for a long period of time. Egypt used the same methodology but in a different way.” Given the length and breadth of the interviews, Mortimer said Asio’s expectations of how much information Abdellatif would be able to actively recall were “unreasonable and unrealistic”. The judge found Asio officers had a “predetermined view”. Interviewers queried Abdellatif’s phone and social media usage and who his friends were. Interrogators labelled him a “liar” and accused him of withholding information. “There was no evidence whatsoever of any inclination to bring an open mind to the question of how the applicant might behave if released into the Australian community,” the judge found. “The applicant showed, in my opinion, considerable patience and respect to the questioners, given his extraordinarily difficult circumstances.” In one interview, Abdellatif defended himself in explaining his exile from Egypt: “Not all Muslim people are terrorists … I was put in a position, in a situation where I went through these things. I can’t do anything else to prove to you that this is the truth.” On another occasion, Abdellatif, who has Crohn’s disease, said he was wearied by repetitive questioning and the inaction in his case: “I’ve had too many interviews … I told them everything and nothing happened.” Abdellatif’s detention has been consistently condemned in Australia and internationally over a number of years. The UN human rights council said it was illegal and a “clearly disproportionate … deprivation of liberty” from which he should be immediately released, while the Australian Human Rights Commission called it “arbitrary … and unjustified”. The Australian government’s own inspector general of intelligence and security criticised its “lack of coordination and … urgency”. A spokesperson for Asio said the agency was carefully reviewing the decision “and is considering its legal options”. The spokesperson said Asio’s security assessments “involved rigorous analysis of intelligence by highly-trained experts… a thorough and robust process”. “Where Asio becomes aware after the fact that information may have been obtained under torture, serious consideration is given to the overall credibility of the information.”",News/Australia news,"Australia relied on discredited evidence to detain refugee Sayed Abdellatif for 10 years, court finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/australia-relied-on-discredited-evidence-to-detain-refugee-sayed-abdellatif-for-10-years-court-finds

4/9/2022,"Victoria’s peak public hospital body has warned elective surgeries could be wound back if demand for emergency care spikes during a predicted surge in Covid cases in the coming weeks. The state’s Department of Health confirmed to Guardian Australia that four health services across the state were already not meeting the minimum nurse-to-patient ratios. The Victoria Healthcare Association predicts staff shortages will worsen over the coming weeks and months, as the state braces for the current wave of infections from the Omicron subvariant to peak later this month. The VHA’s chief executive, Tom Symondson, said despite the easing of elective surgery bans almost two months ago, the state’s hospitals were now experiencing a “difficult time again” due to increasing numbers of Covid cases, backfilling of leave and furloughed staff. “Staff shortages may worsen in coming weeks and months,” he said. Symondson said if emergency care spiked, hospitals might have to “adjust” a range of services, including elective surgery procedures, to ensure the sector could “provide safe care for the people who need it most urgently”. “Public hospitals must retain the final say on how much elective surgery they perform,” he said. Victoria’s elective surgery waitlist ballooned during the pandemic. At the end of last year, about 80,000 people in Victoria were waiting for elective surgery, but the number is likely to have increased over the past few months. The Andrews government on Sunday unveiled a $1.5bn package to help tackle the backlog of procedures. Symondson said the main problem hospitals faced was a shortage of staff, as many healthcare workers had to care for children affected by Covid. “This comes on top of a historic shortage of healthcare workers in Victoria, which has been exacerbated by border closures and burnout,” he said. “There has been no down time for our hospitals to recover from the extraordinary demand Omicron caused over summer.” The government has warned there will be a slow decline of Covid cases, with modelling predicting a “long tail” in May due to a range of factors, including more indoor activity as winter approaches. Guardian Australia understands four health services – which have one or more wards operating outside the minimum nurse-to-patient ratios – failed to reach a deadline set by the Department of Health to cease the use of the surge workforce model by the start of this month. Surge workforce models allow hospitals to source qualified health professionals who are returning to the workforce or employees from alternative industries, or fast track student’s training to fill critical workforce gaps. The ratio of one nurse to every four patients was enshrined in Victoria’s legislation in 2015. A Department of Health spokesperson said the health services using surge workforce models were implementing recovery plans to “return to normal staffing arrangements as soon as possible”. “Our health services are doing everything they can to manage staffing arrangements despite ongoing pressures from deferred care, Covid-19 admissions and staff furloughs.” Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation’s Victorian branch secretary, Lisa Fitzpatrick, said the union was working to establish local agreements with the public health services operating outside minimum ratios. “With the increasing number of Covid-positive patients requiring hospital admission and the increased numbers of staff required to furlough we are hopeful that this will not jeopardise or delay the return to compliance with the Safe Patient Care Act across the state,” Fitzpatrick said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A Monash Health spokesperson said when shortages occurred in its maternity wards, registered nurses could be used to supplement shifts. In July last year, the Andrews government announced a $13.2m boost for the state’s maternity services – under pressure from the Covid-driven baby boom – for 175 extra midwives. But the six-month funding has now run out. Last week, the health minister, Martin Foley, warned the Omicron subvariant could result in “several hundred” extra hospitalisations each day, but stressed the state’s hospitals had been working hard to prepare for increased demand. A spokesperson for Foley said the government was investing in “record levels” of health funding. “A record number of Victorians will receive elective surgery as part of the Andrews Labor government’s Covid Catch-Up Plan – designed to exceed pre-pandemic levels by 25% and get more Victorians the care they need, when they need it.”",News/Australia news,"Elective surgeries may soon be delayed due to staff shortages, Victorian hospital body says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/elective-surgeries-may-soon-be-delayed-due-to-staff-shortages-victorian-hospital-body-says
4/9/2022,"It’s a warm Wednesday afternoon in the far north Queensland city of Cairns. In a car park on Pease Street in the suburb of Manoora, the sound of clap sticks and clapping hands can be heard from inside a building. It has not yet been a week since members of Deaf Indigenous Dance Group returned from the 2021 Laura Quinkan dance festival in Cape York, in which they took part for the first time. Now they are back in their rehearsal room, practising routines for the Cairns Naidoc Week march and performances in Fogarty Park. Didg dancers at the festival in Laura, Cape York Formed in 1997, Didg celebrates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Cairns-based group’s mission is to showcase and promote their abilities and talents. As much a social club as a dance group, Didg provides a safe space for its members to dance, express their culture and hang out with other people with whom they can communicate freely. Nathaniel Murray, Paul Norman, Leslie Footscray and Clifford Johnson rehearse in Cairns Sue Frank, 43, has been involved with Didg since its inception. Today, as well as dancing in the group, she is its manager. Though she was born in Tully (two hours south of Cairns by car), her family is from Badu in the Torres Strait, where she progressed from lip reading to using sign language when she was seven or eight years old. But it wasn’t until she was much older that she met other Indigenous people who were deaf. “I was about 18 when I started getting involved with the deaf mob and the community,” Frank says. “I started taking everything in and learning. I started signing [with them] and started to develop my social skills. I got confident from being included.” Top: Amelia Street and Nathaniel Murray at Naidoc Week in Cairns; bottom: Juritju Fourmile, Leslie Footscray, Nathaniel Murray and Amelia Street at a rehearsal First Nations people have a strong cultural connection to language, she says, meaning those with hearing loss often experience high rates of loneliness – especially when they don’t have other people around them who can understand and support them. Frank has worked with deaf children in the Indigenous community of Lockhart River, on the eastern side of Cape York. “I’ve seen [Indigenous kids] who were depressed and lonely, they had no one,” she says. “The children were getting frustrated, they weren’t going to school. We tried to get the parents to bring them in; it was very difficult. There were a lot of barriers for them. There was no education about the language. They needed their language, and there was a delay.” Nathaniel Murray, Paul Norman, Jack Zitha and Amelia Street line up at Naidoc Week Leslie Footscray, 47, is from Bamaga on the northern tip of Cape York, and also has family in New Mapoon and Lockhart River. He moved to Cairns to attend school when he was 10, returning to Bamaga after he finished his education. “I was born hearing but when I was young I got little rocks got in my ears when I was swimming, which led to me becoming deaf,” he says. “My father is also deaf. “I went back to Bamaga and showed my dad and my family all the dances I knew. I tried to get him to dance with me but he wouldn’t. I asked all my family to come and dance but none of them came, I was the only one. “There was nothing for me there, so I told them I was moving back to Cairns.” He adds: “Didg is part of my family. I love the dancing and the community. When we went to Laura I was happy, it was just fantastic, lots of laughs, it was a great weekend. I feel happy that there’s people more Aboriginal people. The troupe in Laura “There is no support [for deaf kids] where I am from. I would love to see more support up there. Mum helped me a lot when I was young but after I finished school I didn’t have any work – I would just go pig hunting, and for kangaroos and echidnas. I lived on the land, we’d eat fish and turtle.” Frank says it’s important that Indigenous people with hearing impairment have the space in which to express themselves as well as their connection to culture. “Indigenous people suffer more [when they are hard of hearing],” she says. “They lose their culture, they lose their identity, they lose their language. “We are not a disability, we have an ability. We’re equal with the hearing world.”",Arts/Art and design,Getting down with Didg – Queensland’s Deaf Indigenous Dance Group,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/09/getting-down-with-didg-queenslands-deaf-indigenous-dance-group
4/9/2022,"Steel city Wollongong, and its art gallery boasting one of regional Australia’s most prized collections, is wedged in the middle of an unenviable moral quandary over the apparent Nazi past of its prime benefactor. Can the beautiful art works Bronius “Bob’’ Sredersas gave the city be distinguished from his involvement in possible Holocaust crimes, should it be determined that he worked (as archival documents strongly suggest) for the intelligence service of the Waffen SS, known as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), during the second world war? And if it’s further determined Sredersas did in all likelihood work for the SD in Lithuania, will Wollongong, having officially hailed Bob as a benevolent city hero in numerous ways for decades, be obliged to publicly retell his full malevolent story? Further, how might any public acceptance by the city and its residents, and by the gallery, that Sredersas was involved in Holocaust crimes against Lithuanian Jews, alter the way visitors view the aesthetically beautiful art he donated? Ought the art still be exhibited at all? These are just some of the thorny ethical questions Wollongong and the administrators of its gallery are now asking themselves, having finally requested that the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies and the Sydney Jewish Museum assess the documentary evidence about Sredersas’ past. The council’s decision to act is certainly better late than never. Wollongong-born Michael Samaras first raised Sredersas’ suspected Nazi past with the city in January but the council didn’t act until the Guardian published the evidence in late March). Still, there are no easy answers here. In recent days the gallery has announced it is now formally involved in a process that will “inform future steps with regard to the collection and representation of the Bob Sredersas story and background”. Hindsight in the case of Sredersas and how the city feted him while seemingly unaware of his suspected Nazi past, is difficult, though hardly pointless. Nobody evidently knew, when the mild-mannered retiree donated the artworks in the 1970s, that he might have been involved in the Nazis genocidal activities in Lithuania. Instructively, however, after he became a public figure, Sredersas’ caginess about his wartime activities might have – or perhaps even should have – raised some concerns. Those who knew him well in the Wollongong community (and there would appear to be few) will surely now be asking themselves what they might have missed and perhaps how so. Similarly, the references in media and elsewhere to his opaque wartime experiences (not least those that accompanied the 40th anniversary of the Wollongong Art Gallery) now seem freighted with a darker prescience. Sredersas lived simply. Avoided attention. His gift – “The Gift”, as it was reported in the Illawarra – was lauded. The humble former steelworks crane driver was instantly elevated to folk hero. He became the subject of national and international profiles. The gallery named an exhibition space after him, dedicated a posthumous exhibition to him and still honours him with a wall plaque. The beautiful works he spent his meagre earnings on by, among others, Grace Cossington-Smith, Arthur Streeton and Norman Lindsay, form the nationally recognised nucleus of the gallery’s prized collection. In 1976 when Sredersas donated 100 artworks to the city, the bequest was graciously taken at face value – as a generous act of appreciation to an industrial city that took him in from war-torn Europe, afforded him opportunities and accepted him as part of its community. That the bequest might have, indeed, been a genuine act of appreciation (or, indeed, part of some personal quest for redemption – as impossible as that would be to attain given Sredersas’ potential crimes against humanity) are not mutually exclusive from who he may actually turn out to be. Indeed, the Sydney Jewish Museum’s education officer Rebecca Kummerfeld referenced the acute moral complexity of the situation for Wollongong and other communities about the capacity of people who do good to also “do really atrocious things”. “If it does come out that this man did commit crimes and he was involved in genocide, it is going to be an opportunity for dialogue and asking some really challenging questions,” she said. “It is important to understand the people who contributed to this country. And to understand the light and shade in their contribution, whatever that may mean.” This goes to the heart of questions surrounding Sredersas. Can The Gift be distinguished from any evil he may be associated with? It’s an age-old cultural question that will forever vex creative industries: can art, literature and performance be differentiated from the truly appalling people who sometimes create and make it otherwise possible? That’s the grey area. Discuss. Some in the Wollongong community are already calling for any trace of Sredersas to be expunged from the official story of the city, for his name to be stripped from the gallery space that honours him and for the plaque bearing his name and photograph to be taken from the wall. Others, including Samaras, insist this is an opportunity for the city to rewrite the Sredersas story – to tell the truth about him and The Gift once and for all, and to figure out how a community that so embraced him, may have known so very little about him. Stay tuned. There is a philosophy lesson – perhaps a textbook – in this one.

4/9/2022,"There are more journalists outside the Katherine courthouse than there are residents in Larrimah, 180km down the highway. It’s 36C and the tiny town is sweating under the heat of the media spotlight as the inquest into the death of Paddy Moriarty resumes after a hiatus of almost four years. There’s an American documentary crew on its way. Reporters keep dropping in for comments. People driving past stop to take pictures of Moriarty’s deteriorating house or ask questions of the remaining residents. Some of them yell things as they speed past. The Northern Territory landscape always feels exposed to the elements, but this exposure is something else, and not what the residents – mostly retired – signed up for. Larrimah’s the kind of place you go to escape the crowds. But it’s been hard to avoid the gaze of the outside world since Moriarty, 70, and his dog, Kellie, went missing from the 12-person town in December 2017, a case so mysterious it attracted huge national and international media attention. Moriarty was known as a local larrikin, a bit of a shit stirrer, a good storyteller. He was also known for an enduring feud with his neighbour Fran Hodgetts, now 78, who ran a Devonshire tea house across the highway from his place. The pair had been fighting for about a decade. Brent Cilia, Hodgetts’ grandson, is one of three young people who have moved to Larrimah since the disappearance. He arrived more than three years ago to run the tea house and says the town has shed the reputation it used to have for feuding. Most of the residents are on good terms now, he says, and almost everyone celebrated Christmas together at the pub in the past two years. As the inquest opens, he’s serving up tea and scones to tourists, waiting for news from his grandmother, who’s been called to give evidence. This week’s inquest was the second half of proceedings that began just six months after Moriarty vanished. Almost the whole town appeared before the court then. Part two involves a smaller cast: a police officer, lawyers, a couple of Moriarty’s friends, the man who is known as the gardener. Coroner Greg Cavanagh takes the bench for his last case before retirement. Counsel assisting, Kelvin Currie, begins extracting a series of unlikely leads from two witnesses and the police evidence from the officer in charge, Det Sgt Matt Allen. Then Hodgetts appears via videolink from Melbourne, where she now lives. “I can’t hear anything, darling!” she says aiming her ear toward the camera. “I’m hard of hearing!” The technology exacerbates the confusion but a rhythm is established and Hodgetts responds to an allegation that a witness heard her offer someone $10,000 to “get rid of” Moriarty. “I never ever ever ever paid anyone to bump Paddy off,” she says. “I swear on my mother and father’s grave.” She is also asked to explain a complicated series of alleged plant poisonings, for which she says Moriarty was responsible. At the 2018 inquest, it was suggested that the harassment and damage was one of the reasons she had advertised for a live-in gardener. Hodgetts says a few weeks after Owen Laurie took up the position in August 2017, he had been attempting to plant along her fenceline and she had warned him not to put them there, in case someone killed them. He had allegedly replied: “If anyone touches my plants, it will be the first murder in Larrimah.” Now, when Currie asks about the comment, Hodgetts says it was a joke. Laurie takes the stand and says the same. But then comes the bombshell: eight secret police tapes recorded (with a warrant) in Laurie’s home in the six months following Moriarty’s disappearance. In the first, a man’s voice says: “Tell them what I’ve done. Hit with a fucking hammer.” Laurie denies the voice is his, then exercises his right to remain silent. The tapes play for the next half an hour. Some include singing and yodelling. One sounds like a sea shanty. “I killerated old Paddy,” a voice says, after a country guitar interlude. “I fucking killerated him. I struck him on the fucking head and killerated him.” In another tape, a voice says: “You fuck’n killed Paddy, doonged him on the head. Donged him on the head … Smacked him on the fucken nostrils, smacked him on the fucken nostrils … with me claw hammer.” Following a guitar ballad, a voice says: “You gotta find out who fucking done it mate, that’s if you don’t find the fucking body ... I can tell you, you are not finding out.” Eventually, the tapes run out. After a brief silence and a final “no comment”, Laurie is dismissed. The next day, Cavanagh announces his findings: Moriarty and his dog are certainly dead. “In my opinion, Paddy and his dog were killed in the context of and likely due to the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbour,” Cavanagh says. Cavanagh says the evidence in Moriarty’s home – his hat, glasses, keycard and food on the table – indicated he had returned from the Larrimah Hotel that night, then left the house again with his dog. “There is no evidence as to where he went, however, it is my view it’s likely that the new plants at Fran’s place were of some attraction to him.” The Coroner’s Act does not permit a finding that might suggest an individual may be guilty of an offence, and Cavanagh confirms he will report his findings to the commissioner of police and the director of public prosecutions for further action or investigation. Police say a $250,000 reward for information that leads to the discovery of Moriarty’s body or the conviction of his killer still stands. “Murder investigations are challenging, particularly without a body,” Allen says. “The case doesn’t get closed until it is solved. We need to find Paddy.” As the news of the findings filters through, Cilia says, residents dropped in to see if he was OK, one bringing a pack of smokes from town, another some fresh-laid eggs. Although he feels unsettled, Cilia says he’s sure his grandmother had nothing to do with Moriarty’s death. Still, it’s hard to live in a town that small where the coroner thinks a man was murdered. The rest of the residents are shaken too. “I know it’s affecting all of them,” Cilia says. “They’re all older and they’ve been through so much and you can see they’re sick and tired, a little. And it hurts me because they built this town. And it’s a good town. You don’t want it to be known as that place a murder happened.” And so, once more, the people who loved Moriarty find themselves in limbo – that terrible space between knowing and not knowing what happened to their mate. Karen and Mark Rayner had known Moriarty since they moved to Larrimah in 2015. During the first half of the inquest, they were called as witnesses. This time, they sat quietly in the courtroom, listening. Back in Larrimah, they say they don’t want Moriarty’s memory eclipsed by what happened to him. “For us who had the privilege of knowing Paddy, we saw the caring, giving, honest and genuine person he was,” Karen Rayner says. “He didn’t seem to leave too many footprints on this Earth but he definitely left a footprint on our hearts. It was a pleasure to have laughed with him and to hear the yarns he spun about his life. We will miss him always.”",News/Australia news,"Larrimah reflects on a feud, a death and an inquest that exposed the tiny outback town to the world",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/larrimah-reflects-on-a-feud-a-death-and-an-inquest-that-exposed-the-tiny-outback-town-to-the-world
4/9/2022,"Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, is renowned for speaking his mind. But when asked this week whether the state budget will include funding for more police officers, he was uncharacteristically reserved. “We’ll have more to say at the appropriate time but no one should be in any doubt, there are more police in Victoria today than there has ever been,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “The last update I had is that we, in fact, have more police – by head count – than any other state, even states that are considerably bigger than us. That doesn’t happen by accident. It’s happened because we have invested very, very heavily and we aim to continue as we have started.” He was careful not to dismiss the staff allocation modelling (SAM), brought in by the government in 2016 to predict how many additional police the state would need each year. It reportedly shows 1,500 frontline officers must be added to the force over the next four years to keep up with demand. Government sources, however, say the modelling has been skewed by the enforcement of Covid-19 restrictions earlier in the pandemic. “The staffing allocation model, as good as it is, was not written with a global pandemic in mind,” Andrews said. “I’m not here to speak to the staffing allocation model. People can speculate about what the model says and doesn’t say. I don’t propose working through those issues at a press conference.” About an hour later, the Police Association head, Wayne Gatt, held a press conference of his own. “Last I checked, it was the premier’s signature and the police minister’s signature committing to SAM,” he said. “SAM has said we need 1,500 additional police, the force should get 1,500 additional police. “We’re on the cusp of a new term of government and I think the community have a right to know ahead of making a decision in November, whether or not both sides of government quite frankly intend to maintain their commitment to keep recruiting levels where they should be.” The Police Association boasts a membership of 98% of all sworn officers – compared with the union movement’s average of 14% in the wider workforce – giving it significant leverage with the government of the day. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some credit the association’s “cutting police numbers is a crime” campaign with bringing down premier Jeff Kennett’s Coalition government in 1999. But while Kennett tried to rein in spending, the current Labor government has increased it. According to the latest annual reports, Victoria police has a budget of $3.8bn and 21,774 personnel, while NSW – a state three-times the geographical size, with 1.4 million more people – has a budget of $3.9bn and 21,879 personnel. The growth in Victoria’s police force can be attributed to a $2bn announcement by Andrews in December 2016 to recruit more than 3,100 extra officers. It was the single biggest increase in the force in history and came after the state’s crime rate jumped 10% on the previous year. Then, after the Bourke Street massacre in 2017, Andrews introduced bail laws he described as the country’s “most onerous”. Intended to target violent men, they have instead disproportionately affected Aboriginal Victorians, young people and women. Prison populations have swelled, largely with people who are yet to be sentenced. Meanwhile, Victoria police has been under scrutiny for using the barrister Nicola Gobbo as an informant, the death of an Aboriginal woman, Tanya Day, in custody, the leaking of photos of the former AFL coach Dani Laidley, and an administrative bungle that led to more than 1,000 officers working without proper authority. And an inquiry by the Victorian Law Reform Commission found stalking is “often minimised or trivialised” by police, with victims left to manage alone. “Each time I went to my local station, all they would do was say, ‘He hasn’t broken any laws so we can’t do anything,’” one victim told the VLRC. Another said victims were treated “like they are behaving irrationally”. It’s clear Andrews is walking a thin blue line – trying to avoid conflict with the police union in an election year but also not immediately heeding its calls. Best he not slip.",News/Australia news,Daniel Andrews walking a thin blue line with Victoria’s police union,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/daniel-andrews-walking-a-thin-blue-line-with-victorias-police-union
4/9/2022,"In the space of an hour on Thursday night, two Queensland Liberal National stalwarts made announcements that shook the party from the right, and then the left. First, George Christensen announced he had formally left the LNP – ending a political farce that has seen the retiring federal MP for Dawson slide deeper into far-rightwing anti-government conspiracy, all the while remaining a member of the government. Soon after, the Bundaberg mayor, Jack Dempsey – a former state police and Indigenous affairs minister – announced he would run as an independent in Hinkler, a seat held by the resources minister, Keith Pitt. Other than their former party affiliation, Christensen and Dempsey have little in common. But the announcements have some in the LNP worried about its ability to present a coherent federal election campaign message in a deeply complex state. Queensland has always presented as an oddity to outsiders; for more than three decades, with only a few rare exceptions, the state has voted for the Coalition at federal elections, and for Labor to run its state government. One of the reasons – and there are too many to delve into completely here – has been the troubled merger of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland, which created a state party with a church of competing ideologies so broad that “everyone sings their own hymn and the noise just sounds awful”. Christensen’s seat is centred on Mackay and the Whitsunday region. There’s no other stretch of Queensland coastline that better explains how complex the state is to navigate politically. Mackay is a Labor town: working class, Catholic and socially conservative. Some locals are coalminers, others are cane-growers. Drive a little farther north to Airlie Beach, and you’ll meet tourism operators who make their living on the climate-threatened Great Barrier Reef. The next stop is Bowen, the shipping hub for Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. Meanwhile, Dempsey is running in Hinkler, a seat that takes in the retirement mecca of Hervey Bay and his home town of Bundaberg. Just this week, the Queensland government rejected plans for a coalmine near Bundaberg – an announcement that was broadly welcomed in the community. The mayor of Bundaberg says the LNP has become “obsessed with coal” and that his community has genuine climate change concerns. I’m hearing similar things about Gladstone and Townsville. Momentum for climate action is building in some of these places, as communities start to grasp that a new economy can also mean new job opportunities. Queensland politics can be confusing to outsiders. Often different messages are required to woo voters in neighbouring towns. Relying on binary definitions like city/region or coal/climate is far too simplistic. A lot was made of Labor’s 2019 federal election campaign in Queensland and the impact of its attempts to “walk both sides of the street” on issues like the Adani coalmine. Labor campaigners think the direct impact of Adani is overstated – the real issue was the way the party ran a macro-level campaign that didn’t resonate anywhere, rather than using tailored messaging in different parts of the state. The “Queensland paradox” – the need to tell voters different things in Toowong and Townsville – is most often framed in national debate as a problem for Labor. But it will be fascinating to watch how the Coalition attempts to avoid being skewered by that same wedge; particularly as the party finds itself under pressure from both the right – Clive Palmer, Pauline Hanson, Campbell Newman and Christensen are all former party members and darlings of the fringe – and also from a moderate defector like Dempsey. Every move to shore up Dawson or Flynn (where the LNP candidate, Colin Boyce, believes renewable energy is a “fantasy”) could come at political cost to city-based Liberals such as Trevor Evans in Brisbane or Julian Simmonds in Ryan. Every billion devoted to “pie in the sky” Queensland dams – no matter how questionable the spending – makes others wonder why it took a political fight to get federal funding for flood resilience projects in the south-east. There is a lot of movement required to shift LNP incumbents in many Queensland seats, particularly the stretch of bellwether electorates running from central to north Queensland. Swings were so large in 2019 that many LNP members went from tight margins to very comfortable ones. But at the same time, the form book means nothing in Hinkler, where Pitt has a 14% margin but is now running against a mayor who won 64% of the popular vote in Bundaberg. Ditto in Dawson, where Christensen’s brand of Catholic/DLP politics won him personal support among longtime Labor voters. In his resignation statement, Christensen made clear his issues with the LNP’s broad church. “The party needs to undertake some serious soul-searching about what – and who – it stands for,” he said.",News/Australia news,Living on the wedge: why the Coalition faces threats from left and right in Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/living-on-the-wedge-why-the-coalition-faces-threats-from-left-and-right-in-queensland
4/9/2022,"“My opponent in the election, Anthony Albanese, is a complete blank page,” Scott Morrison declared on high rotation this week. “He’s not a small target, he’s a complete blank page. At a time of great uncertainty, considerable uncertainty, not just in the economy but also in terms of national security – a blank page is no answer to the problems Australia faces.” Morrison is hammering this because the observation has salience. Voters in the marginal seats we’ve visited around the country say they don’t yet have a firm grip on the Labor leader, or his policy offering. The Labor campaign is taking a risk by not fleshing out their candidate – something I pointed out a month ago. The lack of definition around Albanese is, in fact, the bedrock of Morrison’s opening campaign pitch, which is better the devil you know. But can we please get real? Coming from Morrison, blank page is an ironic charge. He could easily be talking about himself in 2019. The last time Morrison faced an electoral contest, he donned a baseball cap and jetted around the country telling voters not to vote for Bill Shorten. That was it. That was the pitch. The bill Australia can’t afford. Morrison was the ultimate blank page. Apart from delivering tax cuts, what would happen during the prime minister’s first 100 days, or even the next three years, was a mystery to me in 2019, and I watch politics for a living. Last time Morrison faced the people, he’d been prime minister for less than a year. After Malcolm Turnbull was bundled out of office, Morrison became Australia’s fifth prime minister in a decade. Four of the five had taken the job after a leadership spill. He wasn’t well known, and he certainly wasn’t fully fleshed out. So this “blank page” narrative is not only self-serving, it’s hypocritical. Being a blank page is also not a barrier to winning an election. Morrison himself is the proof point. Things are different now of course. After the victory in 2019, Morrison accumulated a record. He has toned down the cosplay and now campaigns in navy suits, projecting like an incumbent. Morrison can’t shed the record, so he has to make a virtue of necessity. He’ll campaign on the record, or at least the bits he considers favourable, while contending Albanese has no record, so he’s a risk. Morrison’s version of his record will doubtless be a cavalcade of achievements. But this telling will be selective, because the material is mixed. Best to be direct. The worst of Morrison is right up there with the worst I’ve seen in two decades of political reporting. That’s the truth. Genuinely, terrible. Let’s recap these past three years. After sailing back into government with no clear agenda, the government drifted. New MPs arriving served up an ideas boom. It wasn’t just the newbies. Frustration was building inside the government. The frustration was about power without purpose. The economy was grinding, not thriving. There was angst about climate and energy policy and other hot button issues. Morrison was unhappy with the restiveness. As the months went on, the prime minister told the young and the restless to pull their heads in. Then we hit the bushfires in late 2019-20. Morrison’s now infamous Hawaiian sojourn. Not holding a hose. The terrible body language in Cobargo. The inability to speak honestly and transparently about the obvious link between climate change and the catastrophe. That discordant interlude where a promotional video was issued on one of the most perilous days of the disaster. Morrison was in political freefall. The coronavirus pandemic saved him, which seems an odd thing to say, given how much anxiety and adversity Morrison and his ministers faced, particularly over the first 12 months. Morrison learned a critical lesson from the bushfires: don’t look impotent. He grabbed the second disaster and folded the premiers into a war cabinet. Morrison is task oriented. A pandemic generates an enormous number of tasks. The prime minister thundered through his daily to-do list like a man who would live and die politically by the decisions he was making. During the first 12 months, he was rewarded for his pragmatism in the pursuit of saving lives and livelihoods. But in the second, things became more fraught, and not only because the government initially botched the procurement of life-saving vaccines. Morrison constructed his electoral pitch in 2019 around narrowcasting to the “quiet Australians” (a rip-off of Richard Nixon’s silent majority or John Howard’s battlers). But the political backwash of the pandemic was complicated. Opinion polls suggested a majority of Australians were on board with the public health measures, and the government’s massive fiscal response minimised labour market scarring – an important policy achievement. But a vocal minority found the intrusions enraging. Some of the quiet Australians got noisy, and the pandemic, politically, for the Coalition transited from political plus to political risk. As this played out, Morrison comprehensively botched his response to parliament’s #MeToo reckoning. The prime minister shrank, schemed and strategised when he should have listened, empathised and led. He then dragged the Coalition into making a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, which should have been one of his signature achievements, but he failed the future. Morrison discounted his own pivot by producing no credible policy to deliver the pledge. Humanity won’t be saved by a catchphrase. Ask the residents of Lismore. Morrison ramped up the national security rhetoric, correctly identifying we live in the most dangerous geopolitical times since the second world war. But he also executed the Aukus agreement, which leaves Australia with a substantial defence capability gap, unless there’s something about this procurement the prime minister isn’t disclosing pre-election. In the process, Morrison enraged France, a significant Pacific power. In what remains an absolutely extraordinary geopolitical moment, Emmanuel Macron branded Morrison a liar. There were the sports grants. The car park grants. Excoriations by the Australian National Audit Office. Morrison promised to deliver a federal anti-corruption watchdog and failed to deliver. Morrison also promised to protect religious freedom. That promise was whittled back to an anti-discrimination package that some of his own people refused to support because of their moral discomfort about allowing vulnerable transgender kids to become casualties of concocted woke wars. I said earlier Morrison was a blank page in 2019. Perhaps this isn’t quite right. Perhaps a better analogy is a mirror. To stay in power, Morrison disappeared behind a reflective surface and positioned Shorten in front of it. When Morrison did present himself to the community, what they saw was themselves, because he mirrored them. Avuncular suburban dad who mans the barbecue all day at the school fete, with a cheery wife who does the carpool. Those endless, looping TV pictures – prime ministerial wallpaper. Hands on hips, head nodding, a consoling arm draped around a shoulder, a simulacrum of listening. A Christian for Christians, but not too churchy. Saturday night curry chef. Go Sharks. Morrison could mirror successfully in the past because he’s a relentless researcher of the zeitgeist, and he wasn’t weighted with baggage and accumulated disappointments. But as weight accumulates, the mimesis reveals itself. All this probably sounds like I think Morrison will lose the coming election. That’s not right actually. As this contest opens, I think it’s entirely possible, perhaps even likely, he’ll win. Morrison is relentless on the stump. Labor’s pathway to victory is narrow. In the absence of outsized anti-government swings, Albanese will struggle to pick up seats in Queensland. There will also likely be a high non-major party vote. How will those preferences distribute? So the devil you know might prove the winning pitch. But voters are fatigued by Morrison’s shtick. Polls show that. Vox pops around the country record the frustration. The Liberal candidates in marginal seats busily distancing themselves from him demonstrate that Morrison is a drag on their campaigns. After three years of adversity, Australians lack appetite for a political circus. An impromptu excoriation Morrison copped on Thursday night from pensioner Ray Drury was potent because it nailed the prime minister’s chief vulnerability – the measurable gap between rhetoric and delivery. In their darker moments, ambitious leaders wonder how things end. Is it with a stab in the back by a colleague? A loss to a lesser opponent? Because of happenstance, or events? Or does it end because Australian voters lack mercy when they believe a leader hasn’t met the moment? Political endings can be pitiless. The world shrinks until it’s just you, and the indignity of rejection, a loss so intense it transforms some discarded prime ministers into miserable ghosts. Drury gave Morrison a harbinger of how public life can end this week. Drury told Morrison he had promised that people who had a go would get a go. “Well, I’ve had a go, mate, I’ve worked all my life and paid my taxes,” the pensioner said. When Morrison tried to talk him down, Drury gave it to him straight: “You better fucking do something, I don’t care. “I’m sick of your bullshit.”",News/Australia news,For three years the prime minister has schemed and strategised.

4/9/2022,"The northern rivers region of New South Wales has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the country. Lush, rolling hills in every gradient of green. There’s the ancient rainforests, mountain ranges, famous beaches. A subtropical climate. In the long golden afternoons, there is magic in those hills. But on 28 February, everything changed. After six months of rain, the rivers overflowed and flooded. Paradise was lost. Rivers changed shape, carving wider into steep new banks, gouging out roads. The land slipped and slid in the hills, taking houses with it. In the towns, people were left traumatised, their homes trashed. In devastated Lismore, flood-affected residents were taking the first steps towards recovery when, on 30 March, it flooded again. Tentative hope turned to disbelief. Now they are in limbo, exhausted, disoriented, waiting on decisions. Houses are not habitable, scattered across the region. Sleeping in caravans, tents and sheds, or couch-surfing in the overcrowded houses of friends. A university town with a vibrant arts community, Lismore, known affectionately as Lovemore, is a diverse place full of colourful characters and lovely old wooden cottages. In the “rainbow region”, there is “a kitsch vibe” and a strong sense of community, resident Douglas Haigh says. But right now, environmental lawyer and NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson says “it is like a war zone”. “At the moment the only available cooked food in Lismore is [from] a voluntary kitchen,” Higginson says. Danielle Toms speaks for many when she says her mental health is “balancing on a pinhead”. She needs a safe place for her children and pets. “Beyond the resilient, strong mask I kid myself with, I’m just totally lost and don’t know where to turn – and more than anything I just want to go home, even if it doesn’t look like the home I once knew,” she says. This is, in every sense of the word, a watershed moment for Lismore. In the magnitude of this disaster, the question of what to do about Lismore can no longer be pushed aside. This has to be the catalyst for change. Can they continue to live on an active flood plain where they get jittery every time it rains? Is Lismore still viable as a town? “With fast velocity flood waters it is demonstrably getting worse and the occurrences are more frequent,” town planner Peter Cumming says. “We actually have to deal with it.” Cumming believes there is a case for relocation. “But the difficulty is making that happen. And you’ve got to act quickly to do that.” He says disaster-prone Queensland is far more prepared. “You have got something like the Queensland Reconstruction Authority in place to organise it,” he says. “It has the finance, the acquisition power to actually make it happen. New South Wales hasn’t got that.” He says Lismore needs experts who know what they are doing. “Not politicians. And you can’t just rely on a council with no money. They need guidance and hope with firm actions and firm expert opinion.” Higginson agrees, saying a rapid response is needed. “People need to know within the next six months,” Higginson says. “Are they rebuilding? What are they doing? We are literally at a dysfunctional stand still. We are compounding the trauma by having no plan and no response. What we need is a community adaptation plan.” She considers the idea of relocation and land swap as an option. “The government needs to immediately source that land, secure that land, and then offer a fair swap to landholders who are down in those lowest areas,” she says. “The ones that really get smashed and where people were rescued off their roofs holding on for their lives. No matter what we do, we can’t make them safe. The swapped lowlands should be regenerated to nature, cultural, park, recreational, educational and marketplace lands. ” For those on the lower slopes, she says “we need to assist them to raise their homes and buildings in the safest way with appropriate materials”. “We need a whole of catchment and [a] rehabilitation plan to retain rainfall, reduce run-off, lower flood heights and delay flood peaks.” The Queensland Reconstruction Authority was behind the moving of part of the town of Grantham in the Lockyer valley, where 21 people died in a flash flood in January 2011. Mayor Tanya Milligan says it’s been a success. “We have 111 families on higher ground that can sleep at night, that are safe,” Milligan says. “Is that a win? Yeah. That’s 111 families that weren’t in [evacuation] centres and places of shelter in times of an event we have just come through.” Milligan says it was “a huge, huge ordeal”, and the first challenge was securing political and financial support. With $9m each from the state and federal governments, the council bought 935 acres for $30m. “Eleven years on, we still owe $6.3m,” Milligan says. There was, she says, “lots of conversations, lots of sitting down and talking [to] community”, including vulnerable people trying to make life-changing decisions who were assisted by case workers. “If you had a small block, you could swap it for a small block. If you had a large block you could swap it for a large block. It was all done by a ballot system,” she says. “So people would clear their block and give that block to the council.” Milligan says if she was being brutally honest, that land “was worth nothing”. Those with insurance had the ability to build a new home. “But not everyone had the ability to do that. In a perfect world, it would not be at a cost to anyone.” Those who didn’t have insurance, or the funds, stayed behind. And got flooded again. Artist Victoria Lane lost her studio and her home on 28 February. She and her mother own 10 acres and a beautiful cottage they spent $150,000 renovating. All of it went under. One of their horses died in the flood. Now her 82-year-old mother doesn’t know if she wants to go back, and she has nightmares. Lane runs art classes in the studio, so if she moved away she would have no income. “I don’t know whether to just put it on the market as a fixer-upper – would anybody buy it?” Lane says. “Then try and cut our losses, or if there’s a buyback system, yeah, I’m definitely interested, but it depends what that is. I can’t just live on a block of land in a tin shed. I feel like I have been working all my life to have nothing.” Des Grace has lived in Lismore for all of his 53 years and he has had enough. On the night of 28 February, he spent eight hours in a kayak tied to his house with his 15-year-old daughter, before climbing up a tree on to the roof. He had just had surgery for cancer and is still traumatised when it rains. In an extraordinary piece of luck, he had refinanced six weeks before the flood and “they insisted I got flood insurance – I’ve never had it before”. He has since been able to buy a property in Tenterfield. “There were years where we’ve had six floods before between November and May. So I’m kind of betting on another one before May. I am a tough bastard and I’ve had enough. As a global warming realist I don’t have any doubts about the impacts, so I know these events are only going to get bigger and stronger.” As for the rest of Lismore: “How long is it going to take to rebuild? And if they do rebuild, how many people can afford it?” Tony Davies, chief executive of the non-profit organisation Social Futures, is concerned that in a land swap deal, those who could not afford to relocate would be left behind. “To move a community like that, the community would have to be involved in the decision making,” Davies says. “Lismore is absolutely their home, a place they are deeply attached to. Any relocation of neighbourhoods has to be done in a way where the neighbourhood is preserved by the community connections. “If you just build houses and don’t focus on the neighbourhood, you end up with incredible social dislocation.” He says one of the greatest resources people in these communities have is “their social connection”. “I think a big discussion needs to be had. If the costs are not subsidised by the community as a whole you’re going to result in a greater polarisation between haves and have-nots. The most immediate priority for me is proper disaster planning.” Lismore councillor Big Rob says a government buyback won’t work as he believes the amount that a person would get for land on a floodplain won’t be enough to buy elsewhere, particular with house price rises. The idea of a land swap “is feasible, definitely”, he says. “But there are too many competing interests, and just so many issues to address. We just need money, a lot of it, to find better solutions. Otherwise our best solution is to try and reduce the peaks of the big floods and minimise their impacts as best we can.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Eli Roth never wants to leave his house in Union Street. He saved up and bought it two years ago, when he was 27. He used to ride his bike past it when he was a kid. “I bought this place pretty damn confidently,” he says. “The highest flood on record in 1974 never hit the floorboards.” On 28 February he was rescued off its roof. Roth was born in Lismore and feels deeply connected to his community and to his elderly neighbour, Gary. “My heart and soul belong to this town, this community,” he says. The house backs on to the spectacular Lyster Creek – which engulfed his property five weeks ago. “I told myself when I first moved here, I’ll never sell this place, because of the river view out the back – although it pretty much almost killed us,” he says. “It’s saved me a lot of times as well. Just mentally, coming home after a hard day’s work or having a rough day and [I can] just go out and look at it. And it’s just like everything’s OK. Having a coffee in the morning and watching the sun rise over it is priceless.” No matter what happens, this is his home. “Even if I’m left with a vacant block with a caravan on it and still paying my mortgage – I’m staying.

4/9/2022,"A 23-year-old mother of two disappears. She was last seen leaving a remote pub with a stranger. The woman comes from a tight-knit community and loves her family – who instantly suspect foul play. One might imagine what follows next. Footage of helicopters and extensive ground search operations. Televised appeals and rewards for information. An outpouring of grief and rage. National headlines. Perhaps a true crime podcast series. But the disappearance of Kowanyama woman Allison Neridine Bernard on the night of 10 February 2013 was met with relative media silence. Few who lived beyond her Cape York home, where the Mitchell River flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria, would have heard Bernard’s family describe the cheeky little girl who grew into a quiet, proud and loving mother. Or know that she was a woman who loved to dance and to swim in the fresh water of her country, or that her favourite flower was the orange hibiscus. How many saw her family lay those hibiscus around framed photos of Bernard and her family at a court in Cairns this week, where coroner Nerida Wilson ordered police to undertake fresh searches for her body? The searches are to be carried out at a property on the Archer River quarry, known as the Bend, which was previously the home of the man last seen with Bernard, Thomas Byrnes. Byrnes has repeatedly denied having anything to do with the disappearance of Bernard who, he says, had come to his home and then “gone walkabout”. Nearby mine shafts and a dam are to be searched too, at the request of Wilson, who said she would ask the Queensland police commissioner to review the initial investigation into Bernard’s disappearance. While this week’s hearings have been regularly reported by the local Cairns Post and National Indigenous Television, the lawyer representing Bernard’s family at the inquest, Debbie Kilroy, says other media coverage has been “pretty much nonexistent”. “Ms Bernard is not the young white woman that the media or police are interested in,” she says. “If it was a white woman that was disappeared, never to be seen again, there would have been a hell of a lot of resources thrown into that investigation, there would have been national media coverage and she would have been found back in 2013.” The Queensland police service has previously said it conducted an exhaustive investigation into Bernard’s disappearance and that there was no proof she was killed. “The Queensland police service acknowledges the coroner’s direction regarding further searches and obtaining opinions from specific experts,” a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. “These will be carefully considered and acted on in due course.” But human rights advocate and lawyer Hannah McGlade says the case of Allison Bernard is far from isolated. The Kurin Minang Noongar woman has spent more than three decades working in violence against Aboriginal women and co-authored an Indigenous femicide case study. In her home state of Western Australia, where Aboriginal mothers are 17.5 times more likely to be murder victims than non-Indigenous mothers, she is campaigning for a parliamentary inquiry into the killing of Indigenous women and girls. McGlade says racial profiling works both ways, describing a national pattern of over-policing Aboriginal women as potential offenders, and under-policing them as victims. She says the violence inflicted upon Aboriginal women is rooted in the colonial view of as them as “sub-human, to be exploited for labour and sexual purposes”. “This is a long, violent and racist history that has never been addressed in Australia,” McGlade says. “It’s not a subject that Australia talks about, but this abuse of Aboriginal women was deeply embedded in the national white psyche. This is very much alive.” An associate professor at Curtin University, McGlade says the media has played “a significant role in normalising systemic, horrific violence” by devaluing the lives of Indigenous women. “Aboriginal victims of state violence, of murder, of rape, are not given media attention,” she says. “Sometimes the story doesn’t even make the news, it is not considered newsworthy. This is blatant, overt racism.” But if much of the general public has been unaware of the disappearance of Allison Bernard for nine years, her unexplained absence is something her family has had to live with every day. “They don’t know where their mother is,” Kilroy says. “That grief, you can feel it, it’s palpable.” She is not convinced the renewed search will find the missing woman. But Kilroy hopes, for the sake of Bernard’s family, it does. “So Ms Bernard can be taken home and buried cultural ways and her spirit can rest at peace,” she says.

4/9/2022,"Perhaps the message was too familiar. With the unofficial election campaign under way, and the prime minister mired in escalating allegations of bullying and duplicity, a major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world’s most respected climate science body – quickly disappeared from the Australian news cycle this week. The report, the third major release from the IPCC’s sixth assessment of the published evidence, focused on greenhouse gas emissions cuts – what has happened to date and what is necessary from here. Headlines told part of the story: it was “now or never” if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The report suggests that threshold is already practically out of reach without using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky. Keeping heating below 2C, which would trigger damage several magnitudes worse than 1.5C, will require an “abrupt acceleration” of effort after 2030. In a sane world, this alone may be enough to make it a focus of political discussion, now and through the election. But there was much more. The report suggests a rapid reduction in emissions over the next decade is within the world’s grasp – if leaders, policymakers and investors are motivated. Here are some key lessons relevant to Australia. Any suggestion there isn’t technology that could deliver deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions this decade – as scientists and leaders at UN climate talks have repeatedly said is necessary – should be dispelled by this report. This is a key point in Australia given the Morrison government’s “technology, not taxes” mantra. The Coalition’s focus is on supporting technologies that are not yet commercially viable with an expectation they will deliver cuts mostly after 2030 and closer to 2050. It rejects calls for policies to rapidly deploy clean technology now, equating them to “taxes’’ that increase costs. The IPCC report tells a different story. It takes a global view and is not policy prescriptive, but says there are options available to cut emissions across all areas that already make economic sense. In several cases it suggests they would cost less than continuing with the polluting status quo. As the Australian National University’s Prof Frank Jotzo, a lead author on the report, spelled out this week, the IPCC found global emissions could be cut by 50% by 2030 through affordable steps. Jotzo says the general findings of the report are “very readily applied to Australia”. Solar and wind power are the obvious cases. Their average costs fell by 85% and 55% respectively in the decade to 2019. The IPCC estimates building a lot more of both could cut emissions by about 5bn tonnes a year – nearly 10% of the global total – by 2030 while saving governments and consumers money compared with the alternative. They could deliver nearly 3bn tonnes more for a relatively low cost. The ramifications for Australia are potentially significant. Compared with nearly every other country, it has vast amounts of sun and wind and no shortage of space in which to harness them. The IPCC implicitly supports the idea that there is a strong economic argument to quickly boost renewable energy deployment beyond the current pace of expansion as part of a campaign to “electrify everything”, including transport, farms and major industry. The report lists other options that could lead to cuts that were either cheaper than what we have now or would cost relatively little. Programs that reduce demand for energy are a big one – they save money. Other familiar ideas that could be accelerated include improving buildings’ and industry’s energy efficiency, boosting carbon sequestration in agriculture and stopping native forest clearing. Other cheap options are yet to get much traction in Australia at the federal level. Transport is a big one. The IPCC’s data suggests shifting to more fuel-efficient cars and trucks and relying more on public transport, bikes and e-bikes makes economic sense and is good for the planet. These aren’t revolutionary ideas, just ones that have been resisted until now. On fue- efficient cars, the Coalition planned a policy that would have required a reduction in average emissions from the national car fleet – basically, forcing auto companies to sell cleaner cars – but dropped it after industry and internal pushback, despite receiving advice it could benefit the economy by up to $13.9bn. It is part of the reason the Australian car fleet remains dirtier than other comparable countries and the country trails most others in embracing electric vehicles. Despite persistent claims to the contrary from industry and fossil fuel-friendly MPs, the IPCC makes it clear that promotion of coal and gas – a favourite pastime of Australian politicians – is making it harder to keep global heating to 1.5C. The basic argument is straightforward: if existing fossil fuel plants run for their expected lifetimes, the world will blow the carbon budget to keep the temperature rise below that level. New developments only add to that. To keep the goals of the landmark Paris climate agreement within reach, countries should embark on a dedicated effort to decommission, cut back and cancel fossil fuel projects – or be prepared to spend even more on nascent technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In reality, both are likely to be needed. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, thundered this point as the report was released, describing investments in new fossil fuel projects as “moral and economic madness”, and that countries that were increasing fossil fuel production – not activists – were “the truly dangerous radicals” on climate change. He didn’t name Australia this time – that was last month when he called it a “holdout” on climate change for refusing to strengthen 2030 emissions reduction targets – but the message was clear. Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals.But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. The Morrison government has not been swayed. It is backing a “gas-fired recovery”, including opening up new basins with the potential to release extraordinary amounts of greenhouse gas, as vital for the country’s future after the pandemic. Labor does not oppose the expansion. Scott Morrison has also declared the country’s coal plants should run for “as long as they possibly can” and the resources minister, Keith Pitt, cheered a recent surge in coal and gas demand after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Australia is the world’s third-biggest fossil fuel exporter, with government economic forecasts suggesting it will export more than 200m tonnes of thermal coal and about 80m tonnes of gas each year between now and 2027. The government argues there is no need to change this until demand dries up. It says developing countries need coal and gas to grow, that gas reduces emissions overseas by replacing coal (no evidence supplied) and that the focus should be on steps that give fossil fuels a future in a low-emissions world, including developing technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and “blue” hydrogen made with gas. But the IPCC suggests supporting continued use of fossil fuels overseas can lock in polluting energy sources that are increasingly more expensive than renewables. And attempting to add CCS to fossil fuel energy just makes it even more expensive. This is a big one in Australia, where governments have committed more than $4bn to try to make the technology viable. The Morrison government has kicked in hundreds of millions. The IPCC makes clear CCS – stopping emissions going into the atmosphere, usually by burying them underground – will have to prove economically viable for fossil fuels to have a future in a world that keeps heating below 2C. Despite having targets that assume more than 3C of warming, Australia is notionally committed to this. One of the government’s “stretch goals” under its technology investment roadmap is to get the cost of CCS to under $20 per tonne of emissions. The IPCC report suggests this remains a long way off. A table on the likely average cost of technologies available this decade puts CCS among the most expensive. The science body has revised down its assessment of how much of global electricity it expects to come from fossil fuels with CCS in 2040 since the last time it reported from 5% to 3%. The report says polluting industries want CCS to work as it could “allow fossil fuels to be used longer”, reducing the likelihood of assets becoming stranded. But despite having been promised for decades, and having had billions of dollars in funding committed to it in Australia alone, CCS still only captures about 0.3% of the 34.6bn tonnes of annual global emissions released burning fossil fuels. This one shouldn’t be overstated, for obvious enough reasons. Global emissions continue to rise, though the pace has slowed since 2010. But there is evidence that serious efforts to cut emissions work. In 2016, steps such as accelerating available technology, backing energy efficiency and slowing deforestation lowered the global total by 5.9bn tonnes. That’s about a 10% cut. The report says at least 24 countries have cut emissions in absolute terms over at least a decade. The problem is that these cuts are outweighed by rapid growth elsewhere. In Australia, the government points to evidence that national emissions are down about 20% since 2005 – and has called on other countries to “follow our leadership” – but the headline number relies on greenhouse accounting sleights of hand that mask the reality. Fossil fuel emissions – the main game – were rising before the Covid-19 lockdowns hit due to increases from transport, mining and major industry. Government projections suggest those sectors will do little to reduce their impact before 2030. The claimed reduction since 2005 mostly happened when Labor was in power, between 2007 and 2013. Even then, it was mostly due to state policies that slowed the country’s extraordinary pace of forest destruction for agriculture, particularly in Queensland. Australia is still clearing native forests, just at a slower pace. Under greenhouse accounting, that counts as a cut in annual emissions. But it is not evidence of a country transforming its economy. The IPCC report suggests there is another way ahead.
