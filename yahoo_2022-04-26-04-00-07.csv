4/26/2022,"Mark Meadows texted with Trump’s family, Jan. 6 rally organizers, right-wing media personalities, and over 40 Republican members of Congress between Election Day and President Biden’s inauguration just over two months later, CNN reported on Monday. The messages, which have been obtained by the Jan. 6 committee, make clear that the former chief of staff was the Trump administration’s point person for the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and that the effort extended throughout the Republican Party. One of the dozens of GOP lawmakers communicating with Meadows during the time between the election and the inauguration was Marjorie Taylor Greene, the conspiracy theorist from Georgia who just last Friday testified under oath about her alleged role in the events of last Jan. 6. Greene, who has repeatedly defended those who stormed the Capitol, appeared to have done so on the morning of Jan. 7, as well.

Jamie Raskin Says “Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Greene later advocated for President Trump to institute martial law in order to stay in office. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall [sic] law,” she wrote on Jan. 17. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” Greene on Friday testified under oath that she could “not recall” discussing martial law. She gave similar responses about several questions pertaining to Jan. 6.

This, too, appears to contradict her testimony on Friday. “We were so confused,” she said under oath, speaking about when she was first made aware that the building had been breached. “We thought antifa was breaking in, or BLM.” Greene wrote Meadows later last Jan. 6 that “we don’t think these attackers are our people” and that she believed they were antifa members “dressed like Trump supporters,” but the texts make clear that when when the situation was first developing she believed Trump would have sway over the rioters.

We thought Antifa or BLM was breaking in pic.twitter.com/rT52pHpt9o — Acyn (@Acyn) April 22, 2022 Rolling Stone reported last October that Greene was one of several members of Congress who participated in the planning of the rally near the White House that preceded the riot. She also appears to have been involved in the larger administrative effort to overturn the election results. “Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC,” she wrote on Dec. 31. “We have to get organized for the 6th. I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.” Greene’s testimony on Friday came as part of a case brought by a group seeking to disqualify her from office for violating the 14th Amendment, which states that if someone took an oath to defend the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion,” they can’t serve in Congress.

4/26/2022,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Police in the Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria say several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the Ministry of State Security on Monday. No injuries were immediately reported. The Interior Ministry said in a Facebook post that some of the building's windows were broken and that smoke was coming from the structure. Transnistria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of separatist authorities since a 1992 war with Moldova. Russia bases about 1,500 troops there nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine. A senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transnistria. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Blasts hit ministry in Transnistria, next to Ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/blasts-hit-ministry-transnistria-next-165550190.html
4/26/2022,"(Reuters) -Russian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken. Ukraine's armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing ""offensive operations"" in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting air strikes on civilian infrastructure. Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine's 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments. ""We are taking casualties, the situation is critical... we have very many wounded men, (some) are dying, it's a difficult (situation) with guns, ammunition, food, medicines... the situation is rapidly worsening,"" Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant. Konstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognised as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet TASS on Sunday. Reuters could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian the accounts. The Azovstal steel factory is the main remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, a city that has seen sustained bombardment since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych wrote on Facebook that ""Russian troops are trying to finish off the defenders of Azovstal and more than 1,000 civilians who are hiding at the plant"". Russia has denied targetting civilians in what it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Later on Sunday, Arestovych said in a video address released by the president's office that Ukraine was offering Russia a ""special"" round of negotiations to be held in Mariupol to discuss the fate of the civilians and Ukrainian troops still trapped in the city. The negotiations would be intended to establish an immediate ceasefire in Mariupol, ""multi-day"" humanitarian corridors, and the freeing or swapping of Ukrainian fighters trapped in the Azovstal plant, Arestovych said. Russian troops surrounded the Azovstal plant in early March and have gradually taken control of most of the city. Last Thursday, Putin declared that Mariupol had been ""liberated"" and publicly told his defence minister to call off the storming of the Azovstal plant so as to save the lives of Russian soldiers. Putin said the plant should be ""blocked off"" instead.
