12/14/2021,"Pro fighter Conor McGregor said on social media he's packed on muscle after an injury in July. After six months of free weights and a strict diet, McGregor said he now weighs 190 pounds. For most people, gaining that much muscle that quickly is unrealistic. Experts say a slow, steady pace is best. UFC fighter Conor McGregor has been bulking up, according to his social media. Following a shocking mid-fight injury in July, McGregor posted he's now up to 190 pounds from his fighting weight of 156 pounds. He told Spanish outlet AS that the transformation is due to plenty of hypertrophy training, free weights, and six meals a day of carefully-measured carbs, fat, and protein. It's not the first time McGregor has dramatically shifted the scales; he previously packed on enough mass to compete in multiple weight classes in UFC. If you're not a pro fighter, though, it's more likely you'll see modest gains after six months. Even if your diet and exercise is on point, a pound or two of gains per month is more realistic, research shows. Experts say a slow and steady approach is a better bet for maximum muscle gains. Building muscle doesn't happen overnight. It takes years for athletes and fitness models to build their physiques. It is possible to see results of muscle-building efforts within a few months, according to research. A typical beginner to training might be able to gain four to seven pounds of fat-free mass (including muscle) in two to three months, according to research summarized by Strengthlog. More experienced athletes will gain muscle more slowly — two to four pounds within the same time period would be realistic, data suggests. As a result, reasonable estimates for six months might be anywhere from four to 14 pounds of muscle gain, depending on training experience, age, current body size, and genetics, as well as your workout and diet plan. To build any kind of muscle, regardless of fitness level, you also need to be sure to maintain a calorie surplus and get the right combination of nutrients. For those of us who aren't professional athletes, it's important to be realistic about your goals, since muscle-building is unlikely to be your full-time job. Unless you can hire an expert team dedicated to supporting your nutrition and fitness, you're not likely to have the ideal circumstances for gains. The good news is, you don't have to. You can see muscle gains in as few as 10 sets of exercise per body part per week, according to research. You may also have a slight advantage of being able to make major improvements to muscle and strength more quickly than experienced athletes, a phenomenon known as ""newbie gains."" Regardless, it's important to not be discouraged by a perceived lack of progress, and comparing yourself to celebrities isn't helpful. Instead, focus on maintaining good habits, and tracking small, consistent improvements to performance as well as aesthetics, experts say. ""It can take months to put on muscle but benefits in strength happen quickly,"" Noam Tamir, founder and CEO of TS Fitness in New York City, previously told Insider.

12/14/2021,"Faced with rising coronavirus cases, California is ordering a statewide mask mandate for indoor public spaces to go into effect on Wednesday. The order will affect roughly half the state's population, including San Diego and Orange counties, the Inland Empire, the Central Valley and rural Northern California. The statewide indoor mask mandate order will last a month and will expire on Jan. 15. Los Angeles County, Ventura County and most of the San Francisco Bay Area have their own indoor mask mandates that were implemented in the summer. The move comes as coronavirus case rates have risen by 50% in the last 2½ weeks, and county health officials across the state say they suspect they may be seeing the start of a winter jump in coronavirus cases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers California as having a high level of transmission of the coronavirus, the worst tier in the federal agency's four-tier scale. California is also recommending that travelers who return or visit the state get tested within three to five days of their arrival. California's announcement came on the same day New York enacted its own statewide mask requirement in indoor public spaces, excepting only settings where everyone inside must be vaccinated. Officials in Britain have also re-ordered an expansion of indoor mask mandates. The new mask orders arrive as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus — discovered only last month — has spread rapidly around the globe. Britain has recorded its first death of someone infected with Omicron variant. ""Omicron will almost certainly overtake Delta and cause new waves of infection globally,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director, tweeted. While there has been some optimism Omicron may cause less severe illness, ""this will take time to figure out,"" Frieden wrote. In addition, many states elsewhere nationally have been struggling with a winter COVID-19 surge to the still-dominant Delta variant. ""We see other states in the United States struggle with overwhelmed hospitals, and a high number of cases,"" Dr. Mark Ghaly, the California health and human services secretary, told reporters Monday. Ghaly said he's concerned that hospital capacity is still pressed and challenged, particularly in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, across the Central Valley and in the eastern Sierra and the rural north. A number of hospitals throughout the state are busier than usual for this time of year, where staff are still exhausted from battling a nearly two-year-old historic pandemic, and there's still plenty of pent-up demand for healthcare needs that were postponed during earlier parts of the pandemic. The evidence is there that masks still make a difference, Ghaly said. The coronavirus is airborne and can also spread silently from infected, asymptomatic people. ""Even a 10% increase in indoor masking can reduce case transmission significantly,"" Ghaly said. ""Wearing a mask is going to be one of the most important things to help us get through this period of uncertainty."" ""This is a critical time where we have a tool that we know has worked and can work. We are proactively putting this tool of universal indoor masking in public settings in place to ensure we get through a time of joy and hope without a darker cloud of concern and despair,"" Ghaly said. ""Californians have done this before. And we of course believe we can do it again."" Under the new order to go in effect on Wednesday, California is also tightening rules related to entering large events. Existing rules require patrons age 3 and older of indoor events of 1,000 or more people, or outdoor events of 10,000 or more people, to show proof of full vaccination or the results of a recent negative test. For patrons who chose to show a recent negative test, existing rules allow them to show a test as much as 72 hours old; the new rules require patrons to show a more recent test — within two days if it's a PCR test, whose results need to come out of a lab, or one day if it's a rapid antigen test.
