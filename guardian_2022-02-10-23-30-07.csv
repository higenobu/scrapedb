2/10/2022,"The Foreign Office has missed its self-imposed deadline to enshrine in law a tougher sanctions regime against supporters of the Russian state. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had said the legislation would be in place by 10 February. Answering an urgent question in the Commons, the Europe Minister, James Cleverly, said the regulations will be published on Thursday afternoon, and then come into force.  But his claim that the sanctions would immediately come into effect once the regulations were laid out was challenged by the Labour MP, Chris Bryant. He pointed out the new UK sanctions cannot come into force until there had been an affirmative vote by MPs. No time had been set aside for this vote and the House of Commons is now in recess until 20 February. Bryant subsequently received official confirmation that his interpretation was correct. The MP claimed the delay was due to a mix of laziness and giving up governing. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, also asked the Europe Minister to explain the delay, insisting diplomacy had to be matched by deterrence. He said it raised a risk that a Russian invasion could take place without the legislation being in place. Alyn Smith the SNP foreign affairs spokesperson said: “My worry is that Liz Truss wanted some headlines to help with her Margaret Thatcher impersonation, but she has ended up telegraphing to the bad boys that it is time to get their assets out of the UK. “It is likely these measures only come into force if there is an invasion of Ukraine, but dirty money should be treated as dirty money regardless.” The new UK sanctions regime is designed to broaden the net of individuals and entities that can be sanctioned and face asset freezes if the UK deems them to be supporting the Russian regime. At present only those deemed to be undermining the sovereignty of Ukraine can be sanctioned. The broader definition will be examined closely by Russian oligarchs resident in the UK to see how and why asset freezes could apply to them.",News/Politics,Foreign Office misses its own Russian sanctions deadline,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/foreign-office-misses-its-own-russian-sanctions-deadline
2/10/2022,"This is a short book about a big subject, with a thorny history stretching from the Spartans and Plato’s Republic, all the way to present-day science and policymaking. A glance at the index gives some idea of its scope. Ancient Greece rubs shoulders with Avengers: Infinity War and the “Do Not Resuscitate” notices of the Covid-19 pandemic with the doctors’ trial at Nuremberg.  It takes patience to trace the complicated web linking these ideas, and Rutherford does so with much-needed nuance and an absence of alarmism. “For just over a century, we have referred to the deliberate crafting of society specifically by biological design with a word which was for half of its existence regarded as desirable, and for the other half, poisonous,” he writes. As a geneticist and author of books such as How to Argue with a Racist, Rutherfordaims to distil a rounded, scientific analysis from the deeply tainted and overheated subject of eugenics. He begins with a potentially controversial admission: “All science is political.” His own undergraduate study took place at the Galton Laboratory at University College London, an institution with a unique perspective on how scientific endeavour can be sullied by political ideology. Francis Galton was the father of modern eugenics. He gave a name – from the Greek, roughly meaning “well born” – toa discipline that aimed to improve humanity at the population level. It was an intention shared by many, butGalton’s name was formally removed from UCL premises in 2020 because of the role he’d played. “Galton’s racism was deep, consistent and robust, even for his era,” Rutherford writes. “It was explicitly White supremacist.” Like so many before and after him, Galton’s idea of improving humanity meant removing people who were different from him. And, after just a few decades, “the pathway of eugenics led directly to the gates of Auschwitz”. It’s worth remembering how many great men and women of history held such views. Charles Darwin resented the propagation of “the weak”. Marie Stopes once advocated sterilisation of the “hopelessly rotten and racially diseased”. DH Lawrence daydreamed about leading “the sick, the halt and the maimed” into a “lethal chamber”. There’s a page on Winston Churchill’s publicly stated views, and they are eye-watering. It shouldn’t need saying, but does, against a babble of “cancel culture” and “erasing history”, that historical “heroes” are complicated. It might also help to explain why some communities are slow to trust science. So, what about the “troubling present” of the subtitle? Rutherford offers an excellent brief explanation of the young science of genetics, from the gene editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 and embryo selection to IQ, heritability and complex polygenic traits. He is interested in the potential for gene therapy to eradicate specific diseases with roots in a single gene, such as cystic fibrosis, but deeply cynical about the idea that “screening” for intelligence will ever be possible, or desirable, and passionate about the waste of resources involved in pursuing it “when we already know how to improve the intelligence of populations with better education, healthcare and access to physical exercise”. Given that, it’sfrustrating that he tiptoes around some of the more difficult questions involved in genetic medicine. For example: “Every potential mother now has a choice to decide if a life is worth living,” he writes. “It’s an irreducibly difficult and human one, and although science can furnish us with a context, it doesn’t provide a means for making a decision about the value of something as rich as a human life.” If all science is political, should scientists be forced to consider the potential consequences of their work? If we agree to eradicate conditions caused by genetic differences, what happens when somebody powerful decides to get rid of autism? Or deafness? Will today’s genetics pioneers be tomorrow’s heroes or villains? Control is persuasive, sensible and ultimately reassuring, but it is not complacent. We shouldn’t worry about a genetically modified master race, it seems to say, but we must pay attention to the 19th-century-style eugenics happening in our times: from sex-selective abortion in countries such as India and China to reports of the involuntary sterilisation of women in US immigration detention centres. To know history is “to inoculate ourselves against its being repeated”, Rutherford argues. From that perspective, this book is a shot worth having.

2/10/2022,"How long ago the Abortion Act of 1967 seems now, and yet the struggle for a woman’s right to control her own body never ends. Time and again this basic principle comes under attack from rightwing and religious lobbies forever seeking to limit and reverse it. Now they are at it yet again. As the prime minister dashes to roll back all coronavirus legislation a month early to mollify his rebels, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, and his junior minister, Maggie Throup, will decide whether to maintain the abortion laws that were introduced as part of emergency Covid laws, allowing women to request earlier and easier terminations at home. If Javid and Throup instead return to the old abortion laws that were in place before Covid, where women had to have an in-person clinic visit in order to get an abortion, thousands of women will have to chase scarce clinical appointments, forcing many to wait beyond the time limit for medical abortions.  Amid the horror of Covid, some good has come out of the experience of coping with the pandemic. The NHS found imaginative ways to reach more patients despite its desperately overstretched resources. One of the great successes was ensuring that women locked down at home had easy access to abortion. Part of the 2020 Coronavirus Act suspended the old 1967 abortion rules and allowed women within their first 10 weeks of pregnancy to telephone a clinician to request the two pills for a medical abortion to take at home. Women using this service were asked if they were sure of their dates, certain of their decision and had no other medical problems. To obey the law, the usual two signatures from doctors were later added to the form. The pills were sent to most women by post, but women seeking an abortion could still opt to visit a clinic to talk to someone in person. Professor Lesley Regan, former head of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and chair of its abortion taskforce, says the at-home system has been “hugely successful, with shorter waiting times, when every week of pregnancy brings a greater risk.” She talks of how it helps deprived women at home with little access to transport, those living in isolated rural areas and those without childcare. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) says telemedicine helps women on zero-hours contracts who risk losing work if forced to visit a clinic. Home abortion also protects “women threatened with domestic violence who fear attending treatment will alert their abuser to their pregnancy”. Around 100,000 women a year in England and Wales are now using this quicker route to an early abortion. If the law reverts in just two weeks time, Prof Regan, BPAS and all the abortion providers are horrified that thousands will suddenly need non-existent clinic appointments. “We couldn’t do it. It’s impossible,” Regan says. The main abortion providers, writing to warn the health minister, say the delays caused will mean “a significant increase in the numbers of women needing surgical procedures at later gestations”, with an impossible strain on NHS theatre capacity. These concerns are backed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives, the BMA and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare. They warn it will cost millions to reopen clinics pointlessly – and there are no extra staff available. Telemedicine has exposed the absurdity of the 1967 rule that requires two doctors to sign a form. BPAS says, “We have doctors, who are in short supply, sitting in rooms all day just signing forms for women they haven’t seen, instead of treating patients in need.” If waiting times for abortion rise, Nice, the NHS value-for-money arbiter, finds every day of delay in providing abortions costs another £1.6m. But the impact on women matters most. Abortions rose slightly during 2020, the first year of the pandemic, most among those suffering financially, according to official figures. Most women seeking abortions already have children: teen pregnancies have been falling this century. Women who lost income in the pandemic often seek an abortion because of a lack of money. The BPAS says many are avoiding this government’s draconian two-child benefit limit from harming their existing family. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries are among the anti-abortion MPs who eagerly voted for those anti-natalist benefit cuts that ironically pushed more women into choosing abortions. Sad research across the developed western world shows growing numbers of women having fewer children than they hoped to have: those countries with the best maternity leave and easiest childcare have the smallest gap between the number of children born and the number women wanted. This country, with among the highest childcare costs in the world and among the lowest benefits, doesn’t welcome babies. Neither Javid nor Throup have ever voted in favour of abortion rights, the BPAS notes. Javid voted against an amendment brought by Stella Creasy on the lack of progress on abortion rights in Northern Ireland, in favour of an anti-abortion amendment that would have criminalised women seeking abortions on the grounds of foetal sex, and in favour of Dorries’ amendment to stop abortion providers providing counselling to women. Meanwhile, Throup has voted against regulations introducing abortion to Northern Ireland.Women deserve better. Now Javid has just two weeks to decide whether to put extra pressure on the NHS by returning to the bad old abortion law, or free women to go on choosing earlier and easier terminations at home. A public consultation on the matter closed in the summer, but its findings remain secret. Ask the Department of Health and all they say, even at this 11th hour, is “We will keep the future of these provisions under review”. What of the vanished consultation? “It will be published in due course.” The fear is that abortion will become yet another victim of the prime minister’s culture war. The idea of a government headed by a philanderer presiding over abortion rights is beyond obscene.

2/10/2022,"Africa is transitioning out of the pandemic phase of its Covid-19 outbreak and moving towards a situation where it will be managing the virus long term, the World Health Organization’s regional head for Africa has said. “The pandemic is moving into a different phase,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti said. “We think that we’re moving now, especially with the vaccination expected to increase, into what might become a kind of endemic living with the virus.”  Moeti also said the number of Covid infections in Africa could be seven times higher than official data suggests, and deaths from the virus two to three times higher. “We’re very much aware that our surveillance systems problems that we had on the continent, with access to testing supplies, for example, have led to an underestimation of the cases,” Moeti told a briefing. Moeti’s comments confirm what has increasingly been suspected by a number of researchers who have been working to understand the so-called “Africa paradox” - why official reporting from African countries had failed to capture the same distribution of infections and deaths as elsewhere in the world. Some have suggested that the much younger age profile across countries on the continent may have contributed, but a consensus is coalescing around significant undercounting in countries with weak health surveillance systems that have failed to pick up both infections and deaths over the past two years. According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,recorded infections across Africa stood at more than 11 million as of 10 February and deaths at 250,000. If the WHO’s estimates are correct the real figures could be nearer 70 million and 750,000 respectively. Concern about undercounting have been driven by a number of studies and serological surveys – not least in South Africa, which has one of the continent’s most sophisticated disease surveillance – that suggest higher rates of infection than previously thought. African is the latest region that the WHO has suggested may be transitioning out of the pandemic phase and moving towards a more stable situation. The WHO’s European regional director, Hans Kluge, said last week that the continent could soon enter a “long period of tranquillity” that amounted to a “ceasefire” in the pandemic thanks to the less severe Omicron variant, high levels of immunity and the arrival of warmer spring weather. His upbeat assessment said the 53-country region, which includes the UK, was in a position of higher protection that could “bring us enduring peace”, even if a new, more virulent variant than Omicron should emerge. He said Europe had recorded 12 million new cases in a week. the highest single weekly total of the pandemic, with about 22% of all tests returning a positive result.",News/World news,"Africa transitioning out of pandemic phase of Covid, WHO says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/africa-transitioning-out-of-pandemic-phase-of-covid-who-says
2/10/2022,"Boris Johnson “broke lockdown laws” and has made the government “look distinctly shifty”, Sir John Major has said in a scathing attack on the prime minister’s character. In a wide-ranging speech in London, the former Conservative prime minister also condemned Johnson for eroding public trust in British democracy, showing contempt for ministerial standards, damaging the UK’s international reputation, and attempted assaults on civil rights. Below are Major’s main charges against the prime minister and his government.  “Brazen excuses were dreamed up. Day after day the public was asked to believe the unbelievable. Ministers were sent out to defend the indefensible, making themselves look gullible or foolish. “Collectively this has made the government look distinctly shifty, which has consequences that go far beyond political popularity. No government can function properly if its every word is treated with suspicion. “The charge that there is one law for the government, and one for everyone else is politically deadly – and it has struck home.” “He chose to ignore critical reports on his ministers; rejected advice from his independent adviser on ministerial standards – who resigned; and attempted – but failed – to overturn a unanimous standards select committee report that condemned the behaviour of a parliamentary colleague and friend. “It may be possible to find excuses for each of these lapses – and others – but all of them, taken together, tell a different tale.” “Trust in politics is at a low ebb, eroded by foolish behaviour, leaving a sense of unease about how our politics is being conducted. Too often, ministers have been evasive, and the truth has been optional.” “If trust in our word is lost overseas, we may no longer be able to work effectively with friends and partners for mutual benefit – or even security. Unfortunately, that trust is being lost, and our reputation overseas has fallen because of our conduct.” “Although they may be uncomfortable for any government (…) protest marches are a safety valve for free speech. Democracy should treat them with care. Such a denial of civil rights is wrong in principle, and in practice.”“ “Can it really be a crime to be frightened, homeless, desperate, destitute, fleeing from persecution, or war, or famine, or hardship; and to cross half the world on foot and dangerous waters in an unsafe boat, in the hope of finding a better life? (…) Surely, to seek sanctuary from an unbearable life cannot – morally – be treated as a crime? “When a leading tabloid labelled judges “enemies of the people” the justice secretary did not leap to their defence. Other cabinet ministers publicly disparaged “lefty lawyers”, “activist lawyers”, and attacked judges for “exceeding their authority”. “Public denunciation of judges and lawyers gives credence to the belief that the government wishes to usher in a compliant judiciary.

2/10/2022,"Inflation in the US climbed to its highest level in 40 years in January, with prices rising by 7.5% from a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday. The rise in the consumer price index (CPI) survey – which measures the costs of a wide variety of goods – was the largest since February 1982. CPI rose 0.6% from December, higher than expected.  Inflation in America has been driven higher by soaring demand and a lack of supply caused by Covid-19’s global impact on trade. Price rises for food, electricity, and shelter were the largest contributors to the increase. The food index rose 0.9% in January following a 0.5% increase in December. The energy index also increased 0.9% over the month. Rising prices have battered Joe Biden’s approval ratings even as the jobs market has roared back from its pandemic slump. The US economy grew at 5.5% last year, the strongest growth rate since 1984, and more than 1.6m new jobs have been added in the last three months. But with gas prices, food and housing prices still rising, just 37% of Americans approve of how he is handling the economy, according to a poll conducted by Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. On Wednesday ahead of the latest CPI release, the White House warned the latest consumer prices snapshot could be high. “We expect a high yearly inflation reading in tomorrow’s data,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. “Above 7%, as I think some are predicting, would not be a surprise.” “What we’re looking at is recent trends … the inflationary increases are decreasing month to month,” Psaki said.",News/Business,US inflation hits highest level in 40 years in January as prices rise 7.5% from 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/us-inflation-reached-highest-level-40-years-january
2/10/2022,"After decades lurking in the shadows, inflation is back. On Amazon, you can find fridge magnets printed with words spoken 40 years ago by Ronald Reagan, before the election that swept him into the White House. “Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man.”  Price spirals remain a real fear for many Americans, particularly those who lived through the double-digit inflation suffered under Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter. What was a painful but distant memory is now a new reality. And it is global. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Thursday that the consumer price index rose year on year by 7.5% in January, a level not seen since the 1980s. Britain is not far behind, with prices rising by 5.4% at the end of last year. In the eurozone – the 19 countries using the euro – it hit 5.1% in January, the highest level since records began in 1997. Here, the Guardian’s foreign correspondents report on how inflation is denting living standards around the world. For years New Yorkers looking for a cheap eat have been able to rely on a $1 slice of pizza. Not for long. As inflation soars even the cheap slice is under pressure and many of the city’s famous pizza shops are imposing price hikes to combat rising costs for everything from tomato sauce and pepperoni to labour and cardboard pizza boxes. US inflation hit its fastest pace since 1982 in January, pushing prices up at a 7.5% annual rate, the third straight month in which inflation exceeded an annualised rate of 6%. Supply chain issues coupled with rising demand continue to inflate the price of fuel, rent, food, and other essentials. The average price of a used car in the US was $28,205 (£20,782) at the end of December, according to Cox Automotive, the first time the median price of a second-hand vehicle has surpassed $28,000. Price rises have hit everyone but inflation hits poorer Americans hardest. The lowest-earning fifth of Americans already spend 83% of their income on housing, according to the labor department’s Consumer Expenditure Survey, and can ill-afford increases in rents, let alone fuel, food, and other essentials. The Federal Reserve is now preparing to raise interest rates in the hope of taming soaring prices. But with inflation surging worldwide it remains to be seen how soon, or whether, the central bank will succeed.Dominic Rushe in New York Italians have been feeling the knock-on effects of inflation mostly in their utilities bills, with gas and electricity costs rising by more than 50% this winter. In turn, the high energy costs have made it more expensive to run factories and transport goods, hence price rises have also been felt in other areas, such as food and manufactured goods. Preliminary data from Istat, Italy’s statistics agency, earlier this month showed inflation rose by 3.9% during 2021, hitting 4.2% in December – the highest rise in over a decade. The Bank of Italy predicts inflation at 2.8% this year, although businesses are forecasting higher price rises at 3.2%. Italy has not produced nuclear energy for more than three decades and is extremely dependent on energy imports. “We are highly dependent on imported energy, hence why from this point of view Italy is more vulnerable than other countries,” said Marcello Messori, an economics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “In the short term, there will be a great impact on utilities’ bills,” he added, while forecasting that Europe’s green and digital transition plan could impact prices further down the line. “I am in favour of the two transitions but in Europe we are under-assessing the possible medium-term impact.”Angela Giuffrida in Rome Inflation in Germany is currently around 5.3% – only the second time it has exceeded 5% since reunification in 1990 – and is expected to continue to rise at least until the middle of the year. The Bundesbank referred to a ‘consistent extremely high price pressure’ in its January monthly report. There are multiple reasons behind the inflation rate, including supply chain issues, price rises to reflect losses linked to the pandemic, high demand for specific goods and services coupled with a labour shortage, as well as a rise in the VAT rate, after it was temporarily reduced to help businesses last year. The most shocking hikes are for heating, petrol, diesel, electricity, and oil – which according to the consumer price index have increased on average by 18.3%, butin some cases by as much as 50%. On the grocery bill, consumers are paying around 6% more, but with big differences between goods. Potatoes are the big surprise, having risen by around 43% year on year, mainly due to bad weather conditions. Other food stuffs such as tomatoes, salad, milk, salad, onions and eggs have recorded considerable price rises of between 5% and 20%. In general, imports to Germany have increased in price by around 21% – the steepest rise since 1980 – mainly due to supply chain issues linked to the pandemic. While wages are expected to rise too, with trade unions insisting on appropriate increases , lower-income families are being hardest hit. Despite a 20% rise in the minimum wage, many are not expected to feel enough of a lift to be able to make up for the higher cost of living.Kate Connolly in Berlin For a commodity-based economy, Australia faces more of an uphill battle to keep a lid on prices than most. Consumer inflation accelerated at the end of 2021 to 3.5%, while the underlying rate watched by the central bank – Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) – rose to its highest level since mid-2014 at 2.6%. Record high fuel prices were one factor. The RBA’s monk-like forbearance to resist lifting the official cash rate from its record low 0.1% until wages start to rise at least 3% annually will be under the spotlight with financial markets already pricing in the first hike in rates by June. By next February, the rate could be as high as 1.25%, futures indicate. A rate-rise delay until June, though, would at least avoid embarrassing the federal government, which must hold a national election on or before 21 May. Private economists are less hawkish but doubt the RBA can hold off beyond August. One issue to watch is whether the jobless rate dips below 4% which would be the lowest since 1974 although there are many reasons why wages growth may remain restrained including the relatively weak bargaining position of labour. Peter Hannam in Sydney The global wave of inflation has brought Pakistan to its knees. The rate soared to 13% in January, just as the national currency, the rupee, is rapidly devaluing. Food prices have skyrocketed by 17%, leaving lower- and middle-income families, who already spent half their income on food, struggling to cope. The country has recorded a recent 5% rise in the price of potatoes, a 4.5% rise in the price of chicken and a 2.5% rise in the cost of bananas. The price of cooking oil has risen by 27% in the past three years and sugar now costs more than fuel. In January, for the first time in Pakistan’s history, petrol hit 150 rupees a litre (63 pence), a hike of around 40%. Local policy decisions have aggravated global pressures. The government has agreed cost-cutting measures with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to secure a $6bn bailout, which includes levies on petrol and higher energy tariffs and higher taxes. The cost of electricity in Pakistan is already double that of its neighbours India and Bangladesh. Amid mass discontent and anger at the now unaffordable cost of living, Prime Minister Imran Khan recently said that the impact of inflation “kept me up at night” but insisted it was a “global phenomenon”. An anti-inflation protest march is now being planned by the political opposition.
