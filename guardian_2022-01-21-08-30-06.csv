1/21/2022,"The Doomsday Clock, established 75 years ago by scientists to illustrate the danger of human extinction, remains at 100 seconds to midnight according to a panel of experts. It is the third year in a row that the clock has been set at that time, which is closer to midnight than at any period during the cold war, including the Cuban missile crisis.  The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which curates the annual unveiling of the clock’s hands, said the decision to leave them unchanged reflects that a few positive developments over the course of the past year have been counterbalanced by continued drift towards the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the climate emergency, and the rise of biological threats. “The Doomsday Clock is holding steady at 100 seconds to midnight. But steady is not good news,” said Sharon Squassoni, a George Washington University professor and the co-chair of the Bulletin’s science and security board, which decides the clock’s hand movements each year. “In fact, it reflects the judgment of the board that we are stuck in a perilous moment, one that brings neither stability nor security.” Among the positive developments noted by the board was the decision last year to extend the New Start arms control agreement between Russia and the US, the restart of talks over the Iran nuclear programme, and the coming to office in the US of an administration that believes in climate science and has pledged to act to mitigate global emissions. Set against those trends, the board pointed to the continued investment by major powers in their nuclear arsenals, the absence of progress in the Iran nuclear discussions, and the weakness of global actions to address the climate emergency. “The Doomsday Clock is not set by good intentions, but rather by evidence of action, or in this case inaction,” Scott Sagan, a political science professor at Stanford University, said. The board also drew attention to biological threats in the light of the global vulnerability highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The fact that we have active biological weapons programs in Russia and North Korea, with China and Iran close behind, should give us pause,” said Asha M George, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense. “We stand on the precipice of a biological cataclysm. It will take very little more from this arena to push us right over the edge.”",News/World news,‘Stuck in perilous moment’: Doomsday Clock holds at 100 seconds to midnight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/doomsday-clock-holds-at-100-seconds-to-midnight
1/21/2022,"At the end of the 19th century, when our hopeless romantic lead walks through Montmartre for the first time, all he can see is “dazzling chaos”. That’s what this raucous new production of Moulin Rouge! exudes in spades. It’s never going to be easy, staging Baz Luhrmann’s iconic musical movie starring consumption-ridden Nicole Kidman and lovelorn Ewan McGregor. But with a half-tonne sculpture of an elephant leering over the audience, a hefty cast and money to burn, this production gives it a good go. There is a lot to love: with a wonderfully wild energy throughout, it’s happily queerer than the film, and the well-known songs really are spectacular.  The show’s downfall comes with its attempts to bring the music up to date. The 2002 musical is famous for its jukebox choices, blending genres, styles and cultures. For the stage, the creators have added in a chaotic new playlist of flatly popular songs, from Rick Astley to Lorde. The additions work in a select few cases, most memorably in Elephant Love Medley. The two leads, Satine and Christian, have decided to be secret lovers, and they use the love song mash-up to tease each other. Their joy is tangible as they leap above Parisian rooftops, the backdrop beaming with stars. But almost every other choice is incongruous to the point where we might as well have gone to karaoke instead. Diamonds Are Forever is mixed with Single Ladies, Seven Nation Army with Toxic. A poignant moment of self-doubt feels farcical as Satine bursts into Katy Perry’s Firework, jolting us sharply out of the story and doing little to drag us back in. This dramaturgy is reminiscent of pantomimes adding in a recent popular song to get the kids on side. Except here, it’s the drunken hen-dos they’re trying to curry favour with. First performed in Boston in 2018, this production transferred to Broadway, where it won 10 Tony awards. Directed by Alex Timbers, much about the show is sensational. Thick, luscious layers of fabric are draped around the theatre, and the auditorium is bathed in a sexy red light. There are pyrotechnics, glitter cannons, and ebullient ensemble dances. Derek McLane’s design is jaw-dropping, with the carefully carved rooftops of Montmartre giving way to an ancient, dusty artist’s room, a twinkle of the Moulin Rouge spied through gaping windows. These sets barely need actors. They come alive all on their own. The cast do a wonderful job at animating the frenetic cabaret. Liisi LaFontaine is dazzling as Satine, with Jamie Bogyo charmingly awkward as Christian. Both have stunning voices; that’s true of everyone on the stage. But it’s Jason Pennycooke who gives a standout performance. As the revolutionary artist Toulouse-Lautrec, every move he makes is filled with emotion. It is a shame that when Lautrec confesses his love for Satine, the script inserts a line suggesting she’d never be interested in him because of his disabilities. Similarly, the show strikes a sour note with its portrayal of Satine’s life as a sex worker. In an otherwise confident character, they inject her with shame and self-disdain for her work, where her movie portrayal is filled with self-assurance. For an establishment that exudes sexual freedom, this seems strangely uptight. At the Piccadilly theatre, London, until 28 May.",Arts/Stage,Moulin Rouge!

1/21/2022,"Elza Soares, one of the greatest Brazilian singers of all time, has died at her beachside home in Rio after a legendary, genre-straddling six-decade career which made her a national treasure and a global star. “The beloved and eternal Elza has gone to rest but she will forever remain in musical history and in our hearts and those of thousands of fans all around the world. Just as Elza Soares had wanted, she sung until the end,” her family and team announced in a statement on Thursday afternoon.  There was an immediate outpouring of tributes to the 91-year-old samba singer, who died of natural causes and had been preparing to release a new album and perform a series of shows. “Thank you, the greatest of Goddesses,” the actor Lázaro Ramos wrote on Instagram of the woman most Brazilians call simply “Elza”. “The voice of the millenium,” tweeted the rapper Mano Brown in reference to the honour once bestowed upon her by the BBC. The mandolin player Hamilton de Holanda hailed “Brazil’s great warrior woman” while the singer Maria Rita celebrated “this incredible woman of Light”. “She is fucking amazing,” the actor Taís Araujo tweeted. “She always was and she always will be!” Rio’s samba-loving mayor, Eduardo Paes, declared three days of mourning, tweeting: “Elza lives!” Along the coast in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, the black activist and writer Preto Zezé said the heavens had opened, “as if God was weeping over Elza’s departure”. Born in Moça Bonita, a favela on Rio’s impoverished westside in 1930, Soares endured a childhood of profound deprivation and tragedy. She had her first child at the age of 13 and lost her second to hunger when she was just 15. Nevertheless, she rose to become one of Brazil’s most successful and beloved artists, recording more than 30 albums after launching her singing career in the late 1950s at the height of the bossa nova movement. Elza’s vast fan base reputedly included Buckingham Palace, with the singer performing for Queen Elizabeth II during a 1968 visit to Brazil. “She liked the samba, you know!” Elza later recalled. “She even broke protocol by tapping along to the rhythm with her feet. My God, isn’t life mad.” On Thursday the British embassy in Brazil remembered the encounter: “It was a meeting of Queens! Rest in peace, Elza.” The guitarist Zé Paulo Becker, who recorded and toured with the late singer, said: “Playing with her was incredible … The power she had up on stage was just amazing.” “She might have been tired – but when she stepped out on stage she would become this volcano,” Becker added. “She was a true artist … and she will leave an immense hole.” As well as a musical icon, the black singer was a powerful voice for social and racial justice and change. “Brazil is the most racist country we’ve got,” she said in an interview on the eve of her 90th birthday. “Things here are awful, it’s an illness with no cure, an absurd situation, disgusting. It’s my race that I’m watching be destroyed and we have to speak out and say enough’s enough.” On Thursday Brazil’s former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the country had lost not only one of its most potent voices “but also a great woman, who always defended democracy and good causes”. Outspoken and spectacularly elegant until the very end, Elza sent what was to be her last tweet on Wednesday lunchtime, 24 hours before her death. “My name is now, meu amor,” it said.",News/World news,"Elza Soares, one of Brazil’s greatest ever singers, dies at 91",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/elza-soares-one-of-brazils-greatest-ever-singers-dies-at-91
1/21/2022,"Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, has warned Russia that any invasion of Ukraine would only lead to “a terrible quagmire and loss of life” on the scale of the Soviet-Afghan war. Speaking at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, Truss framed the Ukraine conflict as part of a wider dispute between what she saw as liberal states and autocracies, including Russia and China.  She urged Vladimir Putin to “desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake”. The Kremlin, she said, “has not learned the lessons of history” and an “invasion will only lead to a terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya.” Truss added: “We need everyone to step up. Together with our allies, we will continue to stand with Ukraine and urge Russia to de-escalate and engage in meaningful discussions. What happens in eastern Europe matters for the world.” Truss claimed autocracies were “emboldened in a way we haven’t seen since the cold war. They seek to export dictatorship as a service around the world. That is why regimes like Belarus, North Korea and Myanmar find their closest allies in Moscow and Beijing.” Truss, along with the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is in Australia to discuss the next stage of the Aukus partnership, including plans for Australia to be given access to US nuclear-powered submarine technology. Aukus, which brings together Australia, the US and the UK, is designed to be a wider defence partnership, but its launch in September offended the French by cancelling its longstanding contract to build diesel-powered submarines. This week David Hannay, the former UK ambassador to the UN, described the launch of Aukus and the offence taken in Paris as “a travesty of diplomacy”. He added: “In future years I suspect this episode will be taught at diplomatic academies across the world as how quite unnecessarily to lose both friends and influence.” The September agreement has left so much unspecified that there are doubts Australia will ever access the submarine technology. The deal did not set out whether the UK or the US would provide nuclear technology for the submarines, how much they would cost, when they would be completed or what proportion of the submarines would be built in Australia as opposed to the US or the UK. On her visit, Truss has also found herself mired in a controversy over a proposed UK increase in alcohol taxes that Australian winemakers say will wipe out the benefit of the recent UK-Australian free trade deal. Truss said: “UK tax is a matter for the UK and it is non-discriminatory. It is based on decisions that we have to make about our own system.”",News/Politics,UK’s Liz Truss warns Russia of ‘terrible quagmire’ if it invades Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/uks-truss-warns-russia-of-terrible-quagmire-if-it-invades-ukraine
