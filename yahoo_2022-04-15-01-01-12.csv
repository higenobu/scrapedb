4/15/2022,"The first quarter of 2022 has been difficult for retirement savers and retirees alike, and according to investment firm Charles Schwab, it was one of the worst quarters for fixed-income in decades. However, the rising yields and changed Federal Reserve policy have created a prime buying opportunity, says the investment giant. After nearly three years of near-zero interest on fixed income, retirement savers can finally earn attractive returns. But don't go and buy just any bonds: look specifically for intermediate- to long-term bonds. Here's why. A financial advisor could help you plan for retirement and help you select low-risk investments that align with your financial goals. Speak to a qualified advisor today. Fed Tightening Creates Buying Opportunity The beginning of 2022 saw a marked increase in bond yields, a steep sell-off and a change in Federal Reserve policy all in the span of a couple months. Previously Charles Schwab had recommended that fixed income investors stick to short-term assets to cut exposure risk, but with the most recent quarter's dreadful performance, change seems to be in the air. Schwab analysts say it may seem counterintuitive to buy bonds just as the Federal Reserve embarks on a series of interest rate hikes–which are inversely related to bond prices–but the market has actually already discounted much of the expected drops in price. Why Will Bonds Recover Now? There are a couple indications that Schwab analysts say point to a buying opportunity. The bond yield curve jumped and has maintained a high level, which means that the market is already discounting a fast pace of Fed rate hikes. Even though the Fed has only raised interest rates once thus far, the yield curve signals a lot of future rate hikes being priced in–so many, in fact, that the number of hikes would have to extend into 2024 to make sense. Another indicator is the real level of inflation affecting the economy. Due to rising commodity prices, Schwab analysts expect inflation to remain high through the end of the year, when levels should ease again in response to changed Federal Reserve policy. The economy already appears to be cooling, as rising interest rates moderate housing demand and capital goods expenditures. As a result, retirement savers shouldn't worry too much about inflation affecting their fixed income investments in the medium term. Charles Schwab analysts said that ""inflation expectations appear reasonably contained. The markets are discounting high inflation in the near term, but…an aggressive tightening cycle [by the Fed] will pull it lower in the longer term."" Although short-term inflation expectations are at the highest level since 1981, long-term inflation is expected to remain near 3%, a long-term average dating back to the 1990s. How Retirement Savers Can Take Advantage Given the market's reaction to rising interest rates and expected inflation levels over the upcoming year, Charles Schwab asserts that the intermediate to long-term bond outlook is positive. Signs from the yield curve indicate that a peak in yields may be getting closer, which supports the recommendation to buy longer-term bonds. The company acknowledges that there may remain some pricing risk if high levels of inflation continue, but the likelihood appears small given the Fed's willingness to tighten monetary policy. Investors can buy intermediate- and long-term bonds through bond funds, which typically offer higher yields for longer bond terms. The higher yields also carry greater interest rate risk, however, stemming from interest rate movements and inflation levels. Which assets are most appropriate for you depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Bottom Line Investment firm Charles Schwab has found that now may be a good time to add longer-term bonds to your fixed income portfolio. A combination of rising bond yields and planned interest rate hikes points to a relatively-advantageous entry point for intermediate- and long-term bond investing, which can help investors boost their retirement savings and income over time.

4/15/2022,"(Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow would work to redirect its energy exports eastward as Europe tries to reduce its reliance on them, adding that European nations would not be able to ditch Russian gas immediately. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's natural gas, and western sanctions over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine have hit its energy exports by complicating the financing and logistics of existing deals. While the EU debates whether to slap sanctions on Russian gas and oil and member states seek supplies from elsewhere, the Kremlin has been forging closer ties with China, the world's top energy consumer, and other Asian countries. ""The so-called partners from unfriendly countries concede themselves that they won't be able to make do without Russian energy resources, including without natural gas, for example,"" Putin told a televised government meeting. ""There is no rational replacement (for Russian gas) in Europe now."" Putin also said that Europe, by talking about cutting off energy supplies from Russia, was driving up prices and destabilising the market. He said Russia, which accounts for around a tenth of global oil production and around a fifth of gas, would need new infrastructure to boost energy supplies to Asia. He ordered the government to present a plan by June 1 including on ""expanding transport infrastructure to countries of Africa, Latin America (and the) Asia Pacific."" He also sought clarity on the possibility of including two pipelines - China-bound Power of Siberia and the far-eastern Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok in Russian unified system of gas supplies. Plugging those routes into the wider network may allow Russia, in theory, to switch gas flows from Europe to Asia and visa versa. Russia launched pipeline gas supplies to China in the end of 2019 and in February agreed a 30-year contract via a new pipeline, yet to be built, with plans to settle sales in euros. Putin also said that the role of national currencies in exporting deals should rise, amid Russia's plans to switch to roubles in payments for its gas supplies, mainly to Europe. Russia has seen a steep decline in production of oil, its key source of revenues, amid difficulties with payments for trading and vessels. Major global trading houses are planning to reduce crude and fuel purchases from Russia's state-controlled oil companies as early as May 15, sources said, to avoid falling foul of EU sanctions on Russia. Putin said the sector's most acute problems were related to the disruption of energy supply logistics.
