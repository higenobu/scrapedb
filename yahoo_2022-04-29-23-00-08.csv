4/29/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden has failed to integrate the vast numbers of immigrants it has taken in over the past two decades, leading to parallel societies and gang violence, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Thursday, as she launched a series of initiatives to combat organised crime. Many Swedes were shocked earlier this month after violent riots left more than 100 police injured. The violence erupted after a Swedish-Danish politician burned the Quran at a rally and sought to hold more in several immigrant-dominated neighborhoods. Andersson blamed criminals and said both Islamism and right-wing extremism had been allowed to fester in Sweden, in unusually frank and self-critical comments. ""Segregation has been allowed to go so far that we have parallel societies in Sweden. We live in the same country but in completely different realities,"" Andersson told a news conference. The number of people in Sweden born abroad has doubled in the last two decades to 2 million, or a fifth of the population. Andersson's Social Democrats have been in power for 28 of the last 40 years, including the last eight. Andersson said she wanted to introduce local youth crime boards where social services and police could collaborate. She also proposed tools to make sure that youths stayed in schools and off the streets without the consent of parents. ""Integration has been too poor at the same time as we have had a large immigration. Society has been too weak, resources for the police and social services have been too weak,"" she said. Sweden, which holds a general election later this year, has radically tightened its immigration policies since taking in more people per capita than any other European Union country during the migration crisis in 2015. It now has one of the bloc's most restrictive policies. Human rights organisation Amnesty International has been critical of Sweden's tightening of policies, claiming it is causing human suffering and making integration even harder for immigrants.

4/29/2022,"By Greg Torode, Martin Quin Pollard and Yew Lun Tian HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - From countering a Western ""information war"" during a Taiwan conflict to using ""shock and awe"" to swiftly subdue the island's forces, Chinese strategists are soaking up lessons from Russia's Ukrainian quagmire, diplomats, scholars and analysts say. Chinese military experts are discussing the conflict in private chat groups, offering their takes on Western involvement in Ukraine and Russia's perceived failings, say two scholars and four Asian and Western diplomats who are in touch with Chinese strategists. Although their conclusions have yet to surface in official military journals or state media, Russia's failure to quickly crush the Ukrainian military is a key topic - as are fears about how well China's untested forces would perform. ""Many Chinese experts are monitoring this war as if they are imagining how this would unfold if it happened between China and the West,"" said Beijing-based security scholar Zhao Tong of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Russia's approach in the early stages of the war did not subdue Ukrainian forces, which emboldened the international community to intervene with intelligence sharing, military equipment and the economic isolation of Russia. ""China probably should think about conducting a much stronger and much more comprehensive operation at the very beginning to shock and awe the Taiwanese forces to secure a major advantage,"" Zhao said, referring to observations from Chinese strategists. They believe securing that advantage would ""deter enemy forces from being willing to intervene"", he said. Singapore-based scholar Collin Koh said such an approach would create its own problems for China's People's Liberation Army. ""If you are going to 'shock and awe' Taiwan with overwhelming force in the initial stages, there might be a lot of civilian casualties,"" said Koh, of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. That would make occupation difficult and harden international opposition. ""The Chinese can't have any illusions now that they will be welcomed as liberators in Taiwan and given supplies and assistance,"" he said. Taiwan also has greater missile capabilities than Ukraine, allowing for pre-emptive strikes on a Chinese build-up or attacks on Chinese facilities after an invasion. Neither China's defence ministry nor China's Taiwan Affairs Office immediately responded to requests for comment. Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine starting on Feb. 24, reducing towns and cities to rubble amid stiff resistance, losing thousands of troops as well as tanks, helicopters and aircraft. British officials estimated this week that 15,000 Russian troops have died; other sources suggest a higher number. More than 5 million people have fled after what Russia describes as a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and Western governments say this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. INFORMATION WAR Chinese strategists also worry about how Russia is contending with indirect Western military assistance, a factor China would also face in a Taiwan scenario, say two scholars and four diplomats. Chinese experts are privately arguing about the need for Beijing to better compete in the so-called information war, which has complicated Russia's position on the battlefield, Zhao said. Besides isolating Russia economically, Western diplomatic efforts - and reporting on atrocities in the war zone - have made it easier to provide aid for Ukraine and harder for Russia to find outside support. Zhao said that to Chinese strategists, one of the most important parts of the current conflict was how Western nations ""are able to manipulate, from their perspective, international opinion and decisively change the international response to the war."" Some Chinese strategists believe that the control of information has created a much worse impression of Russian performance than is warranted. ""There are a lot of discussions about how China needs to pay great attention to this information domain,"" Zhao said. LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES Some analysts note that the Ukrainian campaign was under way long before Russian forces invaded in late February, with months of build-up on the Russian side of the border. Those efforts were easily tracked by private sector open-source intelligence firms and repeatedly highlighted by U.S. and other governments. ""Taiwan would present a far greater logistical challenge than Ukraine, and to ready an invasion force on that scale undetected would be incredibly difficult,"" said Alexander Neill, who runs a strategic consultancy in Singapore. China's military leaders also have for decades looked to Moscow for not just weapons but also structural and command doctrine. Russian and Chinese forces have staged increasingly intensive joint exercises in recent years, including large-scale combined arms operations in Russia in September 2020. Strategic assumptions from this collaboration, however, are being tested. In 2012 the PLA adopted units similar to Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTG) - supposedly swift, nimble and self-supporting units. But Russian BTGs have become bogged down in Ukraine and proven vulnerable to attack. Russia has also struggled to coordinate the involvement of several military districts in the Ukraine war. Chinese analysts worry a Chinese invasion across the Taiwan Strait - widely seen as a far greater military challenge - would face similar problems, as it requires smooth co-operation across its recently formed Southern, Eastern and Northern Theatre Commands. Russia's forces in Ukraine have had command breakdowns and low morale. Analysts say it's unclear how Chinese troops - untested since they invaded northern Vietnam in 1979 - would perform in a modern conflict. ""We've seen signs of alarming indiscipline from Russian troops, which is a reminder that there is so much we don't know about Chinese troops would perform under the pressures of war,"" Neill said. ""For all the political indoctrination, we just don't know how resilient they would be.""
