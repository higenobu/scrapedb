4/26/2022,"David Cameron and a right-leaning thinktank have warned the government to defend its flagship counter-extremism strategy from criticisms or risk enabling terrorism. In a controversial report from Policy Exchange, the former prime minister has demanded a robust defence of the Prevent strategy. The report claims that Prevent is being undermined by “Islamist campaigners and their allies” and names organisations including CAGE and the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Its release comes after Priti Patel has indicated she wishes to overhaul the strategy in the wake of the murder of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess. An ongoing independent review of Prevent by William Shawcross has been delayed, but is expected to report its findings later this year. In a foreword to the report, Cameron warns: “Just as we need to counter the Islamist extremist narrative, we need to counter the anti-Prevent narrative. We need to show that delegitimising counter-terrorism is, in essence, enabling terrorism.” The report goes on to condemn Muslim groups that have criticised Prevent. “Unopposed, activists have been feeding the national media, and targeting Muslim communities themselves, creating a grievance culture that argues they are victims of Prevent, which they claim is an ‘Islamophobic’ social engineering project.” A spokesperson for the MCB said Policy Exchange has consistently led efforts to discourage cooperation between the authorities and the Muslim Council of Britain. “It is therefore laughable that the Policy Exchange should now claim that we are the ones discouraging cooperation because we are exercising our democratic responsibility to scrutinise bad policy. “The MCB has always repeatedly and loudly opposed all forms of terrorism, but the Policy Exchange’s amnesia fails to acknowledge this,” she said. Muhammad Rabbani, managing director of CAGE, said:“The report stands as a testament to the unified resilience of Muslim organisations, against all odds, in effectively defending their communities from one of the most pernicious and insidious government policies, that is Prevent. “Despite the government having a near absolute monopoly on power and access to mainstream media and PR agencies, the report promotes a false reality of ‘unopposed activists’ critiquing Prevent in order to explain away communities’ wholesale rejection of Prevent.” There have been calls for an independent review of the strategy for years, by critics who say it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or backgrounds and inhibits legitimate expression. The Prevent strategy includes a statutory duty for schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report any concerns they have about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism. It has led to cases in which teachers have reported primary schoolchildren to the police for having toy guns or talking about video games. A coalition of more than 450 Islamic organisations, including 350 mosques and imams, boycotted the government’s review of Prevent last March in protest against the appointment of Shawcross. Shawcross, who chaired the Charity Commission between 2012 and 2018, has been criticised as a result of previous remarks he has made about Islam.",News/Politics,David Cameron says government should defend its counter-extremism strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/david-cameron-says-government-should-defend-its-counter-extremism-strategy
4/26/2022,"Unions have called for a commercial and consumer boycott of P&O Ferries, which is facing a fresh row over crew pay even as its sailings are set to resume on the Dover-Calais route. The TUC urged freight firms and holidaymakers not to book on P&O Ferries, which broke the law when it sack nearly 800 crew last month, while the RMT union said it had evidence that agency workers brought in to replace those staff were being paid less than minimum wage. “We have seen contracts of agency workers where they are being paid the equivalent of £4.35 an hour for 17 weeks work,” the RMT said. “This is less than half the current UK national minimum wage.” The affected crew were on the Spirit of Britain, one of the Dover-based ferries, which has now been passed fit to sail after originally failing an inspection. That means sailings will resume this week, potentially as early as Tuesday, for lorries, with leisure travellers expected to be able to board the ferries next week. P&O Ferries denied that they had cut pay and said it was an “administrative misunderstanding”, but the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it had investigated and upheld a complaint from the RMT. The union said a crew member had alerted them saying he was “desperate” for help after his pay was apparently reduced by £195 on a new contract. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said the individual had been “unaware of an appendix which included made clear that he would be entitled to an additional £195 a month, meaning that there was no change in his overall pay”. The spokesperson said: “There are no plans to change or reduce the wages of any of our agency seafarers and we have made clear that we will continue to comply fully with any national minimum wage obligations introduced by the UK government.” The MCA said: “The complaint made by the RMT union about seafarers’ welfare and employment contracts was fully investigated as part of the reinspection of Spirit of Britain and upheld.” The RMT’s general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Staffing ships with super-exploited agency staff is not just morally wrong, it undercuts those remaining ferry operators who do abide by union rates of pay and conditions and undermines passenger safety.” The TUC called for a public and commercial boycott of P&O Ferries and its owner DP World, the Dubai-owned group that also has lucrative government contracts to run the port of Southampton and the London Thames Gateway freeport. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “P&O and DP World must not be allowed to get away with their scandalous and unlawful treatment of staff. “Companies who behave like corporate gangsters deserve far more than a slap on the wrist. Ministers must sever all commercial ties with P&O and its owner DP World and ensure they do not receive a single penny of taxpayers’ money.” She said that the scandal showed UK employment law was “not fit for purpose” and called on the government to bring forward an employment bill to strengthen workers’ rights. The president of the Scottish TUC, Pat Rafferty, went further by saying P&O Ferries’ chief executive should be put in jail. Rafferty told the STUC conference in Aberdeen: “Peter Hebblethwaite should be struck off the directors register and put behind bars.” Hebblethwaite admitted in a Commons hearing that P&O had failed to consult staff or give proper notification of the move to the UK government or flag states, breaking employment law. The firm is now under criminal investigation by the Insolvency Service. Sailings have now resumed on most of P&O Ferries’ routes around the UK. Another vessel, the European Highlander, was passed by the MCA and returned to service on Saturday, bringing the Larne-Cairnryan route linking Northern Ireland and Scotland back to full capacity. P&O Ferries have not sailed on the major route between Britain and Europe, the Dover-Calais crossing, since it suspended services on 17 March to make 786 crew redundant.",News/Business,Unions call for P&O Ferries boycott for allegedly paying staff less than minimum wage,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/unions-call-for-po-ferries-boycott-for-allegedly-paying-below-minimum-wage
4/26/2022,"The schools watchdog Ofsted is to increase its focus on early-years education as part of its new five-year strategy, to address the devastating impact of the pandemic on some of the youngest children in England. Ofsted is concerned that children in early years are lagging behind in their communication and language skills owing to Covid disruption, while the sector is under pressure as thousands of staff have left since the first lockdown and childcare providers are down by 5,000. In its new 2022-27 strategy published on Tuesday, Ofsted says it intends to increase training for its early-years inspection workforce as part of making this sector a strategic priority. The watchdog is also promising to work with the government to try to simplify the regulatory regime for childminders. The number of registered childcare providers has dropped from 75,000 at the start of the pandemic to 70,000, with childminders accounting for most of the losses. Ofsted says it also intends to share data and insights about group-owned early-years providers to improve their regulation. The chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said: “We recognise the outstanding work early-years providers have done to help children recover what they missed, and this strategy aims to increase our support for a workforce that is so deeply devoted to what it does. “Whether it is through developing specialist training for our inspection workforce or through sharing our own insights, we will do everything in our power to help every child gain the best start in life.” Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed Ofsted’s increased focus on the sector. “That said, even with these positive intentions, it’s difficult to see how much actual change Ofsted, as an independent inspection body, will be able to bring about,” he said. “Even before the onset of Covid-19, early-years providers were grappling with a raft of challenges such as staffing shortages and immense financial pressures as a result of years of government underfunding, and there is no doubt that these challenges have been hugely exacerbated by the pandemic, with more and more settings being pushed to the brink of closure.” The 2022-27 strategy also includes plans to accelerate the inspection cycle so that all schools are inspected by July 2025, as detailed in the government’s schools white paper last month. Ofsted has promised to increase the proportion of longer inspections to allow for evidence gathering, and to work with the Department for Education to increase powers to intervene where children are being educated in illegal and unregistered schools. Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said Ofsted’s inspection system needed to be reformed. “At the moment you are far more likely to be judged below good if your school serves a disadvantaged community. This isn’t because your school is necessarily doing anything wrong but because there are some very significant challenges associated with this context, the biggest of which is attracting sufficient numbers of specialist teachers to fill vacancies in the midst of an ongoing recruitment crisis,” she said.",News/Education,Ofsted will step up early-years focus to address lockdown impact,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/26/ofsted-will-step-up-early-years-focus-to-address-lockdown-impact
4/26/2022,"Children as young as between three and six years old are becoming the latest victims in a growing trend of self-generated child sexual abuse, a report from an internet safety watchdog has said. The Internet Watch Foundation said over a one month period it saw 51 examples of self-generated abuse imagery – where children are manipulated into recording their own abuse before it is shared online – including a child aged between three and six. More than half of the cases involved a sibling or friend of the child. “Such young children being subjected to this kind of abuse is an emerging phenomenon – it is not something we have really seen before and this is the first time we have produced definitive data on it,” said Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive. “Our frontline analysts are now seeing younger and younger children being approached, groomed and coerced by predators online.” The IWF, which operates a UK hotline but also reports on instances of child sexual abuse material [CSAM] around the world, said the self-generated content is created using webcams or smartphones and then distributed on a number of platforms. It said two-thirds of the reports, which were registered between 11 October and 10 November last year, were either duplicated images or videos, or contained the same children appearing more than once. “In some cases, children are groomed, deceived or extorted into producing and sharing a sexual image or video of themselves. The images are created of children often in their bedrooms or another room in a home setting and no abuser is physically present but may be present virtually via the internet,” said the IWF. The IWF said the instances of self-generated CSAM for three to six year olds showed the young victims “performing” as if in a show. “It’s evident this is not the first time this has happened to them and they are obviously trying to ‘please’ an audience, unaware of the inappropriateness being asked of them,” said the IWF. It added: “In many of the videos, phones can be heard buzzing and the children then pause to read and carry out a different request, often not hesitating at what is being asked of them.” The IWF said several images and videos appeared to show children intently looking into the camera, presumably to read or view something and then replicate it. The findings were included in IWF’s annual report, which underline the predominance of self-generated images in CSAM cases. It said 2021 was its worst year on record for child sexual abuse online as it reported 252,000 URLs containing images or videos of children – people under the age of 18 – being sexually abused, compared with 153,000 in the previous year. Of that total, there were 182,000 instances of self-generated material, with the biggest age group within that segment being 11 to 13 year olds, where there were 148,000 reports. “As recently as six years ago, we were seeing so-called self-generated material beginning to emerge as a threat. Now it is not only a regular thing we see – it is prevalent,” said Hargreaves.",News/Society,Children between three and six ‘victims of self-generated child sexual abuse’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/children-between-three-and-six-victims-of-self-generated-child-sexual-abuse-internet-watch-foundation
4/26/2022,"At the end of the last Downton Abbey film, the poor Dowager Countess of Grantham had graciously acknowledged a serious unnamed malady, and there was a solemn overhead crane shot of the stately home against a cosmic starlit sky before the closing credits. It seemed to all of us that this franchise was surely finished. But oh no. Downton is back. Screenwriter Julian Fellowes’s creation has lurched defiantly up from its deathbed for another Charleston around the sick-room and I have to admit – like someone with an empty tube of Pringles in their hand that was full 10 minutes ago – that I did find this film entertaining; more outrageously silly and hammy and artlessly snobby than ever, with some Acorn Antiques-style revelations of paternity shenanigans and gorgeous tailoring for the gentlemen. It is of course several leagues below Fellowes’s original country-house movie – Gosford Park from 2001, directed by Robert Altman - and some plot ideas about the glamorous world of Hollywood movies have in fact been cheekily recycled from that film. And there is another borrowing (cheekier still) from Singin’ in the Rain. All this is something that will (understandably) annoy many, and this film may well try the patience of non-fans. But there is something diverting about the deadly serious melodrama and bizarre glassy-eyed pathos that Downton 2 is serving up. And as ever, there is something intriguing about the way Maggie Smith, when she has to deliver emotional lines – as she occasionally does – sounds less and less posh. The date is around 1928 or possibly 1929, apparently before the Wall Street crash. (But wait: Smith’s character was supposed to be quite old at the beginning of the TV show, which kicked off in 1912!) Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) draws the attention of her crotchety papa, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), to the fact that the house’s roof is leaking – so they need cash. There is nothing for it but to accept the offer of money from the ghastly people from what Lord Grantham calls the “kinema”: a film production company that wants to use the house as a location for a new film. The roguishly handsome star Guy Dexter (Dominic West) charms one and all, and appears to have a particular spark with the house’s footman-turned-butler Barrow (Robert James-Collier). Meanwhile, the below-stairs staff are gibbering with excitement about it all and the film’s sensitive and rather wet director Jack Barber (Hugh Dancy) has a tendresse for Lady Mary, who gets them out of a jam. While this is going down, it emerges that the Dowager Countess has been left a villa in the south of France in the will of an ageing French aristocrat with whom she had a dalliance in the previous century. So this rather Mitfordian plot twist means some of the family have to journey to the sun-dappled Côte d’Azur to inspect this gorgeous property on the Countess’s behalf and be confronted by the nobleman’s affronted widow, played by Nathalie Baye. And what exactly did the Dowager Countess of Grantham have to do to get this house? Are we going to get some shockingly CGI-youthified scene of deshabille? Well, it leads to scenes of utter consternation on the part of Lord Grantham – although perhaps only a pedant would wonder why no one thought to find a photograph of the old Marquise. No matter. It is all cheerfully risible although heading for a note of seriousness to compare with what Wagner was aiming for with Siegfried’s Funeral March. I have to hope now that this really is it, and that if Mr Fellowes want to give us more Downton, he will confine it to a streaming TV show, with a new Grantham generation in the 1970s reduced to penury by exorbitant but highly justified rates of tax.
