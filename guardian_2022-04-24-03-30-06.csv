4/24/2022,"History is teetering on an edge. No one knows which way it will go. Maybe the Russian empire, the last and most terrible of the European empires, will fall. Or maybe it will absorb the hit and survive as it has survived and expanded since the 17th century. You’d be a fool to bet against it. The graveyards of Eurasia are full of those who did. And yet the breathtaking heroism of the Ukrainian resistance and the insane self-delusion of the Putinist regime are allowing Russia’s opponents from Syria to Central Asia, and from Georgia to Moldova, to ask that most revolutionary of questions: “What if?” What if the empire falls? What if structures that have endured and enslaved for centuries can be blown apart like the creaking trucks in a Russian munitions convoy? Talking to the men and women engaged in what is – if only the global left could see it – the great anticolonial struggle of our times, you hear them moving through the stages of revolutionary commitment. From peaceful protest to jail sentences to the realisation that civil disobedience will never be enough. Lives are transformed as the stakes are raised. The story of Timur Mitskievich echoes the anticolonial protests of the 20th century. In 2020, he was a teenager in Minsk when the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, rigged the presidential election as he had crushed every challenge to his rule since he came to power in 1994. Supporters of the opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya took to the streets in the largest popular demonstrations in Belarus’s history. The paradox of civil disobedience is that non-violent tactics work only against regimes that, however oppressive the protesters think them, are not so oppressive they cannot be persuaded to change. For all their crimes and prejudices, the British imperial authorities in India in the 1940s and the US government of the 1960s had to listen to Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Lukashenko did not listen to his opponents. He terrorised them. He didn’t have to worry about bad publicity when he controlled the media. Nor need he concern himself with the reaction of the “international community” after Vladimir Putin said he would maintain the dictator in power if he gave up what little remained of Belarusian independence. His country became a Russian colony again, which it had been almost continuously since the Russian empire seized control in 1795. The 17-year old Mitskievich joined the protests. The police beat him so badly doctors put him into a medically induced coma. While he was out, his mother died, leaving nine orphaned children. Peaceful disobedience works only against regimes with a capacity for feeling shame and the Belarusian and Russian regimes have no shame. Belarus, like Ukraine before 2014, is a country parochial westerners barely thought about. If its name registers today, it is as Russia’s base for its failed assault on Kyiv. In the glib 1990s, liberal democracy’s triumph was assumed to be so inevitable we called Belarus “Europe’s last dictatorship”. Look at its weirdness, we said. It still clung on to Soviet-style rule, an error that history would surely correct as the ideals of free markets and free societies marched on. Instead of being an anachronism, Belarus was a model for the future. While it became a Russian client state, Russia became a supersize Belarus, as Putin removed the limited freedoms he had allowed Russian citizens in the 2000s and aped Lukashenko’s dictatorship. To Belarus’s exiled opposition, Ukraine’s war is their war and a Ukrainian victory would open up the prospect of radical change across territories Russia intimidates and controls. The Ukrainian war has made clear, if clarity were needed, how Russian nationalists view eastern Slavs with the impertinence to reject them. Russian official media explained that Ukrainians (and by extension) Belarusians were really Russians. If they rejected Russian identity and said they had their own cultures and histories that existed before the Russian empire, they proved only that they were “Nazis”. No form of human life could be lower. The Russian state had a duty to kill them or send them to labour camps; to take their children from them and crush their country and their culture. When I spoke last week to Tsikhanouskaya’s senior adviser Franak Viačorka, in exile in Poland, he said revolution was the only viable option now. He spoke the language of an officer in an underground war rather than a politician trying to negotiate a settlement. The Lukashenko regime was the “collaborationist state”. The activists who sabotaged Belarusian railway lines, to stop Russian troops and armour reaching Ukraine, were “resistance cells”. Even in Soviet times Moscow “recognised the existence of Belarus and Ukrainian nations”, Viačorka said. Putin was bringing a “new form of fascism” that denied their very being. The Belarusian opposition was fighting it with covert action. It was attempting to drive the army away from its subservience to Lukashenko and Putin. In Belarus, as in so many other countries, hope depended on a Ukrainian victory offering the “chance to get out of Russian sphere of influence”. Well, we’ve learned better than to be optimists in the years since the fin de siècle’s silly season. We expect brute power to prevail now. The Russian armed forces are undoubtedly corrupt and inept. But you can see the empire winning, as it has always won, by throwing recruits into battle without a thought for their lives and terrorising civilians. For its part, western intelligence is not predicting a swift Ukrainian victory but a hard, grinding war whose outcome is uncertain. For all that, there is in the air, if not optimism, then a plausible question. What if the partial collapse of the Russian empire in the 1990s is followed by decisive defeat in the 2020s? What if the whole rotten structure falls? The doctors released Mitskievich from hospital. He is now fighting in Ukraine in the Belarusian version of the International Brigades of the Spanish civil war. He is one of thousands of Belarusians who volunteered to join the Kastuś Kalinoŭski Battalion, named after the leader of an uprising against the Russian empire in 1863. The battalion has seen action in the battles around Irpin. One day, its members will return to Belarus with highly portable military skills. They will have questions of their own.

4/24/2022,"Before Russia’s tanks, daubed with their infamous Z, rolled into Ukraine, Oleg Ustenko’s advice to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had focused on pension reform, privatisation and coaxing economic migrants to return. Nearly 60 days later, the pair are instead striving to hold together an economy that, even if Vladimir Putin’s brutal bombardment were to end tomorrow, would be left in tatters. “Everything that seemed incredible in the first week has got worse,” Ustenko told the Observer by telephone from battle-scarred Kyiv, where he learned his trade as an economist. “Can you imagine the feeling of an economist after hearing that assets destroyed in the first week of the war were worth $100bn, half of our annual GDP?” The most terrible price paid by Ukrainians is, of course, the daily loss of life. But Ustenko, who was educated at Harvard and Kyiv’s National Economic University, has to wrestle with the economic impact, which he estimates at $1tn so far. With half of the nation’s businesses either shuttered or operating only partially, the economy is set to have shrunk by a quarter by next month. All state expenditure has been frozen, barring defence, social support and emergency funds to provide food, water and shelter for displaced people. The budget deficit has ballooned from an expected $7bn for the year to the same amount every month. Yet Ustenko believes in the power of economics to tackle the human cost of Russia’s invasion – the death, destruction and atrocities emerging in Bucha and elsewhere. Key to this is convincing the west – and Europe in particular – to forsake Russian oil and gas and ramp up punitive sanctions on the Kremlin. The other mammoth task is to start planning for the reconstruction effort that will follow a Ukrainian victory, of which he is certain. Ustenko is scathing about Europe’s response to Kyiv’s challenge on oil and gas. By his estimate, Moscow banks about $1.4bn a day from oil and gas sales, with most of it coming from Europe. “Imagine how many missiles and bombs you can buy for that kind of money,” he says. “Some people in Europe still have extremely narrow thinking. They believe they can help us, that they’re our great friends and indeed they are. But they do not understand that by supplying this money to Putin, they are funding his military machine. If Russians are committing war crimes, even genocide, whoever is supplying Russia with this bloody money is guilty of the same war crime.” Much of his frustration is directed at Germany, Europe’s largest economy and among the most dependent on Russian oil and, in particular, gas. Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock promised last week that Berlin would end imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, phasing gas out later. Ustenko calls this schedule “unacceptable”. But if, rather than Zelenskiy, he were advising German chancellor Olaf Scholz, would he really advocate cutting off the country’s major source of domestic heating? He insists he would, adding that Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, “did everything possible to give this weapon to Putin”. “He has weaponised his energy resources. Now it’s time to show you’re completely different. I wouldn’t want my country to be facing national shame because we’re not doing the right thing. Germany can survive without Russian oil.” An immediate oil embargo would, he says, mean short-term fuel price inflation, followed by a market correction as supplies from other nations kicked in. For gas, he admits the transition would be harder. In the meantime, he adds, payments to Russian gas suppliers should be held in escrow, to be unlocked when the war is over. This would choke off the Kremlin’s revenue stream and provide a financial incentive to end the aggression. It troubles him that Europe’s calculations are based on money and the prospect of thermostats turned down a few notches. “Our guys are hiding underground in temperatures of 3C and you’re talking about a few degrees colder in your house. In Ukraine we’re talking about human life. You’re setting human life against the temperature in your home, or the money.” He also has harsh words for those in the London business community who grease the wheels of international money flows for the Kremlin and the oligarchs who help prop up Putin. While grateful for Britain’s military assistance, he thinks the government should, for instance, ban British insurers from covering Russian oil and gas consignments. “Tankers lifting Russian oil have insurance from London. How many Ukrainians must be killed before that stops?” He invites London lawyers and bankers serving Kremlin-allied masters to imagine Russian soldiers coming to their houses and visiting atrocities on their families. “Are you going to accept that? If yes, then do nothing for us. If you think it’s immoral, act immediately.” He offers a similarly caustic assessment of the global commodities houses that continue to barter boatloads of Russian oil and gas. He has written to them all, begging them to stop. They, and the insurers, will face legal action in the future, he says. “They know we’re watching them and collecting this information. These companies should be judged. Maybe in a year, maybe in 10 years, but we are going to find these people.” Right now, Zelenskiy’s adviser wants tougher economic sanctions. They could include shutting Russia out of all international payments, not just Swift, and measures to stop European boats collecting oil and gas from Russian ports to bring back home or transport to India or China. As well as helping Ukraine, such steps would be in European powers’ own interests, he says. It would cut the costs of coping with floods of refugees and help them avoid becoming Putin’s next target. “You can’t stop a monster. As soon as they’re done with us they’re coming to you. You have to be prepared.” While much of Ustenko’s time is spent nursing the remnants of Ukraine’s devastated economy, he says Zelenskiy asked him early on in the war to start planning ahead. The future is much in his thoughts: as well as an economist he is a family man, who used to enjoy walking in the woods around Kyiv and knows he will not do so for many years, because they are so heavily mined. “The task the president has given us is to find all possible ways to rebuild the economy,” he says. “We are going to win and we have to rebuild our country. We are talking about a huge amount of money.” Ukraine’s defence and eventual reconstruction should, he says, be paid for with frozen Russian central bank funds and assets seized from sanctioned oligarchs. “I’m talking about football clubs, I’m talking about nice apartments, houses and I’m talking about other properties in the UK. We have to implement big work in trying to identify more assets of Russian nomenklatura [a Soviet-era term for those elevated to positions of power]. MI6 is one of the best services in the world. Your financial service is one of the best in the world. They can do this.” Armed with funds, Ustenko would forge a new economic path for Ukraine, one that can lead only westwards. “We’re not going to trade with Russia probably for decades, so the only corridor for us now is Europe.” He is talking about logistical routes but also political ones – including European Union membership, via an expedited process. “For us, the prospect of being an EU member is a huge motivation. It’s like an extra star that appears in the dark sky. Under these circumstances everyone will win: Ukraine, Europe and our people.”",News/Business,Zelenskiy’s economic guru: ‘Germany can survive without Russian oil: I wouldn’t want my country facing the shame’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/23/zelenskiys-economic-guru-germany-can-survive-without-russian-oil
4/24/2022,"European countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, and the London lawyers and bankers who serve Vladimir Putin’s oligarchs, are complicit in war crimes, the Ukrainian president’s top economic adviser has claimed. In an exclusive interview with the Observer, Oleg Ustenko lashed out at the “unacceptable” failure of major western economies to impose an immediate embargo on imports from Russia. He also issued a warning to companies that have helped Russia keep selling its oil and gas, the proceeds of which he estimated at $1.4bn a day, saying Kyiv would one day sue commodity traders and insurers involved in dealing with the Putin regime and its industries. He said Kyiv was monitoring which firms were trading with Russia and vowed that they would face legal action in the future. “If Russians are committing war crimes, even genocide, whoever is supplying Russia with this bloody money is making the same war crime,” said Ustenko. “We know the name of the ship, the flag, the name of the captain, the volume of oil, we know how much money was paid for that oil, the port of destination, the company who sold the insurance. We are going to work with this information. We have other things to do which are much more urgent now, but we are watching everybody who is doing that. “Our belief is that if companies are making war crimes, we are going to prosecute and sue all these people. Maybe in a year, maybe in 10 years, but we are going to find these people.” Ustenko called for much tougher international sanctions on Russia, including the sale of frozen assets such as “football clubs and nice apartments”, with the proceeds going towards Ukraine’s defence and its postwar reconstruction plan. “People in Europe … believe that they can help us, that they’re our great friends, and indeed they are,” said Ustenko. “But they do not understand that by supplying this money to Putin, they are funding his military machine. They’re using it for killing us, for doing the terrible things they did in Bucha and in other places.” He said last week’s announcement from German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who said Berlin would end Russian oil imports by the end of the year and phase out gas thereafter, did not go far enough. “The message … was completely unacceptable, that Germans still agree to pay for killing our people,” he said, adding that Germany would face “national shame” unless it took swifter action. Oil imports could be stopped overnight, and the resulting impact on fuel costs was a price worth paying, he said. Ustenko acknowledged that weaning Europe off gas would be harder but said proceeds from ongoing purchases should be held in escrow, with Russian suppliers only able to access them after the war is over. He also took aim at London-based insurers and global commodity trading houses that have helped facilitate Russian cargoes, as well as the army of lawyers and bankers – many based in the UK – who serve Kremlin-allied oligarchs. “Of course we’re receiving great support but it can never be enough. Tankers lifting Russian oil have insurance provided from London,” he said, calling on the UK government to prevent the provision of cover for such shipments. “We don’t understand and we don’t want to see how many Ukrainians must be killed [before something is done]. It troubles me that in terms of Europe, we’re always talking about money. In Ukraine we’re talking about human life.” A spokesperson for Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance market, including shipping, said it “supports and remains focused on the delivery of a global sanctions regime against the Russian state, which send an important message that Russia’s invasion of a peaceful country is unacceptable”. Global commodity traders such as Trafigura, Glencore, Vitol and Gunvor have also continued to buy and sell cargoes of Russian oil. Ustenko said he had personally written to the bosses of the world’s major traders, pleading with them not to continue doing business with Russia. Some wrote back and promised to cut ties but then broke their promises, he said. Others had not responded and instead continued to trade Russian shipments. The four commodity traders told the Observer they were legally bound to abide by existing contracts but that they condemned the invasion of Ukraine and were not signing new deals. Ustenko also urged lawyers and bankers working for Russian oligarchs to imagine their own families suffering the atrocities perpetrated by invading forces in Ukraine. “Are you going to accept that? If yes, then do nothing for us. If you think that it’s immoral, then act immediately. Even if your government does not understand, you have the power.” Ustenko said Ukraine’s defence and its postwar reconstruction should be funded by seizing the frozen assets of the Russian central bank, as well as those owned by billionaire oligarchs subject to sanctions. “I’m talking about football clubs, I’m talking about nice apartments, houses, I’m talking about other properties in the UK.” ",News/World news,Countries buying Russian oil ‘complicit in war crimes’ says Ukraine adviser,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/countries-buying-russian-oil-complicit-in-war-crimes-says-ukraine-adviser
4/24/2022,"Oldham have been relegated from League Two after a 2-1 home defeat by Salford ended their 115-year stay in the Football League. The result was confirmed only after a pitch invasion at Boundary Park from hundreds of furious fans who held a banner that read “Get out of our club”, aimed at the owner, Abdallah Lemsagam. Earlier, supporters had chanted: “We want our club back” and “We’re not going anywhere” as stewards struggled to maintain order. Both sets of players were escorted off the field by referee Bobby Madley, with the last of the protestors then not leaving the pitch for almost an hour. The match was then initially abandoned before the final 12 minutes were played out behind closed doors, eventually resulting in the Latics’ fourth straight defeat. In a statement, the EFL said: “Despite the earlier announcement of the abandonment of the fixture, after discussions with both clubs, match officials, and stadium security it was agreed the match could be concluded today. “The decision was taken in order to maintain the integrity of the competition given the importance of the fixture at both ends of the League Two table.” Oldham, who had issues with pitch invasions earlier in the season, are now likely to see the misery of relegation followed by punishment from both the Football Association and the EFL. All three goals in the game came in the first half, with Matt Smith – a former Oldham player – and Brandon Thomas-Asante scoring for the visitors either side of Davis Keillor-Dunn’s penalty for the hosts after Jordan Turnbull was judged to have handled the ball. Relegation rivals Barrow and Stevenage both won on Saturday, beating promotion-chasing Sutton and Tranmere respectively, taking them both to 44 points – second-bottom Oldham are on 37 with only two games and six points still to play for. The Latics are the first team to have played in the Premier League to be relegated from League Two, and will play in the National League next season.",Sport/Football,Oldham drop out of Football League after 115 years amid fierce protests,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/oldham-drop-out-of-football-league-after-115-years-amid-fierce-protests
