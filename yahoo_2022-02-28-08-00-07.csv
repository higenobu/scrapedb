2/28/2022,"U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield protested to her Israeli counterpart over Israel's refusal to join 87 countries in backing a U.S.-led resolution to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the UN Security Council on Friday, Israeli officials tell Axios. Why it matters: Israel has attempted to maintain good relations with both Russia and Ukraine during the crisis, and has even offered to serve as a mediator. But that fence-sitting has resulted in criticism from both sides and now from the U.S. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and Foreign Ministry had been claiming for weeks that the Biden administration understood Israel's need to calibrate its reaction to the Russian invasion in order to maintain its security coordination with Russia in Syria. But Israel dragged its feet as the U.S. was gathering co-sponsors for the resolution and did not provide a clear answer before the meeting began. After the vote, which Russia vetoed, Thomas Greenfield passed a message to the Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan stressing the Biden administration’s disappointment. Driving the news: 11 Security Council members voted in favor of the resolution, three (China, the United Arab Emirates and India) abstained, and while Russia's was the lone ""no"" vote. An Israeli foreign ministry official said the decision not to accept the U.S. request to co-sponsor the resolution was due to the fact that Israel is not a member of the UN Security Council and it was clear Russia would veto. Most close U.S. allies and partners did back the resolution, however. Data: UN; Map: Axios Visuals Behind the scenes: Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Israel's Security Cabinet on Sunday that the U.S. “contained” the Israeli refusal to join the resolution. “We speak to the Biden administration in a wide range of channels on various aspects of the Ukrainian issue and the bottom line is that our partners are well aware of our considerations,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat told Axios. The U.S. mission to the UN declined to comment. What’s next: The UN General Assembly is expected to convene as early as Monday to vote on a resolution condemning Russia. Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid told the Cabinet on Sunday that Israel will vote in favor. More from Axios: Sign up to get the latest market trends with Axios Markets.

2/28/2022,"(Reuters) - Protesters took to the streets as Belarus held a referendum on Sunday to adopt a new constitution that would ditch its non-nuclear status at a time when the country has become a launchpad for Russian troops invading Ukraine. The vote, almost certain to pass under the tightly controlled rule of President Alexander Lukashenko, could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. It raises the stakes at a time when Lukashenko has fallen behind Russian President Vladimir Putin's military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role between the two neighbours. The referendum sparked anti-war protests in several cities, as people chanted ""no to war"", cars blared their horns in solidarity, and people laid bunches of flowers in the yellow and blue colours of the Ukrainian flag. At least 290 people were detained, rights activists said. Protests had largely died down in Belarus after Lukashenko launched a violent crackdown on dissent against his 28-year-long rule. Mass protests had erupted in 2020 following a disputed election that opponents say Lukashenko rigged. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said that he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. ""If you (the West) transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,"" Lukashenko said. Lukashenko turned to Russia after the 2020 protests, securing loans that offset the effect of Western sanctions. His rival in the 2020 vote, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, had called on Belarusians to use the referendum vote to protest the war against Ukraine. ""For a long time I did not know how to start this appeal. Because how can you demand courageous actions from people who live in fear for a year and a half? The war we've been dragged into started two days ago,"" she said in a special address. ""But until now, the Belarusians have not declared publicly that they are against it, they have not shown this to the Ukrainians by their actions. So do I have the right to ask you for action? Maybe not. But I won't forgive myself if I don't try."" In videos and photos posted on social media, people gathered at polling stations in Minsk and other cities in Belarus to protest. ""There is little we can do now, with all this terror and horror in which we live. But I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't try to do something. We are already considered accomplices,"" said Elena, 45, who came to one of the polling stations along with a couple of dozen people. She declined to provide more personal information for security reasons. The West has already said it will not recognise the results of the referendum, which is taking place against the background of the sweeping crackdown on domestic opponents of the government. According to human rights activists, as of Sunday, there were more than a thousand political prisoners in Belarus. On Sunday, amateur ensembles performed at polling stations, food and cheap alcohol were sold in buffets. The new constitution would give powers to the All-Belarusian People's Assembly, created by Lukashenko and populated by party loyalists, local councils, officials and activists of pro-government organizations. It would also give lifetime immunity from prosecution to the president once he left office.

 H.R. McMaster, who served as former President Trump's national security adviser, said on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""got a lot more than he bargained for"" when he invaded Ukraine last week. Appearing on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" McMaster said Ukrainian forces have done a ""tremendous"" job. ""I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position,"" McMaster told host Margaret Brennan. ""And I think anything we can do obviously financially - going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth - is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important."" McMaster added that Putin had failed to understand that Ukraine is not an autocratic regime where a political decapitation would be effective. ""The Ukrainian people are fighting for their freedom. They're fighting for democracy. They're fighting for one another and their sovereignty, and that just doesn't go away if he's able to seize Kyiv "" he said. ""I don't think seizing Kyiv is in the cards in the immediate future. The next 72 hours, I think, are going to be really critical."" Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv is still under Ukrainian control as of Sunday morning. Thousands of Ukrainians, many of whom are civilians, have taken up arms to defend the nation against Russia. McMaster also said while discussing the Biden administration's support for Ukraine that there are multiple military options available outside of the U.S. directly going to war with Russia. According to the former White House official, efforts could be made to reopen commercial airline flights in Ukraine in order to relieve ""humanitarian suffering"" and maintain open land routes to neighboring countries such as Poland, Romania and Moldova. Another option would be to resupply Ukrainians with weapons, McMaster said.",World/The Hill,Former national security adviser: 'Putin got a lot more than he bargained for',https://news.yahoo.com/former-national-security-adviser-putin-165445984.html
