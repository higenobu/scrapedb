5/1/2022,"With high-flying growth stocks making all of the headlines, dividend stocks often get ignored. But in a world of still-historically low bank account rates and 40-year high inflation, a steady and increasing stream of dividends can help risk-averse investors sleep better at night. Healthy dividend stocks have the potential to: Offer a plump income stream in both good times and bad times. Provide much-needed diversification to growth-oriented portfolios. Outperform the S&P 500 over the long haul. Let’s take a look at three dividend stocks that Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley sees substantial upside in. Tech stocks aren’t exactly known for their dividends. But the ones with massive recurring cash flows and healthy balance sheets can still deliver solid cash payouts to shareholders. Take Microsoft, for instance. When the tech giant first started paying quarterly dividends in 2004, it was paying investors 8 cents per share. Today, Microsoft’s quarterly dividend rate stands at 62 cents per share, marking a total payout increase of 675%. The stock currently offers a dividend yield of only 0.9%. But given Microsoft’s highly reliable dividend growth — management has raised the payout for 12 straight years — it remains an attractive choice for total return seekers. Morgan Stanley recently reiterated an overweight rating on Microsoft. The investment bank's price target of $372 represents about 28% worth of upside from where the stock sits today. Procter & Gamble belongs to a group of companies often referred to as the Dividend Kings: publicly traded businesses with at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. In fact, P&G makes the list with ease. In April, the board of directors announced a 5% increase to the quarterly payout, marking the company’s 66th consecutive annual dividend hike. It’s not hard to see why the company is able to maintain such a streak. P&G is a consumer staples giant with a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades, and Tide detergent. These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. Thanks to the recession-proof nature of P&G’s business, it can deliver reliable dividends through thick and thin. In January, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the shares from $161 to $177, representing about 9% worth of upside from current levels. The stock offers a dividend yield of 2.3%. MPLX isn’t a household name like Microsoft or P&G. But for the serious yield-hunters, it’s a stock that probably shouldn’t be ignored. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX is a master limited partnership created by Marathon Petroleum to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. The partnership pays quarterly cash distributions of 70.50 cents per unit. With the stock trading just under $33, that translates into a chunky annual dividend yield of 8.7%. While Morgan Stanley only has as an equal weight rating on MPLX, it raised its price target from $37 to $39 recently, about 19% worth of upside from where the stock currently trades.

5/1/2022,"Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger did some kicking of a downed dog on Saturday. ""Wasn't that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen?"" Munger said during the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting after bringing up Robinhood's business troubles, later adding the company's business model ""was disgusting... God is getting just. ... There's been some justice."" A spokesperson for Robinhood didn't immediately return Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Munger has been an outspoken critic of the investing platform, which makes most of its money through payment-for-order flow — that is, selling customer market orders to third parties. “When you pay for order flow, you’re probably charging your customers more in pretending to be free,” Munger said in February 2021, at the height of the meme stock frenzy and a few months prior to Robinhood's July 2021 IPO. “It’s a really dishonorable, low-grade way to talk, and nobody should believe Robinhood’s trades are free.” Robinhood stock is down nearly 45% so far in 2022, and shares are down 72% since the company hit public markets. At last year's Berkshire shareholders meeting, the billionaire stated: ""It's just god awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized men and decent citizens. It's deeply wrong. We don't wanna make our money selling things that are bad for people."" Munger's latest comments come on the heels of a brutal week for the retail investor trading platform. Robinhood announced that the company would slash 9% of its workforce in an effort to reach profitability by the end of the year. The company then reported a very lackluster first quarter, pressured by waning trading volumes for stocks and cryptocurrencies. The company lost $143 million on an adjusted operating profit basis, compared to a $115 million profit a year earlier, and first quarter sales nosedived 43% from a year ago. Options based trading sales also fell 36% while cryptocurrencies dropped by 39% and equities plunged 73%. ""We all know this is a challenging time in the markets,"" Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev told analysts on an earnings call. ""And our focus during this time is on building a great company for the long term."" Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, Munger's longtime business partner, attempted to lighten the mood slightly amid Munger's comments. ""Is it wise to criticize people at all?"" Buffett asked. ""Probably not,"" Munger quipped, ""but I can't help it."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.
