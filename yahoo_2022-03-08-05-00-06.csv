3/8/2022,"By Diane Bartz and David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With inflation at a four-decade high, a U.S. government report shows corporate America has used its clout in the labor market to keep wages 20% lower than they should be, the White House said on Monday. The report, done by the Treasury Department with help from the Justice Department, Labor Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), found companies had the upper hand in setting wages because they generally knew more about the labor market than workers do. Further, workers may not be able to move or to afford an extended job search in order to find better-paid work. ""These conditions can enable firms to exert market power, and consequently offer lower wages and worse working conditions, even in labor markets that are not highly concentrated,"" the report said. The report discusses ways that firms can hold down wages, including conspiring with other companies to avoid hiring each other's workers and requiring employees to sign non-compete agreements that prevent them from leaving for higher wages. The report cited a paper that found one-in-five workers is currently covered by a non-compete agreement, meaning they cannot leave to work for a competitor. ""A careful review of credible academic studies places the decrease in wages at roughly 20% relative to the level in a fully competitive market. In some industries and occupations, like manufacturing, estimates of wage losses are even higher,"" the report said. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% in February but hourly earnings were flat, partly because of the return of workers to lower-paying industries, offsetting wage increases in some sectors as companies compete for scarce workers. Economists say the war in Ukraine and harsh sanctions imposed on Russia will keep energy prices higher for longer, contributing to inflation and prompting companies to try to cut costs elsewhere. Antitrust enforcement efforts usually focus on the prices that companies charge for goods and services. Antitrust enforcers have brought labor antitrust cases in the past, and the Trump Administration's Justice Department brought one against a no-poach agreement between rail equipment suppliers in 2018, but they remain rare.

3/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Hundreds of U.S. school districts are shifting from stern mask mandates to softer mask-optional guidelines, giving parents and children final say in a fraught debate. Most Read from Bloomberg Stakes Rise as Putin Says His War in Ukraine Will Continue China Warns U.S. Against Forming Pacific NATO and Backing Taiwan Ukraine Update: U.S. May Go Alone on Russia Oil Ban; Crude Soars Ukraine Update: U.S. Sending More Troops, Tankers to Europe Putin’s Ruble Workaround Still Leaves Bond Payments in Doubt Some adults say the change is overdue, and that after years of pandemic angst, their kids yearn to see the faces of teachers and classmates. Others say mask choice opens a new arena for peer pressure and ridicule, a perennial issue, but one that’s newly serious with varying vaccination rates and shots out of reach for the youngest students. Schoolchildren already face pressure to fit in, particularly in matters of clothing and appearance. Parents have limited ability to control their offspring outside the house -- not news to anyone who has waged a battle over skirt length or green hair. Now, masks are the new headache. Lupe Hernandez’s vaccinated 8-year-old son, Nico, caught Covid in December and faces lingering side effects. Nico, who has special needs, will remain masked when the mandate ends at his school in New York City’s Tribeca neighborhood. Hernandez says her son already “feels different just being autistic,” and the last thing she wants is extra anxiety when he sees other students not wearing masks. Tori Mikos, of Hampshire, Illinois, in Chicago’s exurbs, has three children in elementary school, and says they won’t be wearing masks. “I’m thrilled that we are going to mask-optional,” she said. “This is something that myself and many parents have wanted for a really long time.” But her children face new crosscurrents of pressure, Mikos said. “We’ve had more parents, even in the carpool, say rude comments,” she said. Kids who persist with masking will have it worse, she said. “The kids will tease kids that are wearing the mask,” Mikos said. “I hope that does not happen.” More than half of the largest 500 U.S. districts now practice mask-optional policies, according to Burbio, a Pelham, New York, data company that tracks school closings. New Jersey, which enacted some of the strictest safety measures at the height of the pandemic is lifting its mandate Monday, as is New York City, the nation’s largest district. New York City’s private Horace Mann School, with some 1,800 students in nursery through 12th grade, is telling families its Monday transition to mask-optional life will be hard. “While the sunsetting of the mask mandate indoors and when on campus will be a relief to some, it will be a source of discomfort and even anxiety for others,” head of school Thomas Kelly said in a letter to parents. The Austin Independent School District in Texas asked parents, students and teachers in a survey whether it was time to make masks optional, and the results so far have been perfectly split, with 6% unsure. Almost a third of respondents said the mandate should stay in place for the rest of the school year. Still, the district made masking optional effective Monday. The policy shift mirrors relaxed guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that rolled out in late February. Some health experts have questioned the timing, and criticized the move, because of the difficulty of reinstating mask rules in the event of another surge. In practice, optional policies may create more friction than mandates. “Some kids who are masking are actually teasing and or bullying the kids who are not masking, and the same is true vice versa, so it’s not just a one way thing,” said Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Montgomery County, Maryland. “It just creates a lot of angst, because now anything can go.” The added burden comes after a prolonged period of social isolation that caused anxiety and depression among children to spike, according to several studies. Tajh Sutton, president of her local school board in Brooklyn, is concerned about relaxing the rule. She kept her two children home without a virtual option for months during the beginning of the school year -- until she started getting calls from the attendance officer. Her children returned in November and the whole family had contracted Covid by January. “My 8-year-old daughter told me she doesn’t want to go school if people are not going to wear masks,” Sutton said. “I don’t understand why we wouldn’t keep the masks on.” Across the country, more than 12.6 million child Covid cases have been reported cumulatively. January saw the highest level of infection among children throughout the pandemic, though cases fell dramatically in the weeks that followed. Since the beginning of September, there have been nearly 7.6 million child cases, according to a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest district in the U.S., will make masks optional for staff and students starting March 14, according to an emailed statement on Monday. The Chicago Teachers Union did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the changed policy, but in a March 4 letter to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, the union said “unilaterally moving to mask optional policy” would violate its Jan. 12 agreement with the district over safety protocols. Some Chicago parents were frustrated that city schools lagged public indoor venues and other districts around Illinois in relaxing guidelines. “All of us were going to be able to enjoy our lives mask-free for the first time in months, and our children, the least vulnerable to this disease, continue to be masked by mandate of the board,” said Nick Kryczka, a parent of third- and fifth-grade students in Chicago’s Jefferson Park neighborhood. “I would describe it as a major inconvenience at the least.” Health experts have pushed for clearer metrics for when to relax or tighten the guidelines, and raised concern about the public’s willingness to re-mask if those benchmarks aren’t understood when cases begin to spike. “The thing I’m worried about is the idea for people that this is done -- that you can go home and burn your masks and never see them again,” said Jaimie Meyer, associate professor of medicine and public health at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. If a new variant emerges, “I’m afraid there won’t be the public appetite for reverting to more restrictive measures.” Horace Mann will still require masks for its youngest students, and advised parents to keep their own feelings on the issue in check during conversations with their children. “Masked or unmasked, at HM we treat each other with the respect, kindness and generosity of heart each of us deserves daily,” Kelly wrote.

3/8/2022,"By Byron Kaye SYDNEY (Reuters) - China must act on its declarations of promoting world peace and join the effort to stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Australia's prime minister said on Monday, warning that the world was in danger of being reshaped by an ""arc of autocracy"". Scott Morrison also suggested in a wide-ranging speech that Russia's invasion was not going according to the plan of its leader, Vladimir Putin, who he said had ""overestimated the capacity of how he might be able to prosecute this illegal war"". ""China has long claimed to have a role as one of the major powers in the world and to be a contributor to global peace and stability. No country will have a bigger impact on concluding this terrible war in Ukraine than China,"" Morrison said in response to a question after a speech at the Lowy Institute think tank. Morrison, whose government has clashed with its biggest export partner over a range of issues, said he was dismayed by China's reticence. ""I was listening for the voice of the Chinese government when it came to condemning the actions of Russia and there was a chilling silence,"" he said. China has declined to call the Russian attack on Ukraine an ""invasion"" while asking Western countries to respect Russia's ""legitimate security concerns"". It has called for a solution to the crisis through negotiations. Russia calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation"", saying it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. Morrison called it a ""gross violation of international law"" and ""the latest example of an authoritarian regime seeking to challenge the status quo through threats and violence"". Most countries had cut off trade with Russia and payment companies like Visa and Mastercard were suspending operations there. But China had relaxed wheat tariffs to Russia and may supply its UnionPay system, Morrison said. ""This for me just jars completely with what the broader international interest is,"" he said. ""So long as they have a bet each way on this, then I fear the bloodshed will continue."" Morrison, whose comments represent a sharpening of Australia's criticism of China, also suggested its silence revealed a natural affinity with Russia that had far-reaching implications. ""A new arc of autocracy is instinctively aligning to challenge and reset the world order in their own image,"" he said. Morrison questioned whether the invasion was going to Putin's plan, as Putin has said it was. ""There is no doubt that Mr Putin is not getting what he was seeking,"" Morrison said. ""I think he's overestimated the capacity of how he might be able to prosecute this illegal war. The way that he has just sent young conscripts into flames, I don't see how that would be resonating well back in Russia."" Morrison predicted a ""resistance in the Ukraine which will only grow over time. I think any gains that are potentially made will be very hard to hold"". Morrison, whose conservative coalition faces an election by May that most polls suggest it will lose, formed a new alliance with the United States and Britain last year that was centred around nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. On Monday, he said the submarine bases would be built on the east coast, home to most of the population.

3/8/2022,"Former Attorney General William Barr said he believes former President Donald Trump is morally responsible for the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol but isn't legally culpable. Asked by NBC News' Lester Holt whether he considered Trump ""responsible"" for the violence at the Capitol, Barr said: ""I do think he was responsible in the broad sense of that word, in that it appears that part of the plan was to send this group up to the Hill. I think the whole idea was to intimidate Congress. And I think that that was wrong."" But, he added, he hasn't seen evidence that Trump committed an actual crime. ""I haven't seen anything to say he was legally responsible for it in terms of incitement,"" Barr said. Holt interviewed Barr for a prime-time special airing Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on NBC. It's Barr's first television interview since he stepped down as attorney general in December 2020 after 22 tumultuous months as the country's top law enforcement official. Barr, in an interview on Monday morning with NBC's “TODAY"" show, said he doesn’t think Trump should be the GOP nominee and plans to support another Republican candidate. But asked if he would vote for Trump if he wins the party nomination in 2024, Barr suggested he would. “Because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic Party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee,” he said. Barr, a longtime proponent of broad presidential power who was often accused of acting as Trump's lackey, was also asked whether he would have investigated the former president over classified documents that the National Archives said were taken to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after he left office. ""To tell you the truth, I probably wouldn't,"" Barr said. He suggested that Trump's having made off with the documents was probably not illegal. ""The whole classification system is done under executive order. It's the president. The president decides everything,"" Barr said, although there's no indication Trump formally declassified the documents that left the White House with him. Barr sat for the interview in advance of the publication of his book recounting his time in the White House, “One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General.” In a letter to NBC News responding to Barr’s interview and his account of his time working for Trump, Trump said the book was ""fake"" and called Barr a ""coward"" and a ""big disappointment."" During his time as Trump's attorney general, Democrats and some former prosecutors criticized Barr for appearing to act as Trump's personal lawyer instead of as an independent law enforcement official. Barr insisted to Holt he wasn't Trump's ""toady"" and defended decisions he made as attorney general that were in line with what Trump was demanding publicly, often on Twitter. Barr, who was also attorney general for President George H.W. Bush, acknowledged that he spent far more time in the White House during the Trump presidency. ""I think I probably was in the Oval Office six times maybe when I was A.G. for Bush,"" Barr said. Asked how many times he was there under Trump, he said: ""Scores. Scores."" He said the meetings were ""sort of like a floating card game."" ""There were always players coming and going,"" he said. ""And there was never really a beginning or end."" In a wide-ranging interview with Holt, Barr defended some of his more controversial actions as attorney general , including a four-page letter he issued ahead of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Two federal judges later said the letter was misleading. Mueller himself also expressed frustration that Barr’s letter “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.” Barr’s statement said Mueller’s team did not find that anyone in the Trump campaign conspired with Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. A judge said Barr left out the fact that the report identified numerous contacts between members of the Trump campaign and people connected with the Russian government. Barr said ""I totally reject"" criticism from the judges, Mueller and others about his letter. ""This was not a summary of the report. It was a description of his bottom-line conclusions. I stuck with the bottom line. You say guilty or not guilty. That's what I did,"" he said. As for his decision to soften a prison sentence for longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone that Trump had repeatedly blasted as unfair, Barr said: ""I knew it would be made to look bad. At the end of the day, all you can do is what you think is right."" Trump pardoned Stone in his last few weeks in office. Barr also defended his decision to remove Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office prosecuted former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and was investigating Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and two of his associates. Barr maintained that getting rid of Berman had nothing to do with trying to protect Trump. ""I didn't think there was any threat to the president,"" Barr said, and the decision to can Berman ""was my call."" ""I hadn't really thought much of him,"" he said. ""I wanted to make the change."" Barr said it was also a coincidence that federal police officers violently cleared protesters from Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., in June 2020 just before Trump held a photo opportunity at a nearby church with Barr and others. An inspector general's report last year concluded that police initially intervened so a contractor could install fencing — not because of Trump’s event. But the report said Barr urged officials to speed up the clearing process once Trump had decided to walk through the area that evening. “Are these people still going to be here when POTUS comes out?” Barr was quoted as telling a U.S. Park Police commander in the report. Barr insisted to Holt that the park ""was being cleared for law enforcement purposes"" and added that ""an attorney general doesn't come in and take operational control of things."" He said he found out he was expected to go to the park with Trump only shortly before he departed. ""They told us that he was going to walk 15 feet in front and we were going to trail behind. He had a very scowly look on his face as he sort of walked along, and I said, 'This is not going to go over well.' That's what I was thinking."" Barr said that despite the perception that he was deferential to Trump, he would stand up to the president when the occasion called for it, including shooting down his demand that former FBI Director James Comey be prosecuted over allegations that he mishandled classified information. Trump ""was very, very upset that I didn't bring a case against Comey,"" Barr said, but ""the evidence wasn't there, the evidence of intent."" He also said he resisted Trump's demand to rush out the results of an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe before the 2020 presidential election. The investigation, which is being handled by special counsel John Durham, continues. Barr said he told Trump that ""we can't run things according to a political calendar."" ""I also felt that the idea that the election would turn on whether there's a prosecution of some lower-level person at that point, you know, on the Russia-gate thing, was a misperception,"" he said. ""I think people were worried about much bigger issues."" As for his decision to authorize the Justice Department to break with previous policy by giving prosecutors the green light “to pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections” amid Trump's claims of widespread fraud, Barr said he just wanted answers to some of the allegations that were already flying around thanks to Trump and his allies. What he found didn't make Trump happy. ""I quickly came to the conclusion that the initial stuff that was pointed to, like the Dominion machines and all these other conspiracy theories, were nonsense,"" he said. And ""this idea of some inner-city boiler room where people are cranking out false ballots is a fantasy."" Barr said that after he announced publicly on Dec. 1, 2020, that he'd found no sign of widespread fraud, Trump became enraged. ""That's the maddest I'd ever see him,"" Barr said. He quoted Trump as telling him: ""Well, you know, I hear about these Dominion machines in Michigan. Some people think that they should be seized."" ""And I said, 'There's no way the department is going to seize those machines. There's simply not probable cause.'"" He said he told Trump, ""The reason you are where you are is because you wheeled out a clown show in lawyers,"" a reference to Giuliani, who was a frequent critic of Barr's. Holt noted that in his book, Barr said he didn’t think Trump would ever concede, because in “his cosmos, a loser was the lowest form of life.” He asked Barr whether he thinks Trump really believes he won the election. ""I think his attitude probably is it either was stolen or if it wasn't stolen I want people to believe it was stolen,"" Barr said. ""It's useful. I'm not sure he's, you know, really fixated on finding out what the truth is there."" In his response, Trump said: “Bill Barr cares more about being accepted by the corrupt Washington media and elite than serving the American people. He was slow, lethargic, and I realized early on that he never had what it takes to make a great attorney general.” That's different from what Trump has said publicly. In February 2020 — after Barr had been on the job for over a year and after he directed a lighter sentence for Stone — Trump said of Barr: “I think he’s doing an excellent job. He’s a strong guy.”",Politics/NBC News,Former AG Barr says he wouldn't have prosecuted Trump for Jan. 6 or taking classified documents,https://news.yahoo.com/former-ag-barr-says-wouldnt-011822408.html

The pair, a bit belatedly embarrassed by their gushing praise of Putin, starred in what was presented as the “Fox News Ukrainian Invasion Celebration Spectacular” — live from Mar-a-Lago. “We got into a little bit of trouble for all the nice things we said about Russia and the mean things we said about Ukraine,” admitted Carlson (played by Alex Moffat). “We did sound pretty awful in hindsight — and foresight,” said Ingraham (Kate McKinnon). “I called the president of Ukraine pathetic. He stayed and fought with his people in the war, and I called him pathetic from the news desk in Washington.” Carlson recounted: “I kept asking, why do we hate Putin? Aren’t liberals in America even worse? ... I kept saying we should be more worried about our own border getting invaded by Mexico. But in my defense, I am racist, so I thought that was true.” Ingraham noted that Putin “has just criminalized free speech and shut down all independent news organizations.” Carlson asked: “Can we please do that to CNN?” To make amends for their thoughtlessness, “Ingraham” announced that she and her co-worker were raising money for the real victims of the invasion — the oligarchs. “So far we’ve raised over $8.3 billion rubles, which comes out to almost $12,” noted “Carlson.” Not to be outdone, James Austin Johnson popped up as former President Donald Trump to man the phone lines for donations and ramble on about Rihanna, who he said can still “pull it off” pregnant.

3/8/2022,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — News reports from Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities under unrelenting bombardment by the Russian military have been triggering painful memories among the survivors of the 1990s siege of Bosnian capital Sarajevo. And yet, many have been spending hours on end glued to their television screens since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. “Not so long ago, we were them,” said Amra Muftic who survived the 1992-95 siege, watching news reports showing civilians taking refuge from Russian rocket attacks, shelling and gunfire in basements and subway stations. “If our experience is anything to go by — and I have a gut feeling that it is — things are about to get much worse” for them, she added. Bosnian Serb forces laid siege to Sarajevo in the early 1990s, during the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia. About 350,000 people were trapped, for 46 months, in their multiethnic city, subjected to daily shelling and sniper attacks and cut off from regular access to electricity, food, water, medicine and the outside world. More than 11,000 people were killed during the siege, including over 1,000 children. Countless others were wounded. “We know how they feel. We survived the longest siege in modern history” said Elma Vukotic, an anesthesiologist, as she and her fellow health care workers stood earlier this week outside their Sarajevo hospital, clad in their medical robes and holding balloons in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag — and, coincidentally, also the Bosnian one. Vukotic said their spontaneous show of solidarity was the least they could do for their Ukrainian colleagues. “All wars are painful, all attacks against civilians abhorrent, but what is happening to Ukrainians right now is especially traumatic for us, because they are so near and in a situation very similar to ours” three decades ago, Vukotic said. “Television images of pregnant women waiting to give birth in the basement of the Kyiv hospital, hastily converted into an emergency bomb shelter, gave me a strong sense of deja vu; I know exactly how they feel, how terrified they must be,” she added. “Also, I think we all can empathize with how unwilling ordinary Ukrainians were to accept that the war was coming until Russian rockets and bombs started raining down on their homes, schools and hospitals.” The Bosnian war started when Bosnian Serbs, with the help of the Yugoslav army, tried to create ethnically pure territories with the aim of joining neighboring Serbia. More than 100,000 people were killed and 2 million — more than half the country’s population — were left homeless during the conflict. The Serb leadership argued throughout the war that multiethnic Bosnia wasn't a country at all and that, along with its Catholic Croats and its Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim and account for about half of the population, it should be split between neighboring Serbia and Croatia. Bosniaks, they insisted, were just treacherous Serb converts who centuries ago abandoned their original (Orthodox Christian) faith. Many in Sarajevo heard the echoes of those old insults in Putin’s recent statements, offered to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A U.N. arms embargo maintained in Bosnia throughout the 1990s conflict gave Bosnian Serb militias, armed and backed by the Serbia-controlled Yugoslav Army, an edge in the fight. They conquered 60% of Bosnia’s territory in less than two months, committing horrendous atrocities against their Bosniak and Croat compatriots. In 1995, the U.S.-brokered Dayton Peace agreement put an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia by dividing the country into two semi-autonomous parts — one run by the Serbs and the other shared by Bosniaks and Croats. The two are linked by weak multiethnic institutions. But living together in the aftermath of a brutal, fratricidal conflict has proven to be difficult. The postwar power-sharing system perpetuates the polarized and venomous political climate in Bosnia, while its entrenched nationalist leaders continuously stoke ethnic animosities for political gain. With Moscow’s backing, the strongly pro-Russia Bosnian Serbs, in particular, have been advocating for years for the independence of their region. Meanwhile, sectarian networks of patronage and pervasive corruption, which gradually became integral to the system, ensure that Bosnia remains one of the poorest countries in Europe, increasingly losing its best and brightest to other countries. “Right now, Ukrainians are subjected to torture, they are pleading for help and hoping for who knows what,” said Zoka Catic, a filmmaker and journalist from Sarajevo who has spent years documenting the devastating impact of war on the mental health of Bosnians of all ethnicities. No matter how the conflict in Ukraine ends, he argued, there is no such thing as a happy ending to a war. “It is just a matter of time … before (Ukrainians) turn into us: sad, unhappy people who experienced the worst feeling in the world — helplessness.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Watching Ukraine, Bosnians relive the trauma of their war",https://news.yahoo.com/watching-ukraine-bosnians-relive-trauma-071918041.html
