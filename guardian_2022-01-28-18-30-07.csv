1/28/2022,"There is an uncanniness in listening to a musical instrument you have never heard being played for the first time. As your brain makes sense of a new sound, it tries to frame it within the realm of familiarity, producing a tussle between the known and unknown. The second album from Mexican-American producer Delia Beatriz, AKA Debit, embraces this dissonance. Taking the flutes of the ancient Mayan courts as her raw material and inspiration, Beatriz used archival recordings from the Mayan Studies Institute at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México to create a digital library of their sounds. She then processed these ancient samples through a machine-learning program to create woozy, ambient soundscapes.  Since no written music has survived from the Mayan civilisation, Beatriz crafts a new language for these ancient wind instruments, straddling the electronic world of her 2017 debut Animus and the dilatory experimentalism of ambient music. The resulting 10 tracks make for a deliciously strange listening experience. Opener 1st Day establishes the undulating tones that unify the record. They flutter like contemplative humming and veer from acoustic warmth to metallic note-bending. Each track is given a numbered day and time, as if documenting the passage of a ritual, and echoes resonate down the record: whistles appear like sirens during the moans of 1st Night and 3rd Night; snatches of birdsong are tucked between the reverb of 2nd Day and 5th Day. The Long Count of the record’s title seems to express the linear passage of time itself, one replicated in the eternal, fluid flute tones. We hear in them the warmth of the human breath that first produced their sound, as well as Beatriz’s electronic filtering that extends their notes until they imperceptibly bleed into one another and fuzz like keys on a synth. It is a startlingly original and enveloping sound that leaves us with that ineffable feeling: the past unearthed and made new once more. Korean composer Park Jiha releases her third album, The Gleam (tak:til), a solo work featuring uniquely sparse compositions of saenghwang mouth organ, piri oboe and yanggeum dulcimer. British-Ghanaian rapper KOG brings his debut LP, Zone 6, Agege (Heavenly Sweetness), a deeply propulsive mix of English, Pidgin and Ga lyrics set to Afrobeat fanfares.

1/28/2022,"A review of the “crippling” insurance costs faced by residents in some buildings with unsafe cladding is to be undertaken by a watchdog, at the request of the government. Michael Gove, the communities minister, has asked the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to establish within six months why insurance premiums have shot up for many customers while work started after the Grenfell tragedy to remove cladding from many sites.  Despite investment and work to identify and tackle cladding safety defects in existing blocks and a continuing decrease in the instances of fire in multiple-occupancy buildings, he said building insurance premiums had increased dramatically for almost all leaseholders in blocks of flats. “I am also concerned to hear that many insurers seem unwilling to offer new policies, forcing people to shop in a more limited marketplace with more restrictive terms or less coverage; in many cases, trapping people with their current provider,” Gove wrote in a letter to the Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi. The minister said he shared the view of many policyholders who, “understandably”, do not view the market as effectively delivering accessibly priced, widely available insurance. “The market lacks transparency and there is not currently useful data to explain the rationale behind the increasing premiums charged by insurers and the conditions associated with the cover. The role and remuneration of brokers, managing agents and freeholders is also unclear.” ​​A government review into building regulations after the fire – which killed 72 people and injured more than 70 – concluded that indifference and ignorance led to a “race to the bottom” in building safety practices, with cost prioritised over safety. A national ban was introduced on using combustible cladding on new buildings, and sprinklers became mandatory on new-builds of more than 11 metres. The full cost of fire safety work on all affected blocks has been estimated at about £15bn. By June last year the government had committed an estimated £5bn through the Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings. But under the leasehold system in England and Wales the cost is often borne by individual flat-owners, some of whom have been left with spiralling insurance costs, service charges, and high fees for 24-hour “waking watch” fire patrols. Last week, Gove threatened a UK trading ban on manufacturers of combustible cladding and insulation unless they pay to fix dangerous housing, giving companies a March deadline to agree a settlement. In a letter to the industry, he highlighted more than £700m in profits made over the past four years by the three firms most closely associated with the Grenfell disaster – likely to mean Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan, which made the combustible cladding panels and insulation foam on Grenfell Tower. Earlier this year, Britain’s biggest housebuilding companies told the government they must not be the only ones to pay the potential £4bn cost of fixing fire safety problems in apartment blocks.",News/Business,Gove requests review of spiralling insurance for flats with unsafe cladding,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/gove-requests-review-of-high-insurance-costs-for-flats-with-unsafe-cladding
1/28/2022," Daniel Kokotajlo’s devastating debut feature is drawn from his own experiences growing up as a Jehovah’s Witness. Ivanna (a performance of quiet desperation from Siobhan Finneran) and her daughters Luisa (Sacha Parkinson) and Alex (Molly Wright), who has a serious blood condition, are dutiful members of a religious group in Oldham. But when Luisa falls pregnant by her non-believer boyfriend, she is “disfellowshipped” – cut off from her family and community. This act, and a subsequent tragedy, pick away at Ivanna’s life of unquestioning devotion, as the rigid rules of the faith stymie her love for her child and sense of humanity.Saturday 29 January, 11.30pm, BBC Two Before the Big Brother house and WandaVision’s Westview there was Seahaven, a pretty US coastal town where Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) and his wife Meryl (Laura Linney) live – watched 24 hours a day by 5,000 cameras. In Peter Weir’s prescient 1998 satirical drama, Truman is the unwitting star of a hit TV reality show (and has been since birth), his every move tracked and manipulated for our viewing pleasure. But reality comes crashing in, and Truman has to choose between the perils of the unknown and comfortable picket-fence conformity.Saturday 29 January, 6.55pm, Great! Movies This 1945 portmanteau film is one of the greats of British horror, if only for the chilling final segment of its five tales-with-a-tale. The brilliant Michael Redgrave plays a tormented ventriloquist whose dummy starts to get ideas of its own about their partnership. The other stories – directed by the likes of Robert Hamer and Alberto Cavalcanti – feature a haunted mirror, premonitions of death and child ghosts in country houses, plus the bonus of Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne basically reprising their Charters and Caldicott double act from The Lady Vanishes.Sunday 30 January, 7pm, Talking Pictures TV Norman Jewison’s 1967 crime drama is the late Sidney Poitier’s finest film – a fiery denunciation of racism wrapped up in a gripping murder mystery and decorated with a superb jazz-blues soundtrack from Quincy Jones. Poitier is Virgil “They call me Mister” Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide detective passing through rural Mississippi who is roped in to helping bigoted sheriff Gillespie (Rod Steiger) investigate the death of a white industrialist. Poitier is magnetic and permanently on the boil, while Steiger nails the difficult shift from resentment of Tibbs to respect.Sunday 30 January, 10pm, BBC Two Florence Pugh first showed what a major talent she is in William Oldroyd’s dark 2016 drama, set in the north-east of England in the 19th century. She stars as the wilful young Katherine, married off to the son of a mine owner, whose feelings of neglect and humiliation push her into an affair with groomsman Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) – which nothing will stop her from enjoying. Interesting racial subtexts (a Black maid is rendered literally voiceless) add depth to a passionate, potent work.Monday 31 January, 11.50pm, BBC Two Enjoy spotting the references to Homer’s The Odyssey or just revel in the silliest performance of George Clooney’s career – either way, the Coen brothers’ Great Depression-era comedy boasts a breadth of entertainment value. Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play escaped convicts who hit the road to find supposed buried treasure. Chaplinesque comedy scenes vie with dramatic encounters with the likes of bank robber Baby Face Nelson, bluesman Tommy Johnson and the Ku Klux Klan – all backed by a cracking folk soundtrack – as the inept trio attempt to reach their goal.Tuesday 1 February, IMDb TV Justin Kurzel’s impressionistic period adventure takes on Peter Carey’s Booker prize-winning novel about Australia’s near-mythical antihero Ned Kelly, and makes a good fist of the attempt. George MacKay plays Ned, whose hardscrabble upbringing in a poor Irish immigrant family leads him inexorably into criminality – events he writes down in an effort to keep control of his own narrative. Essie Davis is a fierce presence as Ned’s mother Ellen, while Russell Crowe has a nice cameo as Harry Power, Ned’s mentor in the ways of the bushranger.Friday 4 February, 11.20pm, Film4",Arts/Television & radio,Apostasy to Lady Macbeth: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/apostasy-to-lady-macbeth-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this
1/28/2022,"Atheatre director once told me that you should never ask what a play is about, just as you should never ask a prisoner what they’re in for: instead, you should ask, “What’s the inquiry?”. What’s the difference, you might wonder. Well, Bill Hayes’s Sweat is “about” a history of exercise, indeed, that’s its subtitle. Yet his inquiry would be better summarised: “What does my body and its acts and competencies say about who I am? What, for that matter, did Plato’s? And from everyone in between, what can I learn about the self?” “Libraries, like gyms,” he writes, “have always been a refuge for me, just as gyms, like libraries, have always been places of learning.” There is a playfulness in Hayes’s writing, which reaches from a rich topsoil of endearing wordplay (“pas de dads”, he calls the sight of two middle-aged men playing squash) to the deepest layers of curiosity and empathy. He takes a profound, historian’s pleasure in tropes that echo across centuries – “The ancient Greek word for ‘gym rat’… literally translates as ‘palestra addict’”, to build an enthusiasm it’s impossible not to share. In one chapter, he learns boxing; it’s physically arduous, Plato had a thing or two to say about it (didn’t he always?), the diary is tearing along with pace and wit when Hayes leads the reader casually into the relationship that made him want to box in the first place. His boyfriend Steve – protective, capable, “always there. In our apartment, at my side, at the other end of the phone, a presence” – dies, suddenly, of a heart attack at the age of 43. It’s like being punched in the face. Hayes, by his own account, ends up medium-good at boxing, but as a storyteller, he’s Joe Frazier.  The focal point of Hayes’s research, which takes him from London to Paris as he tracks down academics and translators, is Girolamo Mercuriale, author of De Arte Gymnastica, the first comprehensive book on exercise, from 1573. Mercuriale was wrong about a lot of things – his treatise on sweat is wild – and right about more. Hayes is wrong about some things – he thinks Mercuriale looks like Shakespeare, which he doesn’t at all - and absolutely fascinating in his own, idiosyncratic fascinations. In between, he splices in his personal sporting journey, from swimming to boxing to running, to being a gym rat, to glancing medit – certainly the route isn’t chronological –ations on his father, and somehow he arrives at today’s conception of exercise. The author describes the modern consensus on fitness as cohering relatively recently, in the early 50s. The epidemiologist Jerry Morris, known as “the man who invented exercise”, more accurately described, per Hayes, as “the man who invented the field of exercise science” spearheaded Britain’s Society for Social Medicine. From his large-scale studies of transport workers, the difference in baseline health between conductors (who walked about) and drivers (who were sedentary) formed the basis for his conclusions about the benefits of keeping fit. In the same year, two American epidemiologists did a similar study on a different cohort, school children aged six to 19, which ultimately led to Eisenhower’s Council on Youth Fitness. The Society for Social Medicine had been established with an explicitly socialist, internationalist agenda, and the cross-pollination of the respective groups’ work was equally explicitly resisted by authorities in the McCarthy-era US (as Morris’s colleague, John Pemberton wrote: “When the immigration officer at New York read my introductory letter stating that the object of my visit was ‘to study the teaching of social medicine in the USA’ he said, with some emphasis, “We don’t want any of that filth here”). In public health terms, there is a fascinating left-right divide: the left uses the body as an index of systemic inequality, while the right uses the body as the ultimate outward sign of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. And while Hayes is extremely alert to race and gender politics, never gulled by the exclusions of historical record (“I suddenly imagined Tolstoy and Einstein competing in a triathlon. Which man would win? Maybe a woman would instead”), he’s not so hot on these big ideological fissures. If that sounds like a criticism, it isn’t; rather, a way of saying, I would have liked more views, more observations, on more subjects – basically, I would have liked this book to go on for a lot longer. Erudite, ludic, eccentric, energetic and historically transporting, it’s like falling through a gym and landing in a joust.  Sweat: A History of Exercise is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

1/28/2022,"The Afterparty (Apple TV+) is one of those “oh, it’s them from that thing” shows, packed to the gills with comedy stars who have appeared in better series or films. Originally conceived as a film about a high school reunion by Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street creators Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, it has been transformed into an eight-part murder mystery, with each episode adopting a different genre depending on the character we are following. Tiffany Haddish plays Danner, the detective who puts herself in charge of investigating the crime. Smart and starry? What could go wrong? Not much, as it turns out, but its fundamental decent-ness is to its detriment. A group of old classmates are getting together for their 15-year reunion, and in among the archetypes is Xavier, formerly known as Eugene, now a famous rock star and actor whose sole purpose seems to be to mess with the heads of the people with whom he went to school. (Dave Franco plays him with ample slime and ooze). But Xavier ends up falling to his death from the balcony of his beach-side mansion, where the reunion’s afterparty has been taking place. Cue the arrival of Danner and her sidekick Culp (Search Party’s John Early, underused in the early episodes), there to grill the attendees and work out whodunnit. The partygoers’ testimonies offer up a cinematic kaleidoscope of stories.  Like Stephen Merchant’s The Outlaws, this plays on the idea of each character being a well-known type. It opens with an extended episode on “adorkable loveboy” Aniq (Veep’s Sam Richardson), who designs escape rooms for a living. He is there to win back his mid-divorce high-school crush, “uptight artist girl” Zoë (Zoë Chao), who gets her own animated episode later. His episode is mostly rom-com, with a brief diversion into arthouse fare. But given that it has to establish the plot and style of the series, it has a lot of heavy lifting to do. It is busy with fun ideas and good performances, but lacking in pace. Even at 48 minutes, the opener feels far too long. It lacks the comedic punch to be truly funny and tries too hard to be funny to have dramatic heft. It cautiously puts one foot forward, then whips it back again. It was a wise move to launch this show with three episodes (the rest will follow weekly). Once it has set the scene, the instalments fall back to a more manageable and more flattering half-hour or so. Brett, Zoë’s ex-husband (Mindy Project alumnus Ike Barinholtz) gets his own action movie, which you could have guessed from the neckline on his leather jacket and his Matt Damon hair. The more bombastic scenes – car chases, handbrake turns, punchups with bouncers – are interspersed with his efforts to be a good dad, and it works surprisingly well. A literal pissing contest between him and Xavier hints at a surreal, slightly gross, very silly comedy that only appears sporadically. It could have benefited from more like this. The third episode stretches the show’s muscles again, giving Yasper (Parks and Rec’s Ben Schwartz) a musical in which he sings his feelings and gently mocks Hamilton’s My Shot with a song called Two Shots. It is all classy to a fault, but for all of its smart ideas, it doesn’t quite ignite. Each episode is an impressive achievement, in that it looks like a lot of work went into it, but I was left admiring that work, rather than immersed in the story. With all those stars, and the ability to borrow from every genre, it should zip along. Instead, it chooses to meander. Still, it is watchable, not least because we won’t find out who the culprit is until the final episode, and there’s a lot of fun to be had in guessing which genre each character will find themselves embroiled in. Stath Lets Flats’ Jamie Demetriou has a small role as running gag Walt, whom nobody can remember, and Broad City’s Ilana Glazer is Chelsea, the former queen bee who had “a total breakdown” and is acting erratically. This is enjoyable, steady, perfectly fine. But it is also classic prestige streaming service television, in that it is a little overdone, a little overlong and lacking the touch of ruthlessness that would have made it excellent.",Arts/Television & radio,The Afterparty review – Tiffany Haddish murder mystery doesn’t quite kill it,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/the-afterparty-review-apple-tv-tiffany-haddish
1/28/2022,"Liverpool are trying to beat Tottenham to the signing of the Porto winger Luis Díaz and are preparing an initial offer of about £37.5m. Their bid will include easily achievable add-ons of about another £15m and a further £4m or so in bonuses less likely to be paid. Díaz, a Colombia international with 31 caps, is one of the most exciting talents in Europe and has scored 14 goals in 18 league games this season. Porto rejected a £37.6m offer from Spurs this week for a player who has a £66m release clause.  On Thursday Tottenham suffered a transfer setback when Adama Traoré, one of Antonio Conte’s priority targets, agreed a move to Barcelona. It would be a further blow to their manager, who has repeatedly stressed the need for reinforcements, were Díaz to end up at Liverpool. The 25-year-old Díaz has twice played against Liverpool this season in the Champions League and is with Colombia for their World Cup qualifiers at home to Peru on Friday and away to Argentina on Tuesday. A medical would take place in South America to ensure a deal could be completed before Monday’s deadline.",Sport/Football,Liverpool aiming to beat Spurs in battle for Porto winger Luis Díaz,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/liverpool-aiming-beat-spurs-sign-luis-diaz-porto-winger
1/28/2022,"It’s been a busy transfer window for Tottenham Hotspur, in terms of effort if nothing else. They’ve been working to close deals for Wolves winger Adama Traoré and Porto trickster Luis Díaz, but it’s increasingly looking like the pair are making respective runs to Barcelona and Liverpool instead. What the Rumour Mill would give to be a fly on the wall when Antonio Conte runs into Daniel Levy in the canteen this morning. Tanguy Ndombele meanwhile is off to PSG, but if Spurs fans sense optimism whistling out of the exit door with him, there’s a smidgen of hope in the form of Bayern Munich keeper Alexander Nubel, who is being lined up to shadow Hugo Lloris. This isn’t helping, is it.  Wolves fans dismayed at the loss of Traoré will find succour in the news that Rúben Neves, currently on Arsenal and Manchester United’s radar, is staying put. Here’s a further blow for Mikel Arteta’s midfield, depending on which way you look at it: Granit Xhaka is off to Roma, where the red-card magnet will hopefully find some inner peace under the less combustible stewardship of José Mourinho. More bad news for Arsenal, to balance out the Spurs stuff at the top of the page: goalscoring target Dusan Vlahovic will soon be banging them in for Juventus, who have agreed a deal with Fiorentina for the best part of £63m. Armando Broja, fresh from giving Manchester City the runaround last weekend, is a target for West Ham, Leeds, Wolves and Everton. Southampton, who have dibs on him for the rest of the season before he returns to Chelsea, are interested too. West Ham also want Blackburn striker Ben Brereton Díaz, who on Wednesday night scored the sort of header for Chile against Argentina that would make Rovers legend Alan Shearer proud. The Hammers also have an eye on Liverpool defender Nat Phillips, as well as old boy Jesse Lingard, though he fancies a move to Newcastle. However, with Manchester United asking the freshly minted Toon for the earth, Lingard might end up at the London Stadium instead … or indeed Aston Villa, Leicester or Everton. Worth keeping an eye on this long-running saga, which if nothing else is likely to come to a satisfactory conclusion before Partygate.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Granit Xhaka to join Mourinho at Roma?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/football-transfer-rumours-xhaka-to-join-mourinho-at-roma-luis-diaz-to-liverpool
1/28/2022,"Following last weekend’s slate of thrillers, what does the NFL do for an encore this time around? Sunday’s two championship games have a lot to live up to but there are more than enough storylines swirling around the four remaining teams to ensure plenty of fireworks (quite literally when it comes to the Chiefs).  What the Bengals need to do to win: Everything perfectly. It all starts with quarterback Joe Burrow taking better care of the ball. Against the Tennessee Titans, Burrow was sacked nine times, tying a playoff record. Much of this was due to the porous offensive line – which will have to step up on Sunday – but some down to Burrow’s refusal to simply throw the ball away when under pressure. The Bengals beat the Chiefs 34-31 in the regular season, so they know they have a chance of an upset, but it won’t happen if Burrow can’t stay on his feet. What the Chiefs need to do to win: The defense needs to do better. Let’s be real: as entertaining as Bills-Chiefs was, Kansas City had to a) set up a game-tying field goal in the span of 13 seconds and b) win a coin toss to clinch the game in overtime. Their defense allowed 36 points against the Bills and they could be without safety Tyrann Mathieu, who suffered a head injury last Sunday. (He returned to practice on Thursday but his status for the Bengals game was still uncertain at time of writing.) Yes, the Bills were an extremely tough matchup, but Burrow and the Bengals are in the AFC title game for a reason. Key player: Patrick Mahomes, quarterback, Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes only came into the league in 2017, but he has already won a regular season MVP award and is looking to take his team to their third straight Super Bowl (where he also has been selected as an MVP). If we’re living in the golden age of NFL quarterbacks – and it’s difficult to argue we’re not – Mahomes is the perfect example of why. Prediction: Chiefs over Bengals. It’s easy to root for this Bengals team, especially if you are a little tired of seeing Kansas City win the AFC yet again. That doesn’t change the fact that the Bengals are the underdogs for a reason: the Bills were the biggest obstacle between the Chiefs and the Super Bowl and Joe Burrow and co should present less of a challenge. This could be a blowout early. What the 49ers need to do to win: They need to find a way to get the best out of their quarterbacks. Plural. The 49ers beat the Packers last weekend in spite of their signal-caller, not because of him. Jimmy Garoppolo looked determined to throw his second interception of the day late in Saturday’s game and it was telling that the season-changing play against the Green Bay Packers was a blocked punt returned for a touchdown. Garoppolo will start but don’t be surprised if the team runs a few plays for rookie Trey Lance in key spots, as they did occasionally throughout the season, particularly when the in-game situation calls for a more mobile quarterback. What the Rams need to do to win: Exploit the quarterback mismatch. Matthew Stafford is coming off a two-touchdown performance with 366 passing yards in the divisional round game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he comfortably outplayed Tom Brady. This time around, the starting QB on the other side is Brady’s former understudy. This is exactly why the Rams made the move to trade Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions for Stafford in the first place: with Goff this one would be a coin flip, but with their new big-armed QB, they’re favorites on merit. Player to watch: Cooper Kupp, wide receiver, Los Angeles Rams. He’s not the most famous receiver on the roster – that would probably be Odell Beckham Jr (who is currently playing for fairy dust) – but Kupp is definitely the Rams’ No 1 receiving option. During the regular season, he led the league in yards after the catch: 848 in total, ranking him above Deebo Samuel, his more versatile counterpoint on the opposing team. Prediction: Rams over 49ers. This one promises to be a much more competitive matchup than the AFC title game and an influx of Niners fans may ensure that the Rams do not even have much of a home-field advantage in LA. Ultimately, though, the 49ers needed the Packers to commit some heinous special teams blunders in order to squeak out a 13-10 victory, and it doesn’t feel like the Rams will be quite as accommodating.",Sport/Sport,NFL championship games picks: will Burrow and the Bengals shock Mahomes’ Chiefs?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/nfl-championship-games-picks-will-burrow-and-the-bengals-shock-mahomes-chiefs
