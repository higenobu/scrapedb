1/6/2022,"On Wednesday, the word on the street was that upwards of 11 Manchester United players wanted to leave the club, the reaction of fans being one of “good riddance”. Those reportedly most frustrated by the lack of changes under Ralf Rangnick include Jesse Lingard, Donny van de Beek, Dean Henderson and Eric Bailly. But who might replace them? Rúben Neves, one of the Wolves players to feature in Monday’s win at Old Trafford, has been linked with a move to Manchester for some time, and it may happen this summer. Dan-Axel Zagadou, a Borussia Dortmund defender available on a free this summer, is also a target. Neves appears to the be the priority, as a cure to the aching gap that is United’s midfield. They would really like to have him on board by the end of January.  Aston Villa are ambitious. That much was clear even before Dean Smith was shipped out in favour of Steven Gerrard. This month’s transfer market looks like being the latest demonstration of that ambition. There is a Liverpool theme to Stevie’s latest moves. There will be no dice on an attempt to sign Joe Gomez from his former club but Philippe Coutinho has been the recipient of a personal phone call from his one-time captain at Anfield. Getting Coutinho off the books is one of the first steps in the new Barcelona regime’s attempts to become the old Barcelona. Should he leave then Ferran Torres, signed last week, might actually be allowed to play. Sources close to Coutinho have been telling hacks that a host of Premier League clubs want to sign him. Keeping it Liverpool, the word is that they are prepared to lose the defender Nat Phillips and Divock Origi, the lucky charm super-sub who is out of contract. Origi is wanted by Lazio, and both players can leave in January, despite the club’s Covid crisis and inability to play Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi. Across Merseyside, the future of Lucas Digne remains up in the air. With Everton having bought two full-backs already in January, the Frenchman looks headed for Chelsea as a replacement for Ben Chilwell rather than Newcastle to pair up with Kieran Trippier, the expected new arrival on Tyneside. Instead, Newcastle are looking to Digne’s compatriot and another man on the Barcelona exit list, Samuel Umtiti, a World Cup winner no less. Aaron Ramsey is another on the unwanted list, with Juventus wanting to get rid of someone on a hefty wage and who doesn’t feature too much in the first team. Where might he end up? Newcastle seems a fair bet right now, with their financial fair play situation quite decent after Mike Ashley barely spent a penny. His wages of £325,000 a week would be prohibitive to many, but maybe not Newcastle. “Ramsey, he returned today after we had given him a few days off to work, to train separately, in England,” said Max Allegri, the Juve coach. “In any case, he’s an outgoing player.”",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Rúben Neves wanted by Manchester United?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/football-transfer-rumours-ruben-neves-wanted-by-manchester-united
1/6/2022," I saw this young palmate newt emerging on the evening of 1 January. Newts should be overwintering in leaf and log piles, compost heaps and other suitable refugia from November until late February or early March, when they start moving toward breeding pools. It is troubling to spot this individual within the overwintering period. The unseasonably warm weather fooled a great deal of species into early emergence: it places them in great peril if they expend energy in an attempt to feed out of season, burn fat reserves and expose themselves to short daylight hours and cold nights that could result in their deaths. Jonathan Davies, 32, certified passive house designer, St Fagans, Cardiff One of several daisies in my garden, photographed on New Year’s Day. I’ve never seen this before. The part of the garden where the daisy is growing doesn’t get much light as it’s shaded by a tall hedge to the south and west. Usually the grass is all that’s on show until much later (March). I’m curious about the early appearance of this species – we’ve seen butterflies very early in previous years, but never daisies. I don’t know what to think about this occurrence in relation to the health of the environment. We have had an exceptionally mild winter, the soil is not especially cold or hard, but the absence of activity in other species seems strange. Anonymous, Redlynch, Wiltshire This photo was taken in my garden on 29 December. Usually in winter the bees form a cluster around the queen while flexing their flight muscles, without beating their wings, to generate adequate heat. With minimal movement their stores of honey and nectar are usually sufficient till the weather warms up in spring. It’s mid-winter in Ireland and yet the bees are surprisingly busy and returning to the hives with pollen and nectar. It’s more like what one would expect in mid-spring at the earliest. This level of activity unfortunately leads the bees to use up their winter stores too quickly, and if late spring brings cold and frosty weather right into May (as happened here last year), then starvation becomes a serious threat to the bees. Of course, as beekeepers we can intervene by providing food for our bees to help them along. Unfortunately this can’t be done for bees of all kinds in the wild who are struggling to survive as the climate changes. All of this is concerning as pollinators of all kinds are in decline and this has huge negative implications for food production worldwide. Niall Keogh, retired teacher, Killarney, Ireland I took this photo while on a trip to Sissinghurst Castle in Kent on 2 January. I saw spring blossom on the trees, and bulbs coming through the ground. I was actually gobsmacked to see the spring blossom; I know it’s been mild for a few days, but didn’t expect to see the effects so soon and so quickly. I worry that these plants are gearing up too early, fooled by the mild air, which could result in failure to flower properly and could harm their reproduction chances when spring comes. Gary fowler, 50, project manager, Birchington, Kent This picture of a daffodil shoot was taken at a sheltered spot under a bay window in our front garden in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. I’d just been on my traditional New Year’s Day walk with friends in Sutton Park and I spotted these exceptional shoots of spring on our return. I was very surprised to see the shoots. I’ve never seen them this early; they usually appear in March. As an active member of our local Eco Sutton group, my surprise was undercut with a deep concern at what is happening to the environment in front of our eyes. Antony Whitehead, retired architect, Sutton Coldfield In the Duke’s Garden at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, we saw this bee, on 3 January, tucking into a winter flowering shrub. Snowdrops and narcissi were coming out last week, the magnolias are in bud, but a bee? Elsewhere in Kew we could see buds and catkins, much earlier than in previous years. Most walks in January see us muffled up against a biting chill, but today was very pleasant with a little sunshine. Last year, I recall seeing goslings in February on a snowy morning. So, yes, seeing a bee at this time is not normal, but it is part of a pattern. While any sign that the winter is coming to a close is welcome, the implication that this is evidence of climate change – a process which appears to be accelerating – is worrying. Tony Hutchinson, 67, working in social housing and regeneration, Brentford, London I planted some bulbs and seeds in pots on our terrace in November, and to my surprise they had already started sprouting by New Year’s Day. I suppose I was expecting them much later, perhaps in a few weeks at the earliest. The funny thing is I have no idea what I planted, so we’ll be looking out for a surprise display of flowers in a couple of months. I’m a bit worried they might not do so well if there’s a frost later in the month or in February. Vita Moltedo, 48, Islington, London On 28 December, I saw ducklings at Bingham’s Pond in the west end of Glasgow. Last year, the ducklings hatched in April. I was surprised to see so many in winter and worried that they might not survive due to lack of food and low temperatures. I wonder if it was the very mild weather that prompted the early laying and hatching. If the milder winter becomes more common, or the temperature drops later into winter, will it have an impact on duck and wild fowl numbers? Hopefully she’ll have another clutch in the spring anyway.

1/6/2022,"“Security. Prosperity. Respect.” Keir Starmer appeared in Birmingham on Tuesday to lay out his offer to the country. It is always, if you care about the Labour party, nerve-racking to hear its leader make an account of its core values, though nothing will ever match the dispiriting moment before the 2015 leadership election, when it named one of its core values as “having strong values”. Shelving, very briefly, the question of who is and who isn’t centrist enough for the country, values are like an octave, or a deck of cards: they are fixed in number, at least the acceptable ones; they are always the same. “Another C sharp, another jack of diamonds,” you think. “Big wow.” It’s only once you’re in the middle of a game that any of them become precious or meaningful, and for far too long the Conservatives have been writing the rules. “Labour values” such as equality were effortlessly lifted, to become “levelling up”. The progressive party flailed to adapt – what next, are we all leveller uppers now? Do we level down? – not realising that the rules were always changing, and now jokers were wild in play too. The way to win against the Conservatives was not to find better, different, newer, or more traditional, or more decisive, or more interpretable values. It was to divest the Conservatives of the legitimacy of their rulebook.  So Starmer’s offer in this speech was more of a placeholder: he vowed that “if we work hard, we should have a right to job security”. I would have preferred a more radical promise, that if we work hard, we should be relatively confident that we can feed and house ourselves, then a side order of support if by circumstance we can’t work hard. He asserted, too, that “everybody has a right to be valued for who we are and what we do”. It’s a laudable idea but quite hard to measure. Yet if you connect those two thoughts – we have workplace rights, and we all have value – it represents a significant break with the last 12 years of economic reality and political discourse. The transfer of power from the worker to the employer that, with zero-hours contracts and poverty wages, has seemed inexorable, would not survive this meaningful reassertion of workplace rights. And the many cruelties of austerity have only endured this long thanks to the underpinning narrative that hardship was self-inflicted and that some (millions of) people simply had less value than others. This is an optimistic interpretation of the speech; the counterpoint, that it simply didn’t say enough about Labour’s policy intentions, is also fair. Its driving purpose was to establish the party as the dynamic vessel of, rather than a moaning participant in, anti-Conservative feeling. Boris Johnson’s critique of his opposite number has, of course, always been that he’s a lawyer – combining the insults boring, technical, elitist, an observer rather than an actor, “Captain Hindsight”. Starmer’s speech, perhaps for the first time since he became leader, performed a jujitsu move: yes he is a lawyer, and Johnson could have at it. He conveyed this explicitly, his patriotism mediated through his hinterland as the “country’s leading prosecutor”. He also did so implicitly, framing his relationship with voters as a “contract” – about as lawyerly as it comes. And he laid a very simple, yet nevertheless lawyerly trap for Johnson: the prime minister himself is unfit for office, yet the problem is with the entire party, not just one man. The Conservatives care so little about the country that they’re “gearing up for a leadership fight” precisely when we most need stability. It was a systematic, rather obvious, block of each exit: they can’t keep Johnson because he’s bent; another candidate won’t stop the rot, because the party is spent; if they ignore the problem and forge on with their leader, it will merely be a depressing illustration that “they’ve been in power too long”; if they try to replace him, they indicate their lack of seriousness and civic duty. These points lay out a foundational principle, without which Labour will always be on the back foot: the Conservative rulebook is no longer legitimate. Later the same day, Johnson gave a press conference of his own, in a move that cynics, which is now all of us, read as attempting to draw attention away from Starmer’s speech. Problematically for Johnson, that press conference was drivel: repetitive, chaotic, and largely devoid of substance. Any that there was, was immediately contradicted by the look on the face of the man (Chris Whitty) standing right next to him. Johnson is getting to a place where, every time he opens his mouth, he makes his opponent’s point for him. Lawyers, huh?

1/6/2022,"It’s been 10 years since Steven Bartlett unsuccessfully applied to be a contestant on Dragons’ Den. Since then a lot has changed. The school dropout, who once stole food from corner shops and foraged for loose change to keep his hunger at bay, went on to start his own company from his bedroom and was a millionaire by age 23. Bartlett will be the youngest ever investor – or “Dragon” – on the BBC’s hit series when it returns on Thursday. But pay attention and you’ll see him everywhere – whether it’s debates on daytime television, motivational quotes on Instagram or on his podcast, the Diary of a CEO, which has consistently topped business charts for the past year.  Joining the show is a privilege and a responsibility for Bartlett, who hopes young people from less privileged backgrounds like his, especially minorities who don’t always see themselves reflected in certain programmes or industries, will feel enabled. “Dragons’ Den was the only window I had into business from 12 years old,” he said. “It’s like the first time you go to New York City after seeing it in films for your entire life. But I understand what I bring. A new perspective from a new era of business. “I feel a responsibility because there’s never been a black, young Dragon on the show. The most powerful role models, of course, are those that are most relatable.” Bartlett was born in Botswana to a Nigerian mum and a British dad. His mum left school aged seven and can’t read or write, his dad was a structural engineer and “very, very smart”. The family (he is the youngest of four siblings) moved to Plymouth, Devon, where they “struggled financially in a nice, white, middle-class area”, something he expands upon in his bestselling book, Happy Sexy Millionaire. That feeling of otherness, of not having “the nice things other people had”, drove him. “I learned that if I was to have anything, it wasn’t going to be left for me under the Christmas tree, it was going to be a direct consequence of my own actions.” He was an insecure boy who struggled in school, barely scraping through GCSEs and A-levels. His attention, he says, was focused elsewhere – from organising school trips to brokering deals with vending machine companies and taking a cut. It was clear from a young age that his interest and talents lay in the world of entrepreneurship. So it wasn’t entirely surprising that he dropped out of his course in business management at Manchester Metropolitan University after just one lecture. He says he looked around the room, full of hungover students and a lecturer handing out felt-tip pens, and “realised this wasn’t going to take me to where I needed to go”. He has vociferous opinions of the education system, which he calls a “propped up scam” held together by a number of stakeholders, none of which are incentivised to help young people nurture their talents and work towards what they’re good at. “You’ve got the employment world that requires a 2:2 for jobs. You’ve got the university who are getting paid to drag you in and keep costs low, and then you’ve got the schools, which are ranked by grades. It’s an archaic system that hasn’t moved with the modern world fast enough. Information is almost redundant by the time universities publish their textbooks. There’s probably not that many that have been written about blockchain, but we know it’s a pivotal part of our future.” Bartlett’s first proper registered business at 18 years old – a marketing agency called Social Chain – now valued at $600m. He talks much of the importance of following your internal voice and knowing your purpose, a thread that runs through the work of contemporary self-help gurus, including his most recent podcast guest, Jordan Peterson. “I’m really bad at doing things I don’t want to do. If you’re fortunate and take the right steps, that culminates in a life where you’re doing a lot of things you do want to do.” This explains why he left Social Chain in 2020 to pursue new projects, including Thirdweb, a company that creates blockchain-based applications, and Flight Story, a marketing platform. In the latter part of last year, he was also listed as number six in the UK’s black power list alongside Marcus Rashford and Michaela Coel. “Quitting has been demonised in our society. It’s associated with being weak. But it’s the incredibly important thing you have to do before you start the next thing.” His key advice for creating a successful business is being unromantic about your hypothesis. After all, Jeff Bezos originally looked to create an online bookstore. This, and other lessons about business life, were imparted through interviewing other entrepreneurs and business leaders. Though he imagined they’d be incredibly unique, he says he discovered that most of his guests are actually very similar. “They’re all affected by the same anxieties. One thing that happened to them on the playground might steer the course of their life. Sometimes your curses become your blessings and vice versa. Most of the time, having a really shitty childhood is the reason why my guests end up being really remarkable people in their later life.”",Arts/Television & radio,How Steven Bartlett went from dropout to youngest ever Dragons’ Den investor,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/06/how-steven-bartlett-went-from-dropout-to-youngest-ever-dragons-den-investor
