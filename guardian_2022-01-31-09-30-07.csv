1/31/2022,"Spotify is adding a message that will direct listeners to correct Covid-19 information as controversy over misinformation shared on Joe Rogan’s podcast continues to grow, with the streamer losing billions in market value and more musicians withdrawing their music. On Sunday, the CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, released an official statement setting out the streaming platform’s plan to tackle misinformation. New content advisories will direct listeners of any podcast that discusses coronavirus to a dedicated website that “provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources”.  Spotify’s rules for its creators have also been made public for the first time, with users told they cannot publish “content that promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health”. Examples include calling Covid “a hoax or not real” or “encouraging people to purposely get infected with Covid-19 in order to build immunity to it”. Users who break the rule could see their content removed from the platform and repeat offenders could be suspended or banned. “You’ve had a lot of questions over the last few days about our platform policies and the lines we have drawn between what is acceptable and what is not. We have had rules in place for many years but admittedly, we haven’t been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,” Ek’s statement said. Ek wrote that the content advisories will roll out “around the world in the coming days.” “To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform,” he added. Rogan, a comedian and host of The Joe Rogan Experience, has sparked controversy for repeatedly spreading misinformation about Covid on his show, including the conspiracy theory that hospitals are financially incentivised to record Covid as cause of death. He has also promoted the use of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic treatment used mainly on animals, to treat Covid symptoms. It has not been proved to be effective at preventing or treating Covid. Last week, musician Neil Young asked his management to remove his music from Spotify, citing misinformation on Rogan’s podcast: “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading false information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them … They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” After removing his music, Spotify said it regretted “Neil’s decision … but hope to welcome him back soon”. Their shares dropped 6% over two days, then recovered slightly – before musician Joni Mitchell announced she would also remove her music from the platform. “Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives,” Mitchell wrote. “I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.” Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who signed a multi-year podcast partnership with Spotify for their company, Archewell Audio, said in a statement that they had expressed concerns about misinformation to Spotify last year. “We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis. We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does,” a spokesperson for the couple said. As of Sunday, Spotify had lost more than US$2bn (£1.5bn) in market value and removed more than 20,000 episodes of podcasts that were related to Covid-19, in accordance with its “detailed content policies”. Calls on social media for people to cancel their Spotify subscriptions have intensified over the last week. The company has not disclosed how many users have left, but a message from its customer support team to subscribers said they were “getting a lot of contacts so may be slow to respond”. Spotify acquired Rogan’s show in 2020, in a deal worth more than $100m. The Joe Rogan Experience is now Spotify’s most popular podcast and one of the biggest in the world.",News/Technology,Spotify to direct listeners to correct Covid information after Joe Rogan controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/31/spotify-to-direct-listeners-to-correct-covid-information-after-joe-rogan-controversy
1/31/2022,"A coalition of women’s rights organisations has called on the UK government to abolish a law that gives courts the power to send people to prison for their own protection, as part of a 10-point plan to tackle inequalities in the criminal justice system. On the fifth anniversary of the Lammy Review, leading women’s rights groups have derided the “lack of progress” in tackling persistent inequalities experienced by black, Asian, minority ethnic and migrant women in the criminal justice system.  The coalition warned that these women faced the “double disadvantage” of gender inequality and racism when they encountered the criminal justice system, which prevented them getting the support they needed and left them at risk of reoffending. The coalition of organisations, including Hibiscus, Muslim Women in Prison, the Zahid Mubarek Trust, Agenda, Criminal Justice Alliance and Women in Prison, presented the government with the action plan. As well as abolishing the law that gives courts the power to send people to prison for their own protection, the coalition demands practical changes to training, recruitment and external scrutiny. It also calls on the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to analyse and publish data on racial disparities in women’s contact with the criminal justice system. In 2018, the government published the Female Offender Strategy, which made a public commitment to tackle racial disparity, but the coalition argues it does not go far enough to meet the needs of BAME and migrant women. Amina, 27, who served a prison sentence, said: “My faith is really important to me and it’s the one thing that got me through my prison sentence but from what I saw the officers had no understanding of what being a Muslim means. “They only know the negative picture the media paints. For the first three months of my sentence, I had to pray on a towel because nobody gave me a prayer mat even though officers saw me pray on the towel. Another one of the girls had to fight my corner and get me one.” Ivory, 35, a woman supported by Hibiscus, an organisation working with BAME and migrant women at the intersection of the immigration and criminal justice, said: “In prison there is a lot of discrimination and racism against black and Asian women because of how we look and the colour of our skin. The way staff address white people is different, and I suffered bullying because of this. “This is an important issue that needs to be urgently looked into and changed.” Marchu Girma, the chief executive of Hibiscus, said: “Currently there are unacceptable levels of inequalities in the criminal justice system, that result in many black, Asian, minoritised and migrant women suffering. I am certain these inequalities are not mountains that cannot be moved.” Indy Cross, the chief executive of Agenda, an alliance for women and girls at risk, said: “It’s a national shame that the criminal justice system consistently fails so many black, Asian, minoritised, and migrant women. The double disadvantage of structural racism and gender inequality in the criminal justice system must be tackled.” The MoJ has been contacted for comment.",News/Law,Women’s groups seek end to UK courts’ powers to jail people for own protection,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/31/womens-rights-groups-seek-end-uk-courts-powers-jail-people-own-protection
1/31/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced plans for legislation to make it easier to rip up EU regulations and protections, amid criticism from Conservative MPs that the government has not taken sufficient advantage of Brexit. The plans claim to cut £1bn in red tape expenses for businesses, but Johnson gave no firm details on which regulations are intended to be repealed or enhanced, instead stating five principles that would be applied, including the value of sovereignty and creating new markets.  Critics said Johnson must make clear whether he intends to target employment protections, and pointed out that businesses and government have already faced billions of pounds of costs as a result of additional red tape due to Brexit itself. Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for business, said: “If this is the best Boris Johnson can muster up to save his job, then he is in big trouble. Try telling the thousands of lorry drivers stuck in queues at Dover that red tape is being cut.” A Labour source said: “The key question for the government is which of the proposed changes in regulation depend on the passage of this bill, and if the answer is none, what other changes are they planning that do? Until they can explain all that, we have to ask what the point of this bill is.” Johnson, who is battling to prevent a no confidence vote in the wake of multiple revelations of lockdown parties in Downing Street, has been criticised in private meetings with MPs that the government has not demonstrated how it is taking advantage of perceived post-Brexit freedoms. The new law – called the “Brexit freedoms” bill – is intended to make it easier to amend or remove some of the bridging law kept on the statute book after Brexit. No 10 said that, as it stands, much of that regulation would require primary legislation to remove it, and the new bill could shortcut that process. Downing Street said it would release a public catalogue of all retained EU laws to determine if they are beneficial to the UK. In a statement announcing the new bill, two years after Britain’s exit from the bloc, Johnson said: “Getting Brexit done two years ago today was a truly historic moment and the start of an exciting new chapter for our country. The plans we have set out today will further unleash the benefits of Brexit and ensure that businesses can spend more of their money investing, innovating and creating jobs.” “Our new Brexit freedoms bill will end the special status of EU law in our legal framework and ensure that we can more easily amend or remove outdated EU law in future.” The attorney general, Suella Braverman, said it was right that there was new scrutiny of the laws. “We can move away from outdated EU laws that were the result of unsatisfactory compromises within the EU, some of which the UK voted and lobbied against – but was required to adopt without question,” she said. “These rules often had limited meaningful parliamentary scrutiny and no democratic legitimacy in the UK at all. It is vital that we take the steps necessary, in this parliament, to remove unnecessary rules altogether, and where regulation is needed, ensure that it meets the UK’s objectives.” The government will also publish a new riposte to critics who claim little advantage of Brexit has been taken, with a new document titled The Benefits of Brexit: How the UK Is Taking Advantage of Leaving the EU. It will claim that reforms have led to a more agile digital and AI sector and a less burdensome data rights regime compared with the EU’s GDPR. It will also claim that there have been benefits in changing clinical trials, strengthening environmental protections and establishing a domestic subsidy regime. Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said the government was not taking advantage of one key aspect of leaving the EU – that it can cut VAT on energy bills, as Labour has been demanding. “The British public overwhelmingly support Labour’s proposed change, and it is time the government started listening,” she said.",News/Politics,Government plans to ‘cut £1bn in red tape’ with new post-Brexit legislation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/government-plans-to-cut-1bn-in-red-tape-with-new-post-brexit-legislation
1/31/2022,"No single word can encapsulate Manipulate. The festival’s mix of animation, physical theatre and puppetry defies easy categorisation. The organisation itself opts for “visually led work”. On the strength of this year’s opening weekend, you could also call it a celebration of making something out of nothing. No more so is this the case than in Acqua Alta by the French duo Adrien M & Claire B. Around a boardroom table, they have arranged a set of large books, opened to reveal pen-and-ink scribbles and simple pop-up structures. Ordinarily, you wouldn’t give them a second look.  Only when you open the app on your phone do you make sense of them. Thanks to augmented-reality technology, the pages become miniature stage sets. Skipping around a flat-roofed house is a squabbling couple, inky black figures moving with balletic grace. Their argument ends as the rain starts. To see what happens next, you move to the next open book. Taking its name from the periodic flooding of Venice, Acqua Alta follows the couple as they are torn apart by rising waters, the man switching from a tiny swimmer lost at sea to an enormous figure, reaching for his partner’s hair as it morphs into a sea anemone. All the while, the room remains unchanged. It is as if we had imagined it. This is also true of Fauna, by the same team, a series of posters of dramatic landscapes – craters, cliffs, waterfalls – from which scores of amorphous black creatures emerge. Escaping into Summerhall’s corridors, they are comic and cute – and visible only to those in the know. Along the road in the Festival theatre’s Studio, two one-off performances also play on the imagination. The Chosen Haram elevates a routine boy-meets-boy love story into something dream-like thanks to the circus skills of a weightless Sadiq Ali and Hauk Pattison. Ali’s first full-length show has visual flair to match its technical prowess, even if his intriguing themes about Islam and sexuality are underexplored. In After Metamorphosis, Lewis Sherlock embodies Franz Kafka’s Gregor Samsa, his twitches and convulsions matched by the repeating phrases of Ali Maloney’s narration. With its pummelling techno soundtrack, the physical-theatre show makes up in intensity what it lacks in subtlety. Manipulate festival is at Summerhall and the Studio, Festival theatre, Edinburgh, until 5 February. The Chosen Haram is at Jacksons Lane, London, 4-6 February.",Arts/Stage,Manipulate festival review – a wealth of delights for the imagination,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/manipulate-festival-review-summerhall-studio-festival-theatre-edinburgh
1/31/2022,"Hundreds of workers at NHS hospitals in London including porters, cleaners and catering staff are to go on strike from Monday in a dispute over pay. The staff employed by the outsourcing company Serco at St Bartholomew’s, the Royal London and Whipps Cross are walking out for two weeks.  They are members of the Unite union, which claims that mainly black, Asian and ethnic minority staff are paid up to 15% less than directly employed NHS workers.Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said: “The NHS workers taking strike action have their union’s unwavering support. They face the same risks as NHS-employed staff. Why on earth are they being paid significantly worse while being treated disgracefully? “It’s time to end this injustice. It’s time to bring these workers, employed by Serco not the NHS, back into NHS employment.” Rallies are planned outside the Royal London hospital on Monday and later in the week at Barts and Whipps Cross. Peter Kavanagh, a regional secretary for Unite, said: “Our members have worked tirelessly through the pandemic, they deserve better. Serco and Barts need to deliver a pay increase that addresses the poor pay and the inequality of treatment compared to directly employed NHS staff at other hospitals in London.” Shane DeGaris, the deputy group chief executive at Barts Health NHS trust, said the trust would be considering future arrangements of the facilities management contract over the next 13 months, and that this could include bringing some services back in-house. He added: “We are hopeful that this matter can be resolved but are working with Serco to put the appropriate measures in place and ensure hospital services are supported if strike action does go ahead.” Taddy McAuley, Serco’s contract director for Barts Health, said the company hoped to work with Unite to avoid the “unnecessary” action. “We are extremely disappointed with the notification of strike action from Unite as we recently increased the pay offer for our employees to a total of 3%, backdated to April 2021,” he said. “This is the same percentage increase as that being received by people directly employed by the NHS. “Serco also recently announced a £100 ex gratia payment for all of our 52,000 frontline employees around the world, including all our colleagues at Barts Health.” Meanwhile, families planning half-term getaways face having their travel plans disrupted by a three-day strike by baggage handlers and aircraft refuellers at Heathrow airport. About 400 Unite members employed by Menzies Aviation will begin their walkout at 00.01am on 11 February, resuming work on 14 February. Unite says the company is refusing to enter into negotiations about a pay rise after firing and rehiring hundreds of workers during the pandemic. Menzies said it was disappointed by the action and hopeful that an amicable solution could be reached at a meeting with Unite scheduled for Monday. It also expressed confidence there would be no disruption to travellers should the strike go ahead.",News/Society,Porters and cleaners at London NHS hospitals begin two-week strike,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/porters-cleaners-london-nhs-hospitals-two-week-strike-barts-royal-london-whipps-cross-serco
1/31/2022,"When Melvin Van Peebles died last autumn, he was rightly remembered as a firebrand film-maker and the godfather of blaxploitation and independent cinema. His stage career as a theatre director, playwright, composer and lyricist is less well documented – mind you, so are his other lives as a novelist, painter and Wall Street trader. In 1971, in the wake of his explosively successful low-budget film Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, Van Peebles made his Broadway debut with a “ghetto-life” musical, Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death. He wrote its music, book and lyrics and the following year, ever the multi-hyphenate, he did the same for a second Broadway musical, Don’t Play Us Cheap. But this time he also produced and directed. The two shows ran concurrently in the summer of 1972, and that year he released a film version of Don’t Play Us Cheap starring the original Broadway cast. It’s now available in a Blu-ray Van Peebles box set from Criterion.  Anyone who only knows Van Peebles for the brutal and bleak Sweetback may be surprised by the abundant warmth of Don’t Play Us Cheap, and also by its sheer goofiness. This is a musical with a prologue told by actors dressed up as a rat and a cockroach and a plot that finds two “devil bats” visiting Harlem and assuming human form to wreck a house party. But against this wacky backdrop, Van Peebles presents a close-knit circle of friends and family: “brothers and sisters getting their groove on” as the intro has it, which brings to mind how the opening sequence for Sweetback listed the main stars as “the black community”. Sweetback’s tale of a hustler on the run was propelled by a jazz-funk score by Earth, Wind and Fire (released on Stax Records) and by Van Peebles’ own defiant musical refrain: “They bled your momma. They bled your poppa. Won’t bleed me.” Don’t Play Us Cheap has a stirring and more expansive mix of R&B, soul, jazz, doo-wop and blues. These songs are not used to move along plot or fill out characterisation in a traditional sense. Instead they collectively form a portrait of the time and place: a Saturday night in Harlem in the early 70s, where Earnestine (Rhetta Hughes) is celebrating her 20th birthday. Unlike musicals whose characters break seamlessly from book into song, Van Peebles has his characters directly discuss the tunes that form the soundtrack. We even see them selecting and spinning the records we hear – an act that invites us to listen more carefully to the lyrics. The film comes alive when Mrs Washington (played by Joshie Jo Armstead, a former Ikette turned soloist and songwriter) hears the opening bars to You Cut Up the Clothes in the Closet of My Dreams. “Ooh that’s it! That’s my song,” she declares, pouring herself a drink and rising from the sofa to deliver the ballad of heartbreak and recovery. Van Peebles gradually frames her in a tight close-up, the other house guests serving first as her audience and then as her chorus of backing singers. “I’m moving on” is a recurring line in that song and in the film itself, which is a hymn to endurance and going high, and celebrates a carefree night when you put the week’s work behind you, forget your worries and simply savour the next dish coming out of the kitchen. Van Peebles tells this tale of a circle of intergenerational family and friends through styles such as gospel and soul that are equally closely related. And the bonds of music are shown to be unbreakable: literally so when Joe Keyes Jr, as Trinity, sits on a pile of records but they don’t snap. Trinity is one of the devil bats who flap into this party with the same tricksy visual effects such as distortion and superimposition that Van Peebles used in Sweetback. But Esther Rolle, as the matriarch Miss Maybell, is hardly freaked out to find Trinity – clad in black and red, with cape and jutting lapels – in her apartment. And in a hot minute Earnestine has fallen for him. If there’s little chemistry between Hughes and Keyes Jr, Rolle has loving wisdom to spare and Miss Maybell gives the film its heart. Earthly ills from jealousy and suspicion to snobbery and hypocrisy are denounced while she exudes a generosity of spirit. “Everybody falls sometimes,” she observes. “The trick is to get back up.” Despite the bats’ best efforts to ruin it, the spirit of the party – just like those records – is unbreakable. After the arrival of another suitor along with a second devil bat named David, there’s not much more plot to bother with. Van Peebles’ film has the disjointed feel of a real party – a carousel of distractions and interruptions, snippets of conversation and jokes. It’s punctuated with rollicking piano lines, call-and-response, hand claps and dance routines that are authentic rather than overly choreographed. But if the feel is largely celebratory, and the whole bat plot fantastical, the story is also grounded in social commentary and politics: our rat host asks “are you hip to injustice?” in the prologue, Miss Maybell reflects on the “lying and killing” in the world beyond her triple-locked front door, and on her wall are photos of Malcolm X and of Martin Luther King whose assassinations were still reverberating in early-70s America. The apartment is filled with photos of other African American icons such as Isaac Hayes, on the album cover of Black Moses, and Van Peebles himself, on the cover of his LP As Serious As a Heart-Attack. Don’t Play Us Cheap earned Van Peebles a Tony nomination for best book and also brought actor Avon Long a nomination for his performance as David. The show ran for 164 performances; Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death managed almost double that number. But it would be years until Van Peebles directed or wrote another major film or stage musical. None of his four theatre productions have had a Broadway revival although there are plans to bring back Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death this year, with Van Peebles’ son Mario involved. But Don’t Play Us Cheap, even with the film’s dated visual effects and uneven comedy, is an irresistible soul-saver of a musical. It deserves its own 50th birthday party on stage.",Arts/Stage,‘Brothers and sisters getting their groove on’: Melvin Van Peebles’ house-party musical ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/melvin-van-peebles-dont-play-us-cheap-lost-house-party-musical
1/31/2022,"Young people who lost their jobs during the pandemic in the UK have returned to less secure work, often in gig economy roles, according to research from a leading thinktank, which also found almost 50,000 more men under the age of 24 are now economically inactive. A report by the Resolution Foundation published on Monday found young people had returned to work rapidly in late 2021, with unemployment now slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels, but a third of the 18- to 34-year-olds back in the workplace were now in atypical, insecure work.  The young “returners” – those who were employed pre-Covid but became unemployed in the pandemic – were now much more likely than those who stayed in work to be on a temporary or zero-hours contract, or doing agency work or unsteady hours. Thirty-three per cent of the returners, among 6,100 people surveyed by YouGov for the study, were now in such roles, compared with 12% of those who had stayed in work throughout the pandemic. While the thinktank said the furlough scheme had been a success in limiting youth unemployment, joblessness during the pandemic nonetheless had blighted future employment and pay prospects, as well as the mental health, of many. Although the youth unemployment rate decreased from 10.5% to 9.8% from spring 2020 to autumn 2021, the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who are economically inactive and not in full-time education, known as Neets, rose by 75,000 last year – with young men accounting for more than 60% of the increase, the report said. Researchers found about two-thirds of those who lost work reported mental health problems. The thinktank said policymakers should not be led into complacency by the headline unemployment figures, and needed to focus on tackling insecure work. Louise Murphy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation and author of the report, said: “One in three young people who experienced worklessness during the last lockdown have returned to atypical contracts, which often means insecure work. The fact that they are more likely to be looking for new or additional work suggests higher dissatisfaction with their current jobs. “And while unemployment has fallen, the number of young people dropping out of education and the labour market altogether has risen – especially young men. “A return to the workplace, on its own, is not enough. Ensuring that young people have the confidence and knowledge to find and apply for work, and access to good quality jobs and sufficient hours, must be a priority for employers and policymakers in the months and years to come.”",News/Business,Young people who lost jobs in pandemic in UK ‘returning to insecure work’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/young-people-lost-jobs-pandemic-uk-returning-insecure-work-resolution-foundation
1/31/2022,"More airline passengers on UK domestic flights could receive compensation for delays and have simpler access to resolve claims under government proposals announced on Monday. Passengers would have the right to a partial refund of their fare after a one-hour delay instead of the current three-hour minimum – rising to 50% after two and a full refund after waiting three hours.  However, the system could see many people receive less money than before. Under EU regulations, which Britain has retained after Brexit, passengers are entitled to at least a £220 payout after three hours’ delay. The Department for Transport said that the new model, based on the way rail and ferry operators offer compensation for delays, would be a significant shift and fairer. Budget airlines have argued that the levels of compensation often outstrip the fare. Airlines often do not pay compensation when delays are deemed beyond their control, for example due to extreme weather, security alerts or air traffic strikes. The government may also force all airlines to be part of the aviation industry’s alternative dispute resolution [ADR] scheme, which allows passengers to escalate complaints if they feel they have not been settled, without recourse to legal action. Currently membership is on a voluntary basis. Ryanair quit the scheme in 2019. The UK’s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, would also have increased powers to enforce consumer protection law and fine airlines directly for breaches. Richard Moriarty, the CAA’s chief executive, said the consultation was “a clear indication of the need to enhance our enforcement powers, and bring us in line with other regulators”. Airlines could also be made to pay full compensation to wheelchair or mobility scooter users for any damage caused to their device in flight. Current liability under the Montreal convention is capped at about £1,200, far below the potential cost of repairs or replacement. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the proposals “aimed to bolster airline consumer protections and rights” and would “help build a trustworthy, reputable sector”. Airlines UK, which represents a wide range of airlines including regional and domestic carriers, said it would “look forward to responding to the consultation [and] the sector’s eventual recovery from Covid”. In a sign of the airline industry’s revival, easyJet said it expects to recruit 1,000 cadet pilots over the next five years and has relaunched its training programme. The airline is to focus on attracting diverse candidates – an advertising campaign features a parent, a former gymnast and a DJ who now work as easyJet pilots. Only around 6% of pilots worldwide are women, although easyJet has doubled the number of female pilots in its ranks since starting a recruitment drive in schools in 2015. Johan Lundgren, the airline’s chief executive, said: “Whilst we have made progress, there is still work to do. Increasing diversity in all of its forms in the flight deck is a long-term focus for easyJet and so we will continue to ensure we lead the industry on this issue.” Both easyJet and British Airways are also looking to recruit thousands of cabin crew for summer 2022. EasyJet said in November it would need about 1,500 seasonal crew. BA said in October it would look to rehire former staff as it ramps up operations for a new Gatwick subsidiary, after laying off thousands of crew at the start of the pandemic.",News/Business,UK proposes changes to compensation for domestic flight delays,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/uk-proposes-changes-to-compensation-for-domestic-flight-delays
1/31/2022,"Up to a million women are at risk of being harmed by gambling, according to a study that found that traffic to online casino and bingo sites popular with women peaks in the winter months. While gambling addicts are disproportionately male, the number of women seeking treatment has doubled in the past five years, up from 1,134 in 2015-16 to 2,423 in 2020-21.  But the great majority of them do not seek treatment, according to the gambling charity GambleAware, with two in five unwilling to do so due to stigma and embarrassment. Women often avoid seeking help despite being more likely than men to report mental health difficulties caused by gambling, such as stress or anxiety, GambleAware found. The rise in female gambling addiction has previously been attributed to the ease with which women can now access casino games and betting on smartphones, rather than needing to access traditionally male-dominated environments such as bookmakers. According to a study that GambleAware will publish later this year, 1 million women are now deemed to be at risk of suffering harm, with the danger particularly acute during winter. Visits to gambling websites with a majority female customer base – such as online bingo – typically rise by 29% between December and March, the charity said. The charity is responding with an advertising campaign, launching today, which highlights warning signs such as losing track of time, spending unaffordable sums and hiding gambling from friends and family. Jemima, whose name has been changed at her request, said her online gambling escalated when she became a mother and found her support networks lacking. “I became a mum at a young age, and that’s when I found online gambling. I saw it as my ‘me’ time – time to close off from the world around me,” she said. “I could do it anywhere – standing in the supermarket queue, waiting for my son to come out of school. I never switched off. Being women who gamble, we do sometimes face a unique stigma – especially in this day and age when you’re expected to do it all. It’s incredibly helpful to see more and more women coming forward to share their stories, and I hope it will help empower others to do the same.” Liz Karter, a leading UK expert in gambling addiction in women and a gambling addiction counsellor, said: “Gambling behaviours manifest themselves differently in women than men. For example, we know the easy availability of online gambling leads many women to games which appear innocent and socially acceptable. The games seem safe and familiar, as they are so similar to the free-play digital games we are all now used to playing. In addition, the hopes of financial gains can prove a powerful motivator.” The government is expected to publish proposals to tighten up gambling regulation within the next two months, amid mounting calls for a tougher regime. Anyone concerned about their gambling, or that of a loved one, can visit BeGambleAware.org for free, confidential advice and support.

1/31/2022,"Boris Johnson will attempt to seize back control of the government agenda this week with a policy blitz, a Brexit bill and flying visit to Ukraine, as Westminster remains in the grip of paralysis over the Sue Gray and police inquiries into No 10 parties. Amid frustration in No 10 at the uncertainty surrounding the report on rule-breaking parties in Downing Street, sources said Johnson was determined to deflect public outrage with a schedule of high-profile announcements and photo opportunities that he also hopes will show MPs he remains focused.  On Monday, Johnson is announcing plans for legislation to make it easier to rip up EU regulations and protections, after criticism from Conservative MPs that the government has not taken sufficient advantage of Brexit. He is also expected to visit Ukraine with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, early this week, and the levelling-up white paper is scheduled for publication on Wednesday. Whitehall sources said they also expected developments this week on help for families struggling with the cost of energy bills, after the prime minister and the chancellor definitively ruled out cancelling the national insurance rise and cutting VAT on energy bills. Johnson could receive the long-awaited report on lockdown breaches in No 10 as soon as Monday, after which he is expected to give an immediate statement to MPs. Scotland Yard’s special inquiries team will this week scour evidence of lockdown-breaking by Johnson’s aides sent to them by the Gray inquiry. Detectives received the information from the Cabinet Office on Friday and police chiefs have been stung by fierce and widespread criticism after pressing for Gray’s report to give only “minimal reference” to the gatherings under investigation. Those are believed to be the most clear-cut breaches of the lockdown rules, and probably the most politically dangerous for Johnson. The police request caused widespread fury in Westminster and the report’s contents are expected to be significantly weakened. The Met was unable to say on Sunday when it will start to write to those identified by Gray as having potentially breached lockdown rules. They will be asked if they have a reasonable excuse and then police will decide whether they should face a fine. Cabinet Office sources said on Sunday night that they were still in discussion with the Met. Opposition parties have been discussing what can be done to force the publication of a full version of the report, which is now only likely after a police inquiry has been completed. Johnson, who spent the weekend at his Chequers residence, is said to have been struck by MPs’ criticism that the government has been unable to communicate the benefits of Brexit. On Sunday night he unveiled plans for a new law – called the “Brexit freedoms” bill – intended to make it easier to amend or remove some of the bridging law kept on the statute book after Brexit. No 10 said that, as it stands, much of that regulation would require primary legislation to remove it, and the new bill could sidestep that process. Critics said Johnson must make clear whether he intends to target employment protections, and pointed out that businesses and government have already faced billions of pounds of costs as a result of additional red tape due to Brexit itself. Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for business, said: “This odd announcement raises questions about what kind of environmental rules, data protections and workers rights this government may look to water down. This bizarre press release leaves ministers with serious questions to answer.” A Labour source said: “The key question for the government is which of the proposed changes in regulation depend on the passage of this bill, and if the answer is none, what other changes are they planning that do? Until they can explain all that, we have to ask what the point of this bill is.” Downing Street said it would release a public catalogue of all retained EU laws to determine if they are beneficial to the UK. In a statement announcing the new bill, two years after Britain’s exit from the bloc, Johnson said: “Getting Brexit done two years ago today was a truly historic moment and the start of an exciting new chapter for our country. The plans we have set out today will further unleash the benefits of Brexit and ensure that businesses can spend more of their money investing, innovating and creating jobs. “Our new Brexit freedoms bill will end the special status of EU law in our legal framework and ensure that we can more easily amend or remove outdated EU law in future.” The government will also publish a riposte to critics who claim little advantage of Brexit has been taken, with a document titled The Benefits of Brexit: How the UK is Taking Advantage of Leaving the EU. It will claim that reforms have led to a more agile digital and AI sector and a less burdensome data rights regime compared with the EU’s GDPR. It will also claim that there have been benefits in changing clinical trials, strengthening environmental protections and establishing a domestic subsidy regime. With hopes rising in No 10 that Johnson can swerve a no confidence vote, the prime minister is also understood to have told staff he hopes to save his chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, or move him to another role. Gray’s report will criticise the culture in No 10 and make a series of recommendations on changes to the organisation, according to those who have given evidence, but Rosenfield has not been implicated publicly in any egregious breaches. No 10 is braced for further damaging revelations in the press once Gray’s slimmed-down report is published. One of Johnson’s fiercest critics, Dominic Cummings, told NYMag on Sunday that it was his “duty to get rid” of Johnson as prime minister, describing it as “sort of like fixing the drains”. Cummings, who was Johnson’s chief adviser, called his former boss a “complete fuckwit” whose only preoccupations were “Big Ben’s bongs” and “looking at maps” to “order the building of things” in his honour.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson to try to regain control with Brexit bill and policy blitz,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/boris-johnson-to-try-to-regain-control-with-brexit-bill-and-policy-blitz
1/31/2022,"Two teams that had been inseparable for the majority of the match and indeed the series were explosively prised apart at the very last as Jason Holder took a sledgehammer to England’s victory chase by taking four wickets in the final four balls to seal victory by 17 runs. In doing so he became the fourth bowler in international T20 history to take four wickets in as many balls, bringing a frequently thrilling series to a jaw-dropping conclusion. Adil Rashid observed afterwards that England’s problem was that “we just lost too many wickets in clusters”, but this was taking the problem to its logical extreme. “I thought to restrict them to 179, we were pretty pleased with that,” Rashid said, “but with the bat we just didn’t have enough partnerships.”  A career-best spell from Akeal Hosein, in which he took a wicket in each of his four overs and with Fabian Allen gradually whittled away England’s chances of victory in the middle overs, had set West Indies on the path to success and a 3-2 win in a series of slender margins, fluctuating fortunes and constant intrigue. England started the final over needing 20 to win, and when Holder’s first act was to deliver a front-foot no-ball the tourists’ task seemed achievable. But from that moment on every player who got bat on ball only succeeded in lifting it to a fielder as Chris Jordan, Sam Billings and Rashid fell, before Saqib Mahmood was bowled to end proceedings with a ball to spare. After a disappointing first match these teams had delivered a succession of compelling and high-quality contests before reaching the closing stages of the series simply refusing to be prised apart, tied as they were at 2-2 after four matches and with England, as West Indies had been earlier in the evening, at 86-2 after 10 overs. But while the hosts lost rhythm in the following phase of their innings, the tourists lost wickets. Moeen Ali, who batted as if he had used up all his timing in compiling Saturday’s half-century, lifted the very next ball to cover, and Hosein delivered the wickets of Liam Livingstone, James Vince – who delivered a 35-ball 55 full of classy shot-making – and Phil Salt in successive overs. In 31 balls England had scored 33 and lost four wickets, and despite Billings’ 28-ball 41 there would be no comeback. For the fourth time in five games West Indies won the toss, but for the first time they chose to bat. Their enthusiasm was understandable, given that the pitch on which both sides scored over 200 in the third game of the series was being reused, and though Reece Topley’s opening over was once again excellent, in the second they switched gears. Mahmood had been out of the England team since the final over of the second game was mercilessly thrashed for 28. Here West Indies greeted his return in much the same style as they had caused his exile, Brandon King carting his opening delivery of the night over long-on for six before Kyle Mayers helped himself to a pulled six and similar four, the over costing 19 and setting the home side on course for a dominant powerplay. But the momentum of the innings shifted immediately afterwards as England’s spinners once again took control. The six overs after the powerplay featured three wickets and three boundaries; between the second ball of the 11th over and the first of the 16th no delivery cost more than one run; and when Rovman Powell carted a Topley slower ball over midwicket in the 18th it ended a run of 42 balls without a boundary. Powell, whose 53-ball 107 on this pitch had powered West Indies to victory on Wednesday, had to wait until the 15th over before coming to the crease and consequently faced only 17 deliveries this time. It seemed a serious misjudgement, particularly given the fact that once he finally arrived he scored even more quickly than he had then. He and West Indies plundered 65 off the final four overs, the latest demonstration of England’s death-over issues. Their total of 179-4 was well below mid-innings expectations but, in the most dramatic style, it would eventually prove enough.",Sport/Sport,West Indies win T20 series decider as England fall to Jason Holder,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/west-indies-win-t20-series-decider-as-england-fall-to-jason-holder
1/31/2022,"And just like that, the Matildas’ 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Campaign is over. It ended with a bang, delivered off the boot of Ji So-yun in the 87th minute of their quarter-final meeting with South Korea. Australia are going home and make no mistake, their early exit represents a disastrous result for the Matildas. It cannot be sugar-coated.  Time and time again heading into the tournament, the repeated line was that the Matildas were in India to win it. Coach Tony Gustavsson said it, the players said it and, as Gustavsson revealed when announcing his squad, the federation had shifted its priorities to expect it. But now, just over 12 months out from a home World Cup that represents Australia’s best-ever chance of staging a proper assault on a world championship, Gustavsson’s vaunted “performance mode” has proven incapable of eliminating one of Asia’s upper echelon. With qualification already secured as hosts, the Swede will enter 2023 with New Zealand – at the Tokyo Olympics – as his highest-ranked scalp inside 90 minutes of a competitive fixture. Before the post mortem continues, it must be acknowledged that, on another day, the Matildas would likely have been able to put some of their multitude of chances away and the result could have been much different. Mary Fowler and Sam Kerr had back-to-back chances in the 19th minute. Kerr had a free header straight at keeper Kim Jung-Mi. Cho So-hyun yanked Steph Catley back on the hour mark as she advanced into the penalty area but VAR did not intervene. Kerr, inexplicably, sent a shot at an open goal wide in the 75th minute. A desperate Hayley Raso couldn’t turn in a wayward Kerr shot in the 91st. Yet to place the narrative of the unlucky loser above all others would not only ignore the haphazard nature of the Matildas attempts to execute a discernible plan, but also remove agency from the Korean performance. It would be unhelpful. Contentious as the VAR-adjudicated decision to award the penalty was, Cho blasted over the bar in the 37th minute. Then, as the Koreans began to exert increasing control over the flow of the game as the second half commenced – compounded by Gustavsson’s move to substitute off Clare Wheeler and shift Emily van Egmond into the six role – Lee Geum-min caught Alanna Kennedy flat-footed and forced a point-blank save from Lydia Williams. Five minutes later, Cho was afforded an open header in the penalty area that Williams, again, somehow managed to keep out. After absorbing the Matildas’ initial 20-minute flurry, the Koreans looked like the more organised and better-prepared team: one that had picked out what Gustavsson’s more heralded XI was trying to achieve. Following the game, Korean coach Colin Bell said that the Matildas’ reminded him of the USWNT; perhaps inadvertently revealing that he has predicted the game plan of his opposite number, a former USWNT assistant. Now, focus will and must turn to the tenure of Gustavsson. There will be time for lessons surrounding players and next steps, but they are subservient to the main issue. He came under increasing pressure during the sputtering run of friendly form during 2021, before staking everything on the Asian Cup, declaring that it would be the forum for adjudication. Judgement is at hand. In the days and weeks ahead, Football Australia will have to decide if the 48-year-old’s plan, philosophy and personality can actually deliver in 2023, or if he is incapable of backing his silver tongue with tangible progression. “I’ve been around long enough to know those questions are going to come from all over the place and that’s fair, that’s OK,” he said. “What I can promise is that I’ve been around long enough to come back from situations like this and learn from it and do better and that’s what I’m going to do if I get the chance to do it.” Regardless of what conclusion is ultimately made, it will be vital that Football Australia be transparent about its reasoning. The discourse around the Matildas has frequently descended into toxicity – distracting from important discussions that should have been happening and negatively affecting player wellbeing – and it is imperative that the federation limits scope for conjecture and innuendo to drag it down again. From there, even more essential is that FA commits wholeheartedly to its course of action. If Gustavsson is to stay, the scrutiny that will follow must be welcomed and he must be backed to the hilt with any possible resources needed to succeed. In the event that a new coach is to be brought in, that resolution must come immediately – any delay and the new coach won’t have enough time to bed in their system, familiarise themselves with the players and take stock of the landscape before the World Cup rolls around. And they must receive similar backing. Inevitably, Football Australia’s reputation will live or die on the decision, and neither comes with an assurance of success. In fact, the only certainty is that an unwillingness to properly commit to either shall result in disappointment.",Sport/Football,No sugar-coating disastrous Matildas Asian Cup failure | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/no-sugar-coating-disastrous-matildas-asian-cup-failure
1/31/2022,"If you’ve blitzed through Cobra Kai and it’s left you hankering for yet more fight-based, 80s throwback drama, consider checking out the work of prolific action movie star Scott Adkins in the truly excellent Ninja Shadow of a Tear (AKA Ninja 2). Ninja Shadow of a Tear is the weirdly titled sequel to 2009’s rather more simplistic Ninja. But it works well as a self-contained entity, ditching any remaining story threads from the first film within the first 10 minutes so you can comfortably watch them in reverse order and kick your evening off with the better one.  Casey Bowman (Adkins) returns home one night to find his wife Namiko (Mika Hijii) has been brutally slain by an unknown assailant with a unique but deadly weapon. Casey accepts an offer from his friend Nakabara (Kane Kosugi) to stay at his dojo in Bangkok in an attempt to find peace. But Casey’s grief continues to manifest in self-destructive behaviour, losing his temper in a sparring session and drunkenly starting a massive bar fight. When one of Nakabara’s students turns up dead, killed by the same unique weapon that took Namiko’s life, Casey’s thirst for vengeance leads him on a hunt through Bangkok and the jungles of Myanmar to the doorstep of an infamous drug lord known as Goro (Shun Sugata). Although Ninja Shadow of a Tear’s plot is a classic revenge rampage, it still finds space to make its simple story more interesting than most. Casey’s journey is fuelled more by his grief than his desire for revenge. He gets things wrong, fights the wrong people, and in many ways he wants to get beaten up himself. But like any good genre movie it doesn’t necessarily need to be original; it just needs to play to its strengths. In Ninja Shadow of a Tear’s case, those strengths largely lie in Adkins’ unparalleled ability to kick a lot of people in the face. With a colossal 59 movies under his belt and an upcoming appearance in John Wick 4, Adkins has been busy. Ninja Shadow of a Tear marked the sixth time (out of nine) that he worked with director Isaac Florentine. The Adkins/Florentine axis flourished in the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, courtesy of the two Ninja movies and the Undisputed series – three stylish direct-to-video prison fight movies that served as nominal sequels to Walter Hill’s 2002 original. With a surprisingly deft focus on character and stunning fight sequences, both the Ninja and Undisputed series belie their direct-to-video roots to offer up some of the most enjoyably knuckleheaded action since Jean-Claude Van Damme’s kinetic prime. Florentine’s direction captures every bone-crunching kick and deadly elbow in luxurious slow motion, while Adkins’ acrobatic fighting prowess seems to defy all known laws of physics. Every spin kick and airborne punch asserts that gravity is a mug’s game and something for other people to worry about (meanwhile, I’m watching from the couch, shovelling biscuits into my face like it’s the end of the world). The other reason Ninja Shadow of a Tear is so much fun is because it has absolutely no pretensions about being anything other than a one-man-army action film. It wears its love for 1980s action and ninja movies proudly on its sleeve and arguably does it better than the classics that preceded it. Casting Kosugi as Nakabara is a masterstroke; he is the son of legendary martial artist Shô Kosugi who appeared in Cannon Film’s ninja trilogy – Enter The Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Ninja III: The Domination – a staple of video stores everywhere. There’s also a nod to Schwarzenegger’s Commando, as Adkins rampages through the woods, taking on an army by himself and announcing his arrival at the drug compound via hand grenade. Amusingly, there is no concession to traditional ninja stealth, but that’s all part of the fun. For additional viewing, you can catch the first Ninja on Prime and 10 of Adkins’ other movies on Netflix. His Art of Action series on YouTube – a lockdown project where Adkins interviews a fascinating selection of action stars, directors and stunt people – is also well worth seeking out. Ninja Shadow of a Tear is a movie I love on a cellular level: as an introduction to Adkins’ filmography, as a nostalgic love letter to ninja movies and VHS rentals, and as an unashamedly fun slice of modern martial arts cinema.",Arts/Culture,Ninja Shadow of a Tear: Scott Adkins kicks butt in enjoyably knuckleheaded revenge rampage,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/31/ninja-shadow-of-a-tear-scott-adkins-kicks-butt-in-enjoyably-knuckleheaded-revenge-rampage
