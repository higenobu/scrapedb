3/10/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"" and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon. Late on Tuesday, Russia repeated its accusation of several years that the United States is working with Ukrainian laboratories to develop biological weapons. Such assertions in Russian media increased in the run-up to Moscow's military move into Ukraine and were made as recently as Wednesday by foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. ""The Russian accusations are absurd, they are laughable and you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday. In a statement, also released on Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia ""is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine.""

There was no immediate response from the Russian embassy in Washington to the U.S. assertions on Wednesday. Russia has denied carrying out an attack on Navalny. On Wednesday, Zakharova said Russia had documents showing the Ukrainian health ministry had ordered the destruction of samples of plague, cholera, anthrax and other pathogens before Feb. 24, when Russian forces moved into Ukraine. Zakharova said the documents unearthed by Russian forces in Ukraine showed ""an emergency attempt to erase evidence of military biological programmes"" financed by the Pentagon. She provided no further details on the documents. Reuters was unable to independently confirm her information. A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson said: ""Ukraine strictly denies any such allegation."" Like many other countries, Ukraine has public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans. Its laboratories have received support from the United States, European Union and World Health Organization. The Pentagon's Biological Threat Reduction Program has been working with the Ukrainian government to ensure the security of pathogens and toxins stored in the laboratories.

A former U.S. official, who is familiar with the cooperation between Kyiv and Washington, said the United States had helped to convert several Ukrainian laboratories that had been involved in the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program into public health facilities.

3/10/2022,"(Updates prices, adds comment) March 9 (Reuters) - Russia's rouble tumbled to record lows in onshore trading on Wednesday despite measures by Moscow to shore up its battered economy and safeguard hard currency availability amid fresh economic sanctions triggered by its invasion of Ukraine. Catching up after two days of market closure, the rouble jumped to 120.83 to the dollar on the Moscow Exchange before clawing back some losses to close at 120, or 12.5% softer than its Friday close. It closed 6.3% weaker against the euro at 127 after hitting a record 131 per euro in early trade. Offshore rouble trading was also thin with large disparities in pricing: On Refinitiv, the rouble stood at 129 to the dollar while on the EBS platform it was bid at 138 from the previous 130 close, down 5.8%. Russia's financial markets have been thrown into turmoil since its invasion of Ukraine prompted severe economic sanctions. On Wednesday, the European Union froze ties with the central bank of Belarus, an ally of Russia in its Ukrainian invasion, and top banks there. ""If we just take a step back and think about the near term, the headlines about lack of liquidity, how the military situation evolves, that will determine a lot of the near-term trading,"" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. ""But if we think about the long term economics, a very weak rouble certainly makes sense for the foreseeable future."" The central bank has more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% and the government has rolled out support measures, but Russian assets have been sold heavily and the rouble is now down around 30% against the dollar in Moscow since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. On Tuesday, the central bank said it was offering additional crisis support to financial firms and that banks were banned from selling foreign currency to its citizens for the next six months, a move seen aimed at preserving precious hard currency in the country. The finance ministry said Russian banks will be allowed to lend to companies controlled by non-residents, which would allow companies wishing to do business in Russia to operate as usual. Trading in equities on the Moscow Exchange remained closed. Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25. BMO's Ma said that once the stock market reopens there is a chance that prices will drop further than what their longer-term value will be, but timing that will be very hard. ""It's certainly not something for anyone who is unwilling to take an extreme amount of risk because the reality is that many international investors simply want out and price doesn't really matter,"" said Ma. Russia's 5-year credit default swaps - a measure of the cost of insuring exposure to the country - soared sharply to a record 2,960 basis points and was recently at 2,939 bps . Annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 9.15% in February from 8.73% in January, its highest in seven years, with prices soaring further on a weakening rouble. Michael Metcalfe, global head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, said in a research note that there were signs prices in Russia had risen sharply since the rouble's slump - more so than in prior currency collapses. ""If it were sustained in the coming weeks and months, (this rate) could see the Russian annual inflation rate almost double in the coming months,"" Metcalfe wrote.
