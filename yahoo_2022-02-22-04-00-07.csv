2/22/2022,"By Andrew Osborn and Mark Trevelyan MOSCOW (Reuters) - Seated at a large white table in an echoing Kremlin hall, Vladimir Putin summoned his top security officials one by one on Monday to give him their advice at a potential turning point in the crisis around Ukraine. In a lengthy meeting of his Security Council, broadcast on state television in what a presenter called ""unprecedented footage"", Putin cross-examined ministers and spy chiefs on the question of whether to recognise the two breakaway Donbass regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states. One after another, they walked to a white lectern in the column-lined hall to paint a relentlessly grim picture of the situation in Donbass. Looking pale and tired, Putin drummed with his fingers from time to time as he listened. His special representative on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, said Kyiv and the West had no interest in implementing a 2015 peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for the past eight years. The head of the FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, told Putin the security situation in the two breakaway regions was deteriorating, and that nearly 70,000 people had so far fled to Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of stepping up shelling of the separatist regions - which Kyiv has strongly denied - and said some residents had been left without gas or water. Much was riding on the president's decision. Recognition of the separatist regions could provide Russia with a pretext to openly send its military forces into the Donbass and justify that by arguing that it was protecting residents there from Ukraine. It would also effectively kill off the Minsk peace agreements that all sides, including Russia, have until now called the only possible route out of the crisis. But Putin was taking his time. SHOW OF AUTHORITY At one point he intervened to emphasise that he had not discussed in advance what the officials were going to tell him, as if to dispel the impression that the proceedings had been choreographed. In reality, the televised meeting appeared calculated to convey the impression of a leader carefully arriving at an important decision after weighing all the evidence from his subordinates. It also gave Putin the chance to demonstrate his authority over the most powerful people in the land, putting them in their place if they slipped up. He jumped in to chastise foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin when the latter said he ""will support"" recognition of the Donbass regions. ""Will support, or do support? Tell me straight, Sergei Yevgenievich,"" Putin said. When Naryshkin then said he supported the breakaway regions becoming part of Russia, Putin upbraided him again: ""We're not talking about that... We're talking about whether to recognise their independence or not."" Naryshkin: ""Yes, I support the proposal to recognise their independence."" Putin: ""Ok, please sit down, thank you."" With all the reports delivered, all eyes turned to Putin to pronounce his verdict - but he was not yet ready to end the suspense. ""A decision will be taken today,"" he said - and with that, the cameras stopped rolling.

2/22/2022,"Fiona Hill criticised Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy, especially Russia. Hill said Trump's policies sent the message to Putin that Ukraine is a ""playground."" Her comments come as the US warns that Russia is about to invade Ukraine. Former White House Russia advisor Fiona Hill said that President Donald Trump's foreign policy emboldened Russia to the point where it feels it can invade Ukraine. In an interview with CNN Hill, an expert on Russia who advised Trump, addressed the contrasts between Trump's approach to foreign policy and President Joe Biden's. She said Trump's foreign policy had not been driven by concern about the US national interest, but by personal interests and impulses. ""There's no Team America for Trump,"" Hill said. ""Not once did I see him do anything to put America first. Not once. Not for a single second."" Hill recalled Trump's praise for Russia's authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin as well as his disdain for NATO. She also mentioned his campaign to pressure Ukraine for manufactured dirt about Biden in the run up to the 2020 election. The Ukraine pressure campaign saw Trump threaten to withhold military aid from the nation, and led to his first impeachment. ""All this did was say to Russia that Ukraine was a playground,"" Hill said, drawing a direct line to events today, where Russia has amassed a huge military force around Ukraine which the US said is for an invasion. Hill shot to prominence when she testified during Trump's 2019 impeachment hearings, rebutting conspiracy theories promoted by Trump allies that sought to excuse Russia of blame for interfering in the 2016 election, and explaining how Russia was seeking to sew domestic discord in the US. She has gone on to speak critically of Trump's approach to foreign policy, and has said there were close parallels between how Trump sought to cling on to power after his defeat in 2020 and Putin's style of rule. Hill in the CNN interview said that Biden had managed to pull NATO allies together for a display of resolve in face of Russian aggression, but warned that the crisis would likely drag on for some time as Russia seeks to slowly exert pressure on Ukraine. ""The real challenge is keeping everyone together for a considerable period,"" Hill concluded. ""It's going to go on a long time.""
