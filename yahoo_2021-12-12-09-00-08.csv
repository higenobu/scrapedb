12/12/2021,"A juror in the Jussie Smollett trial has explained several reasons why the jury felt there was no way they could acquit the star actor in his bombshell trial for staging a fake hate crime attack on himself. The female juror, who declined to be named, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the jury of six women and six men didn’t have any major disagreements but they took nine hours to deliberate because they wanted to properly consider all the evidence. Some doubted that prosecutors had proven their case beyond reasonable doubt when deliberations began, she said. But those people just wanted more time to look over all the evidence again. “It was not evenly split, but there were some doubters,” she said. Jussie Smollett’s Ego Is What Finally Brought Him Down Smollett was found guilty on Thursday evening of five of six counts of disorderly conduct related to filing a false police report about a battery and a false police report about a hate crime in January 2019. He was found not guilty of one count related to telling a detective two weeks later that he was the victim of an aggravated battery. Smollett—an openly gay, Black actor who for nearly three years denied accusations that he hired two brothers as assailants in the alleged attack—testified on his own behalf during the one-week trial. But the juror said they felt his answers didn’t have credible reasoning, especially when there was zero evidence to back up his story. Smollett’s creative director Frank Gatson, who initially called police in 2019, was included on a list of witnesses to testify but was never called. “We all wanted to hear from Frank,” the juror said. Ultimately, the juror said they found testimony from the brothers hired to attack Smollett to be more convincing. Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo gave damning testimony that Smollett had paid them to carry out the task of roughing him up and slipping a noose around his neck after dousing him in bleach. They also claimed that Smollett had walked them through a “dry run” days before. Rubbing salt in the wound, the juror said Smollett’s defense attorney Nenye Uche seemed to be “just shooting from the hip” with her approach to the trial. She threw out unsubstantiated claims that didn’t sit well with the juror, like a claim that the Osundairo brothers wanted a $2 million payout from Smollett to change their story. In contrast, prosecutor Dan Webb had a “methodical, plodding” style that made his argument seem water-tight, the juror said. Jussie Smollett Found Guilty of Faking Hate Crime Attack Uche said she would be appealing due to the jury’s “inconsistent’ verdict. “You cannot say Jussie is not lying for the same exact incident,” she said in a statement. But the juror explained why they only delivered guilty verdict on four or five charges. “We were told it was an aggravated battery because [Smollett] said they were wearing a mask,” the juror said. But “in all [of Smollett’s] accounts of what happened, he mentioned a mask.” She added: “I just hope that [Smollett and his attorneys] know that we went in there with an open mind. I listened to both sides. We wanted to make sure that those who had doubts didn’t feel pressured.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/12/2021,"Tornados laid waste to the town of Mayfield, Kentucky, on December 10, causing fatalities and widespread destruction. Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear told WKLY News that at least 50 people were believed dead after a severe tornado ripped through western Kentucky, on Friday. During a press conference in the early hours of December 11, Beshear said the devastating storm was “the most severe tornado event in Kentucky’s history.” He said multiple tornadoes touched down, with the primary tornado “on the ground continuously for over 200 miles.” “We have deaths in multiple, possibly many counties,” he said, adding: “The city of Mayfield has been devastated.” More than 56,000 people were without power in Kentucky, according to the governor. A state of emergency was in place before midnight and the national guard was deployed.

12/12/2021,"After an alert was issued Friday night about a deadly tornado approaching Illinois, Carla Cope told her son “to get to shelter” at the Amazon delivery facility where he was working. Instead, she told The Daily Beast her 29-year-old son, Clayton, insisted he needed to alert others about the impending natural disaster. “He just said he needed to tell someone that [the tornado] was coming,” Cope told The Daily Beast on Saturday, hours after she learned her son was among two Edwardsville, Illinois employees who were killed in the severe weather. “He had a big heart and he was a very sweet man.” The deadly incident at Edwardsville mirrors a grim scene in at least six other states, after what could be the longest reported tornado path in history. The natural disaster has killed at least 70 people in Kentucky and three in Tennessee—and left hundreds scrambling to restart their lives after their homes were obliterated. “The level of devastation is unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. “This will be, I believe, the deadliest tornado system to have ever run through Kentucky.” A Navy spokesperson confirmed to The Daily Beast that Clayton Cope enlisted in 2010 and served as an Aviation Electronics Technician for a majority of his service. Before separating from the Navy in September 2016, he received a series of awards and decorations, including the national defense service medal and the global war on terrorism expeditionary medal. “He was a ‘one of one’ kind of person,” Leighton Grothaus, one of Clayton’s longtime friends, told The Daily Beast. “I knew him most of my life. He was the kind of person who would take the shirt off his back for anyone. He would go out of his way to say hi, bubbly, buy anyone a drink at the bar.” Cope said her son started his job as maintenance mechanic at the Amazon fulfillment center earlier this year. When he wasn’t working, Cope said her son “loved riding his Harley and fishing.” Grothaus added that he last spoke to his friend on Friday afternoon as he was about to clock into work at Amazon. “I am at home visiting for the weekend and I wanted to set up a lunch for today,” said Grothaus, a 25-year-old full-time farmer. “He was so excited and we were both looking forward to it.” Grothaus added that as the tornado alerts were going off on Friday night, another friend informed him that “the Amazon building collapsed.” “That’s when I got that real sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I started texting Claying, calling him. But he never answered,” he said. “It was devastating.” After the storm passed on Friday, Cope said she raced down to the warehouse to search for her son. Cope added that it wasn't until 4:30 a.m. that authorities told her that her son was among the employees who died in the natural disaster. “[It was] gut-wrenching, nauseating, and heartbreaking,” Cope said about learning the news of her son’s death. Officials say the storm took the roof off the Amazon warehouse, leaving dozens of employees trapped inside at the time of the collapse. The entire southern portion of the warehouse also was destroyed by the storm. “About half of it’s missing, it’s gone,” Edwardsville Fire Department Mark Mayfield said Saturday of the approximately 400,000-square-foot building. Edwardsville Police Chief Mike Fillback added “there’s a lot of debris from the concrete; that is predominantly a concrete and steel structure.” Fillback told The Daily Beast that while he could not confirm Cope was among the deceased, a press conference scheduled for Saturday afternoon would include the county coroner, who would answer questions. While officials across several states are still scrambling to save residents who could still be trapped under the tornado’s destruction, a Kentucky judge has also been identified as a victim of the natural disaster. The Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court confirmed in a Saturday tweet that Judge Brian Crick, who “served McLean and Muhlenberg counties, lost his life during the storm.” On Twitter, the father of five called himself a “devoted husband and dad. District Judge in the 45th Judicial District in KY.” ""This is a shocking loss to his family, his community and the court system, and his family is in our prayers,” the statement added. “I have asked our justices, judges, circuit court clerks and AOC managers to try to determine the safety of any court staff in Western Kentucky, and what we can do to help any who need shelter, food or clothing.” -- Read more at The Daily Beast.
