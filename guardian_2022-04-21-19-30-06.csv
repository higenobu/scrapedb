4/21/2022,"Online shopping group THG has dismissed “numerous” takeover approaches as “unacceptable”, saying they undervalued the company. Manchester-based THG (formerly known as The Hut Group), which runs beauty and nutrition websites including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Myprotein, confirmed there had been interest from third parties, but said the company was not currently involved in any talks. “You will all be aware that there has been significant speculation about possible third party interest in THG,” its boss and founder Matthew Moulding said on Thursday. “I can confirm that the board has received indicative proposals from numerous parties in recent weeks.” However, he said the board had “concluded that each and every proposal to date has been unacceptable, failing to reflect the fair value of the group, and confirms that THG is not currently in receipt of any approaches”. “We continue to focus on delivering our exciting growth strategy across a number of large global sectors, and prepare to step up to the premium segment of the LSE at the appropriate time,” Moulding added. The news momentarily sent THG shares up by as much as 4% on Thursday morning, before falling back to trade 0.6% higher at 95p. Its shares are still far below the flotation price of 500p in September 2020. It follows a turbulent year for THG, which faced criticism for allowing Moulding to serve as both executive chair and chief executive, which is against best corporate governance practice. The board also signed off on a deal that allowed Moulding to acquire a raft of THG properties before leasing them back to the company for millions of pounds a year. News of the offers came as THG reported a 35% increase in revenues to £2.2bn, helping push adjusted earnings up 7% at £161m. First quarter results also showed a 16% jump in revenue to £520m. Moulding said it was a strong performance that was ahead of targets set when THG went public a year and a half earlier. He singled out the strong performance of Ingenuity, a division building direct-to-consumer websites for other companies, which has been a key part of the company’s growth plans. THG said it was aware of the rising cost pressures, and the “significant impact of short-term cost inflation on both global consumers and supply chains alike”. However, the group said it believed the cost pressures would be temporary and pledged to “shield consumers” in the interim as part of efforts to build a long-term, loyal customer base, that it hopes will account for up to 80% of annual revenues.",News/Business,THG rejects takeover bids as revenues jump by 35%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/21/thg-rejects-takeover-bids-as-revenues-jump-by-35
4/21/2022,"On Friday, Trump endorsed JD Vance in the Ohio Senate Republican primary. This follows his endorsement of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania’s Senate Republican primary and Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate race. The media has framed these endorsements as long-shot bets that “could put [Trump’s] desired image as a kingmaker at risk”. But this misses the point. What’s really at stake for Trump is the selling of Trump and his big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. To get a strong endorsement from Trump, a candidate apparently must fulfill three prerequisites – run in a swing state whose primaries and general election will attract lots of media attention, be totally committed to Trump and his big lie, and be capable of promoting Trump and his lie with the kind of celebrity pizzaz that sells well on television. Vance – celebrity author of Hillbilly Elegy – was originally appalled by Trump and his lie, and said so. But now that he’s running for the Senate, Vance has become one of the most forceful promoters of Trump and his lie. As Trump noted about Vance, “he gets it now”. Oz is a celebrity television doctor who has over the years come under fire for bogus on-air medical advice, which makes him perfect for promoting Trump and his big lie, too. Trump admires Oz’s television bona fides: “They liked him for a long time,” Trump said of Oz at a rally in Pennsylvania last week. “That’s like a poll. You know, when you’re in television for 18 years, that’s like a poll. That means people like you.” Walker fits the criteria, as well. He was both a college and NFL star. Trump couldn’t care less whether he’s viewed as a “kingmaker” by the press and politicians inside the Beltway. He cares only about his narcissistic need to delegitimize the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And he has a knack for recognizing ambitious, unprincipled, television-savvy hucksters who will help him. Let me pause here to emphasize two things that are too easily forgotten. First, no one to this day has produced even a shred of evidence that fraud affected the results of the 2020 election. Sixty federal judges, along with Trump’s own departments of justice and homeland security, have concluded that Biden won fair and square. Second, the lynchpin of democracy is the peaceful transition of power from those who lose elections to those who win them. Yet it’s been over a year and half since Trump has refused to concede – continuously spreading his big lie that the election was stolen, pushing public officials at all levels of government to overturn the election, and instigating an insurrection at the US Capitol on the day Congress was to certify the election results. As federal district court judge David Carter stated in a recent opinion: “[T]he court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” Trump is already well on the way to rebuilding the Republican party around his big lie. He is purging the Republican party of his critics and installing loyalists in key state positions. And he is inspiring Republican-state legislatures to enact election sabotage laws that will give Trump and his supporters opportunities to rig congressional election results. The upcoming 2022 congressional elections will serve as proving grounds for his attempt to steal the 2024 presidential election. Trump is a growing menace to our system of self-government. The longer he goes without being held accountable for what he has done, the more danger he poses. The critical question, then, is whether Attorney General Merrick Garland will bring criminal charges against him – and when. The window of opportunity is closing fast. The House Select Committee on January 6 will be holding public hearings in a few weeks and report its findings thereafter. If Republicans take over the House in the midterm elections, they are sure to close down the inquiry. Moreover, immediately after the midterm elections, America will be in the gravitational pull of the 2024 presidential primaries – in which Trump will almost certainly play a leading role, unless he is indicted and convicted. He has already amassed a campaign chest of more than $120m, more than double that of the Republican National Committee. During the last six months of 2021, his PAC raised more money online than the Republican party every day but two. Once he is a declared candidate, it will be impossible for Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms to stop him from engulfing them with his lies. Some say Garland should not bring criminal charges against Trump because criminal charges have never before been brought against a former president. This is a specious argument because no former president has ever before attempted to overthrow a duly elected President – the first attempted coup in the 233-year history of the United States government. Others worry that criminal charges against Trump – along with a trial and possible imprisonment – would only deepen the fierce partisan divide that’s already drained trust out of much of American democracy. This is a legitimate concern. But failure to hold Trump accountable for what he has done would pose a far greater risk for American democracy – permanently entrenching distrust in our election system and legitimizing future battles over every contest, possibly provoking repeated rounds of violence. Trump’s indictment and conviction must occur as quickly as possible. The upcoming midterm elections will not simply be a battle between Republicans and Democrats. They will be a battle between Trump acolytes and fair election supporters over protecting the integrity of our elections and our democracy. The sooner Trump is held accountable, the safer American democracy will be.

4/21/2022,"Hey Simon, I saw Days of the Bagnold Summer when it premiered at the Glasgow film festival. I loved it! I’m curious if Wes Anderson was an inspiration? A lot of the film brought him to mind, from the colours to the staging. Theocapa Well, I’m a huge fan of Rushmore, so I guess he probably was an inspiration on some level. But the directors I spent the most time watching, analysing – and plagiarising – were the film-makers from the 60s and 70s – the generation before Wes Anderson – people such as Hal Ashby, Peter Bogdanovich and Elaine May, who specialised in bleak, sad comedy – right up my street. How did you get Earl Cave involved, and what was it like working with your wife, Lisa Owens? TurangaLeela2 Earl walked into the audition and knocked it out the park. His is a tricky role because, on the page, it reads as pretty moody and morose, but he managed to infuse Daniel with a real sweetness and vulnerability. What was it like working with my wife? In retrospect, that feels like a pretty spicy decision, with potentially catastrophic ramifications. But I guess on some level we must have an unshakable confidence or faith in each other. I certainly had no doubt that she would produce a brilliant script, so as soon as she hinted that she might be interested in writing the adaptation, I snapped her up. Does Bagnold Summer have a TV series in it? It seems a shame that we only got to spend an hour and a half with such fantastic characters. timetoshine It’s a lovely idea, but I’m not sure we’d get away with Bagnold Summer on TV given that the film is – let’s not beat around the bush – an almost plotless tone piece. On TV there would need to be story, action, emotional climaxes – all the things we were very keen to avoid. If you do want more Daniel and Sue, may I direct you to the original graphic novel by Joff Winterhart, on which the film is based? I would like to see you in a movie where you play a young 90s David Baddiel and he plays you in the year 2050. Perhaps it could be a kind of Timeslip thing, with the 2050 Simon Bird tired of being unfavourably compared to Baddiel, and using a time machine (which will of course exist in 2050) to return to the 90s and sabotage Baddiel’s career so he never becomes famous. robotdoggy What a specific and unusual premise, robotdoggy! That’s not to say I’m not interested, if the money’s right. I’d need to see a script, but … why don’t you put me down as a heavy pencil? Have I ever been compared – favourably or unfavourably – to Baddiel? No, it hasn’t come up. Am I a big Baddiel fan? Absolutely. I grew up in the 90s, a Fantasy Football obsessive. I feel you’re trying to start some sort of beef between me and Baddiel, which I have no interest in. I’ve got nothing but respect for David Baddiel and his illustrious career. If a production company offered a blank cheque, what film would you direct and/or star in? flyforfun Can I refer you to the previous question? I’m all in on the Baddiel Timeslip vehicle. But if for some inconceivable reason that falls through, I guess my ambition is to make the two films I am developing with my wife. Unfortunately, it’s far too early to give any details about either. Thank you for recommending the 98-year-old Ethiopian piano-playing nun Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou in a previous Guardian interview. Any more musical recommendations please? Mirren54 Oh, big time. Judee Sill is a recent discovery, an American singer from the 70s who writes these incredible songs that sit somewhere between teen pop anthems and hymns. I’ve also been listening to a lot of shoegaze, so Slowdive and Mazzy Star. Cate Le Bon’s new album is amazing as well. Would you consider taking over an episode of the Cautionary Tales podcast to see if anyone notices that it’s not being done by [economist and journalist] Tim Harford? The joke I’m getting at here is that your voices sound quite similar. SirAnthonyHopkins I’ve never heard of the podcast, but I do have an A-level in economics, so I could be up for some sort of job swap, if Tim Harford can be talked into a flagging acting career with a sideline in directing low-budget indie films that don’t perform at the box office. It’s a big if, admittedly. Would you have followed a comedy/acting career if you hadn’t got into Cambridge and Footlights? Criticulated I like to think I would, but Footlights definitely gave me a leg up. Not really for the reasons people assume – nepotism and the old boys network, neither of which I experienced. It’s more about the infrastructure that allows 18- and 19-year-old kids to perform live comedy for the first time in a supportive environment. It’s a boot camp for wannabe comedians, with a relentless schedule of gigs that forces you to generate material and hone your craft. After being on telly for the first time, how hard was it getting used to always having to be nice to people who want pictures and stuff when you’re just trying to do normal things? MaliciousA I really don’t mind it. I mean – let’s not be disingenuous – there are times when it can be annoying, but that usually directly correlates with how drunk the person is. But, in general, it’s lovely. I got into this business hoping – but never really believing – that I could be involved in shows that mean as much to people as my favourite comedies meant to me when I was growing up. Shows such as The Office, Look Around You and Big Train. To be reminded that I’ve actually done that is really humbling. A politician’s answer if ever I’ve heard one. Do people still shout “briefcase wanker” at you in the street? davidabsalom “Briefcase wanker.” “Bus wanker.” Just as long as it’s got wanker in it, that seems to be the crucial component. Give us your best Paul Ritter anecdote, as we miss him greatly. fareastman I don’t really have a defining anecdote. It wasn’t really Paul’s style to ruin takes by laughing or go off on wild improvisations. That would have been far too egotistical. What you got with Paul was a gradual accumulation of wisdom and generosity from one of the most humble people I’ve ever met. He was a father figure and remains a huge role model, professionally and personally. When writer Robert Popper pitched the show to me, he said it was based on two universal truths. No matter how old you are, when you go home, you immediately revert to behaving like a child. And that all dads, when they hit 50, just go a bit weird. I think that is probably true. I’m only a decade and a bit off. If you could go back and reshoot one episode of Inbetweeners and Friday Night Dinner, which episode would it be? NintheO Well, it would be almost criminal of me not to take this opportunity to redo Series 2 Episode 1 of Friday Night Dinner, in which I accidentally broke Tom Rosenthal’s leg, leading to multiple surgeries and months of physiotherapy. So the Field Trip episode of Inbetweeners it is. A beautiful location, fish and chips on the beach, watching one of my closest friends, Joe Thomas, almost dying of hypothermia. What could be better? Liam Gallagher, Ian Brown and Richard Ashcroft are famous for their stylistically different walking style. Yet Will in The Inbetweeners gets mocked. How come? Ben Fitzgerald I guess the obvious difference is those guy are literally rock stars, whereas Will is a fastidious virgin. Will would probably have got away with his weird walk if he’d also written I Am the Resurrection. Also – let’s be clear – Will’s walking style is just my walking style. That’s literally how I walk. It’s not a comedic choice. To this day, I do not understand what’s funny about it. Do you fancy Will’s mum too? Hectormandarin I think that’s got to be “no comment”, hasn’t it? What’s your favourite brand of powdered custard? vammyp This feels like a trap. As I imagine vammyp is well aware, the market leader in the powdered custard field is Bird’s Custard Powder. It seems obvious that vammyp wants me to, at the very least, acknowledge that I share my surname with the founder of a powdered custard brand. I just can’t tell whether that’s supposed to be a source of embarrassment or of pride. Anyway, long story short, I’m more of a creme fraiche guy. How about more Inbetweeners, but this time you’re the embarrassing parents? TurangaLeela2 It’s a hard no, I’m afraid. It just wouldn’t be the show people want or remember. Much better to leave it as a happy memory. Cut to us all doing a third film for Netflix next year … Anything’s possible. Honestly, you can’t trust a single word I’ve said in this interview. It’s all filler, no killer.  Days of the Bagnold Summer is released as a special edition DVD & Blu-ray by ANTI-WORLDS on 25 April.

4/21/2022,"Manchester United have confirmed that Erik ten Hag will be their new manager on contract to June 2025, with the option to extend for a further year. The Dutchman will leave his role as Ajax head coach and begin his Old Trafford tenure after the end of this season. Ten Hag has spent more than four years in charge of Ajax, winning the Dutch league and cup double in 2018-19 and 2020-21. His team lost the 2022 cup final to PSV last Sunday but are on course to secure another league title. An agreement has been reached to pay Ten Hag’s €2m release clause and it is understood the 52-year-old has been granted a key demand: to be allowed the final decision on transfers together with the club executive. Ten Hag said: “It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. I know the history of this great club and he passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. “It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.” Rise and riseErik ten Hag, 52, spent much of hisplaying career as a central defenderat FC Twente – it is said a lack ofspeed made him work harder,position himself smarter and bemore aware of the importanceof teamwork, seeing the gamethrough a coach’s eyes while stillplaying. He moved seamlessly intoyouth coach roles at the club beforebecoming first-team assistant,which included a spell workingunder Steve McClaren before FredRutten took him to PSV Eindhovenin 2009 for three seasons.  The first-team coachMarc Overmars appointed himmanager of Go Ahead Eagles in2012 and he duly took the sideinto the Dutch top flight beforeleaving to coach Bayern Munich’ssecond team for two years.

United’s initial five-man shortlist also included the Spain coach Luis Enrique, Sevilla’s Julen Lopetegui, Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel and Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino but Ten Hag quickly emerged as the clear frontrunner. He will be the club’s first permanent manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjær left in November, Ralf Rangnick having stepped in on an interim basis. Luis Enrique in effect ruled himself out when he made it clear he would not leave the Spain job until after this winter’s World Cup. Lopetegui and Pochettino were interviewed but Ten Hag impressed in discussions led by John Murtough, United’s football director, and overseen by Joel Glazer, the co-chairman. During interviews Ten Hag more than satisfied the club with his English, which had been regarded as a potential challenge. The squad were informed of his appointment on Thursday morning. Murtough said: “During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team’s attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. “In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that.“We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer.”",Sport/Football,Erik ten Hag is appointed as new permanent Manchester United manager,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-appointed-manchester-united-manager-ajax
4/21/2022,"Good morning. Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian forces to blockade the Mariupol steelworks rather than storming the area, after his defence minister admitted thousands of Ukrainian troops continued to resist there. Putin called for Russian troops to blockade the Azovstal steelworks – the Ukrainian army’s last stronghold in the besieged city – “so that a fly can’t get through”. Russian officials had claimed that their troops would seize the plant by Thursday afternoon, while a Ukrainian marine commander said on Wednesday his country’s forces there were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours”. The change in tactics comes as the US and allies warned of intelligence that Russia is considering cyber-attacks on countries supporting Ukraine as forces struggle to make military inroads. “Evolving intelligence indicates that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyber-attacks,” the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network said in an official cyber threat alert on Wednesday, noting that “some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government”. Other developments on day 57 of the invasion include: Facebook posts disputing evidence of alleged war crimes in Bucha have been shared hundreds of thousands of times, analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue has found. Russian forces are moving towards Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine, British intelligence suggests, while Putin likely wants to demonstrate “significant successes” ahead of 9 May Victory Day celebrations. Russia has fined Google 11m roubles ($137,000) for failing to delete what it called “fake” information about the Ukraine war. Donald Trump’s campaign has been ordered to pay former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman more than $1.3m in legal costs. The ruling closes the case of alleged violation of a non-disclosure agreement by Manigault Newman. The former political aide, who compared herself to David and Trump to Goliath, published an explosive tell-all memoir in 2018 after being fired, leading Trump to sue her. John M Phillips, an attorney for Manigault Newman, tweeted: “$1.3m attorney fee and cost order against the Trump campaign issued! (Highest known prevailing party attorney fee assessment against a president or presidential campaign). Huge thanks to Omarosa for believing in us during this three-year ordeal of weaponized litigation.” What did the memoir say? Among other allegations, Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House included the claim that the Trump was a “racist” who used the N-word. She also released audio recordings of Trump officials. Is this the first Trump NDA case? No – the former president has lost other cases, including by a former campaign worker who said he forcibly kissed her. A man who participated in the US Capitol riots was caught after he boasted about his involvement to an Uber driver. Dashboard camera footage shows Jerry Braun telling the driver, who picked him up from Washington DC on 6 January 2021, that he “tore down the barricades” so the rioters “could get to the Capitol”. The driver’s tip to authorities led the FBI on a 15-month investigation resulting in Braun’s arrest on 12 April. Braun was charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct, obstruction during civil disorder, and entering and remaining on restricted grounds, according to an affidavit by FBI special agent Lucas Bauers. How was he identified? His Uber account used his first name – authorities then searched the booking sheet of the hotel he was dropped off at. They pored over images and compared them to the Uber footage to find a positive match. More than 800 people have been charged for their involvement in the riot, of which more than 250 have so far pleaded guilty.

4/21/2022,"Anthony Albanese says he intends to push ahead with his campaign despite being forced to isolate at home for seven days after being diagnosed with Covid. The opposition leader released a statement, saying he would “continue my responsibilities as alternative prime minister and will be fighting for a better future for all Australians”. The Labor leader said he had tested positive during a routine PCR test on Thursday – the day after he faced Scott Morrison in Brisbane for the first leaders debate of the campaign. Albanese said on Thursday night he planned to isolate at home for the next seven days and would continue to follow health guidelines and advice. The illness would force a week-long absence from the hustings at the mid-point of the campaign, but Albanese said he would continue to work remotely. The positive test follows a busy day of campaign activities on Thursday, including a visit to a Nowra nursing home in the marginal electorate of Gilmore. The Labor leader also mingled, unmasked, with voters after the leaders debate in Brisbane on Wednesday night. Albanese suggested his illness had been caught by a routine screen, and his symptoms thus far were mild. “I am feeling fine so far – and thank everyone for their well wishes”. The positive diagnosis is a significant disruption to the Labor campaign, and it comes as Albanese was recovering from a messy opening week. Albanese could not recall the current unemployment rate or the official cash rate on the first day of the campaign, and the first round of opinion polls, including the Guardian Essential survey, suggest the Labor campaign took a hit after that shaky opening sortie. Labor’s standing in the two-party preferred “plus” measure dropped three points in a fortnight, and Albanese’s disapproval metric rose five points. But Albanese had been clawing back ground during his second week on the hustings, and undecided voters in Brisbane scored Wednesday night’s debate to the opposition leader. The Labor party has also just unleashed its first round of negative attack advertisements targeting Morrison’s record in government. Labor’s campaign director Paul Erickson contracted Covid in the first week of the campaign, and had to work remotely. Strategists have war gamed various scenarios about how the campaign would need to adapt to accommodate a leader sidelined from physical campaigning. Senior strategists were meeting in Labor’s campaign headquarters in Sydney on Thursday night to recalibrate plans. It is clear there will be a full court press of senior frontbenchers, including the deputy leader Richard Marles. It is unclear whether Labor will respond with a designated stand-in leader fronting for Albanese at scheduled campaign events during the seven day isolation period. Albanese has been accompanied in recent days by a number of senior staff serving as his travelling party, as well as frontbenchers, including Tony Burke. While Albanese contracting Covid was always a significant risk-management issue for the Labor campaign, Morrison contracted Covid prior to calling the federal election. The prime minister had to isolate at home in Sydney early in March after he tested positive for Covid. Morrison announced his positive result late on the evening of 1 March, saying he would continue to discharge all of his responsibilities as prime minister including virtually chairing cabinet committee meetings. He also delivered a scheduled address to the Lowy Institute on the “arc of autocracy” via a video hookup. Labor subsequently accused Morrison of being slow to invoke a national emergency declaration in relation to the flooding disasters. The shadow climate minister Chris Bowen – who is recovering from coronavirus – was one of several MPs to wish Albanese well on Thursday evening. Bowen wrote on Twitter: “As someone a few days ahead of you on the Covid journey, my advice is to rest up. Because there is much work to do when you’re out of isolation to win this election and then a huge amount to do to give Australia a government we can be proud of”. The Greens leader Adam Bandt also sent well-wishes. “Really sorry to hear this, Anthony,” he said on Twitter. “Hope you feel OK and are up and about again soon”. “In the meantime, I hope election 2022 can shift to ‘hybrid workplace’ mode & that we still get to see you on our screens while you’re housebound”.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese tests positive to Covid but vows to continue election fight,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/anthony-albanese-tests-positive-to-covid-but-vows-to-continue-election-fight
4/21/2022,"Police in the US have killed nearly 600 people during traffic stops since 2017, with the deaths continuing apace this year, a review of national police violence data shows. The numbers add urgency to the growing push from advocates to prevent deadly stops and remove officers from traffic enforcement following the police killing of Patrick Lyoya, a Black Michigan man, earlier this month. Encounters with police during traffic stops, including minor infractions, disproportionately harm people of color, according to data collected by Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group, which argues that armed police should not be involved in many of these cases. About 10% of the roughly 1,100 people killed by police each year involve traffic violations, the group found. “We often see the most extreme examples on the news, but this is something that happens so frequently,” said Samuel Sinyangwe, a data scientist and policy analyst who founded Mapping Police Violence. There were 97 deadly traffic stops in 2017; 114 in 2018; 117 in 2019; 119 in 2020; 117 in 2021; and 25 so far in 2022 as of April, according to the data. There has been renewed scrutiny of traffic stops since the 4 April killing of Lyoya, an unarmed 26-year-old in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was shot in the back of the head after a struggle with an officer who pulled him over for having a mismatched license plate. Lyoya’s death is the most recent that has captured headlines and calls for change. Daunte Wright, 20, was killed after being pulled over for an expired registration tag and a hanging air freshener; Sandra Bland, 28, was stopped for failing to signal; and 32-year-old Philando Castile died following a traffic stop after an officer claimed he looked like a suspect in a recent robbery, citing his “wide-set nose”. Mapping Police Violence tracks deaths reported by government and media, and categorizes a killing as a traffic case if the encounter began with a routine stop for a traffic violation. It does not classify deaths as traffic violations if the individual was pulled over for other reasons. Black drivers make up 28% of those killed in traffic stops, while accounting for only 13% of the population. Research has consistently found that Black and brown drivers are more likely to be stopped, searched and subjected to force. “There are millions of encounters between the police and the public because of traffic enforcement, and many result in negative experiences – people being searched, arrested, and having force used against them, Sinyangwe said. He noted that the majority of killings by police involved either traffic stops, mental health episodes, welfare checks, nonviolent and low-level offenses or no alleged crime – all circumstances in which there should have been an alternative response to armed officers. Some of the deadly traffic cases tracked this year include a Miami man stopped for an expired tag, a Milwaukee man accused of failing to signal and an Oregon man who allegedly failed to stop while entering a roadway from a parking lot. In some cases, people are killed as they attempt to flee or after the stop uncovers a weapon. Police press releases often fail to disclose the reason for the stop, instead focusing on the individual’s actions once they were pulled over. The New York Times recently documented more than 400 cases over five years in which US police pulled over and killed motorists who were unarmed and not under pursuit for a violent crime. Since George Floyd’s murder, local governments across the US have pursued reforms meant to restrict traffic stops and limit unnecessary encounters between police and motorists. “I see no reason why somebody who has bad tags needs an armed response,” said Amity Dimock, whose son Kobe Dimock-Heisler, 21, was killed by police during a mental health crisis in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, the same city where Wright was fatally shot. “Police are trained for combat, for adverse situations, and I think that’s where we should leave them.” Brooklyn Center passed a resolution last year, named after Dimock-Heisler and Wright, to create an unarmed civilian division responsible for certain traffic violations and to send trained clinicians to mental health emergencies. “This is about putting the most effective responders into these situations,” Dimock said. But the process of implementing these changes has been slow and is still in an early phase, she added. Officials in Lansing, Michigan, adopted new guidelines in July 2020 meant to restrict traffic stops for matters unrelated to public safety, such as a cracked windshield. Police stopped significantly fewer people, but the major disparity impacting Black drivers persisted, said local councilman Brian T Jackson. “It’s reduced the chances that these bad encounters can happen, he said, noting the policy was not binding and officers still had wide discretion to make stops. “We should only be stopping people when there’s a legitimate safety reason.” In 2020, Berkeley, California, initially proposed a sweeping reform that would put unarmed civilians in charge of traffic, but state law has prevented that overhaul. The city instead restricted stops for equipment violations, but Sinyangwe’s analysis found that the number of overall stops has remained fairly steady. He said he was concerned that cities were “targeting a very narrow category of traffic stops”, especially since the majority of deadly stops in the database stem from “moving violations”, such as speeding or driving through a stop sign. Some progressive prosecutors have also worked to limit unjustified traffic stops. Sarah George, an elected Vermont prosecutor who heads the Chittenden county state’s attorney’s office, implemented a policy in December to decline charges in cases that stem from a “non public safety” traffic stop (such as an officer who found drugs during a stop for a broken taillight). “My hope is that if police know that a drug possession case is not going to be prosecuted, maybe they’ll direct the resources elsewhere,” she said, adding that minor violations are often issues of poverty, such as inability to pay for new registration. “There are just a lot of traffic violations that do not need law enforcement attention, that shouldn’t even be traffic tickets and certainly shouldn’t be justification to pull somebody over.”",News/US news," US police have killed nearly 600 people in traffic stops since 2017, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/us-police-violence-traffic-stop-data

4/21/2022,"Diana Celestine was let in on the secret about 10 years ago. Then an IT consultant in Charlotte, North Carolina, she’d made a passing comment to a friend lamenting the state of her love life – something along the lines of “I’ll probably never get married”. Celestine had just been joking around. But her friend stopped her, deadly serious. “If you speak it into the world, it brings it in,” she said. “It was the first time I’d ever thought that your words and thoughts might make any difference,” Celestine tells me now over Zoom. At the time, The Secret had just swept the globe. The 2006 book by the Australian television producer Rhonda Byrne popularized the pseudo-scientific “law of attraction” as self-help. It claimed that it was possible to change your life through the power of thought alone, and that success was as simple as “ask, believe, receive”. Fifteen years ago, The Secret spread by word of mouth, understood as another quasi-spiritual celebrity fad. But today, its principles are freely voiced in a popular practice called “manifesting”, the catch-all term given to the practice of visualizing an outcome to make it a reality. Though interest had been mounting since 2018, the practice’s popularity picked up through the pandemic when the 369 method – a numerology-focused form of asking the universe for what you want – went viral on TikTok in March 2020. Public figures as disparate as the UFC champion Conor McGregor, Booker winner Bernardine Evaristo, a host of pop stars and even Donald Trump have credited the principles of The Secret with their success. Model Cara Delevingne recently claimed to be manifesting a baby. Even outlets that might ordinarily be skeptical of celebrity woo seem to be entertaining the idea: the Financial Times recently published “the case for manifesting”. In the UK, a new guide touting seven steps to one’s “best life” has become an instant bestseller. For many, manifesting is a pragmatic combination of goal-setting and positive psychology. For others, it falls somewhere between quantum physics and spirituality, with results that are nothing short of miraculous. Nearly every method asks that you act as though what you’re attempting to manifest – love, money, a promotion or just a text back – is already true. But there is a line. Indulged without action, manifesting may be little more than magical thinking. It could untether us from our sense of agency – and even from reality. In 2004, everything that could go wrong did go wrong for Rhonda Byrne. She was struggling with her health, at work and in her relationships; her father had just died, and her business was in significant debt. “I had no idea how I could solve these things,” she said in an interview last year. Byrne was desperate. Then her daughter Hayley gave her a copy of The Science of Getting Rich: a 1910 guide to “wealth attraction” through willpower, by Wallace Wattles. Wattles had been inspired by the so-called “New Thought” spiritual movement of the 19th century, which alleged that health and prosperity could be unlocked with the power of the mind. Distraught, Byrne sat down to read. “Ninety minutes later, my entire life had changed,” she said. “I knew that we had the power to manifest our lives, in whatever way we wanted.” Byrne decided to put it to the test by discarding her reading glasses as the physical manifestation of her “belief” that eyesight deteriorates with age. She started visualizing herself reading in low light. Within three days, Byrne said, she didn’t need glasses at all: “That was the level of my knowing, and my belief.” Secretly, Byrne start to study New Thought leaders and the supportive universal energies they described. From there, she linked it to just about every feat through history, from Plato to Beethoven, Edison to Einstein. “Wherever I looked, this information was there,” she said. Byrne felt as if she had uncovered “a great secret – the secret to life”. And she wanted to share it with the world. “There isn’t a single thing that you cannot do with this knowledge,” she writes in her book’s foreword. “It doesn’t matter who you are or where you are, The Secret can give you whatever you want.” Of course, The Secret had no scientific foundation. Yet when it was published in 2006, people wanted to believe. Its promise of personal success was particularly attractive through the Great Recession. By 2009, The Secret had grossed $300m in sales, boosted by a rapturous endorsement from Oprah Winfrey, who credited the law of attraction with her breakout role in The Color Purple. “The message needs to go further,” Winfrey said. “… You really can change your own reality with the way you think.” Fifteen years on, The Secret’s staying power remains remarkable. A Netflix film starring Katie Holmes was released in 2020, alongside a fifth follow-up book by Byrne. And on The Secret’s website, success stories continue to pile up at a rate of more than a hundred a month. Soon after her friend told her about the power of the mind, Celestine started paying more attention to her thoughts, “just in case”. But it wasn’t until a few years later, when she was living in New York and having difficulties at work, that she started trying to change them. Celestine had been reading You Are a Badass by Jen Sincero, another word-of-mouth bestseller with similar teachings to The Secret, without the mysticism. “There’s no big mystery to this stuff,” Sincero writes. “If you want something badly enough, and decide that you will get it, you will.” Celestine describes herself as practical, even skeptical by nature. But back then, she was burnt out, isolated and overwhelmed. What did she have to lose? She slowly began to work on her mindset. At first, she found even thinking positively – “today’s gonna be a good day” – to be a challenge. But soon, she says, she started having better days. I like Celestine. She is easy to talk to, and with her wayward brown curls and peach tank top, she radiates warmth, even in the bare bedroom she’s Zooming from. But she also seems more hesitant than I had expected from the ass-kicking “transformation enthusiast” described on her lifestyle blog, The Chic Life. The woman I interview is understandably conscious of being made to sound like a kook before an unsympathetic audience. Manifesting, she says, combines the practical, and the woo: “You know what you want to do, but you have to do something about it.” There is in fact some sound science to support the power of positive thinking. Setting aside the dizzying discussion of frequencies, energies and vibrations, The Secret preaches mindfulness and gratitude – both of which have been shown to make a measurable difference to our day-to-day life. Likewise, specificity and visualization have been shown to support us in achieving our goals. In this way, manifesting can boil down to basic psychology: you can’t achieve what you don’t believe to be possible, and your thoughts and emotions influence your experience. Where it diverges, however, is on causation – and the guarantee of results. According to its practitioners, manifesting does not just prime you for success: it creates it, anything from a successful date to sell-out stadium tours. (After reading The Secret, around 2015, Celestine started by trying to manifest a parking spot – “and I did,” she says. “And it was a pretty good one.”) After separating from her husband a few years later, Celestine invested further in what she now groups as “vibration-raising activities” – meditation, gratitude journaling, restorative yoga and listening to music at Solfeggio frequencies, which are said to put you in harmony with the law of attraction. She then decided she wanted to manifest a new relationship – and a new life across the country in San Francisco, to boot. It worked, Celestine says. In mid-2018, “I did manifest a boyfriend. I did manifest moving to San Francisco. I did manifest a job there. And I did have a luxury apartment.” Well done, I say, and meaning it. “Thank you!” She beams. “The funny thing was, the boyfriend I ended up manifesting – he moved to San Francisco, on his own, a month before I did.” What does it look like in practice, I ask, to manifest a boyfriend? “The same way that people might learn differently, they might manifest differently,” she replies. She herself made a love-themed vision board, and a list of the qualities of her desired partner. She also worked to challenge disadvantageous thoughts such as “there are no good men” and “dating post-divorce is hard”. Celestine likens the process to hypnosis, influencing your subconscious mind. “If you want to manifest a boyfriend, but you think guys don’t like you, you’re at a mismatch, right? Your subconscious starts sabotaging you,” she says. “Whereas if you are focusing on your ideal outcome, and getting rid of limiting beliefs so that you believe that of course you’re worthy of a great boyfriend – now everything is going to be aligned.” Ican’t help but feel that Celestine is selling herself short: the universe didn’t set up her dating profile, or go on dates. But it seems that at least the thought of supportive energy on her side made her feel able to put herself out there. That is exactly manifesting’s power, says Gala Darling, an author, entrepreneur and self-described “manifestation queen” based in Los Angeles. “It’s a way to make women comfortable with owning their desires,” she says. “I think a lot of women struggle.” In resistance to this, Darling – with her candy-colored tattoos, hot pink hair and unrelenting optimism – gives her rule for life as “feeling good is your job”. Darling came to manifesting through an accupressure practice known as “emotional freedom technique” (EFT), which professes to alleviate psychological distress through tapping fingers on the body. (There is little empirical support for this, though a 2016 review suggested it may help with anxiety.) Darling says daily tapping quickly rid her of her “limiting beliefs” about herself, paving the way for her manifested transformation from postal service worker in her native New Zealand to full-time “high-vibe honey” in Los Angeles. Last year she achieved her long-held dream of owning a pink Lamborghini – though she shrugs it off now. “I had visualized it so much that it wasn’t even shocking or surprising,” Darling says. Darling’s online courses cost from $90 to $550, and are bought overwhelmingly by women. She sees manifesting as an inherently feminine practice, countering a more masculine approach to success and “just grinding it”. But for it to be effective, she says women have to believe themselves to be deserving. “There is so much that comes up for us internally around worth: ‘Is this acceptable, am I allowed to want these things? Is it selfish?’” She says people mostly turn to manifesting to give them confidence – “the ability to ask someone for their number, to wear what they really want to wear, or the power to quit their soul-sucking job and start their own business”. Throughout the process, she aims to lead by example: “My manifestation is not a selfish act … because my followers feel empowered and emboldened as well.” The line is evocative of one of her celebrity clients: the “original Girlboss”, Sophia Amoruso, who was eventually discredited for overseeing a toxic work environment and leading the Nasty Gal brand into bankruptcy. I ask Darling if external circumstances, such as poverty or a pandemic, constrain what’s possible with manifesting. “I think they can be an impediment, but … I think the best thing is that we can focus on what we can control,” she says. “And what we can control is the environments that we put ourselves in and the amount of personal responsibility that we take.” None of that is easy, she adds. “Some people probably think manifesting is sending a wish into the universe … For me, it’s really about having discipline and plans.” For that reason, Darling disapproves of coaches who encourage people to spend beyond their means – and not just because it’s irresponsible. “One of the things I’ve learned about manifestation is that being in a place of desperation never works.” The trouble is, it’s from a place of desperation that manifesting often holds the most appeal. Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck self-help series, has been open about his loathing for The Secret, calling it “delusional positive thinking” and “a psychological pyramid scheme” which attracts only “the most desperate and gullible”. “Simply changing the way you see things from ‘always shitty’ to ‘always great’ would probably have a pretty big impact in a lot of areas for some people,” he wrote in 2015. “But at some point, you actually have to do something.” Spending too much time visualizing your dream can actually prevent you from taking steps towards it. Over 20 years of research, Gabriele Oettingen, a professor of psychology at the University of New York, has established a powerful link between picturing success and inaction. While daydreams might be good for a temporary mood boost and to explore the possibilities of the future, it can also drain our energy to the extent that there is an associated drop in blood pressure, Oettingen says. Manifesting can also encourage us to invest in a delusion. Candace Charee, a manifesting coach, preaches the “law of assumption”, first articulated by the 20th-century mystic Neville Goddard. Charee describes it as the level up from the law of attraction, assuming that mindset trumps action. “There’s no ‘if it’s meant to be’ – you are calling the shots … Anything you assume long enough, or that you persist in long enough, hardens into a fact.” The only thing outside our control, Charee says, is how long it takes to see results. Her method of “neurocognitive reprogramming” (her words) was inspired by Goddard’s teachings, but is her own creation: she leads her clients in a guided meditation to access their subconscious, and returns them to a memory underpinning their personal blocks. Then, Charee says she “will implant a whole, brand new story”. Her offerings range in price from $30 for a prerecorded guided meditation, to $1,000 for an hour-long coaching package by phone. She has no scientific training or background, but says she has worked with thousands of people; many come to her after not seeing results from therapy. Listening to her talk about how she “reprogrammed” a client’s childhood memories of her father, I feel uneasy. Even her business name business, Effortless Manifesting, seems to promise a quick fix to potentially traumatic experiences, I say. Does she feel confident making those guarantees? “Obviously, nothing is guaranteed because it’s up to them to do it,” Charee replies. “They have to be ready … If they’re not, then we don’t work on that yet, because it’s not going to do any good. You have to say, ‘I’m done feeling this way.’” Would there be any circumstances where she would refuse to work with someone, or tell them their expectations were unrealistic? “I don’t think so,” says Charee, after a pause. “I have my own moral code, so if someone said, ‘Hey, I believe in murdering babies, help me manifest that,’ I would tell them to fly a kite. No one has ever come to me with that, by the way.”. I clarify: I meant if someone was to come to you with childhood abuse, for example, would you say that that was beyond your expertise? Charee seems taken aback by the question. “Right now I’m working with someone who’s dealing with that.” But most of her clients, she says, want to manifest love – and often a specific person such as an ex or a crush. On TikTok, nearly 190,000 people follow her instructional videos, some featuring her husband of just over a year as proof of her “expert” technique. They had been on and off again for years, before Charee decided to cut off contact. After 24 days of visualizing him as her husband, even setting him a place at the dinner table and journalling about their imagined day together, he got back in touch – this time, to pursue her. Now Charee’s ultimate ambition is for them to tour stadiums together, performing music and doing live onstage transformations in front of audiences of thousands. “I already have the whole thing planned out; I already know that it’s done … Like yourself, reaching out to me,” she says, warmly. “It’s not by chance.” It was not by chance, I agree – but by Google. It is no wonder that manifesting has taken off in the internet age: treating “the Universe as your catalogue” (to quote The Secret) mirrors the instant, hyper-targeted gratification we’ve come to expect. In her 2020 piece marking The Secret’s 15th anniversary, Jessica Wildfire wrote that it had given people license to focus only on their “selfish, personal desires instead of doing the hard, thankless work it takes to actually improve the world”. The law of attraction, Wildfire argued, supported people to retreat into their own reality, at the expense of social responsibility or respect for experts. Trump, she noted, is an outspoken fan of 1950s “wealth attraction” guru Norman Vincent Peale. Oettingen, the psychologist, says that if we invest too deeply into our fantasies, we risk entering “a different reality”: “It takes me away from things I do have responsibility for – to protect my family or my community, to engage in local politics … It makes people passive.” Not only that: it can make us failures. The flip side of the Secret’s message is that we alone are responsible for our money troubles, relationship troubles or even poor health. On Reddit’s Law of Attraction forum, about 220,000 subscribers describe their efforts to manifest everything, from jobs to justice for Breonna Taylor. Many ask when they can expect to see results. One person recently posted that they were close to giving up on manifesting their “dream life” following a medical diagnosis: “It’s been over five years, and nothing … I feel like I gave everything to manifesting what I want, to the point where it has driven me insane.” As Oettingen points out, daydreams are essentially “an expression of our need”. Much manifesting seems an attempt to outsource to the universe what we either feel helpless to secure for ourselves, or can’t count on society to provide – whether that’s love, housing, healthcare or financial security. In his 2007 critique, the Canadian religious scholar John Stackhouse suggested The Secret had become popular because of Christianity’s failure to connect. He saw it as taking some of the “genuinely nourishing” spirit of faith and gratitude but stripping away sacrifice and adding the “poison of self-will”. At least now, in these online communities, manifesting is also a collective effort: subscribers to r/lawofattraction grew by 39% over the 12 months to January 2022. In times of uncertainty – as in the pandemic – rituals, positive thinking and focusing on a brighter future can all bring comfort. Celestine credits manifesting with having improved her relationships, her health, her life, and seen her through difficult times. But she is also clear: it cannot triumph over an “imperfect world”. “I think it’s just really important for people, in every situation in life, to try to find the things that work for them,” she says. Early in 2021, Celestine quit her job and moved from San Francisco to South Carolina. The relationship she’d manifested had ended amicably, and she wanted to be close to her family; plus, she’d never quite recovered from burnout. Her online business has since been on the back-burner. Celestine had recently been considering a pivot from manifesting to more general health coaching, she tells me: “Now that you’ve reached out to me, I’m like, ‘Is this a sign from the universe?’” Please don’t give me that responsibility, I say – and we both laugh.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Is ‘manifesting’ dangerous magical thinking or a formula for success?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/21/is-mainfesting-real-the-secret

The scent and sight breathtaking.Bridget Mellor Every year, in late April, I head for the Malverns to savour a most spectacular display of our native bluebells. Following the western slopes of the ridge, drive south along the aptly named Jubilee Drive, a route with a breathtaking, seemingly boundless vista across the timeless Herefordshire landscape to the Black Mountains and the canvas of blue cannot be missed. Just before the Herefordshire Beacon, the cerulean slopes appear. Black Hill car park is a good place to explore from. There are refreshments at the Malvern Hills Hotel and Sally’s Cafe at British Camp.Hillary Macmillan I’ve been visiting the bluebells at the National Trust’s Emmetts Garden perched on the Greensand Ridge in west Kent a few miles from Sevenoaks every year since I was a child. The azure sea of bluebells stretches across the south-facing slopes of the Edwardian hillside gardens, which are part of ancient Scord’s Wood, an important Site of Special Scientific Interest for its flora. After you’ve admired the carpet of bluebells in the shade of the trees and the views of the Weald as far as Ashdown Forest, you can wander around the rest of the garden, with its stunning azaleas and arboretum. I always stop for lunch at the little tea room but there’s also the option to enjoy a picnic in the meadow, perfect on a sunny day.Adult £13, child £6.50Jay Gee The hollows from which were quarried the great sarsen stones of Stonehenge are softened in the spring with a magnificent bluebell display that stretches throughout the entirety of West Woods, just outside Marlborough in Wiltshire. Follow ancient paths including the West Saxon Wansdyke, or make your own way among the trees. There is also a neolithic long barrow. Access by car, bicycle or foot is easy and free, although a local charity usually accepts donations over the bank holiday weekend, opening the road through the woods for full vehicle access in return. Those who have experienced West Woods’ bluebells make a visit an annual adventure. Unforgettable, especially at dawn or dusk.Helen Buttery To the south of Glasgow, in Castlemilk Park, you’ll experience an abundance of birdsong, the heady aroma of wild garlic and see roe deer prance through a cherished bluebell wood. But the city has another wonderful bluebell wood worth exploring: just north of Glasgow is the ancient forest of Garscadden, and the azure and purple haze of a mature bluebell wood. Both woods have well-worn paths, ruins to explore and an abundance of wildlife. Both are free to enter, providing much-needed respite from the stresses of city life.The Jhunds The Lake District is well known for its bluebell woods, but you can avoid the crowds by going to Caldbeck. Just within the Lake District national park, it’s unspoiled, unique and underrated. The walk from here to Hesket Newmarket along the River Caldbeck takes in a steep woodland. Here you’ll find that unbeatable combination of bluebells and wild garlic, the smell of which lingers above the river. Both villages have charming tearooms, and the community-owned Old Crown in Hesket Newmarket is especially good for a locally brewed ale.

4/21/2022,"On the evening of 15 February 2007, a team of five police officers in Cameron county, Texas, began an interrogation of a Mexican-American mother whom they suspected of having murdered her two-year-old child. Melissa Lucio was in a vulnerable condition. She was pregnant with twins and in the grip of shock and grief. Just two hours earlier her youngest child Mariah had been pronounced dead having fallen unconscious. The officers did not let the suspect’s vulnerabilities get in the way of the inquisition. Over almost six hours, stretching late into the night, they applied to Lucio the notorious “Reid Technique” – a controversial interrogation method that has led to numerous wrongful convictions in the US. As trained to do under the system, the officers put their faces within inches of Lucio’s, screaming at her that she “had to know” what had happened to her child. They had “lots of evidence” that she was to blame for the death, they said, forcing her to view photographs of the girl’s lifeless body. Then, as the Reid method dictates, they abruptly switched tone. They gently reassured her that she could “put this to rest” if she would only confess to having caused the toddler’s death. Lucio insisted over 100 times that night that she was innocent. But after more than five hours of aggressive “maximization” and “minimization”, as the technique is known, she reached break point. She began to repeat the phrases that the investigators had effectively coached her to say. “I don’t know what you want me to say,” she told them. “I’m responsible for it … I guess I did it.” That coerced confession was the core evidence presented at Lucio’s subsequent trial. It was critical to the jury’s guilty verdict, and to the death sentence that followed. Next Wednesday, pending a last-minute stay, Lucio, 52, will be executed for a crime that significant evidence suggests she did not commit. Not only that, but significant evidence also suggests that the crime for which she will be strapped onto a gurney and injected with lethal drugs never happened in the first place. A mounting body of intelligence – much of it never heard at trial, some of it actively suppressed by prosecutors – points to a very different conclusion. Mariah was not beaten to death by her mother, she died of internal injuries from an accidental fall. As the 27 April execution date approaches, concern that an innocent woman is about to be sent to the death chamber has reached fever pitch. Strange bedfellows have come together to call for the execution to be delayed in an eruption of disquiet that has rarely been witnessed in such intensity in Texas. “There are so many layers of injustice here that it has drawn the support of unlikely allies. People who may believe very strongly in the death penalty are speaking out because they are disturbed that this case has gone terribly wrong,” said Sandra Babcock, a member of Lucio’s defense team and a Cornell law school professor. Among those calling for a stay of execution are a bipartisan group of 103 members of the Texas legislature – including 32 Republican members of the House and eight Republican state senators. That is an extraordinary display of cross-party unity for such a toxically divided assembly. Hundreds of religious bodies, along with women’s and domestic violence advocacy groups, have joined celebrities such as Kim Kardashian to plead with the Republican governor Greg Abbott and the state’s board of pardons to intervene. A documentary about the case, The State of Texas v Melissa, was released in 2020. Five of the jurors who convicted Lucio have also called for a reprieve. They argue that if they had known at the time what has since emerged the outcome would have been different. The many legal missteps that lie behind Lucio’s death sentence are laid out in a 266-page petition released this week that calls for a postponement of the execution and a new trial. The prisoner’s lawyers begin by exploring the wealth of evidence that Mariah died by mishap rather than in a brutal murder. As Lucio was being interrogated by Cameron county detectives, in a separate room in the police station some of her other children (she had nine at that time) were also being questioned. They told investigators that their mother had never been abusive or violent in any way. The children also said that two days before Mariah died, they had seen their sibling accidentally fall down a steep flight of stairs on the outside of the house they were renting. Lucio, who had been busy getting the children ready for school, found the girl at the bottom of the stairs crying. Over the next 48 hours family witnesses said that Mariah showed signs of distress, including sleeping long hours and being listless. None of that evidence, which could support the diagnosis of an internal brain injury caused by the fall, was presented at trial. Nor did the jury hear that Mariah had a medical history of difficulty walking that had resulted in previous documented tumbles. Two days after falling down the stairs, Mariah stopped breathing and became unresponsive. Lucio dialed 911; paramedics tried to revive the child but she died before reaching the hospital. Babcock told the Guardian that a sequence of mistakes were made by police, the prosecutor and expert witnesses that all flowed from the same source: an initial misreading of the suspect’s mindset. Lucio had been brought up in an extremely poor and troubled family in Lubbock, Texas, in which she had been subjected to sexual assault from the age of six and at 16 had become a child bride in a bid to escape the abuse. Long years of domestic violence ensued. Her cumulative experiences – never told to the jury – made her singularly vulnerable to making a false confession in the course of a coercive interrogation. It also helped explain the bemusement of first responders when they turned up at her house having answered the 911 call. They found her slouched on the floor, where she showed no sign of emotion or crying. Babcock said that was the classic posture of a victim of domestic violence triggered by a traumatic event. “She was numb, in shock, she was dissociating.” But to police officers and other first responders, she came across as a callous and cold-hearted individual who appeared unmoved by her child’s death. “They saw a woman who didn’t fit their model of how a grieving mother should behave, and they immediately jumped to the conclusion that this was a woman who had something to hide.” At trial, one of the Texas rangers who was first on the scene told the jury that he had found Lucio with her head down, making no eye contact and showing no apparent concern about Mariah. “Right there and then, I knew she did something. That’s one of the most common clues – someone with their shoulders slouched forward: they’re hiding the truth,” he said. That testimony was false. Several scientific studies have shown that you cannot deduce anything about a suspect’s guilt or innocence from their body language or facial mannerisms. The medical examiner who carried out the autopsy, Dr Norma Farley, showed a similar willingness to prejudge Lucio’s guilt. In her testimony, Farley made several critical statements that have been shown to be scientifically inaccurate. She said that bruising on Mariah’s body must have been caused by a “homicidal” severe beating. False. A medical review of the autopsy reports criticized the medical examiner for failing to detect clear signs that the child had a blood coagulation disorder that would have produced extensive bruising throughout the body. Farley said that Mariah’s injuries had to have been inflicted within 24 hours of her death – a significant detail as it ruled out as cause of death the fall on the staircase two days before. That was false too. A medical expert who reviewed the evidence pointed out that it is well established that physical manifestations of an injury can take several days to appear. Farley also told the jury that at least two bite marks had been found on Mariah’s back and that they were caused by an adult’s teeth suggesting a brutal and painful attack. False. Bite mark analysis has been thoroughly discredited. Numerous scientific studies have shown that there is no way to categorically identify a wound on a body as being a bite mark. Nor is there any way to identify from the wound who might have caused the abrasion. Dr Janice Ophoven, the pediatric forensic pathologist who reviewed the Lucio materials, concluded: “The investigation into Mariah’s death appears to have been significantly prejudiced… and creates a risk of serious miscarriage of justice in this case.” This week Lucio was placed on “execution watch” – a system of 24-hour surveillance that all death row inmates are subject to in Texas in their last seven days before execution. Prison authorities say it is to avoid the risk of suicide or self harm, but Babcock told the Guardian that Lucio found the arrangement “very upsetting”. “She finds the idea of being observed 24/7 extremely stressful, and every day that passes is one day closer to her possible execution. The terror is real.” Both the court of criminal appeals in Austin, Texas, and the state’s board of pardons are considering Lucio’s plea. A stay of execution is possible, given the many glaring flaws in how she came to be put on death row. Lucio is a woman of deep faith who hopes and prays that her life will be spared, Babcock said. But she also knows there is no certainty – not in the death penalty and especially not when a state as relentless as Texas is out to take her life. “This is the cruelty of alternating between hope and despair,” Babcock said. “It is torture, and every day is more torturous than the last.”",News/World news,Texas mother is set for execution as evidence suggests she did not kill her child,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/texas-woman-death-row-melissa-lucio
4/21/2022,"NDC Wales are a very likable bunch of dancers to spend a couple of hours with, a versatile group of 10 distinct young performers in a triple bill that shows their range. The most easily engaging piece is Andrea Costanzo Martini’s Wild Thoughts, set partly to Matthew Herbert’s track Foreign Bodies, made with sounds sampled from the human body. After the dancers have amusingly catalogued their body parts in intricate rhythm, a rumbling of innards sets off a new skein of movement, as if led by gurgling intestines. There is plenty of dancing skill, as well as entertainment value. The most ambitious work is Codi, by Anthony Matsena, with input from his writer brother Kel. The fast-rising Matsena brothers were born in Zimbabwe and brought up in Wales, and here they delve into Welsh mining history. The stage is sometimes lit only by the dancers’ head torches, and the result is murky in more ways than one. There are fleeting scenes – pride, anger and strident protest, a draconian foreman, voices talking of being trapped, bodies piled in a heap: the Aberfan disaster instantly comes to mind but the details of the stories Matsena is drawing on are not revealed. In parallel, Matsena harnesses the energy of the dancers in forthright unison, using the glitch and pop and hard accents of hip-hop, ending on a note of triumph. Most unpredictable is Caroline Finn’s Ludo, a piece that feels like an inventive day in the studio, props being tossed at the dancers to play with: a spoon becomes the instrument of a game of control and spite; a gramophone is a comical, conical hat, and a set of oversized costumes by Rike Zöllner are refashioned into stretchy alien forms, ballgowns and straitjackets. It’s the kind of open-ended, absurdist play that has no great purpose, escalating to confidently orchestrated chaos or broken by an interlude where they dance with big expansive angles and lurching giant steps. Whether it ignites the viewer’s own sense of playfulness or is akin to watching a bunch of four-year-olds raid a dressing-up box is debatable, but either way, this Cardiff clan are good company.

4/21/2022,"Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla and the world’s richest person, is set to collect a $23bn (£17.6bn) bonus after the Californian electric car company’s first-quarter results exceeded performance targets. Musk, who is already sitting on an estimated $249bn fortune, is in line for the bonus share payout after Tesla hit share price and financial growth milestones in its earnings on Wednesday night. Tesla made an adjusted profit of $5bn on revenue of $18.8bn in the first quarter of the year – an 81% increase on the same period a year earlier. The results, combined with the growth in Tesla’s share price performance, mean Musk has hit targets that should lead to a bonus share payout worth about $23bn. The company outlined an extraordinary deal for Musk in 2018 that would pay him an unprecedented $55.8bn (£40bn) bonus if he built the business into a $650bn company within a decade. He achieved that milestone early, in January 2020. Tesla today has a market value of $1.1tn, following a 1,300% rise in its share price since the target was set in January 2018. It means Musk, who collects no salary, should now have unlocked the final three parts of the 12-tranche bonus scheme. Each tranche gives Musk the right to buy 8.4m Tesla shares at $70, a huge discount on the current $977 share price. His profit on each tranche could be $7.7bn or a combined value of $23bn. The payments need to be signed off by the board, and he must hold on to the shares for five years before selling. Musk, who is attempting to buy Twitter for more than $43bn, said he was not in talks with Tesla’s board over a new bonus scheme after completing the 2018 deal early. “There are no discussions underway about incremental compensation for me,” he said on the company’s earning call. “The future is very exciting,” Musk said in the call with investors. “I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla than I am right now.” ",News/Business,Elon Musk stands to collect $23bn bonus as Tesla beats targets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/21/elon-musk-stands-to-collect-23bn-bonus-as-tesla-surges-ahead
4/21/2022,"Rishi Sunak is in Washington DC this week to discuss the state of the global economy with his fellow finance ministers. But he is clearly keener on listening to some of them than others. Had the chancellor not been on a plane on his way across the Atlantic, he would have joined a walkout by the UK delegation – led by the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey – when Russia’s representative started speaking at a gathering of the G20. The protest by the Brits – along with the Americans and the Canadians – at a forum that includes the world’s leading developed and developing economies won’t make the slightest difference to the Kremlin. For all that, it is a symbolic gesture that matters. The International Monetary Fund issued a warning this week about the risk of the war accelerating the fragmentation of the world into rival economic blocs, and here is an example of it. China made it clear it didn’t think Russia should be excluded from G20 meetings, as did the country currently in the chair: Indonesia. The IMF is worried about the risk of a return to the 1930s. It fears the current trend towards deglobalisation will result in trade barriers going up, countries adopting their own technological standards – and rival reserve currencies emerging to challenge the supremacy of the US dollar. Bad all round, in other words. But hang on a minute. Greater international cooperation is a good thing, to be sure. There are global problems that need global solutions, as the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, rightly noted at a press conference yesterday. Yet there isn’t much evidence that the current model of globalisation is much good at solving them. As the IMF itself notes in its latest world economic outlook, the debt-relief process is unfit for purpose. A properly functioning globalisation would have resulted in a fairer distribution of Covid-19 shots rather than vaccine apartheid. There would be more effective action to tackle the biggest collective problem of all: the climate crisis. The mistake is to see globalisation as synonymous with multilateralism rather than the particular variant of international capitalism that has emerged in the three decades since the collapse of communism. Funnily enough, countries managed to find ways of trading with each other in the years before the Berlin Wall came down. China, the big winner from the past 30 years, has seen a marked reduction in poverty but has achieved it by retaining strong control over its economic policy and movements of capital. Wary of the sort of shock treatment administered to Russia in the early 1990s, Beijing has liberalised its economy in its own way and at its own pace. India has liberalised cautiously. The rhetoric of globalisation is all about smooth-running and efficient supply chains. An international division of labour and the lack of any controls on capital moves production to where labour costs are lower, and helps keep prices in the shops down. But as we are now finding out, there is no guarantee that long and complex supply chains are an impregnable defence against inflation. On the contrary, when global production lines get gummed up – either due to a post-pandemic surge in demand or the shockwaves from war – cost of living pressures surface. The past couple of years have brought home to governments the benefits of self-sufficiency: be it in food, fuel, personal protective equipment or Covid-19 drugs. Moreover, despite all the hype, globalisation has not led to faster growth and more rapid advances in living standards for most of those living in the UK and other developed nations. For the rich, of course, it has been a different story. They captured the gains from global growth and salted them away either in offshore tax havens or – in the case of Russian oligarchs – in the London property market. In the late 1990s, I co-wrote a book with my colleague Dan Atkinson warning that sooner or later there would be a backlash against the insecurity that would result from turbo-charged, post-cold war capitalism. At the time, globalisation was all the rage – with politicians of the left as well as the right – and the book was not exactly a bestseller. Our critics told us to wake up and smell the coffee. These days, the mood has changed somewhat. Labour and Conservative politicians competed with each other to condemn P&O and its decision to sack British seafarers and replace them with cheaper foreign staff. The courts have recognised that workers in the gig economy need greater protection from the “flexible” labour market. There has been a rethink of the wisdom of being dependent on foreign energy and of allowing China to take stakes in strategically important sectors. It is no longer seen as ludicrously quaint to trumpet the need for a bigger manufacturing base. Let’s be clear: the drift towards deglobalisation does not mean a retreat into North Korean-style autarky. Nor does it mean the death of globalisation, because countries will always cooperate when it suits them. There is, though, a recognition that countries were better able to command their own economic destiny pre-globalisation and less prone to financial crises. Transporting goods halfway round the world is expensive when energy prices are high, and unsustainable to boot. The process of re-onshoring production was under way long before Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine. But the prime reason for the rethink of globalisation is political. The age of insecurity has arrived and it has prompted a predictable backlash from voters unhappy about the rising cost of living, falling living standards and rising inequality. The current model of globalisation has been shaped by deliberate policy choices and what comes next will also be shaped by deliberate policy choices. If that allows governments to take back control of their economies and to be better able to protect their citizens then there is only one thing to say: bring it on.

4/21/2022,"A 91-year-old holocaust survivor died while sheltering from Russian strikes during the siege of Mariupol, her daughter has said. Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova died on 4 April while sheltering in a freezing basement without water, in a grim echo of how she had hidden in a basement from the Nazis when she was 10 years old, her daughter Larissa told Chabad.org. Obiedkova, the second holocaust survivor known to have died during Russia’s war in Ukraine, “didn’t deserve such a death”, said Larissa, who was with her at the time. Larissa described the conditions in Mariupol as “living like animals”. “There was no water, no electricity, no heat – and it was unbearably cold,” she said. Her mother was ill and immobile. “Every time a bomb fell, the entire building shook,” Larissa said. “My mother kept saying she didn’t remember anything like this during the Great Patriotic War [second world war].” Obiedkova avoided capture by hiding in a basement when German forces occupied the city of Mariupol in October 1941. The Nazis rounded up the city’s Jewish population, including her mother, who was taken and shot, along with the whole of her mother’s family. Nazi forces killed between 9,000 and 16,000 Jews in ditches on the outskirts of Mariupol. Obiedkova’s father, who wasn’t Jewish, managed to get his daughter admitted into a hospital, where she spent two years after the Nazis were convinced she was Greek and not Jewish. Mariupol was liberated by the Soviet army in September 1943. Her daughter said that a VHS tape of Obiedkova giving an interview in 1998 about her life was destroyed when their home was destroyed. Larissa and her husband buried her mother in a public park near the Azov Sea. Rabbi Mendel Cohen of Mariupol described Obiedkova as “a kind, joyous woman, a special person who will forever remain in our hearts” who had “lived through unimaginable horrors”. Boris Romantschenko, another Ukrainian holocaust survivor, was killed during the current conflict in March. The 96-year-old had survived a string of Nazi concentration camps including Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, and was killed by an explosion during Russia’s assault on the city of Kharkiv.",News/World news,"Ukrainian holocaust survivor, 91, dies during Mariupol siege",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/ukrainian-holocaust-survivor-91-dies-during-mariupol-siege
4/21/2022,"A 31-year-old woman in Spain caught Covid twice within 20 days, the shortest known gap between infections, scientists have reported. Researchers in Spain gave details of the healthcare worker, who tested positive a few days before Christmas in December 2021 and again in January 2022. The case is further evidence that the Omicron variant can evade immunity from even recent previous infections. The woman, who was fully vaccinated and had received a booster shot 12 days earlier, tested positive in a PCR staff screening test at work on 20 December. She didn’t develop any symptoms, and self-isolated for 10 days before returning to work. On 10 January 2022, just 20 days after first testing positive, she developed a cough, fever and felt generally unwell and did another PCR test. This was also positive. Whole genome sequencing showed that the patient had been infected by two different Covid variants. Her first infection was with the Delta variant and the second was with the Omicron variant, which is known to be more infectious and can evade immunity from past infections and vaccination. Dr Gemma Recio, of the Institut Català de la Salut in Tarragona and one of the study’s authors, said: “This case highlights the potential of the Omicron variant to evade the previous immunity acquired either from a natural infection with other variants or from vaccines.” She added that the case underlined the importance of genomic surveillance. “Such monitoring will help detect variants with the ability to partially evade the immune response,” she said. Reinfections are recorded in the UK, but require 90 days between positive tests. Official figures suggest that nearly 900,000 people in England had potentially been infected twice with Covid up to the start of April. However, the number is not exact because only whole-genome sequencing can pinpoint whether infections are caused by different variants, and not all infections are reported. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “This case is not particularly surprising, though the gap between infections is particularly short. We have known for some months that reinfections will occur. The Omicron variant with its escape mutations has made reinfections even more likely.” Now that Omicron is the dominant variant, it is possible that prior infection with Omicron will make reinfection – especially so quickly – less likely. Previously scientists had predicted that as Covid-19 moves into an endemic phase, reinfections are likely to occur within a range of three months to five years. “We can expect further waves of infection especially during winter even without new variants,” said Hunter. “Fortunately the evidence is that immunity to severe disease is more robust than immunity to infection. So even though reinfections will continue to occur for many years, we will see fewer and fewer severe illnesses and deaths with time.” Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said: “While it is difficult to extrapolate from a single case, this report highlights the ability of the Omicron variant, and its sub-variants, to reinfect even in those individuals who are fully vaccinated … This accounts for the extremely high levels of infection we have experienced in the UK.”",News/World news,"Woman, 31, catches Covid twice within three weeks in Spain",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/woman-31-catches-covid-twice-within-21-days-spain
