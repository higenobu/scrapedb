3/14/2022,"A senior Republican senator on Sunday urged the US and Nato to “close the skies” over Ukraine, hours after a logistics hub and training base for foreign fighters 11 miles from the Polish border was struck by Russian forces, killing 35. “The message coming loud and clear is close the skies,” said Rob Portman, a senator from Ohio who is on a visit to Poland. “Because the skies are where the bombs are coming, whether it’s the missile attacks or the airplane attacks or with artillery.” The US intelligence community has assessed that any attempt to create a no-fly zone would risk an escalation of the conflict. The US has also turned down a Polish offer to supply jets to Ukraine via an American airbase in Germany. Asked if supplying Ukraine with Russian-made MiG-29s could trigger a third world war, Portman told CNN’s State of the Union he “didn’t know why that would be true”. “The Russians have complained about everything,” he said. “Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war.” Russia, he said, “complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes. We have given [Ukraine] helicopters. “… What we have heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want [the MiG planes] badly. They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. So I don’t understand why we’re not doing it.” Portman welcomed an indication from Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, that anti-aircraft systems could be provided. Sullivan repeated Joe Biden’s opposition to the transfer of “offensive” weapons while underlining US commitment to the supply of “defensive” arms. The adviser told CBS’s Face the Nation the US and allies “believe in our capacity to continue to flow substantial amounts of military assistance, weapons and supplies to the front in Ukraine. “We have been successful in doing so thus far and we believe that we have a system in place that will allow us to continue to do so, notwithstanding the Russian threats.” Russia claimed the strike on the Yavoriv base was against foreign fighters and weapons. The US defense department spokesman, John Kirby, told ABC’s This Week no Americans had been at the facility. “We had left, as you know, several weeks ago,” he said. But Kirby reiterated that the US and allies would “continue to flow and to move and to reposition forces and capabilities along Nato’s eastern flank to make sure that we can defend every inch of Nato territory if we need to. “We’ve made it very clear to Russia that Nato territory will be defended not just by the United States, but by our allies. “US troops are not going to be fighting in Ukraine and there’s a good reason for that because the United States getting involved in combat in Ukraine right now or over the skies of Ukraine right now leads to war with Russia.” Of calls to supply jets or announce a no-fly zone, Kirby said: “We can all understand the kind of escalatory measure that might be perceived as.” US diplomatic activity in Nato states has intensified, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and defense secretary, Loyd Austin, visiting countries close to the warzone. On Saturday, the White House approved an additional $200m of military assistance for Ukraine. “We are determined and the Ukrainians are determined to ensure that anti-tank, anti-armor, anti-air capabilities, ammunition and other forms of assistance actually do make it to the front to blunt the Russian advance,” Sullivan told NBC’s Meet the Press. “We’re coordinating the efforts of our allies and partners to do the same thing.” Last week, Biden warned of a “severe price” if Russia chose to use chemical or biological weapons. Sullivan said Russian claims about supposed Ukrainian bio-weapons labs signaled that Moscow could be preparing to do so. “When Russia starts accusing other countries of potentially doing something, it’s a good tell that they may be on the cusp of doing it themselves,” he said. “What we’re here to do is to deny them the capacity to have a false flag operation to blame this on the Ukrainians or on us, to take away their pretext and to make the world understand that if chemical weapons are used in Ukraine, it is the Russians who will have used them. And the response will, as the president said, be severe.” Sullivan will meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome next week. Sullivan said the US was determined to enforce the economic consequences of Russia’s invasion and would respond to any attempts to work around western sanctions. “We have made it clear to not just Beijing but every country in the world that if they think that they can basically bail Russia out, they can give Russia a workaround to the sanctions that we’ve imposed, they should have another thing coming because we will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses,” Sullivan told NBC. He declined to lay out what steps the US and allies might take. “We will communicate that privately to China, as we have already done and will continue to do,” he said. The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, particularly around soaring energy prices, have yet to register heavily in US polls. On CNN, Portman deployed a Republican attack line, blaming Biden for not expanding domestic drilling for oil. Biden has countered that US oil companies have not exploited existing permits. A CBS poll released on Sunday found that 77% of Americans across the political spectrum are willing to pay more for gas as a result of sanctions to punish Russia. According to the poll, 69% said economic pain now might be a wise hedge against bigger problems later. Americans largely believe Russia has designs on invading other countries.",News/US news,Biden adviser rejects Republican call to ‘close skies’ over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/biden-adviser-rejects-republican-call-close-skies-over-ukraine
3/14/2022,"The gambling industry should face a new multimillion-pound statutory “addiction levy” to fund the prevention and treatment of gambling-related harm, the most senior NHS clinicians treating gambling addiction have said. Prof Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the director of the National Problem Gambling Clinic, and Dr Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service, are calling for a new independent health board to be created to tackle gambling addition. It would be funded by a statutory levy on gambling revenues on the “polluter pays principle” – where the most harmful parts of the industry pay the most. That board would oversee the spending of levy money, which could reach tens of millions of pounds a year, with a target to reduce gambling-related harm by 50% within five years, starting in 2024. In a paper for the Social Market Foundation thinktank, professor Bowden-Jones and Dr Gaskell said the current voluntary arrangements for industry support for addiction services are failing badly. “The current voluntary system has no integration of NHS services, no consistency in funding decisions, no independent evaluation of long-term impact or regulation via the Care Quality Commission, no coordinated oversight from research councils over research into harm, and serious questions have been asked about the independence of this voluntary system from the influence of the gambling industry,” they wrote. “Furthermore, decisions about the funding of healthcare services are not overseen by experts at the Department of Health and Social Care, as would be expected, but rather officials at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.” Currently, gambling companies make voluntary donations to the charity GambleAware, to fund a range of treatment services for people addicted to gambling. This voluntary deal will provide up to £100m over a four-year period. In February, NHS England severed its links with GambleAware because of concerns over the group’s connection to the gambling industry. Instead, the NHS will fully fund its own gambling services across England from 1 April. The government is reviewing the UK’s gambling laws, with proposals to be published in a white paper expected within weeks. Dr James Noyes, a senior fellow at the SMF who co-authored the paper, said the government should take the opportunity to put the prevention and treatment of gambling harm under the leadership of the DHSC, funded through a proper statutory framework. “In 2020, a House of Lords select committee report stated that it is ‘beyond belief’ that DCMS has steadfastly refused to introduce a statutory levy on the gambling industry. Yet two years on, we have still not seen any progress,” Dr Noyes said. “This is despite the fact that dozens of leading clinicians, academics and parliamentarians have called for an end to the current voluntary arrangement between DCMS, GambleAware and the gambling industry.”",News/Society,Top NHS clinicians call for ‘addiction levy’ on gambling industry,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/13/top-nhs-clinicians-call-for-addiction-levy-on-gambling-industry

3/14/2022,"Cyberflashing is to become a criminal offence, with perpetrators facing up to two years in jail under government plans to strengthen the upcoming online safety bill. Three-quarters of girls aged 12-18 have been sent unsolicited nude images of boys or men, according to research published in 2020. A revised version of the online safety bill is expected to be published the week that will include a number of new offences in addition to cyberflashing. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said: “The forthcoming online safety bill will force tech companies to stop their platforms being used to commit vile acts of cyberflashing. We are bringing the full weight on individuals who perpetrate this awful behaviour.” The move to criminalise cyberflashing in England and Wales follows recent action to criminalise upskirting, which is now a criminal offence, and a proposal this year to do the same for breastfeeding voyeurism. “Reports of cyberflashing are rising worryingly. This offence will close loopholes in the existing law and ensure that cyberflashing is treated as seriously as in-person flashing,” said Prof Penney Lewis, criminal law commissioner at the Law Commission, an independent body that reviews laws in England and Wales. Other offences in the bill are designed to punish digital “pile-ons”, sending threatening social media posts and publishing hoax bomb threats. The offences, originally proposed by the Law Commission, are: sending or posting a message that conveys a threat of serious harm; sending a communication with the intent of causing psychological harm or serious emotional distress; and deliberately sending a false message with the intention of causing harm. The online safety bill will contain substantial changes from its draft version when it is published this week. Alongside the new criminal offences, it will require that online platforms protect users from fraudulent adverts and will order commercial pornography sites to carry out age checks on people trying to access their content. Privacy campaigners have described the new age verification policy as a “privacy minefield” and have warned that it could establish the principle of age-gating across the internet. The bill will impose a duty of care on tech companies that host content created by internet users, with social media platforms a particular focus. The duty of care covers several areas including preventing the proliferation of illegal content and activity such as child sexual abuse and terrorist material, ensuring children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content, and protecting adults from legal but harmful content, such as cyberbullying.

3/14/2022,"And so the Six Nations has the last tango it wanted. A packed Stade de France and a primetime television audience, a grand slam up for grabs and enough pre-match talking points to wallpaper the Louvre. Can France be stopped? Are England capable of being party-poopers? Is there any chance of Ireland sneaking up on the blindside? Regardless of the answers, “Super Saturday” will be lively. On the evidence of the penultimate weekend’s three games, France should be feeling quietly confident as they eye a first grand slam for 12 years. No one could accuse them of playing the house down in Cardiff on Friday night but their Shaun Edwards-marshalled defence remained firm enough to deliver a fourth win in four championship games. The tournament’s most improved defence versus a hitherto blunt-edged England attack? A mass outbreak of Covid or a fistful of red cards aside, a home win looks the likelier outcome. There is, though, one key element no side in the competition has completely mastered as yet. How many teams, when the pressure of favouritism has materialised, have risen emphatically to it? Not Scotland, who lost in Cardiff when everyone expected them to win? Not France in Cardiff. And not Ireland, either, despite the late couple of tries that massaged the 32-15 Twickenham scoreline on Saturday. Had Ireland, as also happened against Italy, retained their poise more consistently and not endured such a horror show at the scrums, the admirable spirit in adversity shown by England’s forwards would have sustained them for only so long. The psychology of it all is fascinating: not for the first time a side reduced to 14 men redoubled their efforts and made life awkward for a side that theoretically held all the aces. Which is why all and sundry need to pause and await the acid test of a full-on Parisian finale before arriving at a verdict on Eddie Jones’s continuing stewardship. We will never know what would have unfolded had Charlie Ewels stayed on the field – or James Ryan for that matter – but, equally, the lock’s second-minute red card made it impossible to reach any hard and fast conclusions. 15	H Keenan Ireland 14 	A Capuozzo Italy13 	C Harris Scotland12 	J Danty France11 	J Lowe England10 	D Biggar Wales9	J Gibson-Park Ireland1	E Genge England2	J Marchand France3	T Francis Wales4	M Itoje England5	W Rowlands Wales6	C Lawes England7	J van der Flier Ireland8	T Faletau Wales That is not to say England’s attack is anywhere remotely close to where it needs to be. Take out the Italy game and the ledger shows a paltry two tries in three games, one donated by Wales via a lineout malfunction and the other via a little Murrayfield magic from Marcus Smith. There is a continuing absence of top-level pace and, at times, much real shape behind the scrum. The selectorial stubbornness of past seasons is also coming home to roost in some positions and another bottom-half finish to a Six Nations – potentially their third under Jones in five years – would be unacceptable for a side with England’s pretensions. All that said, those actually on the field deserve genuine respect for the spirit, determination and defiance which inspired one of the noisier occasions Twickenham has hosted in a while. Maro Itoje, Ellis Genge, Jamie George, Courtney Lawes, Sam Simmonds and Jack Nowell displayed such staggering commitment that France, whose lineout stuttered in Cardiff, will need to be far more consistently dynamic than they were against Wales. The other undisputed area of English excellence was their kick chase: France’s Melvyn Jaminet may be a superb goal-kicker and runner but, as Dan Biggar demonstrated, he can be fallible beneath the high ball. Do not be surprised if Ben Youngs is once again recalled. There is a bigger picture, though, which will swiftly unveil itself to every England player when they embark a few days early to France this week as part of their forward planning for next year’s Rugby World Cup. Pick up a copy of L’Équipe with their morning coffee in the Parisian suburbs and the rising sense of French expectation will be unmissable, lacking only the final dessert spoon of crème anglaise on top. Under Fabien Galthié, Raphaël Ibañez and Edwards, Les Bleus have also visibly kicked on in the past two years in a way England simply have not. For Genge read Cyril Baille, for George read Julien Marchand, for Itoje read Cameron Woki. And if Grégory Alldritt and Antoine Dupont looked relatively mortal in Cardiff, the possibility of a grand slam in Paris will surely rejuvenate them. Jones’s counter-thrust is that his reshuffled England squad will also be peaking in 18 months’ time but endless promises of la confiture demain will sound even hollower if his side come to a sticky end on Saturday. While the Rugby Football Union is loth to jettison Jones now, not least because of the expense and the shortage of available replacements, there is no question that a grim night in Paris would intensify the scrutiny on certain aspects of his tenure. Wales and Ireland, by contrast, have shared three of the last four titles and the Irish last finished in the bottom half of a Six Nations in 2013. A final weekend victory in Dublin combined with a French loss in Paris could yet yield a fourth title in nine years, assuming they tighten up their basics, reduce their penalty count and stop trying to throw miracle offloads whenever they make a half break. It is also necessary to go back to 2010 to find Scotland’s most recent win in Dublin, which just happened to be the same year France last claimed the Six Nations title. On that occasion they sneaked home 12-10 against England in the concluding game thanks to three penalties from Morgan Parra and a drop goal from François Trinh-Duc, with Ben Foden contributing the game’s only try on a damp evening. This time around the weather is set fair and the stage is perfectly set. Are France the real deal? We are about to find out.",Sport/Sport, France must deal better with pressure of expectation against England | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/france-must-deal-better-with-pressure-of-expectation-against-england
3/14/2022,"‘You have been so missed” beams Tori Amos, sat astride her piano stool three songs into her first gig since the pandemic. The feeling is clearly mutual; the adoring front rows honour her return with three consecutive standing ovations, and you can feel the sense of relief ricocheting off the London Palladium’s ornate walls. Without the “voltage” of performing live, and grieving the death of her mother, the American singer-songwriter has said that she had depression in lockdown, eventually finding her way back via the rugged countryside of her adopted home of Cornwall. Realising she had to write her way out of the emotional fog, just as she had done on 1992’s uncompromising breakthrough Little Earthquakes, the ornate Ocean to Ocean started to take shape. While this short UK tour is ostensibly in support of that album, her sixteenth, Amos is famous for her eclectic setlists peppered with fan favourites, B-sides and covers. Tonight is no different. After her ecstatic arrival in which she bows and mimes a wide group hug, she settles down between her giant Bösendorfer piano on one side and a bank of keyboards on the other. Head turned to face outwards, eyes peering inquisitively over the top of black-framed glasses, she joins her drummer and guitarist for the swirling Juárez, a song about the murder of hundreds of women taken from 1999’s electronic curio, To Venus and Back. It’s a meandering opener, and one that feels like flexing a musical muscle that’s been laid dormant for a while. The same can be said for Bouncing Off Clouds, which skips around a propulsive bassline, augmented by Amos’s constant swivels between piano and keyboard. Depending on a song’s mood, her instruments – including a fourth keyboard hidden on top of the piano – are either caressed closely or hammered into submission. The one stumbling block is her silk trouser suit, the tendrils of which occasionally get caught under her gold stilettos as she stamps at various pedals. There are concessions to the more casual fan – the galloping UK hit Cornflake Girl and an impassioned Crucify still sound as fresh as ever – but it’s a show aimed at pleasing the hardcore. So we get three songs from 1996’s cult classic Boys for Pele, with spare piano opener Horses fleshed out into a gently rolling rock workout, while the Nine Inch Nails-referencing Caught a Lite Sneeze is elongated to a near eight-minute swirl, Amos playfully delivering the word “sneeze” as “snayz”. In this context, the songs cherrypicked from Ocean to Ocean work perfectly, with Addition of Light Divided and the title track sticking to a template that favours undulating rock over candlelit piano confessionals. When the latter does arrive as a “prayer” for a world “gone mad”, it’s via a delicate cover of Tom Waits’ Time, an ode to prioritising love and gripping on to life while you still can. It is followed by Amos’s own Russia, from 2017’s Native Invader, an album that aims to make sense of humanity’s myriad horrors. On set closer Take to the Sky, an early B-side from the Little Earthquakes era that rails against dangerous male ego, Amos absorbs the pain and forges her own path. “Have a seat while I take to the sky,” she sings; that voice, like her message, still as clear as a bell.",Arts/Music,Tori Amos review – flexing her musical muscle on an ecstatic return,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/13/tori-amos-review-london-palladium

3/14/2022,"Two Queensland mayors of flood-ravaged towns on the Mary River have backed calls for the federal government to help underwrite insurance companies against future inundations. The calls come as homeowners and small businesses brace for a potential rise in insurance premiums that could hit even those in neighbourhoods that did not flood, and push insurance out of reach for more people in those that did. Gympie mayor Glen Hartwig and his counterpart in Maryborough, George Seymour, told Guardian Australia the commonwealth should expand its planned $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover floods in the state’s south-east. “The reality is that a lot of towns that have been around for a little while have to deal with the impact of decisions that were made 150 years ago on where some homes and some businesses were located,” Hartwig said. “So, yes, assistance for individuals to deal with floods would be a good outcome.” Set to become operational in July, the reinsurance pool effectively sees the commonwealth insure the insurance companies against huge losses if they offer disaster cover. A federal Senate committee hearing into the reinsurance scheme last week prompted MPs from both sides of politics representing flood-affected communities to also back its expansion. Seymour, the mayor of Fraser Coast regional council, said he hoped the government would, at the least, investigate “extending the scheme to include flooding”. People in Brisbane also bore the brunt of policy decisions that have allowed homes to be built in areas – and with designs – that had left them at the mercy of flood waters. Dr Di Johnson from Griffith University’s business school said it was individuals, households and small businesses who were left carrying potentially “catastrophic” financial risks while the climate crisis and a legacy of poor planning coalesce. “When you have people who are paying premiums that are doubling or tripling in a year, then it is obviously market failure,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “That’s created a hidden cost, because it is a cost that is put on to individual citizens and particular communities, as if they were somehow at fault.” Johnson said the reinsurance pool would be an important stepping stone toward preventing more homes from becoming uninsured. “Frankly, if we are trying to support a viable and sustainable insurance market for natural disasters it already urgently needs to be extended – even before it has begun,” she said. Brisbane’s lord mayor said the reinsurance pool was a matter for the federal government. “We’re focused on Brisbane’s biggest ever clean up after the city’s biggest ever rain event,” Adrian Schrinner said. While the Gympie mayor acknowledged that risk was “clearly being carried” by small businesses and residents, he said it was wrong to lay the blame solely at the feet of government or insurers. “Part of the challenge we face in society is that everyone is looking to ostracise themselves from responsibility,” Hartwig said. “If you go and buy a property that is built on a floodplain, there is the possibility that it may be inundated and you need to factor that into the sale price.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app “There is a responsibility right across the board, from the people that have purchased the property to the people that have sold it, to local governments that allowed that sort of development to occur and also insurance companies.” Asked if their councils bear responsibility for the issue due to previous planning decisions, Schrinner said property buyers have access to “detailed information about flood risks” and can reduce the impacts of flooding, while Seymour said “all levels of government need to work together to ensure we have resilient communities”. Suncorp and RACQ did not directly answer questions as to whether they would increase premiums as a result of the ongoing floods. Suncorp said “high-risk locations” were being “challenged” by higher premiums as “we face worsening extreme weather”. “In recent years, we have seen an increase in both natural hazards and reinsurance costs, which impacts premiums,” the insurer said. But Griffith business school’s Dr Kirsten MacDonald warned homeowners could expect a new reality when their insurance was next up for renewal. “Across the board those premiums are likely to go up, and disproportionately so in those existing flood zones, and the now-new flood zones,” MacDonald said. “But it’s when the renewal date comes that these poor people are going to get that shock.” However she said premium rises should not be inevitable and called on insurers to reward property owners who took action to minimise flood risk when calculating their insurance bill. She said that houses which were raised above flood levels and constructed from materials which held up well against inundation, such as tiles and hardwoods, should pay lower premiums for insurance against flood, just as those who install extra security pay less for insurance against theft. MacDonald also backed a broadened reinsurance pool to cover floods for areas where insurance was impossible, either because it was not available or where premiums were “at an extreme price”. But not everyone is convinced that reinsurance pool would curtail surging home insurance premiums. A three-year inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission produced a report in late 2020 that recommended direct subsidies as a tool for bringing down premiums rather than the reinsurance pool the Coalition ultimately adopted. The commission found reinsurance pools supported the insurance industry rather than improved affordability. At least one insurance consultant warned the government fund was “going to get hammered” by repeated cyclones and argued instead for relocation and redesign in the face of the climate emergency. One point on which proponents and critics of the scheme do seem to agree however is that, alone, it will not be enough to keep disaster insurance affordable in the long run. “Even if that reinsurance pool was extended to cover a wider definition of natural disasters, it is just a Band-Aid, stopgap solution,” Griffith University’s Johnson said. “Risk mitigation through public infrastructure, like the flood levees, the revised building codes, better drainage, planning and, of course, action on climate change.” “Ultimately that is going to have the most impact to effectively and sustainably reduce premiums.”",News/Australia news,Mayor defends planning decisions ‘made 150 years ago’ amid calls for flood insurance support,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/mayor-defends-planning-decisions-made-150-years-ago-amid-calls-for-flood-insurance-support
3/14/2022,"Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is muscling up for another fight with business and the federal government as he pushes forward with Australia’s first paid sick-leave trial for those in insecure employment. In an exclusive interview to mark the launch of Guardian Australia’s new Victorian state news section on Monday, Andrews – seeking his third term in office – outlined his reform agenda while criticising the federal government for a perceived lack of ambition. “I got fit and well to come back, not to piss off. I’ve got a lot to do,” Andrews said, one year after the fall that badly injured his ribs and vertebrae. High on the list is addressing the shortcomings of the growth in casual work, which he said the pandemic had “dramatically exposed”. “The notion that we all collectively benefit from people not having any sick pay and having to choose between keeping their family fed or keeping their community safe, they’re not choices people should have to make,” Andrews said. During Victoria’s second wave, people working in multiple jobs were more likely to contract and spread Covid-19. Some were continuing to work while awaiting test results or when they should have been self-isolating, given they could not afford to call in sick. It led to the introduction of payments to isolate. While the sick-leave trial – details of which are expected to be announced imminently – will be funded by the state government, Andrews said any ongoing scheme would be funded by an industry levy. Asked if he was concerned about a backlash from business groups, Andrews replied: “It’s not a matter of ‘can business afford to support this?’ It’s a question of ‘can all of us afford not to do this?’ “Can we continue to have a situation where literally tens of thousands, maybe more Victorians, are in completely vulnerable, uncertain, fragile, insecure circumstances? That’s not good for them. It’s not good for their kids. It’s not good for their families. It’s not good for any of us,” he said. “We need to have a system where everybody can access sick leave.” When Andrews first flagged the idea of a sick-leave scheme in 2020, the then-federal industrial relations minister Christian Porter described it as “a business and employment-killing approach”. “I will not easily forget Christian Porter defending the fact that there isn’t a proper framework for insecure work,” Andrews said. “[Porter] said, ‘Oh they’re all paid more per hour, so they should put away their own sick pay.’ It’s just quite unreal, frankly.” It’s not the first time the Victorian government has targeted taxes at specific groups to help fund reforms. The mental health levy, announced in last year’s state budget, targets businesses that pay more than $10m in wages. It was a key recommendation of a royal commission into the sector and is expected to raise almost $3bn to fund mental health services over four years. There’s also a windfall gains tax for developers, set to come into effect next year, a tax for electric vehicle users and a tax for homeowners who keep their properties in inner and middle Melbourne vacant for more than six months, among others. Andrews was unapologetic about the need to raise money to pay for social reform, and clearly prepared to contrast his record with that of prime minister Scott Morrison federally. “If you haven’t got a reform agenda, you haven’t got an agenda at all. You’re just occupying the office,” he said. “You’re just content to beat your opponent. That’s not what I offer. And it’s not what I think our country and our state needs.” However, the state government’s most recent reform proposal – a levy to fund social housing – was scrapped after 10 days in what was considered by many a tactical retreat by Andrews ahead of the state election on 26 November. Andrews maintains the government had secured a deal with industry to introduce a major planning overhaul, which would boost their profits by $7bn, in exchange for a 1.75% levy on newly built developments with three or more dwellings or lot subdivisions. The levy was expected to raise more than $800m each year, paying for up to 1,700 new social and affordable homes each year, and was to come into effect when the government’s $5.3bn “big housing build” wraps up in 2024. The opposition swiftly began calling it a “housing tax” but Andrews said ditching the proposal wasn’t a backdown. “No one should confuse this for the government deciding it was all too hard. It was frankly obscene, the people who for years demanded planning reforms … were then unwilling to share those super profits with people who are some of the least powerful in our community, the most disadvantaged,” he said. With an estimated 100,000 people on the public housing waiting list in Victoria, Andrews now seems to have pinned his hopes on a Labor win at the upcoming federal election to resolve the issue. “The last time we had a very big social and affordable housing building program was when we had a federal Labor government who partnered with us coming out of the GFC [global financial crisis] and we got thousands of additional units built,” he said. “We will definitely need a partner in Canberra.” Despite questions over federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s appetite for reform, Andrews said he had no doubt Albanese was there for the right reasons. “I’ve known Albo for 25 years and he is a person of great conviction,” Andrews said. “He doesn’t want to win just to beat Scott Morrison. He wants to win so he gets the opportunity and the obligation to govern and get things done.” Throughout the interview, Andrews repeatedly returned to expressing frustration with the federal Coalition, pointing to their unwillingness to partner with state and territory governments in areas such as renewable energy, skills and Tafe and mental health. He said despite both Victoria’s royal commission and a federal productivity report highlighting the cost to the economy of poor mental health, there seemed to be little funding on offer from the commonwealth. “You can’t put a few hundred million dollars on the table and pretend that that’s going to get this job done. We’re spending $3.8bn. I reckon Victorians have worked out that if I thought you could get the job done for say $300m, I’d probably spend $300m,” he said. “Big reform comes with big investment, and big reform is best when it’s framed with big ambitions, not for yourself, not for your place in history, but for every person you serve, every family.” He also questioned the federal government’s refusal to consider pleas from the Victorian and New South Wales governments to distribute GST in a way that would compensate them for their spending on the pandemic. “This is a one-in-100-year event and just carving up the GST with no regard for what Victoria and NSW has been through just doesn’t make any sense,” Andrews said. “This is not a parochial agenda. It’s just a fairness agenda.” On the subject of climate change, and despite the failure of a plan from Mike Cannon-Brookes to buy AGL Energy and shut its coal plants early, Andrews predicted solar, wind and batteries would be powering the state within the next eight to 10 years. “This transition is happening and the strangest thing is that you see conservative politicians, who will talk about the fact that this will cripple an industry as an excuse not to act when the industry itself is already acting,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity. It’s a massive opportunity.” Earlier this month, Andrews announced a plan to accelerate the rollout of offshore wind energy generation projects in the state, setting rolling targets of 2GW installed by 2030, 4GW by 2035, and 9GW by 2040. He also sees “opportunity” in Melbourne’s CBD, although he doesn’t believe it will return to what it was like before Covid-19. “It’s a bit silly to be bagging people for choosing to spend time doing the school drop-off or pick-up, not spending time on the train or on a freeway every morning and every night,” Andrews said. “If you can, why wouldn’t you spend some of your time working from home? I think the future here is maybe more people living in the CBD.” Andrews also suggested the “great Australian dream” of owning a home was less important to younger generations, especially given the increasing cost of property – the median price of a home in Melbourne is now $1.1m. “Not everyone has intergenerational wealth or the ability to act like a bank. So this is a really significant challenge,” he said. “We’re always talking about the great Australian dream, absolutely. But I get a sense, I’ve talked to my kids and their friends, they’re much more focused on perhaps living where they want to live and ownership is not such a big thing. They are happy to rent with secure terms.” For someone who claims politics isn’t a popularity contest, Andrews has had it in droves, at least according to polling. Even as he posed for Guardian Australia’s photographer last week, he was mobbed by a bridal party to pose for selfies. This is despite overseeing some of the world’s longest Covid lockdowns, a battered budget and a major infrastructure agenda beset by overruns and delays. Certainly his pandemic profile was polarising, and there were sustained protests over vaccine mandates and the government’s pandemic bill in November last year, during which a life-sized gallows and an effigy of the premier was paraded. Andrews said he understood the frustration of many Victorians but elements of the protests – including the threats against politician’s wives and children – were of “such an ugliness” he’d never seen before. “Our democracy is stronger and healthier for a diversity of views but decency has to count for something as well,” he said. There are also two corruption inquiries under way, one into the moderate faction of the Labor party, led by former minister Adem Somyurek, who continues to stir up trouble for the government. It was Somyurek’s branch-stacking operation that led to the Victorian ALP being placed under control of the national executive, meaning rank-and-file members have been unable to vote in preselections for two years. If Andrews can win a third election in November and serve until next May, he will overtake John Cain Jnr as Labor’s longest-serving Victorian premier and be immortalised with a statue out the front of 1 Treasury Place. Will he serve a full four years? He says despite the physical and mental challenges of the past two years he hopes so. “As difficult as it was, I think I’m fitter and healthier for it, in a strange way. “I’ve got a lot of work to do still. “I’ll be here for as long as my colleagues and my community want me. It’s a great honour. But again, you’re not here to occupy the office, you’re here to get things done. And I don’t think any government has got as much done as us.”",News/Australia news,‘Here to get things done’: Daniel Andrews prepares for battle over paid sick leave,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/here-to-get-things-done-daniel-andrews-prepares-for-battle-over-paid-sick-leave
3/14/2022,"Dozens of the nation’s top emergency chiefs, who spoke out in the wake of the devastating bushfires two years ago, have now criticised the Morrison government’s “fumbling” response to the floods disaster. Thirty-seven members of the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, led by former NSW fire and rescue commissioner Greg Mullins, say the government was warned in October last year about the prospect of massive flooding over summer, and did not adequately prepare for the devastation that has resulted in New South Wales and Queensland. “The government knew what was coming and it did not adequately prepare our communities or first responders,” Mullins said. “Time and again this government fails to listen to expert advice. There are 80 recommendations of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements gathering dust. The government has failed to implement them. “Those of us who do hold hoses know just how dangerous climate change has become. Australia is under-prepared, and Canberra has no answers to how it will rapidly slash emissions this decade.” The royal commission’s report in October 2020 said Australia was likely to see compounding disasters, with cascading effects that not only threaten lives and homes “but also the nation’s economy, critical infrastructure and essential services, such as our electricity, telecommunications and water supply, and our roads, railways and airports.” Among the recommendations from the report the group said have been not taken up by the government, include integrating of Australian government disaster management. The group said Emergency Management Australia and the newly formed National Recovery and Resilience Agency operate in two different government portfolios and effectively compete for resources. Other recommendations such as making sure state and territory agencies have interoperable comms systems have also yet to be completed, with the group arguing the federal government should take ownership of the issue to broker an outcome among the states. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, on Sunday flagged a future Labor government would consider establishing a separate civilian agency to be deployed in times of natural disasters to avoid the increasing reliance on the Australian Defence Force, stating it was not sustainable. The NSW State Emergency Services also defended refusing ADF offers of assistance to Lismore on 25 February. Commissioner Carlene York said the forecast at the time for the northern rivers was minor to moderate flood levels. She said at that time, the NSW SES resourced to those levels. “Now history would tell us when we look back in hindsight, those flood levels went past the maximum flood reward level and went to almost 14.4 metres, which is two metres above anything we have ever experienced in that area.” She said they were relying on local experience, and experienced volunteers in the area had not seen floods at this level. On Sunday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, agreed that Australia was becoming a harder place to live as a result of climate change, but disagreed that the Coalition had taken a long time to move to that view. “Dealing with climate change isn’t just about getting emissions down. It’s about resilience and adaptation,” he told Nine’s Today program. “You want to deal with resilience on bushfires, you have to do fuel load management. You want to deal with floods, you’ve got to build dams. Now it hasn’t been the Coalition that has been against reducing fuel loads and building dams in this country.” Former deputy director general of the NSW State Emergency Service and flood expert Chas Keys said the disaster shows business as usual can’t continue, and there needs to be a drastic cut back on mining and the burning of fossil fuels. He said there also needed to be a reset in managing disasters, with more focus currently on relief and recover and not mitigation. “There is no more manageable hazard in Australia than flooding: we know where it will occur, we’re usually warned ahead of it and we can predict what its effects will be. We’re just not managing this risk well, and it hurts us over and over again to a greater extent than it should.”",News/Australia news,"Emergency chiefs slam Coalition’s ‘fumbling’ response to floods, claiming they were warned of a potential crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/emergency-chiefs-slam-coalitions-fumbling-response-to-floods-claiming-they-were-warned-of-a-potential-crisis
3/14/2022,"Iam an “expert”. At least in the sense that as a specialist medical doctor in mental health I am asked to give expert advice, included in expert advisory groups, and if I give evidence in court, it’s taken as expert evidence. But when I see young people in my day-to-day work to help them with their mental health it becomes evident to me who the real “experts” are. Annie*, for instance, came to see me about a distressing situation. She was at school and suddenly felt really unwell. She said she couldn’t breathe properly and her heart was racing. She felt numb, had pins and needles in her hands and felt as if she was about to pass out. She told me that she didn’t want anyone to notice so she went to the bathroom where she increasingly felt like something terrible was about to happen. Maybe a heart attack – there was pain in her chest. She couldn’t come out of the bathroom because she was crying. She’d had episodes like this on and off for a couple of years but this was by far the worst and she was scared something serious was wrong. It was getting harder to go to school or even to go out with her friends. Annie saw her doctor who said it was “just anxiety”. The doctor told her she should avoid going to hospital when this happens because tests are unnecessary, expensive and unhelpful for anxiety. She was given a prescription for a medication. When she googled the tablets she was given, the search results showed they were antidepressant medications. Her friend with depression had gained a lot of weight on medication and it seemed like her personality had changed. Annie said she didn’t want this: “I don’t want to be medicated for the rest of my life.” She felt even more anxious and low about herself. She felt judged because she had admitted to drinking and trying drugs at parties with her friends. She regretted being honest about this because she thought it stigmatised her – even though she felt this sort of thing was pretty normal for someone her age. She had actually stopped drinking and was scared of what drugs might do to her heart. She was scared to go out and even scared to exercise in case it harmed her. Annie had a different story of herself to relate when I saw her and lots of questions about why this was happening. She felt as if she wasn’t the person she was being treated as and she didn’t know where to get help. That week I also saw Justin*, a young person in trouble with the law. He’d had a rough childhood, and found that the streets – and a group of young people in similar circumstances – were safer than home. He was on charges of breaking and entering. He looked stressed, he couldn’t sleep, couldn’t sit still and found it hard to talk about himself. He found it especially hard to talk to people in positions of authority. He relied on drugs to sleep, to feel OK and to block out bad feelings. These two teens had very different backgrounds and experiences but neither could easily put into words what was going on with them. They looked unhappy, miserable. They sometimes shrugged, looked away when spoken with and fidgeted. But when I got it wrong they both clearly let me know with a shake of the head or a firm “no”. If the answer was yes, they usually followed up with some more information. They both tried to help me understand. And I didn’t feel they were lying or hiding the truth when I was trying to see their world. Annie has panic attacks, a panic disorder and agoraphobia – avoidance of places that might bring on an attack. Justin has ADHD and is on the autism spectrum. His anxiety comes from trying to fit into a neurotypical world. He has also experienced trauma and had to fend for himself from a young age. Each has their own story. As the health professional, I try to use my training and experience to consider their story against the evidence in mental health research. Then I try to speak their truth back to them within this framework. Between us, we check out what parts seems to fit, and we look at aspects that can be reversed by treatment. We talk about the pros and cons and all potential side effects. Sometimes it takes time and a lot of trust to work out the way forward. Both Annie and Justin had already been given labels and prescribed treatments. They didn’t agree to those, and they didn’t follow them. First we needed agreement. Ultimately, I’ve found that the “expert” on any adolescent is themselves. To be effective, it’s my job first to listen to them.

3/14/2022,"At first light, the clouds hanging low across the valleys, Tommy Lee Lewes and his rescue chopper crew were hurtling through heavy rain to one of the northern rivers’s most isolated regions. Amid widespread devastation, they had been tasked with rescuing a man in a critical condition in a remote part of Upper Wilsons Creek, an area of dense bushland cut off completely by the flood waters. Time was against them. A venomous snake driven from the rising water had bitten the man more than six hours prior. Antivenom is usually needed within an hour. In some cases, a bite can cause a heart attack within 15 minutes. The night shift aircrew, wearing night vision goggles, had already tried and failed to reach the man in pitch black, stymied by treacherous conditions and the rugged terrain. Flying low to maintain visibility, Lewes saw first-hand the devastation the floods had wrought across the hinterlands. “There were just landslides of up to eight to 10 houses swept away through these valleys,” he says. “Just the destruction – cows, cars, shipping containers, just everything. It looked like a warzone.” The conditions were torrid. Visibility was poor, there were storm cells in the area, and the spot they had to drop the paramedic was covered by dense canopy. “It was a very difficult job.” As they hovered above the house, waiting for the medical team to extract the man, the weather began to turn, growing more extreme. “We were hanging in there and pushing on and pushing and pushing on, but we were aware that the weather was deteriorating,” he says. Finally, they managed to extract the man and escape before the weather turned too dangerous. The man survived. Lewes’s account of the rescue, mounted by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service on 3 March, reveals the horrendous conditions faced by aircrews as they responded across a vast flood-affected region last week. Between their crew, the Australian defence force, police, contract and volunteer helicopters and the Rural Fire Service, helicopter crews winched people trapped under collapsed houses and plucked victims from water, dodging floating debris. The Westpac crew landed on the roofs of flooded structures at night, using night vision goggles to bring people to safety. They rescued trauma patients, flood victims experiencing chest pain, snakebite victims, and, in one case, a Covid-19 patient. Lewes says his crew, which is tasked by the NSW ambulance service, would normally be dispatched on a single mission on average each day. In the first four days of the flood disaster, the blades didn’t stop turning. “It just didn’t stop,” he says. “That first day I think we jumped in the helicopter at 6.30am. We didn’t get out until 9.30pm at night. Every time you called there’d be five, six, eight new jobs.” All of it was done while their usual Lismore base was under water, flooded along with much of the town. The crew were instead forced to relocate to Ballina, where they worked alongside more than a dozen other helicopters. On one job, a landslide had trapped multiple people at a home in Upper Main Arm. Both the Westpac and Toll aeromedical crews were unable to free the victims. The ADF were called, winching in an engineering team, who were able to get them to safety. Lewes, an aircrew officer, said his team was triaging cases from a vast region, stretching from Gympie in Queensland to Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The most life-threatening cases were often in remote areas, only accessible from the air, away from towns and population centres. Cases that needed specialised medical assistance, which the Westpac crew could provide, were prioritised. Also in the air was a fleet of volunteer helicopters, owned by private citizens, which stepped in to drop supplies and conduct rescues at the height of the disaster. Their work helped thousands. Last week, speaking in Lismore before Scott Morrison’s appearance, one of those pilots, Rich Latimer, called for government and volunteer groups to unify to prepare for the next disaster. “The message we really want to pass is: we need unification,” he said. “We need communities to realise that we need to prepare ourselves for this more and more … and really drop the message of us and them, and the polarisation.”",News/Australia news,"As the NSW floods dealt their damage, choppers rescued people from snakebites, landslides and rising water",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/as-the-nsw-floods-dealt-their-damage-choppers-rescued-people-from-snakebites-landslides-and-rising-water
3/14/2022,"Unionist Linda White is expected to replace Victorian Labor senator Kim Carr, after a backroom push in the final weeks before the election. Guardian Australia understands that, after starting with substantial support, the former Australian Services Union assistant national secretary has pulled further ahead in the race to replace Carr, with support from the United Workers Union. Other candidates for the Victorian left Senate spot include industrial lawyer Josh Bornstein and Ryan Batchelor, a former staffer to Julia Gillard and the executive director of the McKell Institute. Senior left sources told Guardian Australia it was the “strong expectation” that White would prevail, and that she may be the only candidate to nominate when the process formally begins in April. Carr is highly resistant to any attempt to move him on from the Senate, but senior factional sources said he had lost both union and rank-and-file support from within the left in Victoria. Bornstein commands more support than Batchelor, but his bid to replace Carr lost momentum after he pulled out of the race in 2021 before throwing his hat back in the ring. Guardian Australia understands that after the UWU amalgamation between the National Workers Union and United Voice, the UWU Queensland state secretary, Gary Bullock, would have input into the Victorian contest. Bullock had swung in behind White, raising eyebrows about the mega-union’s influence from out-of-state and risking potential backlash. The UWU is also supporting its national political coordinator, Jo Briskey, to take the next vacant seat in Victoria. Some believe this could mean Briskey replaces retiring right faction MP, Anthony Byrne, in the seat of Holt, although the right was yet to resolve whether it would let the left faction have the seat in a bid to buy factional peace. The tragic death of right senator Kimberley Kitching also creates a Senate vacancy in Victoria to be filled by the Labor party. Avoiding backlash from Carr and respect for Kitching, who passed away suddenly on Thursday, are both factors in delaying a final decision on the Senate spots. On Sunday the Age reported early names suggested for Kitching’s spot include Maurice Blackburn principal lawyer, Liberty Sanger, Victorian corrections minister, Natalie Hutchins, and barrister Fiona McLeod, who stood for Labor in the seat of Higgins in 2019. In February the Victorian court of appeal upheld the national executive’s takeover of the Victorian Labor branch to combat branch-stacking. That decision could still be subject to a high court challenge, which would further delay the formal preselection process.",News/Australia news,Unionist Linda White leads race to replace Victorian Labor senator Kim Carr,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/unionist-linda-white-leads-race-to-replace-victorian-labor-senator-kim-carr
3/14/2022,"The AFLW to date, has long been a summer offering despite the frustration of players and supporters for whom summer is no time for footy. For this reason, last week’s tabling of an August start to next season came as a surprise. A decision has not yet been made, but the AFL Commission has approved the concept and it is now up to each club, including the four new inclusions in Essendon, Hawthorn, Port Adelaide and Sydney. For these expansion clubs, an August start is significant. We have seen previous first-timers up against well-established teams. That first season is full of discovery and, let’s face it, some pretty ordinary results. With three less months for planning and preparation – let alone list building – it is understandably not ideal. But the more obvious pain point around an earlier start exists with the current playing groups. They will have just come off an already-gruelling sixth season only to have to back this up again in five months’ time. Between April to August, players must squeeze in a well-earned break, the work and study they may have missed from having to play, a pre- pre-season and then a pre-season proper. An August start will also mean players with significant, season-ending injuries may not make it back in time. The AFL has to change the start date. Whenever and however it does this will present significant challenges. An August start this year in particular means for the bulk of the players starting in the competition – mostly school leavers – it will land at the pointy end of their final year of school. Some have suggested raising the draft age to mitigate this, however that poses other issues in an expansion year when the league needs to find 120 players’s worth of new talent. Regardless of where in the sport calendar the season ends up, the challenge will be in honouring the diverse needs of the not-yet-professional cohort itself. While for some marquee players and others with work flexibility, a mid-year season is fine, in fact welcomed. It means more opportunity to play with little financial impact or effect on work life balance. For others it is stressful and unlikely they will be able to return to play again this year. Wherever the AFLW lands, the crucial piece of the puzzle that, from the outside appears to be missing, is due process and consultation. While a later-in-the-year start may be welcome and ultimately for the better, the uncertainty and lack of previous long-term planning does seem to wreak of sideshow. While not a one-to-one comparison, the idea of springing anything this significant on the AFLM seems improbable – so why the casual approach for the W? For all the what ifs, and obvious complications however, there is plenty of upside. Finally the athletes will play in cooler months. While the idea of ‘clear air’ for the AFLW is long gone, their season played in and around the traditional footy season feels right. More importantly, the athletes of the W will be negotiating their collective bargaining agreement. An earlier start throws open a number of possibilities including a longer contract. The overlap in Men’s and women’s seasons might also be the encouragement of men’s and women’s players need to negotiate a joint CBA. For clubs there is plenty to work with, too. The W and M overlap should boost numbers in memberships and audience – the ‘one club’ campaigns write themselves. Despite what will be a jam-packed end of season, at least club staff will get an off-season. As for the fans, August to December does seem like the sweet spot for the AFLW. In the M, the season ramps up into finals, when fans are either at fever pitch watching their team make it to September, in which case watching their W team will be a welcome addition to the hype. Or they are lamenting their team’s slow fade out of finals contention, for which the W season can be the perfect antidote. There are, of course, those for whom AFLM is simply the bread rolls you snack on before mains. The other thorn in the side of this seemingly perfect time of year is women’s cricket. September to October sees the international games played and October to December is WBBL season. If women’s footy finds a home in August it will split cross-coders like Jess Duffin, not to mention pathways for both codes. And then there is the question of how the broadcasters and media will service both. Despite initial concerns there is a diamond of opportunity waiting to be exploited, an AFLW season that overlaps with women’s cricket is extremely good for women’s sport. Both major codes will be forced to compete for audience, memberships, broadcast rights and perhaps even venues. In the capitalist world of sport, this can only be a good thing. Everybody must lift. Both codes will have to pay attention to audience, trends, cut-through – which will all make for a better women’s sport offering. August to December could become a festival of women’s sport. And maybe, just maybe, this is the beginning of the world we have been waiting for.",Sport/Sport,"An AFLW shift to August?

3/14/2022,"The $30bn plan to build a giant solar farm in northern Australia to power Darwin, Indonesia and Singapore has moved a step closer to reality with billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest contributing to a $210m capital raising. The investment brings to about $250m the money raised to build a 17-gigawatt solar plant on a cattle property at Newcastle Waters, midway between Alice Springs and the Northern Territory’s capital. The project would be a 12,000 hectare solar precinct with 17-20 GWp solar generation and 36-42 GWh energy storage to enable 24/7 dispatchable electricity near Elliott, in the Northern Territory. The funding “will take us all the way through to the financial close of the Australia-Asia PowerLink”, David Griffin, Sun Cable’s chief executive, said. “It will also allow us to accelerate development of our broader portfolio,” he said. “Our mission is to supply renewable electricity from resource-abundant regions to growing load centres at scale.” The company plans to explore other “multi-gigawatt” solar plants both in Australia and elsewhere, including other intercontinental power links, based on the know-how developed over the past four years, Griffin said. More details were likely to be announced “some months from now”. “Some of our subsequent projects will also rely on [technology] very similar in concept to the first project,” he said. “There’s a lot of opportunities in this area … but certainly we have more projects emanating from Australia as well.” Griffin said there was no connection between Sun Cable’s plans, and the recent hostile takeover bid by Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures and Canadian asset manager Brookfield of AGL Energy. The two suitors dropped their bid a week ago after AGL rejected a revised offer that valued AGL at just under $8.5bn, although AGL itself is not certain the two won’t be back for another tilt. Sun Cable, declined to provide a breakdown of the contributions from Grok and Forrest’s Squadron Energy to the $210m raising, adding only that the original investors took up their full entitlements. Staff, who now number 80, also joined the list of shareholders, Griffin said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We’re just really stoked to close this round,” Griffin said. “It’s a really significant number and puts us in a really strong position.” Cannon-Brookes said the fundraising brought Australia “one step closer to realising our renewables exporting potential”, while developing a blueprint for other projects. “We can power the world with clean energy and Sun Cable is harnessing that at scale.” “Sun Cable’s vision will transform Australia’s capability to become a world-leading generator and exporter of renewable electricity and enable decarbonisation. I’m proud to be a cornerstone investor in Sun Cable, its team and its vision,” Forrest said. Squadron Energy and Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries were approached for comment. The latter had a big week, landing Guy Debelle, the current deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia to be its chief financial officer. Debelle, who had been considered to be a frontrunner to replace current central bank governor Philip Lowe, will help steer the company’s plans to produce 15m tonnes of hydrogen produced by renewable energy a year by 2030 for global markets. “Climate change has a broad-ranging impact on Australia, both in terms of geography and in terms of Australian businesses and households,” Debelle said in a statement after his surprise exit from the RBA. “Australia has been an energy exporter for many decades,” he said. “Australia is also endowed with resources that have the potential for us to continue to be an exporter of energy – but renewable rather than emissions-intensive fossil fuels.” Debelle’s now former boss, RBA governor Lowe, told a banking conference on Friday investors wanted a plan on how Australia would transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. “They want to know what the opportunities Australia has and they want to talk about the risks that we have as well,” Lowe said, noting Debelle had resigned “to participate in those opportunities”. Institutions such as the RBA and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority were working on a framework to help markets measure, manage and price the risks as Australia shifted out of fossil fuels, he said. These included assessing climate vulnerability. “We need to provide the people who want to make capital decisions with information, and it needs to be quality information,” Lowe said. “Australia [can] seize the fantastic opportunities we have in this area. That’s a huge challenge for the future.”",News/Australia news,Sun Cable’s giant Northern Territory solar project gets $210m funding boost ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/sun-cables-giant-northern-territory-solar-project-gets-210m-funding-boost

Paul’s debut last month marked the first time the Bankstown poetry slam could play to capacity since the Delta lockdowns, which affected this part of Sydney more than anywhere else in the city. Pre-pandemic, the slam would attract 200-300 people to their monthly events, but Covid prompted a shift to online or quasi-online events. On its full-capacity comeback, however, there was little evidence of rustiness; instead there was a sense of ease. Slam poetry is a relatively new literary format: spoken word poetry performed dramatically, to a time limit and usually in front of a lively audience. In Bankstown, that audience actively participates – clapping ferociously through awkward moments, bantering with performers or clicking their fingers in appreciation. Poet after poet takes to the stage, with work that covers a broad swathe of topics, from grief to racism, beauty standards, love and the cruelty of time. Zia, one of the first performers, spins her words to paint a visceral image of an unhealthy relationship. “You fed me your words, knowing without your words I would starve. Maybe it was better off I had starved,” she proclaims, her voice trembling, the crowd enraptured into silence, before exploding into applause and whistles when she finishes. Another poet, Leila, describes her search for numbness amid a sea of anxiety – in feverish detail. “But numbness is just pain’s ugly sister,” she reflects, the crowd cackling in delight, their support infectious. No one – neither the late arrivals standing in the corner nor those sitting deep in the hall’s dark corners – remains silent; the noise comes in waves and fills the space. The Bankstown poetry slam means many things to many people, but its most striking quality has to be the comfort it fosters within the community. Throughout the night, host Bilal Hafda – also one of the volunteer organisers – banters with a crowd eager to respond. He occasionally refers to the slam’s traditions and its past in conversation with an audience who know what to expect. “It’s a space that is owned by the community, even though they might not be the ones who run the event,” he says. “It’s the audience that makes me feel welcome every time I step into the Arts Centre.” The slam is the largest regular poetry slam in Australia, where anyone can register to perform a three-minute poem, and has become a literary institution in western Sydney. Before Covid, the event was held at least 10 times a year, would attract hundreds of people and many hundreds more for its grand slam which has sold out venues such as the Seymour Centre. International poets including Rupi Kaur and Rudy Francisco have performed at the slam, alongside high-profile Australian poets such as Luka Lesson and Omar Musa. It has had collaborations with the Sydney writers’ festival, Sydney festival, Biennale of Sydney and is due to do a slam for ABC Radio. Established in 2013 by volunteers, it has grown into a unique platform and space, anchored neither by theme or demographics, but by a feeling of what some call magic, others warmth, and which Hafda defines as openness. Asked what the slam means to the community, Hafda chooses his words carefully. “I don’t think it is my place to comment on how the community feels about it. I feel like one of the reasons why the slam is so fantastic is because no one voice speaks for it,” he says. “The reason it’s such a respectful and safe space is that no one is trying to make everyone pick the same answer. It comes down to your personal experiences with it, whatever your journey with it is.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hafda describes the event as being “mechanically” of Bankstown, one of the most diverse suburbs in Australia. The founders and organisers are from the suburb, he says, but their focus was always in making an open space. “The reaction to artists, regardless of theme, and craft, as long as it’s respectful, is always going to be met with the same encouragement, which means that it’s a space where lots of different kinds of art can be shown.” The slam is one among a number of other unrelated writers’ events, workshops and writing centres which have been established in western Sydney – including SweatShop and WestWords – with new voices consistently emerging and reshaping the cultural output of the region. The first half of the year will see a variety of books published that are set in western Sydney, or written by western Sydney authors – including from Omar Sakr, Yumna Kassab, George Haddad and Shankari Chandran. The historically culturally marginalised area is finding its voice. Hafda says it is the quality of the work performed at the slam which defines it, with poets peeling back their sense of self in front of an enthralled and supportive audience. “I think the calibre of the performances and the written word – so the actual craft and mechanics side to the performance – is absolutely exceptional,” Hafda says. “The poets are just so damn good, they are amazing, and it’s one of the reasons people keep coming back.” After the slam, one of the performers, Ibrahim, says there was a particular magic in the room. “Love is what characterises this space. It was crazy, it’s just love in there, it’s nuts, it was so nice.” He had travelled from south Sydney, having heard of the slam from friends, and wrote his poem on the way. He says he’d been performing as an MC for 20 years, and found the slam invigorating. “It was crazy because there was so much heart, intention, love, togetherness. You’ve got all walks of life that are in there and they just came together. The space is a testament to that, to how people can come together.” For all the love and community, it is a competition. Many poets are returning performers, eager to share their new or improved works, and the slam uses a points system to determine a winner. At the beginning of the night, in another of the slam’s traditions, Hafda throws chocolates into the crowd, picking the judges at random. On the night Guardian Australia visited, Amarachi Ogugoum and Ezara Lowes were appointed, given whiteboards and a marker. They become part of the show, relishing their roles as the self-described villains. Big scores are cheered, while lower scores are hissed at, as Hafda laughs and encourages the judges to stay strong. “It’s important to keep it real, I’m not going to give someone a higher score unless they deserved it,” says Ogugoum. “And it’s all subjective opinion.” Lowes adds: “When I was looking at the poem, I wanted something that felt genuine and not a bit tacky.” Both women had travelled some distance (Ogugoum from Newtown, Lowes from Kellyville) to be there. “Its giving community a space to be free; there aren’t a lot of spaces to be artistic in lower socio-economic areas,” says Ogugoum. “This kind of place feels freeing.” It is ultimately a close contest this Tuesday night, but Dai Amemoret wins with a poem addressing flooding in her hometown in Brazil. She says the slam is defined by the vulnerability it nurtures. “Someone goes on stage and tells you things they haven’t told anyone else, and you have this level of proximity and intimacy, where you truly get to know someone, because they just pour their heart out,” she says. “It’s where this magical thing happens, where we can be in a safe space to express the things that hurt us the most, and have that warmth reflected back into you.”",Arts/Culture,"‘It’s just love in there, it’s nuts’: freedom and verse at the Bankstown poetry slam",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/14/its-just-love-in-there-its-nuts-freedom-and-verse-at-the-bankstown-poetry-slam
3/14/2022,"The black soil sinks and then swells around Zena Ronnfeldt’s boots as she steps through rows of cotton on her property near Dalby in Queensland’s Darling Downs. “The soil is just so great, we can grow a dozen different crops here,” Ronnfeldt says. “We have mung beans and chickpeas, cotton, corn, wheat, barley, and silage for feedlots. If we needed to, we could grow vegetables under irrigation. It’s just a food bowl.” In recent years, pockmarks have spread like a rash across the landscape. Satellite images show how development of the coal seam gas industry has accelerated, as thousands of wells have been built across some of Australia’s most productive farmland. The conflict between these competing multibillion-dollar industries – agriculture and onshore natural gas – has bubbled here for more than a decade. A timelapse of satellite imagery shows the rapid rise in gas wells in the region west of Dalby. But what Ronnfeldt discovered beneath the black soil on her property last year has brought the strained relationships between some landholders and gas companies to a critical point – a deteriorating situation that has farmers and resources law experts demanding an immediate pause to the ongoing gas ramp-up. During the process involved in sinking a new water bore, Ronnfeldt learned that Arrow Energy – a joint venture between global petroleum giants Shell and PetroChina – had drilled diagonally underneath her land. “Years ago they did mention the fact that they might want to put wells on our property, and I talked to them about the size of the compensation bill. We never heard from them again,” Ronnfeldt says. “They were drilling on the property next door and when we asked, Arrow wouldn’t say where the wells were going.” The Queensland government is formally investigating allegations that Arrow commenced “deviated” drilling beneath multiple properties without providing a formal entry notice or otherwise notifying landholders. Arrow has admitted “mistakes” as it developed dozens of these deviated wells, but has previously said it “genuinely did not believe entry notices were required”. The investigation has dragged on for 10 months without result. Arrow continues to drill deviated wells but is now notifying landholders. Now the company is expanding gas operations to new parts of the Darling Downs, east of the Condamine River, sparking warnings to farmers to seek legal advice before signing any agreements. Ronnfeldt says subsidence (an anticipated effect of CSG extraction) has occurred on a section of her property since the drilling started. “We’ve got a field over the back now, that’s 120 hectares that we’re struggling to crop at all,” she says. “It’s all about the drainage. It’s like in your street and your city and garden, when it gets waterlogged and doesn’t get away. We’ll be slopping around in mud or the machinery gets bogged. “We actually have damage and the company is making no real commitment to any sort of rectification at all. They treat us with such disrespect.” In response to Ronnfeldt, Arrow said any “ground movement due to CSG has not occurred to the extent it has altered the drainage on the property”. The Queensland Department of Environment and Science told Ronnfeldt they could not investigate the subsidence because Arrow’s state environmental approval “does not specifically contemplate or regulate broad-scale subsidence” and that damage to the commercial productivity of farmland is not considered “environmental harm”. Across the Darling Downs (the gas companies call roughly the same area by its geological name, the Surat basin) there is emerging evidence that CSG operations will leave a significant physical legacy on the landscape. Russell Bennie’s family has owned land in the Cecil Plains area since the turn of the 20th century; they’ve been growing broadacre crops here for about 70 years. “Over the past four to five years we’ve been noticing staining on the ground, it happens after rainfall typically,” Bennie says. “It basically has a rainbowy sheen to it, and it’s getting worse. We’re about 3km from a gasfield that has been active for 15 years.” Last year, Bennie took some soil scrapings and had them tested. The lab confirmed the presence of volatile organic compounds – or hydrocarbons – in the soil. The testing does not establish the source of the hydrocarbons. There are some places in the region where gas seepage – such as the bubbling Condamine River, famously set on fire by the Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham – are considered to be a natural phenomenon. There is also evidence – detailed in a report commissioned by the Queensland government last year – that gas escape in the Condamine is “enhanced” by nearby CSG production. “[The soil staining] is something we’ve never seen, and we’ve been operating continuously for 120 years,” Bennie says. Most often, attention on the impact of gas fracking, mining or development focuses on the potential environmental harm caused by these activities. But under Queensland law, agricultural land has no environmental value. Any damage to the black soil plains used by farmers would not be subject to environmental regulations; instead it becomes a much more complicated matter to resolve. There are expected physical impacts from CSG on farmland. Queensland government reports expect water volume in 702 water bores in the Surat basin will be affected by the impact of gas drilling in the long term. That figure keeps rising, from 459 in 2016 and 571 in 2019. Gas drilling is also expected to cause subsidence of more than 15cm in some areas. That distance might seem insignificant until you see some of the Darling Downs farmland: the countryside is unerringly flat, expanding in some directions to an ocean-like horizon. In Australia, property rights are complicated by a regime where resource companies and landowners have overlapping tenures. The inevitable conflicts between the gas and agricultural sector are governed by complex laws and regulations, which in Queensland have developed in a piecemeal way as issues arise. The state has never had an inquiry like the Victorian process that resulted in a ban on fracking to protect agriculture. Madeline Taylor, one of a handful of lawyers in Australia whose work focuses on the intersection of resources and agriculture, says the cumulative impacts of the gas industry in Queensland “are still not understood”. “Now we’ve had the CSG industry in Queensland for over a decade, we are only now seeing the real human effects, the social licence impacts, the erosion of community trust,” Taylor says. “We need to now take a precautionary approach. Those cumulative impacts will play out over a matter of decades. It’s time to halt development, to do a proper scientific inquiry, rather than constant amendments to legislation and regulations, which create constant uncertainty for landholders. “The protection of our best arable land is crucial in Australia because we don’t have much of it. We’re the most arid continent in the world. We’re seeing constant climate change effects and we will have diminishing agricultural productivity in this country.” In that context, Arrow Energy’s deviated wells – some which begin on one property, but drill underneath another – have become significant. “For the first time we’re really seeing pressure on our property law framework in Australia, because of deviated wells,” Taylor says. “It has shone a light on the limits of property rights for landholders. What I constantly get is farmers asking me: ‘Why can’t I just say I don’t want this?’” If there is no significant surface impact, Queensland law classifies directional drilling as a “preliminary activity”, generally allowing companies to drill under private land without a prior agreement in place. Regulations generally require them to notify the land-holder before starting. Guardian Australia sought an interview with a representative from Arrow, but the company declined. In response to questions, a spokesman said the company was “committed to working with (landholders) in good faith to address their concerns. “Our goal remains to build and maintain long-term positive landholder relationships based on openness, trust and mutual respect. If landholders have concerns, we encourage them to contact us or the regulators directly.” In earlier statements, the company has admitted unspecified “mistakes” during the early implementation of its “deviated wells model”, which it says was designed to minimise ground disturbance by allowing several slanted wells to be drilled from a single site. “Arrow appreciates that our Surat activities are taking place on some of the state’s most productive black soil, and that we must take exceptional care to minimise our impacts on landholders, communities and the environment to deliver our project.” Last month, the Gasfields Commission, an agency set up to promote “coexistence” between farmers and the gas industry, called on the government to urgently finalise its investigation to provide clarity. A 2020 Queensland government audit of how the CSG sector was generally managed by government raised serious questions about the state’s compliance regime. “At present, no one is providing transparency and certainty that regulators of the CSG industry are performing their roles effectively,” it said. Last year the Environmental Defenders Office compiled a similar report detailing failings of a regulatory system weighted heavily in favour of gas companies. It found that environmental assessments for gas projects were often minimal – in some cases allowing projects to double in size without any additional assessment – and that the legislation supposed to protect priority agricultural land, the Regional Planning Interests Act, was not effective. “No application for a regional interest development approval has ever been refused, and concern exists that conditions placed on these approvals are often minimal,” the EDO report found. When Arrow announced its plans to expand east of the Condamine River, a group of agricultural peak bodies – Cotton Australia, the Queensland Farmers’ Federation, AgForce and Central Downs Irrigators Limited – issued a joint statement urging landholders to seek legal advice before signing agreements. “[On] February 17, a number of agricultural representative organisations were advised by Arrow Energy that it had issued its deviated well agreement to a small number of landholders, and two had signed,” they said. A few months ago, a representative from Arrow turned up at Bev and Wayne Newton’s property at Kuppun, west of the town of Dalby. The company said that they would soon begin drilling diagonally underneath their property, from a well pad built near the boundary. “They shoved a map in our hand saying … [they were] drilling these,” Bev Newton said. “They’re being drilled parallel to huge water storage we’ve got, they want to run deviated wells parallel to the banks of our 1,000 megalitre ring tank wall. Who, then, is held responsible for a health and safety issue?” Arrow has since paused drilling plans relating to the Newton’s property. Bev says the CSG companies have adopted a “divide and conquer” approach in the years they have been operating in the Downs. Some farmers welcomed gas companies onto their land and signed compensation agreements to host wells. Others objected, but ultimately signed when told that attempting to block access could require costly court action. One landowner who does have a compensation agreement with Arrow, who did not want to be named because of the depth of feeling within the local community, said compensation agreements had provided “a little” income during recent years of drought. Bev Newton says: “If I had a block out west, I’d gladly welcome them too. “It’s not that we’re opposed to gas, but it’s a fossil fuel and it’s on the phase-out. “We have our children who have gone away to study and come back and they want to look after the land. We want to look after it for them. Agriculture will be here long after the gas wells are gone.”",News/Australia news,"In Queensland’s food bowl, farmers fear the gas bores from next door",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/in-queenslands-food-bowl-farmers-fear-the-gas-bores-from-next-door
3/14/2022,"Australia is internationally renowned for its beaches and (dying) coral reefs, but, for those not fortunate enough to live by the sea, the public pool is an institution. In my early 20s, I developed what would become a chronic back condition that kicked off with a bulging disc and a bout of back surgery. For the frustrating months I spent recovering, warm water hydrotherapy, saunas and spas were a major source of pain relief. I would visit my local pool at least three times per week, starting with gentle walking in the hydro pool amid aerobics enthusiasts, then graduating, eventually, to the lap pool. Since then, swimming laps has been a coveted routine in my life. The public pool, like the corner store or local pub, is a community hub, a rare spot where families, retirees, young couples and teens from different backgrounds and circumstances meet and play. Arising in the most unlikely of places – whether it be the middle of the Pilbra or the edge of the Murray River – the public pool is the holy grail of refreshment on a hot day, a space to gather, gossip and – for many – learn to swim. Icy-poles dripping on well-worn towels. Slabs of cement burning feet in the sun. The rich smell of chlorine lingering in your hair. What could be better? Sneaking in at No 10, Vic Hayton memorial swimming pool may be humble, but it remains well worth a visit for the mere novelty of taking a dip in the middle of the Pilbra. Set against palm trees and miles of red dirt, the aquatic facility is a green oasis in the middle of a dry, inland mining town. For those hot Western Australia days, the pool has recently been equipped with colourful shade sails covering the babies pool and half of the main pools, and boasts a barbecue for warm summer evenings. It also punches above its weight with its water features, a volleyball park and half-court basketball area, making it a quintessential meeting place for locals and families. Tom Price is around a four-hour drive from the ocean, so you’ll be in need of a swim when you get there. There are many features at the Launceston Leisure & Aquatic Centre that make it stand out above its Tasmanian peers, but other than eight separate water spaces, highlights include a 65-metre water slide that winds atop treetops and two springboard diving boards, open during the summer season. The outdoor waterslide is ticketed, but one ride will only set a thrill-seeker back $1. Unlimited recreation is $10 per person. On weekends and during the school holidays, LAC also sets up “The Big Inflatable” at the end of the indoor 50-metre pool, which is, essentially, as described – a giant inflatable device. Other than that, there’s multiple heated and accessible indoor and outdoor pools, a spa, an interactive water play area, a gym, a cafe and barbecue facilities. It’s fun for the whole family, all just minutes from the CBD. The Leichhardt pool and aquatic centre is one of the few facilities in Sydney that still retains an iconic diving platform – featuring a salmon and baby blue staircase with various jumping platforms set against leafy gum trees. Take your pick from an indoor or outdoor heated pool, hydrotherapy pool, children’s pools, a dive pool or an outdoor mushroom pool, designed to be a children’s aquatic playground. There’s also a fitness centre, cafe and free parking next to Leichhardt Oval. The facility and surrounding gardens have beautiful views of the water across the upper harbour – bring a book to enjoy on the grass after a dip, and enjoy expansive views of the bay. Ocean pools get a lot of press, but the humble lake pool deserves just as much celebration. Lake Mulwala swimming pool straddles the border between Victoria and New South Wales, at the tip of the Yarrawonga foreshore. Instead of saltwater, the Olympic-sized pool is filled with fresh water from the Murray River, allowing for lap swimming away from tree stumps. A prime spot for pelican-spotting, come for the pool and stay for the lake foreshore, where packed with picnic spots, a kids playground and a waterslide. On the water, canoes, tubes, waterskis and barbecue pontoons can also be hired for daredevils – or those looking to settle in for the day. The local pub is just metres away on the corner of Inglis and Melbourne streets. When Eastern Beach Reserve was built in the 1930s, it was often referred to as “the people’s playground”. Today, the Geelong waterfront has been revamped from the decayed promenade it once was but the sea bath of old remains the same. This pool is a lovely spot to visit when the sun is shining or en route to the Great Ocean Road. The shark-proof swimming enclosure is the main event, but families could pass hours exploring the reserve’s various floating islands, playgrounds and children’s pools set against the historical art deco boardwalk. And thrill seekers can have a go at the large diving tower, with expansive views of Corio Bay. Stay for the day and have a picnic at one of the barbecue facilities, or bring your dog along for some aquatic fun (though they’re required to remain on a leash). Spring Hill Baths is well worth a visit for the history alone. The oldest surviving swimming baths in the southern hemisphere, it’s Brisbane’s first in-ground pool and a heritage listed site. Designed by Thomas Kirk, Spring Hill Baths was built from 1886 to 1913 and still retains its classic brightly coloured changing rooms and grandstand seating with stepped wooden bleachers. Its old word charm is retained down to signage, with black lettering warning “spitting and smoking strictly prohibited”. Perfect for winter bathing, the baths offers a 23-metre indoor heated pool, a kiosk (including espresso machine) and aqua aerobics. Check out the original Spring Hill cottages on your way out. At the beginning of Bill Bryson’s travel guide Down Under, he recalls reading a history of Australian politics on the long flight from London. “I encountered the startling fact that in 1967 the prime minister, Harold Holt, was strolling along a beach in Victoria when he plunged into the surf and vanished,” he writes. “No trace of the poor man was ever seen again. This seemed doubly astounding to me – first that Australia could just lose a prime minister (I mean, come on) and second that news of this had never reached me.” It’s a quintessentially Australian story – as is memorialising a prime minister who presumably drowned by naming a swimming pool after him. Commissioned in 1967 to be designed by Australian architects Kevin Borland and Daryl Jackson, the Glen Iris pool was hastily renamed after the sudden death of the local member and has since been cited as a “perhaps unintentional” example of Australian black humour. If name alone isn’t enough to earn it fourth spot, it’s now considered to be one of the finest examples of Brutalist architecture in Australia, and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. And it is well worth a visit in the summer or winter, with several indoor and outdoor pools, a spa and sauna, and its circular diving pool. There may be no better place to enjoy the enviable views of Sydney Harbour than from Andrew (Boy) Charlton pool, set right on Woolloomooloo Bay. Previously called the new Domain Baths, the facility has a long history. Apart from being the site of Australia’s first swimming races, it was host to Andrew “Boy” Charlton in 1924 when he swam against Arne Borg of Sweden. Some 6,000 people gathered to watch Charlton beat Borg over 402 metres, setting a new Australian record. Three decades later, the baths were refurbished and reopened under his name. Now featuring a 50-metre outdoor saltwater pool, a 20-metre program pool and a host of sun lounges, Andrew Charlton pool is the perfect spot to well and truly settle in for the afternoon. The word “breathtaking” is thrown around a lot these days, but it may have the most beautiful poolside view in Sydney, placing it firmly at No 3. “I saw you in the lane next to meYou were doing freestyle, then you switched it aroundTo a little bit of backstroke… When I came to, you and your towel were gone …” Fitzroy swimming pool was most recently namechecked in the verses of Courtney Barnett’s Aqua Profunda!, named for the historic sign painted in the 1950s to warn Italian migrants of the “deep water”. But it’s been a cult go-to for artists and creatives for decades, featuring in Helen Garner’s quintessentially Melbourne novel Monkey Grip back in 1977. Opened in 1908, the pool was saved from closure in the 1990s following a heated community campaign and nowadays you’ll never be a real resident of Melbourne’s inner north until you visit it; a blanket of tattooed bodies stretched out on concrete, battered Sally Rooney paperbacks in hand. Fitzroy pool is an institution and a prime spot for people watching. Before Manuka swimming pool became a staple of the nation’s capital, Canberrans would swim in water holes down the Molonglo, Cotter and Murrumbidgee rivers. Then, in the summer of 1931, Canberra’s first pool (then called “The Swimming Pool”) was officially unveiled, set against the leafy Manuka Oval. Six decades later, I learned to swim in Manuka pool, passing many Sunday afternoons in my floaties. Designed in magical art deco style by EH Henderson – also known for the capital’s National Library and beloved bus shelters across the city – Manuka swimming pool is a must-visit for any pool connoisseurs. Featuring an outdoor 30-metre pool, toddlers’ pool and extensive grassland, Manuka pool tops the list for its beauty and grace. The heritage-listed facility still retains its period signage and deco architectural style. It was subject to a significant refresh in 2019, but the ACT government was careful to retain the original design, including specially imported tiles from the Czech Republic.",Arts/Culture,Australia’s 10 best public pools – sorted,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/13/australias-10-best-public-pools-sorted
