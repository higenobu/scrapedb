12/11/2021,"We are spouses, living in Britain, who were born in different countries. One of us, whose grandfather was an immigrant, has only British citizenship. The other is a Briton with dual citizenship who could, under the nationality and borders bill, as highlighted by Zoe Williams (Cruel ministers have made citizenship a tool of dirty politics, 8 December), in future have their British citizenship removed at the whim of a Home Office minister or official. Why might such a thing happen? Well, bear in mind that government amendments to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, also going through parliament, potentially criminalise most public protests, as pointed out by George Monbiot (As we turn away, Boris Johnson is grabbing more power. Where is the opposition?, 8 December). This double whammy of profoundly anti-democratic legislation will surely intimidate the newly created category of second-class British citizens, who may be moved to demonstrate on any issue whatsoever in the future. The entirely foreseeable next step will be to remove from all British citizens recourse to the European court of human rights. As Labour party members, we urge the Labour leadership to join with other parties in campaigning vigorously against both these bills.Vera da Silva Sinha and Chris SinhaCringleford, Norfolk   George Monbiot writes: “Johnson is the most dangerous prime minister to have presided over the UK in the democratic era.” Fair and reasonable methods of opposition – including demonstrations and legal challenges – are the very stuff of democratic politics. Introducing legislation to suppress such actions is the route to dictatorship. Yet why should we be surprised, as this is just one of many such actions by this cynical and sinister government. The list is extensive – cronyism through the awarding of contracts to relatives and friends; appointing friends and supporters to key posts to introduce bias into the checks and balances; intimidating and denigrating the media that attempts to offer balanced news coverage; manipulating voting processes and constituency boundaries for party political gain; and interfering with and undermining the authority of those implementing judicial and disciplinary processes. This is a government that has no respect for democracy. It will go to any lengths to crush those who challenge or oppose it, and is indeed led by “the most dangerous prime minister”.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  George Monbiot’s sobering article will be greeted with scepticism by those of an “it couldn’t happen here” persuasion, but it articulates what we have been feeling for some time now. Unfortunately, it can and is happening here, little by little, under a wholly corrupt government totally focused on keeping power and ignored by the wilfully ignorant bulk of the population who are concentrated on their own immediate concerns and not with wider issues until they rear up and bite them personally. Monbiot is right to feel there is a tipping point beyond which the change is unstoppable, and we may well be close to that point. We don’t apologise for thinking an analogy with Nazi Germany is appropriate.Brenda and Hugh EdwardsGrange-over-Sands, Cumbria  Warm thanks to George Monbiot and Gina Miller (Boris Johnson’s ‘war on judges’ is a fiction – the truth is, it is an attack on all of us, 8 December) for highlighting the terrifying threats to our democracy posed by the government’s legislative programme.

12/11/2021,"As co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for the 12-step programme for recovery from addictions, I am disappointed that Oscar Quine had been told that the 12 steps would cure his addiction (I was told the 12 steps would cure my addiction. Why did I end up feeling more broken?, 4 December). We do not claim that. The steps do not work for everyone, but they certainly do for many. The original 12-step programme for alcoholism has been successfully adapted over the years for drugs, food, gambling and many other addictions. The 12 steps are not a religious programme, but they are spiritually based. Addicts need to connect with a power in their lives greater than whatever has led to their addiction.  Many addiction-free atheists and non-believers are among our fellows. They embrace, alongside those of many faiths, the simple spiritual principles of honesty, open-mindedness and a willingness to help others who suffer. Achieving change is most effective with daily diligent and disciplined practice of the steps. This can be challenging. Anyone can get recovery for free if they are willing to work for it to the best of their ability. There are hundreds of 12-step live and Zoom meetings running across the UK and worldwide on a daily basis. The APPG brings these facts to the attention of parliamentarians, government and public bodies, so that in turn those who suffer can find awareness of 12-step recovery. With public funding for addiction services so severely constrained, the entirely free and voluntary nature of 12-step recovery makes this work all the more important, particularly for addicts who cannot access private rehabilitation centres.Clive BrookeLabour, House of Lords  Oscar Quine is right that the 12-step model doesn’t work for everyone. It didn’t work for my sister, who died recently from a cancer related to prolonged alcohol abuse. But it does work for many others. I worked for five years at the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust, now the Forward Trust, which ran programmes based on the 12 steps. I met hundreds of people whose lives – and the lives of their families – were transformed by the programme. It’s not a panacea, it clearly takes hard work and commitment, but there was definitely nothing “joyless” about the people I met. As I haven’t been through the 12 steps, I don’t want to talk as though I know more about it than I do, but the impression I got was that the reference to a “higher power” was based on individual choice, not formalised religion. What I do know is that the people I met who were helped by it seemed to be not just clean and sober, but somehow more alive than the rest of us.Claire WildLondon  Oscar Quine’s experience of working a 12-step programme for addiction is not unheard of but, in my experience, is by no means common. I am an atheist, and nearly 27 years sober as a reasonably regular attendee of AA meetings. I chose to attend meetings where there is neither a religious overtone nor prescriptive way of following the steps. Instead, I chose meetings where there is genuine kindness, empathy and fellowship. There are many such meetings. The 12-step programme works, as far as I can see, by bringing together people who share a common problem and are at various stages of recovering. The group’s experience of recovery is generally wiser than the individuals. That is the power. People find new friends with a common cause. The disease model of addiction is widely and internationally accepted. As is the success of the 12-step model in helping numerous people worldwide recover from substance addiction to lead clean, sober and contented lives. Inevitably, while it works for many people, 12-step recovery does not suit everyone. Outside professional help can often provide additional necessary support to resolve mental health and other issues, particularly associated with early-life trauma. I wish Oscar the same contentment, self-acceptance and happiness in his recovery that I have found on my journey in 12-step recovery.Peter NorthWinchester, Hampshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/11/2021,"Good sex, like good comedy, relies on timing, and maybe, 17 years after the original show ended, 11 years after the second film departed cinemas, Sex and the City no longer has its finger on the clitoris when it comes to timing. “And Just Like That, It All Went Wrong” was the New York Times’s verdict on the wildly publicised, moderately anticipated SATC follow-up series, And Just Like That, which debuted its first two episodes this week. The Guardian’s Lucy Mangan described it as at times “excruciating”. Certainly the jokes are bad. Not “Lawrence of my labia” bad, as Samantha (Kim Cattrall) notoriously said in Sex and the City 2. But a far cry from the spit-out-your-wine-with-laughter-and-shock level of the original show, which ran from 1998 to 2004. And that’s the least of its problems.  The show, once so brave, limits its discussions of women and ageing to whether Miranda should dye her grey hair, rather than confronting the more obvious issue of whether to have Botox and filler injections. The fashion, once integrated so beautifully into the show by stylist Patricia Field, now sits on the characters like costumes, the clothes wearing the women rather than the other way around. The characters always lived fantasy lives, but now they live ostentatiously, even repulsively wealthy ones, with Charlotte buying her children’s clothes at Oscar de la Renta and Carrie boasting that the fishmonger gave her the expensive kind of salmon, taking proceedings close to Dynasty territory. And Just Like That tries to be au courant, with Miranda worrying that she might be a “white saviour” and Carrie being castigated by her non-binary friend Che (Sara Ramirez) that she comes across like an “uptight cisgender female married lady … I know you got more”. Are “female” and “lady” now terms of abuse on SATC? Apparently so, and Carrie meekly agrees to try harder. It’s now fashionable to denigrate SATC as too white and too naff, but it was a genuine cultural phenomenon that changed how women saw their lives, and how an entire city – New York – saw itself. “I feel a little guilty that our show became the look for what New York is,” Sex and the City star Chris Noth, who plays Mr Big, told the Guardian this week. The once pretty barren Meatpacking District gentrified itself beyond recognisability during the show’s run, allowing women to brunch and shop down there, just like the characters. Women, too, took their cues from the show, which reassured them that going for cocktails with friends was far more fun than being married. Ever since the release of the increasingly appalling films in 2008 and 2010, and now the disappointment of And Just Like That, a common theory is that the show was too much of its time to endure. But like Friends, which has faced similar criticism, SATC has actually endured very well. The reruns still totally work, and that is because of a simple if often forgotten truth: the scripts were brilliant. Yes, the show was wrapped in a gauze of fantasy, and its depiction of women’s sex lives was revolutionary. But the reason it spoke to women so deeply was for neither of those reasons: it’s because it was soaked in emotional truth, and it was extremely funny. Never mind the discussions about cunnilingus and masturbation, although they were great, actually. It was the plotlines about Samantha’s breast cancer, Miranda caring for her mother-in-law with dementia, Charlotte’s infertility and Carrie’s affair with Big while he was married that stuck to the sides. The reason the movies and the new show don’t work isn’t because they’ve come out at the wrong time – it’s because their scripts are terrible. If the original show had been like And Just Like That, let alone Sex and the City 2, there would be no Sex and the City tour buses going around New York City today. It’s a mystery why the SATC spin-offs are so bad, given that they’re written by Michael Patrick King and executive produced by Parker, as the original show was. In truth, the original show lost its way in the last series, with its insistence that all the women end up shacked up with someone, betraying the courage of its original convictions, although at least the scripts were still good. Most likely, the huge success of the franchise cowed everyone involved into conventionality. It’s a shame. Some franchises cannot endure, it turns out. But, happily, old box sets live forever.",Arts/Television & radio,And Just Like That: bad jokes are the least of its problems,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/10/and-just-like-that-bad-jokes-are-the-least-of-its-problems
12/11/2021,"Sylvia Rose, a former social worker, writes (Letters, 6 December) on the class-based reasons people choose junk food: “In part, it’s historical: manual labourers, post-Industrial Revolution, cramming in as many cheap calories as possible – white bread, sugar, jam. In part, it’s the misery of being poor or marginalised, of needing a little something to cheer you up, to blunt the edge of it all, be it biscuits or cigarettes.” I wonder if she has met anyone who works for the NHS? My husband is an NHS surgeon. The standard daily fare in his last doctors’ mess was white toast, jam, sugary tea and coffee. When he’s on call – and lucky to get a quick break in the middle of the night – it’s McDonald’s or a kebab. As my mum, an NHS midwife for 30 years, says, the NHS runs on sugary tea, tins of biscuits and boxes of chocolates. These aren’t marginalised, poorly educated people, with no knowledge about health or the consequences of lifestyle, but people (like thousands outside the NHS) doing stressful jobs, where there’s no time to take breaks, who are overworked and looking for a quick burst of calories to get them through their shift.  So while class and education are a factor, they are only two, and it’s pertinent that those at the other end of the socioeconomic scale are also struggling. Perhaps our modern lifestyles, where time to eat and learn to cook are sadly scarce, across all classes, are to blame.Name and address supplied  How I agree with Sylvia Rose. Surely the solution lies in inspiring schoolchildren to love cooking? I am forever grateful for the basic cookery lessons that I received in the 1950s.

12/11/2021,"We, the friends and relations of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in England, would like to applaud the Guardian for your article (Myanmar’s junta condemned over guilty verdicts in Aung San Suu Kyi trial, 6 December). We cannot remain silent any longer about the situation there and that of Daw Suu in particular. Since the illegal coup on 1 February by the military, all the progress achieved under the National League for Democracy has been undone, leaving the country close to complete collapse. The farcical nature of the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi is reminiscent of a Whitehall comedy. She has been convicted of “incitement”, when her only offence was to oppose obedience to the illegal regime while she herself was gagged and held incommunicado in an unknown place of detention. This trial was judged fair by the army spokesman, who needs to be asked why the hearings had to be held in secret, with her lawyers banned from any reporting of proceedings.  Prospect Burma’s Autumn 2021 newsletter says: “The health and education systems have collapsed. Schools and universities have been closed for some 18 months. Over 42,000 public health workers have been fired, or quit their jobs in support of the Civil Disobedience Movement; over 200,000 staff have quit or have been dismissed in the education sector; over 1.7 million people are refugees or internally displaced, plus a further 250,000 civilians forced from their homes.” We now ask that world bodies, particularly the UN and Asean, continue to boycott the regime; that all countries put pressure on the junta to step down and cease to terrorise their own people; that Aung San Suu Kyi, the legal president, Win Myint, together with an estimated 10,000 political prisoners, should be released at once; and that the army should hand power back to the democratically elected government.Marie-Laure Aris, Christopher Gore-Booth, Adrian and Lucinda Phillips  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/11/2021,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a billionaire in possession of a sprawling media empire must be in want of a steady supply of bullshit. With the recent purchase of a Montana cattle ranch, home to 7,000 head, Rupert Murdoch now has access to more of the stuff than even Tucker Carlson could hope to shovel. The ranch, located in the south-west of the state, not too far from Yellowstone national park, was bought from Matador Cattle Co, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, for about $200m, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The ranch’s sale, between the two driving forces behind the conservative movement in the United States, is the largest in Montana’s history.  “This is a profound responsibility,” Murdoch said in a statement. “We feel privileged to assume ownership of this beautiful land and look forward to continually enhancing both the commercial cattle business and the conservation assets across the ranch.” The property is reported to cover roughly 340,000 acres, and span fifty miles from north to south, including “4,000 elk, 800 antelope and 1,500 mule deer” as well as a “28-mile-long creek stocked with trout” and 25 homes for employees, according to a representative for the Murdochs. According to at least one neighbor and fellow rancher, John Jackson, the chairman of the Beaverhead county commission, the Koch brothers “have been good neighbors”, as he told the Bilings Gazette. He did not expect much to change with the Murdochs moving in, although it’s unclear how much time the 90-year-old media scion will be spending there (a spokesperson said the family do intend to spend time on the ranch).. Many on social media were quick to joke about the parallels between the sale of the ranch and the HBO hit Succession, about a family loosely based on the Murdochs, as well as the Kevin Costner program Yellowstone. Another recent highly lauded work of fiction, the Jane Campion film The Power of the Dog, is set on a Montana ranch. In the film, head rancher and son of wealth Benedict Cumberbatch proves unable to connect with those around him and sets out to ruin the lives of everyone he encounters. Koch Industries has been busy selling off similar properties around the US of late, including one in Kansas listed for around $24m and one in Texas at about $124m.

12/11/2021,"Two doses of a Covid vaccine offer less protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron than with Delta, with a lower level of protection seen against the new variant even after a booster jab. According to the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Omicron is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December, based on current trends, while there could be more than a million infections by the end of the month – a tally that will be dominated by Omicron.  The vaccine efficacy data suggests that people who have had two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab 25 or more weeks ago have far lower protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron than with Delta. While the data suggests about 40% protection against Delta at this time point, it suggests protection from Omicron could be less than 10%. There is a great deal of uncertainty around that figure, though, because of the small number of people studied and the fact that the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab was largely given to older or more vulnerable people. A similar trend was seen for those who have had two doses of the Pfizer jab, with about 60% protection against Delta at 25 or more weeks since the second dose, and just under 40% protection against Omicron at the same time point – although again, there are uncertainties around the figures. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: “These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain. “The data suggest this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible. We expect the vaccines to show higher protection against the serious complications of Covid-19, so if you haven’t yet had your first two doses please book an appointment straight away.” For both groups, a Pfizer booster jab raised the level of protection against both Omicron and Delta, providing about 70-75% protection against symptomatic infection with the former. More details soon …",News/World news,"Two jabs much less protective against Omicron infection, UK data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/two-jabs-give-less-protection-against-catching-omicron-than-delta-uk-data-shows
12/11/2021,"Are we there yet? Are we at the end of the Boris Johnson odyssey? It’s an impatient question, given it was only two years ago this very weekend that Johnson was celebrating a victory that brought an 80-seat majority and excited talk of a 10-year reign in No 10. An impatient question but one hardly confined to excitable Westminster journalists. The prime minister’s own colleagues are asking it of each other and themselves, prompted by the serial revelations of a torrid week. “Cummings was bad, but this is off the scale,” one minister tells me, reflecting the widely shared view that Dominic Cummings’ lockdown jaunt to Barnard Castle has been outdone by the video of sniggering Johnson aides implicitly admitting that they had been partying in Downing Street while the rest of the country faced a bleak, often lonely Christmas; that they had been knocking back the booze while many were denied the right to give so much as a consoling touch to a dying loved one.  That imagery should be devastating for Johnson, who ran, however improbably, as the populist tribune of the people against the hated establishment. The mock press conference footage exposed that fraud. It confirms voters’ worst fears, says that same minister, “that the government is a conspiracy of elites, taking the public for fools”. Add to that the striking allegation that the PM misled his own standards adviser, Lord Geidt, over the source of funds for his absurdly extravagant makeover of the Downing Street flat – decorating Versailles while outside the palace the people trembled in the face of plague – and you have a prime minister confirmed as the embodiment of the very elite he claimed to oppose: pampered, greedy and out of touch. The result is that the man who united shire Tories with “red wall” Brexit voters to forge a winning coalition in December 2019 has crafted a new alliance in December 2021. He has brought together previously warring factions of his own party – the anti-mask crowd, good-government types who remember integrity, and the 2019 intake still waiting for Johnson to deliver on his promises – in unison against him. The latter group is the one watched most closely. There are a lot of them and they face constituents who made clear two years ago that they were merely lending their vote to the Tories, that their support was conditional. “When they are complaining,” says one MP of the class of 2019, “then he’s in real trouble. And they are.” All of this would obviously have finished off any normal politician, but Johnson does not fit that description. He has already survived so much – not just successive waves of scandal but a record of incompetence in the early handling of Covid that led to tens of thousands of needless deaths – that it’s tempting to reach the same conclusion that Johnson drew about himself long ago: to him the normal rules do not apply. You can imagine him staggering on until the Christmas cessation of hostilities, then returning in the new year full of new promises and new slogans, breezily dismissing the current agonies as old news. Such are the arguments of the Westminster village, as cheerleaders and critics trade competing scenarios. But there’s one player missing from these dramas, in which all power rests with the 361 members of the parliamentary Conservative party. That missing player is the electorate. So often our politics is like that, the public reduced to a data point, their involvement limited to one say every four or five years and the muffled voice they are granted in the form of digits on an opinion poll. Happily, next week may be different. There is a byelection in rock-solid North Shropshire, the seat vacated by Owen Paterson, the man who broke lobbying rules, and whom Johnson wanted to let off without punishment. Given that Tory MPs’ attachment to Johnson is deeply transactional, contingent solely on his electoral prowess, a shock result on Thursday could prove to be a tipping point. Defeat there will spark mass panic among Conservative MPs: if that seat can fall, they will say to themselves, then what about mine? Even Labour’s most optimistic souls concede they cannot win North Shropshire, which leaves the Liberal Democrats as de-facto challenger. But some Labour tribalists are hardly enthused by the prospect of a Tory defeat there at the hands of the Lib Dems. They worry a revived Lib Dem party could be a headache, and they’d prefer to see a weakened Johnson remain in post. One senior Labour figure says “it’s a no-brainer” that the party should not want to see the Tories repeat their trick of 1990 and 2019 – switching leaders, so the public feels it has had the catharsis of a change of government without changing the governing party. Much better, runs the argument, for Johnson to limp on to the next election, where he’ll be a scandal-plagued, damaged-goods PM facing former prosecutor and straight-arrow Keir Starmer. That, they say, is a contest Labour could win. I get all that logic. But politics can’t always be about gaming out scenarios and plotting chess moves. Sometimes it’s simpler than that. In this case, the plea needs to go out to the Tory voters of North Shropshire. They were cheated by their Tory MP, who promised to work for them but was found to be lobbying for the companies that paid him handsomely. They have been cheated by a Tory prime minister who has lied and lied – setting the rules for everyone else while he and his chums broke them without a second thought, laughing at the saps who were stupid enough to comply. This isn’t only an offence against the integrity of our public life, it’s a danger to our public health. Because you cannot fight a pandemic if the government’s instructions will no longer be followed. Many Britons will look at Cummings’ eye test and the Secret Santa in No 10 and decide they won’t be fooled again. We face a government that is cruel, useless and rotten from the head down. The voters of North Shropshire have a rare chance on Thursday to declare that the citizens of this country will not just take it. That they won’t just shrug and say, “That’s Boris.” That they will demand better. The political after-effects will take care of themselves. The most immediate task is to send Downing Street the clearest possible message: the party’s over.

12/11/2021,"In the four years since Willow Smith last performed live in the UK, the 21-year-old has been through multiple artistic transformations. On 2017’s The 1st, she was a raw singer-songwriter in the vein of Tracy Chapman or Fiona Apple; her eponymous 2019 album ventured into psychedelic soul. With this year’s pop-punk-influenced Lately I Feel Everything, it feels as though Willow has found her final form as a Black alt poster girl for Gen Z. (Her mum, Jada Pinkett Smith, previously fronted the nu metal band Wicked Wisdom.) Her angsty but powerful vocals are right at home in Camden’s sold-out home of rock. The show starts with a special guest, which turns out to be her older brother, Jaden. Perhaps spooked by the recent deaths at the Astroworld festival, he checks that the crowd have enough space and asks fans to cross their arms if they feel uncomfortable. Amid clouds of smoke, he performs his song Icon, then introduces his little sister. “Once upon a time Willow would go on stage and then I would go on stage,” he says. “But now the tide has turned.”  Willow’s set feels like a metamorphosis – a young artist coming into her own, belting out long clear notes that dwarf the sound of her guitarist and drummer. A few tracks in, she pulls her woolly hat off to reveal a bold shaved head; she puffs nonchalantly on a cigarette like a rock star and shows off her prowess on guitar on Female Energy Part 2. Between songs, she instructs fans to fill the room with positive energy. “I’d really like to know your deepest darkest fears and aspirations,” she says. The atmosphere of liberation proves contagious when a fan throws their wig in the air at the crescendo of TikTok favourite Meet Me at Our Spot. Notably absent from the setlist is her debut single Whip My Hair, released when Willow was 10 years old. She has spoken about being traumatised by that era of her career. More than a decade later, she’s an artist whose anxieties, frustrations and pride fuel her most beloved music to date. “I couldn’t have asked to come back and had a better show than this,” she says, beaming at her fans.",Arts/Music,Willow review – youngest of the all-star Smiths comes into her own,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/willow-review-electric-ballroom-london
12/11/2021,"This year was a much more stable year for the women’s game than the Covid-affected 2020, which meant that the whole process of doing the top 100 list was much easier and a lot more fun. There was a fantastic Olympic Games in Tokyo with its own spectacular moments and memories and potential power shifts in several domestic leagues, whether permanent or temporary. Paris Saint-Germain finally ended Lyon’s dominance in France, Bayern Munich did the same to Wolfsburg in Germany while Barcelona became European champions after years of Lyon dominance with a dominant and devastating 4-0 win over Chelsea back in May.  It was a similar story in the United States with Washington Spirit winning the NWSL Championship for the first time and Canada taking a first gold medal in Tokyo, all of which is reflected in this year’s rankings. Barcelona dominate with 13 players in the list, Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas taking a hard-to-argue-against victory with 3,136 points, 293 points clear of Vivianne Miedema, who finishes as the runner-up for the second year running, ahead of former winner Sam Kerr. Forty-six of our 83 judges had Putellas as their No 1 with Miedema the next best with 15 winning votes. The two Champions League finalists dominate the top 10 with six Barcelona players joined by three Chelsea players as well as Miedema from Arsenal. The changing face of the top 10 this year sees five players make the very top section of the list for a first time: Putellas, Jenni Hermoso, Fran Kirby, Irene Paredes and Aitana Bonmati. PSG and Lyon are level with 10 players each on the list, though the latter have a couple more players on loan with NWSL side OL Reign. The USA were once again the nation with the most entrants, with 15 players making the list, whether it be returning senior internationals such as Megan Rapinoe, Rose Lavelle, Tobin Heath and Christen Press or the stars of the domestic league in 2021, such as Trinity Rodman. Last year’s winner Pernille Harder dropped to fifth and as ever it was fantastic to see so many new faces on the list this year, with 17 brand new entrants, including Mariona Caldentey and Lauren Hemp jumping straight into the top 50. There were new entrants both young and more experienced, with exciting talent such as Rodman, Melvine Malard, Sandy Baltimore and Catarina Macario all in, as were the likes of Katie McCabe, Esther González, the NWSL top scorer Ashley Hatch and Paulina Dudek, the latter of whom came home in 101st in 2020. After last year’s schedule difficulties and a lack of nominations, many players also return this year after dropping out 12 months ago, with Kirby the highest returning player in seventh place, while Stina Blackstenius, Ellen White and Lavelle are in the top 30 too. There are some big movers too and deservedly so. Just as the likes of Marie-Antoinette Katoto, Magdalena Eriksson and Alexia Putellas shot up the list in 2020, Bonmati is the biggest mover in 2021, moving up 83 places into the top 10 for the first time. Patri Guijarro, Ashley Lawrence and Sandra Panos also gained more than 50 places, while Hanna Glas moved up 48 places to become the top full-back ahead of Lucy Bronze, the England international dropping out of the top 10 for the first time. Rodman and Germany’s Lena Oberdorf are the youngest players this year, both 19 and the only teenagers in the list, while Formiga’s absence means the retiring USA legend Carli Lloyd is the most experienced at 39, coming home in 70th place in her final year in the rankings. It has once again been an honour and a pleasure to see how the list has come together this year, with a fantastic blend of incredibly talented experienced and young players from all around the world ahead of what should be an exciting 2022 with a European Championships to look forward to in England and another chance for the very best to shine on the biggest stage.",Sport/Football,Barcelona dominate top 100 after Women’s Champions League triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/barcelona-dominate-top-100-after-womens-champions-league-triumph
12/11/2021,"Few laughs are as forced, fake, exaggerated and downright obsequious as the Football Press Conference Laugh and a classic of the genre could be heard at Jürgen Klopp’s latest audience with the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate. Taking his seat at the top table for media duties before Aston Villa’s visit to Anfield on Saturday, Klopp greeted his audience, picked up a water bottle, unscrewed the lid and announced that he would not be answering any questions about $tevie Mbe.  Following a pregnant pause he grinned, showing all present his expensive Dulux Colour Chart “Frosted White” veneers, prompting all present to realise he was joking and completely lose their minds. While it was unlikely to get him an opening slot on Live at the Apollo, as gags go it wasn’t too bad; we’ll certainly give him that. However, given the reaction it got from the assembled hacks, the German could have been forgiven for thinking he’d morphed into mid-1980s Billy Connolly, as his audience erupted into paroxysms of collective mirth. Braying and honking at preposterously great length, they slapped their thighs and rubbed tears from their eyes … then asked him questions about $tevie Mbe. With the Anfield favourite returning to his old stomping ground as Villa’s manager, it is no surprise the former Liverpool skipper and fan favourite has captured the pre-match headlines. And having been on his current stepping stone for all of four games, the obvious focus was on whether or not he was destined to manage his old club in the future. “Yes, absolutely,” tooted Klopp, to stony silence before tapping his mic. “The only thing is when is the right moment for that. I think it will definitely happen and that is good for everybody.” Meanwhile in his own press conference, Mbe wasn’t so much cracking wise as resisting the urge to commit an act of violence as yet another journalist asked him about his relationship with Liverpool. “I want to win every game that I play in and now my priority, my focus, and everything I give on a daily basis, will be for Aston Villa,” he sighed. “One thing I can guarantee the supporters, the players and all the staff here is that when I commit to something, I’m all in.” An assurance of sorts that, in comedy terms, he’ll be at Villa all week. Don’t forget to tip your waitress and try the chicken. Join John Brewin from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Brentford 0-0 Watford in the Premier League. “Erling Haaland will take the next step. Bayern, Real, Barcelona, Manchester City – these are the big clubs he can join. City won the Premier League five times, significantly more than Manchester United. When we moved to BVB, we all knew this step would come” – infamous Mr 20% Mino Raiola plays fast and loose with Premier League facts as he tries to engineer a bumper move from Dortmund for his goal-guzzling Norway striker. Who is the Guardian’s No 1 female footballer for 2021? It’s … oh, just click to find out. “You can tell Matt Dony (yesterday’s Fiver letters) not to worry. In a few years’ time Liverpool will have an ex-player who was much better than Divock Origi being brought in as their woefully under-qualified manager” – Richard Saunders. “As a flamin’ Australian, just when I thought there was no way for Sam Kerr to become more of a national icon she goes full Andrew Symonds on a pitch invader (yesterday’s Quote of the Day). No offence to our nation’s frontline worker heroes (or Pat Cummins), but I think she’s a lock for Australian of the Year” – Adam Osborne. “There are multiple permutations for Peter Lingard’s team-related pub names around England (yesterday’s letters). Forest County, City Rovers, etc. But I would definitely be happy to fork out London prices for Tin in The Ham Palace” – Andrew Want. “I was thinking of opening a pop-up Christmas pub called Bar Humbug” – Peter Worley.

The top 42 clubs in Spanish men’s football have voted through a €2.1bn investment from private equity fund CVC Capital Partners for an 8.2% stake in a new company that will manage their broadcasting revenues. Only Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Ibiza voted against, while one club abstained. Brighton v Spurs on Sunday has been called off because Covid is refraining from doing one and Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta wants clearer rules around postponements. Anthony Martial’s Mr 15% has also been flapping his gums wildly in the hope of earning some serious coin. “Anthony wishes to leave [Manchester United] in January,” wibbled Philippe Lamboley. “He just needs to play … and I will speak to the club soon.” Meanwhile, Ralf Rangnick revealed he got on the blower to Paul Pogba to ask him when he might be able to do a shift in United’s midfield. “We had a telephone call for about 10 or 15 minutes,” yelped Rangnick, who has yet to meet Pogba while he recuperates in Dubai. “He told me he is getting better but … of course he has been idle for quite some time.” Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall is trying his hand at optimism after a walloping at the Emirates by Barcelona in Women’s Big Cup. “It’s great even if it doesn’t feel good losing 4-0,” he parped. And Brendan Rodgers sounds delighted to be taking Leicester into Tin Pot after being dumped out of Big Vase by Napoli in a thrilling 3-2 defeat. “With all due respect to the competition, I’m not sure what it is,” he head-scratched. OK, so now you know Alexia Putellas is No 1, here’s Bea Redondo on how the Barça midfielder became the best in the world.

12/11/2021,"Days after a homeless man with mental health issues lit the Christmas tree outside Fox News’s Manhattan studios on fire, “Fox desperately wants this to be a political thing,” said Jimmy Kimmel. Fox & Friends hosts decried New York City bail reform which allowed the suspect to go free, for example, with host Brian Kilmeade even calling the arson “a hate crime against us”.  “You can’t commit a hate crime against a channel, in the same way you can’t shoplift at Etsy – it’s impossible, really,” Kimmel retorted. “They must not have anything to talk about at Fox this week,” he added, “because they really went to town on this ‘we have been victimized’, jag,” none more so than host Tucker Carlson, who called the burning “an attack on religious observance”. “The [Department of Justice] can tell you precisely how many Qur’ans were burned last year in the United States, but they don’t keep track of Christmas trees, why is that?” Carlson said. “Well for one, little snowflake, unlike the Quran, Christians don’t base our faith on pine trees,” Kimmel responded. “It’s the reason we don’t hang popcorn and cookie ornaments on the Bible. But you know that.” Kimmel also mocked a new MasterClass video by Hillary Clinton on “resilience”, in which she gets emotional reading from the victory speech she had planned to give in 2016. “What is this? What is she doing? Is this a Christmas present for Donald Trump?” Kimmel wondered. “It’s like she made him a Cameo video for his birthday. Donald Trump will masturbate to this MasterClass.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on Joe Biden, who hosted a virtual Summit for Democracy this week. “I’m not sure we’re the country to be hosting it,” Colbert said of the two-day summit with 80 world leaders. “These days, a US president lecturing the world about stable democracy is like Andy Cohen hosting the Rational Discourse Among Sober Housewives Summit.” Biden kicked off the summit with a virtual address. “Government of the people, by the people, for the people can at times be fragile, but it also is inherently resilient … democracy is hard, we all know that.” “Do we though, Joe?” Colbert responded. “It’s like he’s saying all the right things but he kinda seems like the kind grandpa who’s moved in because Mom and Dad have ‘gone away for awhile’ and doesn’t understand where the family’s at right now. He’s reminding the kids about the basics: dinner is at 6, face and hands washed, say grace first, while ignoring the cockfighting ring they have set up in the family room.” Colbert also touched on the burning of the Fox News Christmas tree, and especially Brian Kilmeade’s attempt to label it a “hate crime” against the network. “Yes, it’s clearly a hate crime against a historically marginalized group: morons,” Colbert deadpanned. “Fox lives matter!” “Republicans are, as usual, lying about lockdowns and vaccines,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “Instead, they’d rather focus on absurd, unproven remedies like hydroxychloroquine or ingesting bleach,” or a new one from Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson: mouthwash. “Standard gargle, mouthwash, has been proven to kill the coronavirus,” Johnson told a radio show on Wednesday. “If you get it, you may reduce viral replication … why not try all these things?” “Or even better, don’t use mouthwash and your bad breath will keep people 6ft away from you at all times,” Meyers quipped. To be clear: Listerine confirms on their website that mouthwash “is not intended to prevent or treat Covid-19” and should be used as directed on the label. “I don’t even want to imagine what’s next,” said Meyers. “Is Titleist going to have to issue a statement that says ‘Contrary to Republican statements, covering our golf balls in Sudafed and eating them for dinner will not give you ‘Superman eyes?’” Hillary Clinton is giving a MasterClass on resiliency, available everywhere. Well… except maybe Wisconsin. pic.twitter.com/M3MVVSqnrn And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also looked at Hillary Clinton’s new MasterClass, in which she faces the camera and reads from her planned 2016 victory speech that she’s “never shared” with anyone before. “The way she’s sitting like that and reading it to us, it’s like the world’s most depressing fairy tale – ‘Once upon a time, an ogre crushed the dreams of a princess, and nobody lived happily ever after, the end,’” Noah said. “I really love how she was like ‘I’ve never shared this speech with anybody before, it was too painful, and – you’re paying me how much? Oh well, I guess I could read a few pages,’” he added. “I’ll say one thing: you’ll never see Donald Trump doing this,” he concluded. “He doesn’t write backup speeches, because whether he wins or loses, that dude gives the same speech.”",Arts/Culture,Kimmel on Hillary Clinton’s MasterClass: ‘Is this a Christmas present for Trump?’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/10/jimmy-kimmel-hillary-clinton-masterclass-trump
