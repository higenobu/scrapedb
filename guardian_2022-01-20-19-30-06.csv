1/20/2022,"Greg Rutherford’s dream of becoming the first British athlete to win a medal at a summer and winter Olympics has ended after he missed out on selection for GB’s bobsleigh squad for the Winter Games in Beijing. The London 2012 Olympic champion came out of retirement last year in an attempt to qualify in driver Lamin Deen’s sled, and then battled back from injury to make his bobsleigh debut this month. However Deen failed to achieve the necessary qualifying standard which ended Rutherford’s chances of making the flight to Beijing.  Brad Hall and Mica McNeill will pilot British crews in the two-man, four-man and women’s bobsleigh, with both having also represented Team GB at the last Games in Pyeongchang four years ago. Hall and his crew of Taylor Lawrence, Nick Gleeson and Greg Cackett believe they are genuine medal contenders, having won six medals on the World Cup circuit as well as another at the Olympic test event in China in October. That achievement is particularly impressive given they are not funded by UK Sport due to historical problems in the sport and a poor performance in Pyeongchang. Speaking after the team was announced, Hall insisted the team could make history: “We’ve had a great season so far and we’re hoping to carry that momentum into the Games. The boys have regularly been among the best starters in the world, too, and we’re heading to Beijing full of confidence. “We’re at the business end of the season and it’s now all about giving it everything we’ve got at the Olympics, knowing that we’ve got a realistic chance of coming home with a medal.” Montell Douglas, who competed for Team GB at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games in athletics, will team up with McNeill in the women’s bobsleigh. McNeill, who made the World Cup podium when she and Nicoll won a maiden World Cup silver in Sigulda this month, added: “It’s been a very different journey to the Games this time round but I’ve loved every moment of making it happen. I can’t wait to get back on the ice out there and represent Team GB.” The team’s leader Bruce Tasker, who won bronze in Sochi in 2014, also predicted a strong showing. “It’s really exciting heading into an Olympic Games with teams producing their best results ever,” he said. “You cannot ask more of an athlete than to be the best they have ever been and both teams have achieved record performances this year.”",Sport/Sport,Rutherford’s Winter Olympic dream over after bobsleigh squad misses out,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/greg-rutherford-winter-olympic-dream-over-after-bobsleigh-squad-misses-out
1/20/2022,"Sajid Javid has admitted a senior Tory publicly urging Boris Johnson to quit has been “damaging”, as critics of the prime minister sought to maintain pressure on him after the embarrassing defection of a Conservative MP. The health secretary said he wished the former Brexit secretary David Davis had not told Johnson at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday: “In the name of God, go.” The words echoed a plea made to the former wartime leader Neville Chamberlain in the Commons.  Javid said he had known Davis for many years and had huge respect for him. “We don’t always agree on everything and that is one thing I don’t agree with him on,” he told Sky News. “It is damaging, of course it is. If you said to me would I rather he didn’t get up and say something like that then, of course, I wouldn’t want to see that but that’s the decision he made. “The prime minister has come to the House of Commons last week, he has set out and apologised, set out what has happened but most importantly I think he has asked for this investigation to be done, for the time and space to be given for it to be completed and the facts to be established. “And once they are, the PM will come very quickly back to parliament and submit himself so David Davis, or anyone else, can ask … whatever question they want.” Javid said he liked Christian Wakeford, the MP for Bury South who dramatically crossed the floor of the Commons chamber on Wednesday to sit with Labour having defected from the Conservatives, citing Johnson’s “disgraceful” conduct. Many Tory MPs have been critical of Johnson’s handling of a slew of allegations about parties held in Downing Street and other parts of government during lockdown. However, they are seeking to trigger a no-confidence vote in Johnson by submitting the required number of 54 letters calling for such a ballot. The latest estimate by Tory rebels is that about 30 letters have been submitted. Even if Johnson were to survive such a vote, the Guardian understands that the 1922 Committee, which administers the ballot, is considering changing the rules to shorten the length of time a prime minister is immune from another no-confidence vote from 12 months to six. Javid told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the rule-breaking parties – such as ones held in No 10 the night before Prince Philip’s funeral – “damage our democracy”. He called the gatherings “wrong in every single way”. Reflecting on Wakeford’s defection, Javid said: “I feel sorry for the people of Bury South, they voted Tory. I think a byelection would be welcome, I think Christian would be happy with a byelection. “Given the people of Bury South rightly voted Conservative in 2019, they wanted to get Brexit done, they wanted to see a strong economy and now they’ve got an MP that has changed his affiliation without their permission, why not give them a say?” Javid, who ran for the leadership in 2019, did not rule out doing so again. “There’s a good lineup of talent I would say in the party there and so there is no leadership election, we have got a PM, he is getting on with the job and that is what matters,” he told Sky News. “There is no leadership election.”",News/Politics,"PM being urged to quit by senior Tory is ‘damaging’, admits Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/pm-urged-quit-david-davis-damaging-admits-sajid-javid-boris-johnson-tories
1/20/2022,"Carhartt, the Michigan-based workwear company, is facing a wave of conservative backlash after its CEO announced that it will keep its vaccination mandate, despite a recent supreme court decision to block a federal mandate that would require businesses with over 100 employees to get vaccinated or take weekly Covid-19 tests. In an email sent to employees last Friday, Mark Valade said that Covid-19 vaccinations remain mandatory. “We put workplace safety at the very top of our priority list and the supreme court’s recent ruling doesn’t impact that core value,” Valade wrote.  “We, and the medical community, continue to believe vaccines are necessary to ensure a safe working environment for every associate and even perhaps their households. While we appreciate that there may be differing views, workplace safety is an area where we and the union that represents our associates cannot compromise,” Valade added. “An unvaccinated workforce is both a people and a business risk that our company is unwilling to take.” Since Valade’s email, conservative pundits and social media users have criticized Carhartt, prompting the #BoycottCarhartt hashtag to trend nationally on Twitter. Matthew Kolken, an immigration lawyer tweeted, “Ironic that Carhartt is mandating vaccination for their employees considering that the company outsources production to China. #BoycottCarhartt.” Elijah Schaffer, a host on the right-wing outlet the Blaze, tweeted, “Wow @Carhartt is subjecting their employees to medical abuse. Very bad look. Definitely should stop buying their products if you do.” “Never ever buy @Carhartt products again,” wrote Sebastian Gorka, a conservative and controversial former aide to president Donald Trump’s deputy assistant. Others came to the company’s defense, with one user tweeting, “Wow @Carhartt I’m impressed and I will be purchasing from a company that cares about protecting all of its workers. Thank you for not making this issue political & for believing in science. We need more companies like yours!” Another user tweeted, “I’m a commercial and heavy and highway carpenter and have been buying Carhartt overalls and carpenter pants for over 30 years. Way to go Carhartt. Real men wear Carhartt and get vaccinated.” Last December, the company implemented a requirement for all its US employees to be fully vaccinated by 4 January or face termination. Carhartt said it will accept medical and religious exemptions for review and has interviewed employees to gather information regarding their situation or beliefs. The decision was met with protests from a handful of employees. “All of us, you know associated, have worked completely through the Covid, you know through the pandemic. We’ve been loyal, we’ve been faithful and then now all of a sudden it’s like you’ve got to comply,” Angela Faulk, a Carhartt employee in Madisonville, Kentucky, told WEVV last December. “We love, we love Carhartt, working for Carhartt but we just feel like this decision is wrong,” she added. In response to the protests, Valade wrote last week that workers in two Carhartt locations, including its Madisonville branch, were given extensions and now have until 15 February to get vaccinated.",News/US news,Clothing brand Carhartt in conservative crosshairs for issuing vaccine directive,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/carhartt-vaccine-mandate-backlash-conservative
1/20/2022,"Badri Ibrahim is a Sudanese comic artist and the founder of the Abbas Comics empire. His strips are quirky and irreverent, poking fun at the Sudanese military and encouraging civic activism. One recurrent character is a hapless but wise cat called Ghadanfar, a sort of Garfield meets Snoopy protagonist, who finds himself on the wrong end of misunderstandings with neighbourhood felines and humans. It is all rendered in colloquial dialect and is dry, funny and often poignant. So popular has the comic become that Ibrahim is regularly commissioned to do private work, rendering Ghadanfar in different guises – as a bashful groom on a wedding invitation card, for example.  The majority of this work comes through Facebook, where his comics have about 19,000 followers. “I ran the page for about a year,” Ibrahim says. By then, it had become its own community, and now he does not need to spend much time maintaining it. During the launch period, Ibrahim spent a lot of time “posting regularly and engaging with comments” and also “sending the page to everyone I know”. Freelance work came through those comments. “People and businesses would send me a message through the page, looking for an artist. Sometimes they ask for one of my comic characters to use for a product.” He can’t imagine how he would have launched his artistic career without Facebook. The social network has two benefits for businesses – not only in Africa, but for all emerging markets. The first is ease of access. “Everybody has Facebook,” Ibrahim tells me from his studio in Khartoum, where he is still working late at night. “Everybody knows how to use it. Most of my audience is in Sudan and they can share my content easily.” The second benefit is its analytics function. Ibrahim can see who shares his content and how it spreads, and make decisions about how to increase his business. But, for many people, Facebook is not only indispensable but unavoidable. Across Africa, Facebook is the internet. Businesses and consumers depend heavily on it because access to the app and site are free on many African telecoms networks, meaning you don’t need any phone credit to use it. In 2015, Facebook launched Free Basics, an internet service that gives users credit-free access to the platform. Designed to work on low-cost mobile phones, which make up the vast majority of devices on the continent, it offers a limited format, with no audio, photo and video content. Over the past five years, Free Basics has been rolled out in 32 African countries. Facebook’s ambition does not end there. Where there are no telecoms providers to partner with, or where infrastructure is poor, the company has been developing satellites that can beam internet access to remote areas. This plan, however, was set back in 2016, when a rocket powered by Elon Musk’s SpaceX exploded, destroying an AMOS-6 satellite on board that Facebook had intended to launch and, through it, lease internet connectivity in partnership with the Eutelsat, a French satellite company. Internet access in Africa is overwhelmingly via mobile phones; only about 8% of African households have a computer, whereas phone ownership hovers at around 50%. Half of mobiles are online, but not via billed plans. The majority of data users are pay as you go, and sometimes own multiple sims to switch between cost-effective plans. When the data they have purchased runs out, Facebook is still there. Western users are deleting their accounts for a variety of reasons, among them the platform’s record on privacy, its contribution to political volatility by designing algorithms that prioritise disagreement and friction, and its staleness as a user experience. Younger users prefer shorter, more transient content, as on TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. According to whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony to the US Senate, the company is aware of its stagnating growth in certain places and demographics. “Facebook understands that if they want the company to grow, they have to find new users,” she told senators. An internal Facebook document refers to a decline in younger users in “more developed economies”. In much the same way that tobacco companies migrated their efforts to emerging markets once the potential elsewhere was diminished by landmark lawsuits, regulation and awareness raising, so is Facebook focusing on new pastures. In 2020, as the pandemic began, I found my movements on the African continent limited for months at a time – for instance, in Egypt during an airport shutdown and a strict sunset curfew. My Facebook account – a relic of younger days and old online habits – became essential if I wanted to contact businesses, find phone numbers, order food and even hunt down tips for securing vaccines. The links I followed inevitably ended up in variations of a “Join Facebook to comment/message/contact” page. In the end I reluctantly reactivated my account. The timeline I returned to was a virtual Marie Celeste, a tumbleweed of posts from friends and relatives who had also long left the site, but never bothered to delete their accounts, which had become prey to viruses and phishing. Yet, Facebook was soon my most used social media app. Mona Amin had the same experience. When she moved from the US to Kenya in 2017, Facebook was inescapable. Settling down in a new country that didn’t have the infrastructure she was accustomed to meant that everything from finding places to rent to sourcing furniture happened via Facebook. For someone whose last interactions on Facebook had been to like people’s photos from a night out, the new interface was overwhelming and unwieldy. “I didn’t even know how to use it any more,” she says. “But it is useful, and there are a lot of people still on there. Or they’ve rejoined.” To users in volatile economies with disrupted supply chains, Facebook isn’t just useful, it is vital. Balqees Awad lives in a remote part of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, a city that has witnessed political instability and food and fuel shortages over the past three years. One closed Facebook group in particular has been a lifeline – helping her to secure bread and petrol. “When a bakery receives a bread delivery, or a petrol station replenishes its fuel, someone always posts in the group. They even tell us when there is heightened police presence in certain areas. Security patrols sometimes pick up people for no reason and extort or detain them.” Members are vetted before they are allowed entry into the group to ensure they are trustworthy sources of information, and not gathering intelligence to report to jittery security and police forces. Awad buys her data, as she buys almost everything else, including her food, electricity and gas, in small, pre-paid quantities. She doesn’t pay a single bill at the end of the month apart from rent. “The ‘small small economy’,” is what we call it,” says Nanjala Nyabola, a Kenyan writer and advocate. This describes the “kadogo economy” in Kenya, where commodities are sold in the smallest possible unit – one banana, one piece of bread, one ounce of flour, one megabyte at a time. Small is the way it has to be for much of sub-Saharan Africa – not just for ease of budgeting, but because a large section of the population is unbanked, so the direct debits required for contracted phone services are not an option. But, even when markets are more sophisticated, Facebook still maintains a strong grasp on business owners and users. Amina Rashad runs Glow, a Cairo-based business that provides healthy meals, nutrition programmes and juices. She started the company from her home in 2017 and simultaneously set up a Facebook and Instagram page. “It’s what made my business,” she says. “It was my virtual store for such a long time.” She took orders via Facebook messenger and a WhatsApp widget embedded in the Facebook and Instagram page. Once the business took off, she was able to diversify the way she received orders, building a website and an app, both of which take orders and payments. An affluent clientele base means that her customers are more likely to use a bank. Egypt’s e-commerce infrastructure has developed rapidly over the past decade, particularly in the food and grocery delivery sector, which helps the capital’s growing middle class save time and hassle in a sprawling, densely populated and traffic-congested city. But there are still limitations that send Rashad back to social media, where orders are taken manually and paid for on delivery. The company’s website and app payments system is hosted on a shared platform, rather than a proprietary one, a common arrangement that is cost-effective for a growing business. But, despite the volume of orders that now comes from the website, and the relatively low cost of automating payments, shared platforms come with less control when things go wrong – such as provider servers going down, or when there is a need for urgent site maintenance. “There is a highly personalised element to the product,” says Rashad, so she is happy to remain in an orders ecosystem that is less anonymous, “so we can go back and check details, answer questions, check allergies.” Facebook presents its free internet initiatives in Africa as philanthropy, but they are also likely to be a way for the company to reposition itself, as users log off in the west and log on elsewhere. There is growing awareness in the global south that Facebook’s overtures may have sinister implications. Free Basics was effectively banned in India in 2016, after an outcry that the initiative violates the rules of net neutrality, the principle that all content and applications should be enabled by internet service providers. According to research by Global Voices, Facebook’s actions constitute “digital colonialism”, where it “is building this little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”. These consumers aren’t always passive. The concentration of users on Facebook in some African countries has had some positive outcomes in terms of facilitating free speech and civic activism in nations where oppressive regimes have a tight grip on the public space. ‘There’s no doubt in my mind,” says Nyabola, “that social networks have been useful for political discourse and for organising in countries where there is no free speech.” After a military coup in Sudan last October, the army cut off internet services, but some users still managed to find ways to livestream protests on Facebook. While reporting on the coup and its aftermath, I found myself, again, familiarising myself with Facebook’s functionalities. The platform’s neglect of moderation means that armed militias and authoritarian regimes also abuse the platform for their own propaganda ends, not to mention the trolling and personal attacks that take place, just like anywhere else. CNN reported, in October last year, that Facebook knew it was being used to incite violence in Ethiopia and did not act. There has also been a “failure to invest in language, in understanding local context”, Nyabola says. “Facebook’s Africa office opened in 2015. The first Amharic-speaking content moderators were hired in 2019. It’s not a small thing that less than 100 people are working on content moderation in Ethiopia.” And Amharic is only one of more than 80 languages spoken in Ethiopia. While Facebook in Africa remains broadly unpoliced, the platform’s benefit to the voiceless will be drowned out by those who are louder and more powerful. In the meantime, for small businesses and users alike, Facebook is unavoidable. The company may be in a fight for its life in the west, as calls for regulation grow louder and cloud its prospects. But in Africa and other regions in the global south, Facebook’s economic, political and social influence almost guarantees it a second life.

1/20/2022,"This is a far greater scandal than the parties in Downing Street. In a just world, it would prove the downfall of our prime minister. This week, airstrikes by the Saudis and their allies killed more than a dozen people in Yemen, civilians among them. Last month an estimated 32 civilians died as a result of the ongoing conflict. The country has been convulsed by civil war since 2014. For seven years, a Saudi-led coalition has been pummelling the impoverished country with bombs, many of them supplied by Britain. Through our staunch military alliance with the Saudi dictatorship, our government is directly complicit with these atrocities. You can be forgiven for knowing nothing about any of this: Yemen does not matter, you see. Its people have been relegated to the bottom of the hierarchy of death, and most of our media show little interest in scrutinising our government for slaughter that it is directly complicit in. The Saudi violence has only increased in Yemen since October, after the UN human rights council voted to end its war crimes investigation following intensive lobbying by the dictatorship in Riyadh.  If Yemen is no longer the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, that is not because its plight has improved, but because the western blockade of Afghanistan has taken centre stage. Last September, the UN warned that millions of Yemenis were “a step away from starvation” as the “country’s economy has reached new depths of collapse”, while over Christmas rations for 8 million Yemenis blighted by hunger were cut. Yet our government retains its tight alliance with the Saudi regime, which decapitates gay people and dissidents, brutalises women and provides, in words purportedly of Hillary Clinton, “clandestine financial and logistical support” to terrorists. This is the regime that chopped a journalist into pieces in a foreign embassy, and incinerated Yemeni children travelling on a school bus on their way back from a picnic – an “apparent war crime”, in the words of Human Rights Watch. That isn’t to say the Saudi-led forces are responsible for criminal acts alone. The courageous Mwatana for Human Rights organisation based in Yemen’s capital Sana’a scrutinises violations committed by all sides, including the Iranian-backed Houthis who control much of the country. What matters is that our government is directly arming and supporting one side, and therefore bears direct responsibility for their actions. If it wasn’t for the stubborn and diligent work of the UK campaign group, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), there would be practically no consistent scrutiny of our government’s role at all. According to its research, BAE systems has sold £17.6bn arms and military services to the Saudi dictatorship since 2015, while the company has 6,700 members of staff posted in Saudi Arabia. Thanks to a judicial review brought by CAAT in 2019, the court of appeal found that the British government’s decision to keep licensing military equipment to Saudi Arabia was unlawful, but the government resumed arms sales after arguing only “isolated incidents” of airstrikes violated humanitarian law. CAAT’s court battle goes on. “There have been no efforts to ease or lift the blockade,” its research coordinator Sam Perlo-Freeman told me. “The Saudis are maintaining it without suffering any consequences or diplomatic efforts. The attention given by the world’s powers to end the war or at the least the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is woefully inadequate to nonexistent.” While it continues to arm and back the Saudi war effort, Britain slashed its humanitarian aid to Yemen by half in 2021, while the World Food Programme warns it cannot feed Yemenis properly because of funding shortfalls. CAAT and other human rights organisations should not be carrying this burden alone. Yemeni lives do matter, despite the silence that suggests otherwise, and our government must be held to account for its complicity in this horror. So yes, we should all be furious at our rulers partying and boozing while ordinary citizens couldn’t hold the hands of dying relatives. But our government’s direct involvement in the massacre of civilians by one of the world’s most repulsive dictatorships is an even graver crime. It is our failure to speak up that allows the killing to go on.

1/20/2022,"A cross-party group of MEPs has called for a large-scale election observation mission to Hungary, citing fears about democratic standards. Hungarians go to the polls on 3 April in parliamentary elections that will decide the fate of the incumbent prime minister, Viktor Orbán, whose last 12 years in office have seen tighter executive control over courts, a withering of independent media and widespread concerns about corruption and cronyism.  In a letter to the head of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which checks electoral probity in 57 mostly European and central Asian states, the MEPs called for a full-scale election observation mission to Hungary. “We come from five political groups and from 19 different countries. But we all share the concern that the elections might not be held to the highest democratic standards,” states the letter to ODIHR director Matteo Mecacci. The ODIHR, part of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, has begun a needs assessment of the mission it should send to Hungary. During Hungary’s 2018 elections it sent a limited mission, meaning it did not undertake systematic observation of voting, counting and tabulation of results. The Warsaw-based body, however, can choose to send a larger mission to carry out wider checks if it deems there is “limited confidence among election stakeholders in the election administration”. After the 2018 vote, where Orbán’s Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority, the OSCE observers criticised “hostile and xenophobic” rhetoric, a campaign that “limited space for substantive debate”, where public television “clearly favoured the ruling coalition” and the government used public funds that tilted the playing field in their favour. MEPs cited these issues, but also raised the alarm about new voter registration rules, which they say makes it easier for people to use fictitious addresses. “It is widely feared that [these rules] will be instrumentalised by the ruling party to increase its voter base in particularly contested regions,” states the letter. One prominent election analyst, Daniel Hegedüs of the German Marshall Fund, told the Guardian earlier this month that the integrity of the 2022 contest would be worse than 2018 and 2014, elections he characterised as “free but not fair”. In April, Orbán will face a challenge from Péter Márki-Zay, a Conservative church-going father of seven, who has united six opposition parties behind his candidacy. The letter has been signed mostly by MEPs from the Green, Social Democrat, centrist and radical left groups. A few signatories come from the centre-right European People’s party, which used to be Orbán’s political home. One notable EPP signatory is Danuta Hübner, a former EU commissioner for Poland. Several signatories are prominent in the Hungarian opposition, but support came from across the EU, including France, Germany, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Romania and Greece. Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács has dismissed warnings of a rigged election as cynical and absurd. “Voters will reelect [Orbán], I predict, because he has taken the country forward and delivered real results for Hungarians,” he wrote in a recent article on Euronews.",News/World news,European MEPs call for election observation mission to Hungary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/european-meps-call-for-election-observation-mission-to-hungary
1/20/2022,"Mia Mottley, who shot to international fame during the Cop26 climate talks and oversaw Barbados’s break with the Queen last year, has won a second term as the Caribbean nation’s prime minister The 56-year-old’s Barbados Labour party (BLP) won all 30 seats, up from 29 in 2018 in an election marred by complaints that thousands of Covid-positive Bajans were denied a vote.  Mottley came to international attention last year when she castigated global leaders at Cop26 and her government jettisoned the Queen as head of state, installing the singer Rihanna as an official national hero at the same time. She also has star power at home, where she is known by her first name only. Her clean-sweep victory suggests voters did not blame her for the island’s tourism revenues falling by 90% during her truncated first term due to the Covid pandemic. An 11th hour attempt to stop the poll failed on Tuesday night when the country’s high court ruled it had no jurisdiction to postpone the election, which took place amid rising Omicron cases. Philip Catlyn, the opposition candidate who brought the case, had argued that 5,600 people in isolation were disfranchised after they were banned from going to polling stations to cast their vote. Anyone who tests positive on the island of 287,000 people has to wear a tracking bracelet to deter them from breaking quarantine. As voting got under way on Wednesday, the Portuguese government announced measures to ensure that those infected with Covid could vote in that country’s snap general election later this month, fuelling accusations of unfairness. Huge crowds celebrated into the early hours of Thursday outside BLP’s headquarters in the capital, Bridgetown, after Barbados’s midnight curfew was lifted for the night. In her victory speech, Mottley said the landslide victory would allow her government to “lead the country first to safety and then to prosperity” and to prepare Barbados for the challenges “of the next 10 to 15 years”. These include climate change and antimicrobial resistance, she said. Global heating poses an existential threat to Barbados. Last year the island suffered its first hurricane in 65 years and a storm with almost 500 lightning strikes in the space a minute, plus volcanic ash-falls from neighbouring St Vincent. Though Barbados is reliant on long-haul flights and polluting cruise ships for much of its economy, Mottley was the breakout star of Cop26, taking global leaders to task for their inaction on climate change. At the BLP’s final rally on Tuesday, Liz Thomas, Barbados’s ambassador for climate change, reminded the crowd of the US president, Joe Biden, walking hand in hand with Mottley: “White people from all over the globe say to me: how do I get a Barbados passport? Caribbean people say to us: ‘How do I get a Mia Mottley?’, ‘I wish we had a Mia, give us Mia, lend us Mia’, but Barbados got Auntie Mia,” she said. Basking in her second straight landslide, Mottley promised to uphold the values of Errol Barrow, the first post-independence prime minister of Barbados, who said the country would be “a friend of all and a satellite of none”. Despite the BLP’s thumping victory, Cynthia Barrow-Giles, professor of constitutional governance and politics at the University of the West Indies, believed Mottley’s imposition of republicanism without a referendum had turned some voters away from the BLP. “People are so angry they were not consulted by the prime minister. They see it as an authoritarian tendency and autocratic,” she said. Barrow-Giles and a colleague polled Bajans and found while only a minority wanted to retain the British monarch as head of state, most objected to the lack of consultation. Though the BLP’s lengthy manifesto made numerous eye-catching promises, such as building 10,000 homes and investment in the medicinal cannabis industry, Mottley’s second term is likely to be dominated by recovering and diversifying the Bajan economy, post-Covid. As part of a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund, the Barbados government needs to achieve a 6% surplus of GDP, which may lead to austerity measures, said Barrow-Giles. One of Mottley’s preoccupations is also addressing Barbados’s ageing population via immigration. She wants to attract more “digital nomads” to the island and lure back the Bajan diaspora, repeatedly saying on the campaign trail that the island “hasn’t replaced its population since 1980”. The main opposition, the Democratic Labour party, which ruled Barbados between 2008 and 2018, campaigned against the BLP “one-party state”. Voters were not convinced and Barbados will have no official opposition for the next five years.",News/World news,Barbados PM Mia Mottley who broke with Queen wins landslide second term,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/barbados-pm-mia-mottley-who-broke-with-queen-wins-landslide-second-term
1/20/2022,"Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley has declared he will not resign over the Novak Djokovic visa saga and rejected suggestions his governing body paid for the deported world No 1’s legal fees. It comes as TA faces increasing scrutiny from players concerned the Australian Open’s voluntary Covid-19 testing protocol is exposing them to needless risk.  Tiley, who has remained largely out of the public eye throughout the Djokovic affair, was booed on Wednesday during a rare appearance at Kia Arena to mark Samantha Stosur’s final singles match. A few hours later he broke his silence in a tense interview with the tournament’s host broadcaster, the Nine Network, during which he side-stepped questions about the ill-fated bid to bring the unvaccinated Djokovic to Melbourne Park, saying “we already addressed those questions”. With the fallout has come calls for Tiley to stand down from his role, which also includes tournament director, forcing the TA board to issue a statement on Monday night supporting Tiley and acknowledging “lessons to learn”. Tiley has found himself in the firing line over TA’s role in allowing the unvaccinated Djokovic to fly to Melbourne under the belief that a medical exemption approved by TA and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. Tiley defended TA’s handling of the matter shortly after Djokovic was first detained saying “we were talking to all parts of government to ensure that one, we were doing the right thing, and the right process with these exemptions”. Asked by Nine on Thursday whether he has or will consider resigning from his role, the 60-year-old said: “No. We put a statement out recently. I am very focused today on delivering a great event. I am proud of being able to stand up here and you can see what is behind us [at Melbourne Park]. “I am proud of what the team has done and what we have delivered so far. We have had four days of unbelievable tennis and great entertainment and we will have that for the next 10 days.” Tiley also denied claims by former mayor of Melbourne suburb Brighton, John Locco, that TA had footed the bill for Djokovic’s federal court battle to remain in the country, reported to be in vicinity of $500,000. “I have seen those reports today and we don’t really go into the detail of financial arrangements we have with players but those reports are simply untrue,” Tiley said. The live issue at Melbourne Park right now is that of the lack of rigour around testing, which operates on an honesty basis and is compulsory only if players have symptoms. Dual grand slam champion Garbiñe Muguruza, world No 3 Alexander Zverev and British No 2 Heather Watson are among those to have questioned the procedures. Accredited players, staff and media are provided with daily rapid antigen tests but Muguruza, who lost her round-two match to Frenchwoman Alize Cornet on Thursday, described them as an “optional thing”. “Me, I test every two days by myself in my room,” Cornet said. “It’s not mandatory, I still do it.” Zverev speculated there were additional players competing with Covid-19 than Frenchman Ugo Humbert, who said on Wednesday he had tested positive, and said he was “kind of doing a bubble for myself, simply because I don’t want to take any risks”. “We are not getting tested, so I think if we would get tested there would be probably more positives than there are now,” the German said on Wednesday night after his second-round defeat of John Millman. “I’m somebody, I’m here to play the tournament, and I understand that there is a lot of cases in Melbourne, there is a lot of cases in Australia all around.” Watson said she had not been tested since the Adelaide International earlier this month and had not been asked to since. “No,” she said. “I think once you’ve done your day five, that’s the rules.” All international players had a mandatory PCR test upon arrival in Australia and were required to have a second one between five and seven days later. “There has been a fair bit written about that,” Tiley said. “Throughout the year the players have been travelling around the world. There have been protocols they have had to follow to do that. We are working closely with the men’s and the women’s and came up with a set of protocols that are more rigorous than their week in, week out travels. “Coming into Australia every player had to test … on days five and seven they had to test. There is also mandatory symptomatic testing and every player is provided each day with a rapid antigen kit they can pick up either at the hotel or here onsite. That is really the program we have had going. So far it has worked well and been successful.”",Sport/Sport,Underfire Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley refuses to resign over Djokovic visa saga,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/underfire-tennis-australia-boss-craig-tiley-refuses-to-resign-over-djokovic-visa-saga
1/20/2022,"One hundred years ago, in February 1922, Sylvia Beach, owner of the Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Company, published James Joyce’s Ulysses, in full, for the first time. Now to mark the centenary of the seminal novel’s publication, the publisher and bookseller she ran is set to release an ensemble recording of its complete text, featuring major names ranging from Eddie Izzard to Margaret Atwood. More than 100 writers, artists, comedians and musicians are coming together to read a section from Ulysses for Shakespeare and Company, including Will Self, Jeanette Winterson, Ben Okri and Meena Kandasamy. The recordings will be released as a free podcast, starting on 2 February and ending on 16 June, the date also known as Bloomsday in honour of the day in 1904 when Leopold Bloom wanders the streets in Ulysses.  “We thought we have to do something to mark the occasion,” said Shakespeare and Company literary director Adam Biles. “Normally our instinct for something like this would be to do a big party on the day itself, but because of Covid restrictions, and the difficulties the bookshop has been through in the last few years, we came up with the idea to get people to record readings. It just kind of spiralled from there, to putting out an entire unabridged version of Ulysses – it’s never going to reach Joyce’s level of ambition with the book, but it’s something wildly ambitious for us to do.” Authors and artists were keen to sign up for the project, said Biles. Self will be the first reader – “He’s a great performer, and also a great torch bearer for for modernism,” said Biles – followed by Winterson. Izzard is taking on the famous first section of Calypso: “Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.” Molly Bloom’s soliloquy will be read by multiple voices, including Atwood and Deborah Levy, said Biles. “It’s going to be very polyphonic.” The readings will be accompanied by a “Bloomcast” of 10 episodes, hosted by Biles and intended to be a primer for those new to Ulysses. “So many people have started and abandoned Ulysses, and it is a very tough book in many ways. But it’s also a book which really returns on the investment you make into it. It is hard work. But it’s also an incredibly powerful book emotionally speaking, it’s certainly one of the most intense literary experiences out there,” said Biles. “And having this diverse cast of differently accented people, with different ways of reading, has meant that each section is going to take on its own character, and hopefully keep people interested and keep their attention between February and June.” The readers will be using the text of a new edition of Ulysses, published by Penguin Classics to mark the centenary. The novel will also be celebrated at the Hay festival with a series of live discussions and performances between 26 May and 5 June. And Shakespeare and Company is not the only organisation to mark the centenary with a recording: Thornwillow Press has signed up readers including Stephen Fry and Salman Rushdie for a video and audio podcast reading of Ulysses. Weekly episodes will culminate on Bloomsday, when readers will be able to watch or listen to 300 readers, over 30 episodes, reading Ulysses.",Arts/Books,"Centenary recording of Ulysses to be read by Eddie Izzard, Margaret Atwood and others",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/20/centenary-recording-of-ulysses-to-be-read-by-eddie-izzard-margaret-atwood-and-others
