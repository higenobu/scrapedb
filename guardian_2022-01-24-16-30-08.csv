1/24/2022,"Accidentally shooting someone in the head can really put a downer on a holiday. Just ask the two protagonists in Netflix’s unbearably tense Scottish thriller Calibre. Marcus (Martin McCann) and Vaughn (Jack Lowden) are two old friends embarking on one last trip before Vaughn ruins his social life forever by having a kid. Marcus, played with mesmerising intensity by McCann, is taking them on a hunting trip in the Scottish highlands. It’s a slow buildup as they leave the city behind and journey into the beautiful Scottish wilderness. They’re staying in a remote village where the locals have just a hint of The Wicker Man about them – you’re half expecting Christopher Lee to pop out in a kilt at any second. When one of them casually mentions that this very weekend also happens to be the date of an obscure ancient solstice festival complete with a bonfire, you start to really worry for the boys. And your worries are not unfounded, although the trouble they get in is of their own making.  Trouble starts the moment they arrive after Marcus buys a drink for a local girl and almost comes to head-butts with a jealous onlooking man. The warning to “keep an eye on your friend” from local bigwig Logan has a ring of ominous foreshadowing about it. Unfortunately for the mild-mannered Vaughn it’s clear that Marcus is the one in charge, which is a bit like appointing a lit stick of dynamite as the babysitter. Marcus is the kind of character who finds trouble just by existing. He’s Withnail without the jokes. The sort of guy you’d run a mile from if you had any sense but you don’t because he’s your friend. The lads wake up the next morning with a hangover and head off into the woods to kill something. They succeed but suffice to say that if you tried to mount the head of their prey above the fireplace, you’d get some awfully funny looks from the neighbours. It’s a sickening moment that from then on infuses every second of the film’s remaining runtime with a dramatic tension that turns your palms into reservoirs. Watching it is excruciating, like being stuck on a broken-down Tube train with stomach cramps. And as the lads panic and make increasingly bad decisions to cover their tracks, it only gets worse. It’s a measure of the film’s quality that this fairly unoriginal premise is still packed full of surprises, misdirections and twists. Just when you think you know where it’s heading, it veers thrillingly off track. The deft handling of these well-worn genre tropes is down to the skill of Matt Palmer, the writer and director of this fantastic debut feature. It’s the kind of confident work you’d expect from a film-maker with much more experience and its raw power brings to mind some of Ben Wheatley’s best stuff. Palmer’s script is taut and clever and he elicits some wonderful performances from his actors, from menacing thug Brian McClay (Ian Pirie), to the simpering wreck of Vaughn. The whole film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Márk Györi, who manages, as the story unfolds, to turn the Scottish highlands from a picture postcard into a prison. Its beauty becomes claustrophobic as the net closes around our boys and the scenery that was meant to offer a relaxing escape, becomes a labyrinth. Calibre’s power is such that it could make even the most psychotic big-game hunting American dentist think twice before picking up a rifle. If Walter Palmer had watched this before his trip to Africa, Cecil the Lion might still be with us. It packs more of a punch than films with 100 times the budget and shows that you don’t need a superhero to grab an audience. You need atmosphere. And the atmosphere conjured by Palmer et al doesn’t let you go for a second. In fact, even after the credits roll and you’ve turned back to the latest reality dating show, you’ll still be thinking about the final haunting image even as Chad from New Jersey licks maple syrup off an influencer. It’s a film that also explores some big questions: what would you do to save someone’s life? What would you do to save your own? What is justice? But never gives any easy answers – except perhaps one. What would you do if you found yourself being chased through the woods by a group of irate Scotsmen? Run.

1/24/2022,"“Hey Google, what’s the factorial of 100?” There are several clips doing the rounds of what happens when you ask Google Assistant this question. The response is both hilarious and terrifying.  The factorial of 100 is the multiplication of 100 by every whole number less than it. In other words, 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x 96 x …. x 3 x 2 x 1. The answer is a big number. Clearly. Yet Google Assistant gives the wrong answer. Or rather, its answer is rounded up. (Siri abbreviates in a more sensible way.) Today’s puzzle is to do the sum properly: How many zeros does the factorial of 100 really have at the end of it? All that is required to solve this puzzle is knowledge of elementary arithmetic. Such as the fact that, if a number has a 0 at the end, it means this number is divisible by 10. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solution.

1/24/2022,"Ruth Crocket is too modest to say life was busy when she worked as a risk modeller for a leading bank. “Not busy, but occupied,” she says. Always dashing for a train, she was rarely in her village of Hitcham, Suffolk. But occasionally she popped into the village’s only shop for fresh bread rolls, which were very, very good. One day, she heard the shop was to be sold, possibly converted into housing. The village pub had recently gone the same way. “It seemed impossible not to do something,” she says. “So I did it. I bought the business.” Six years on, at the age of 66, she is postmistress and owner of Hitcham Post Office and Stores.  When Crocket took over, she shifted things around and made the space feel more inviting. A community grant paid for new floors and counters. After a few months, she went part-time at HSBC. But after a year, the shop ran up a sizeable five-figure loss. “I thought I could do it without completely overwhelming or bankrupting myself,” she says. “Even if it wouldn’t make a profit, at least it should be able to run itself.” But seven months after buying the business, Crocket was made redundant by the bank. “I was terrified,” she says. “I felt I’d got on to a tiger and I couldn’t work out how to get off. I was living through my reserves.” Buying the shop might seem like a curious move for a risk modeller. But, Crocket says: “If you are very short-term protective about things, often that’s a long-term high risk.” Besides, she adds, “I haven’t got children. My parents had gone.” Her late brother Martin, who had schizophrenia, was then “fairly stable”, and her partner is of an independent bent. “I didn’t have that much to lose … I suppose I could risk it.” As an economist, Crocket says, she is fascinated by her experience. But she admits that her actions “would have looked very out of character to anyone who knew me”. So why did she feel the urge to step in? At Oxford University, Crocket studied philosophy, politics and economics. “What I should have done is join an aid organisation or something,” she says, to give “on-the-ground help. Doing-things-for-people sort of stuff … I suppose the family intention was in that direction.” Her father, a psychiatrist, “was very interested in the theory of therapeutic communities and how to make organisations or groups of people work together to be effective”. Crocket applied for positions as an economist with international aid organisations, “but it wasn’t a path that opened up to me”. In any case, her brother was severely ill. “That really dominated a lot of my time … I didn’t feel I could go away,” she says. Perhaps the shop felt like a kind of hyper-local aid. “It was what was needed,” she says. “And it was right there in front of me.” When the pandemic hit, the shop, which had run at a decreasing loss for five years, came into its own, and became a hub for a volunteer delivery network. Crocket bought huge sacks of flour, sugar and rice, which she and her colleagues doled out by the kilo. Now the shop is not only breaking even, she says, but “a bit over”. Crocket always “had visions” of things working. She stocks local bread and meats, homemade cakes and a deli range, and has made a start on click-and-collect. She is pondering serving coffee. She has nine years on the lease, still enjoys “the sheer fun of ‘playing shops’” and has “more ideas to try out”. “The shop has changed everything, really,” she says. “I know a lot of people in the village, which I didn’t before. It’s really educated me in the economics of an on-the-ground business.” She has wonderful colleagues. And as a reader for the local church, she feels there’s a lot of resonance in “the idea that, whatever happens with people’s souls, it doesn’t do any harm to feed their bodies”. The shop is “a touchstone, a connection into reality at a very practical, hands-on level … I just wish I had been a bit younger when I did something like this. But then I probably wouldn’t have done it, would I?” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I was a banker who finally took a risk – and bought the village shop’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/24/a-new-start-after-60-i-was-a-banker-who-finally-took-a-risk-and-bought-the-village-shop

1/24/2022,"Netflix is facing a fight to stop as many as 750,000 UK subscribers defecting as its rival Disney takes back exclusive control of hits such as Modern Family, How I Met Your Mother and Sons of Anarchy to bolster its own service. The streaming company, which last week forecast the lowest number of new global subscribers in the first quarter since 2010, has lost the UK rights to five popular titles to Disney+ this month, with more set to follow.  Analysts at the research firm Digital i estimate that the loss of the titles – which also include Prison Break and New Girl, with Homeland expected to follow soon – could cost Netflix UK as much as £90m annually if all of the 750,000 subscribers were to follow their favourite shows and leave. Their report has identified this core of users as “high risk” of unsubscribing because a large proportion of their viewing was of these shows. “The viewing to these six titles, five of which have already left Netflix, was significant in the UK,” said Ali Vahdati, the founder and chief executive of Digital i. “This means a significant number of subscribers will begin to question their Netflix subscription and look to the new home of their favourite content, Disney+.” The UK is fast approaching peak Netflix, last year recording the lowest number of new subscribers since it launched a decade ago. Digital i estimated that content licensed from Disney accounted for about 12% of the viewing of Netflix’s most popular content in the first quarter of last year, with the company removing nearly all of its top-ranking titles in the UK since then. “Modern Family was the most streamed Netflix show in Europe in 2020,” said Vahdati, who has estimated that the loss of that show could have the biggest impact, with almost 270,000 subscribers deemed to be hardcore fans. “Our previous research showed that over half of Netflix’s top viewing was to major [Hollywood] studio content.” As the streaming wars intensify, Netflix is expected to spend more than $17bn on content this year, an increase of a quarter over 2021. There will be an increasing focus on creating original productions as it attempts to replace TV shows and films licensed from third parties with its own content. Last week, Netflix pointed to upcoming fare such as the Ryan Reynolds sci-fi film The Adam Project and the return of hit series Bridgerton and Stranger Things as attractions that would help it to pull in and retain subscribers. At the same time, it increased the price of its monthly subscriptions in Canada and the US, its biggest market. UK subscribers saw prices rise last March as the company looks to fund its content budget in the face of ever-increasing spend by rivals. Netflix is still the most popular streaming service in the UK, with an estimated 14 million subscribers as at the end of last year, ahead of Amazon at 12.3 million and Disney+ at 4.7 million, according to Ampere Analysis.",News/Media,"Netflix could lose 750,000 UK subscribers as Disney takes control of hit shows",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/24/netflix-could-lose-750000-uk-subscribers-as-disney-takes-control-of-hit-shows
1/24/2022,"In whitewashed Strandkorbs, families huddle together, enjoying the last of the warmth from the faltering autumnal sun on their upturned faces. These striped beach baskets, some owned, others rented, are dotted along large expanses of windswept sands that seep into the inky Baltic sea.  The island of Usedom in Pomerania, surrounded by forests of beech trees, is known by some as the “bathtub of Berlin” and by others, slightly more poetically, as “sun island”. Dietrich Gildenhaar, a local author and guide, tells me that the island, north of the Szczecin lagoon in the huge Oder estuary, has been a luxury tourist destination since the Gründerzeit (Germany’s mid-19th-century economic boom), having been crowned one of the country’s sunniest places in Germany, with an annual average of more than 1,900 hours of sunshine. It is in two halves, the west side belonging to Germany and the eastern part to Poland, and has some of the region’s best beaches, with designated strips of sand for dogs and other sections reserved for nudists partaking in Freikörperkultur or “free body culture”. However, despite being popular with Germans who flock to its spa resorts or explore inland on bike rides and long hikes, the island remains largely undiscovered by international visitors. In search of an alternative winter break, I’ve arrived to sample one of its many spas for some much-needed health and wellbeing maintenance. On a Saturday afternoon in mid-October, with temperatures struggling to creep over 12C, most of the people on the seafront are German families in thick wool sweaters, who walk along the piers and bustle into coffee shops to escape the Baltic breeze. The sky is dotted with colourful kites, many reaching dizzying heights. We are in Bansin, one of three resort towns on the German side. Gildenhaar, standing outside a powder-blue house built in the Russian style, explains that many of the island’s buildings were financed by the wealthy German Delbrück family. Visitors included Russian poets, Berlin’s elite, and the king of Prussia, Wilhelm I; an annual parade in his honour is still held today. “It was a place where you would often see nobility and aristocrats mixing with artists, and they would all come here for the wellness. Some of them were very ill and were ordered by their physicians to take the good air of Usedom,” he says. Until the early 19th century, passengers arriving at the station were picked up in wooden carriages and transported to villas set back from the sea in private, landscaped gardens. All three of these coastal towns – Ahlbeck, Heringsdorf and Bansin – remain connected by rail. The legacy of this aristocratic wealth has seeped into every corner of the architecture, and the island has an air of understated elegance, with many of the buildings now in private ownership and rented out as holiday homes. There are many tastefully decorated hotels overlooking lawns behind the beach: ours is the Steigenberger Grandhotel and Spa in Heringsdorf, with its heated outdoor pool and saunas. Another big draw of this region is the seafood. There are wood-fired huts for smoking fish dotted along the coastline, and nautical themes aplenty in the restaurants and hotels. Close to the Polish border is the Fischräucherei Kamminke smokehouse, jutting out to sea. Large picture windows on its semi-enclosed veranda offer sparkling views over the Szczecin lagoon and create sun traps, protecting us from the bitter breeze. As we drink in the view, the waiters deliver huge plates of smoked butterfish fillet and stremel salmon, with steaming hot potatoes and dollops of braised cabbage. Our chunky wooden tables groan with the heavy plates, and the fish has a sweet pungency from the smoking process. Further north there is Koserower Salzhütte, an old fishing hut converted into a restaurant, where only beechwood is used to smoke the fish. Its recipes have been passed down from a grandfather who, as a fisherman, owned two of these work huts and fished in nearby Koserow. The restaurant’s owners have created a small museum telling the story of the island and its dependency on fishing. Herrings were particularly plentiful off this coast in the decades after 1815, and the Prussian state took measures to support the fishermen and supply the wider population. Under state supervision, the herrings were salted and stored in large wooden barrels, giving the fish a long shelf life. The salt huts on the site, also known as herring huts, date from that time and have been listed as historical monuments. A small, dark dining room in one of these herring huts tempts us inside with smells of sea and wood and a promise of fish smoked in large wooden barrels. There is gravlax, entombed to perfection in coarse sea salt, served with a sweet cucumber dill salad that cleanses the palate with every mouthful; raw smoked herring, a delicacy that melts on the tongue; and large chunks of lightly fried halibut with the requisite cabbage and potato. All washed down with sweet German Scheurebe wine, it is a feast, an ode to the ocean. The island has a haunting beauty. In his new film Usedom: A Clear View of the Sea, Heinz Brinkmann says: “When I was a child, the story of the discovery of my home town of Heringsdorf seemed like a fairytale. In spring 1863, the brothers Hugo and Adelbert Delbruük, bankers from Berlin, walking through a dense forest, proclaimed at the site of the Baltic sea: Here we will stay!” And it is indeed a fairytale.

1/24/2022,"Give or take the Guardian’s Dining across the divide feature, who these days has forthright debates with their ideological opposites? That’s what playwright Mark St Germain orchestrates in his 2010 play imagining an encounter, on the eve of war, between arch-rationalist Sigmund Freud and born-again Christian CS Lewis. Spoiler alert: they do not settle the question of God’s existence. But the only thing more futile than having the conversation, argues Freud – and I found this point curiously touching – would be not having the conversation at all. You have to invest, then, in the idea of civilised argument for argument’s sake – because that’s all you’re getting with Freud’s Last Session. Why would God allow such pain in the world, asks Freud, a question sharpened by arbitrary deaths in his family, and the terminal oral cancer whose effects are gruesomely enacted here. “God wants to perfect us through suffering,” ventures Lewis, who – under no obligation to be rational – has a nonsensical answer to everything.  The dialogue ranges from the pair’s sex lives to the veracity of the New Testament, and is sustained by a series of “touché” moments, when they catch one another out in ideological frailty – sometimes triggered by news on Freud’s wireless of the outbreak of the second world war. Whether this more or less familiar debate would long detain anyone were it not between the Freudian slip guy and the Lion, Witch and Wardrobe guy, I doubt. But director Peter Darney measures its beats with precision. And the trenchant exchange of ideas between Séan Browne’s Lewis and Julian Bird’s ailing yet indomitable Freud may itself restore your faith – if only in the virtues of cordial disagreement.

1/24/2022,"Covid cases are rising rapidly among US nursing home residents and staff, causing shortages in admissions, exacerbating bed shortages at hospitals in turn, and in some cases requiring the national guard to be called in.  The Omicron wave has sent many staff home sick at care facilities and rehabilitation centers that offer round-the-clock medical care. As a result, hospitals that would normally release patients into such stepped-down care are now holding off, creating a backlog of patients stuck in hospital. “Things are condition critical today. Individuals can’t find an empty or staffed bed out there,” said David Grabowski, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. “It really puts hospitals in a difficult position,” he said, noting that they can’t admit new patients until they find a spot at a care facility for those patients well enough to be transferred. “That’s a huge problem, because they’re occupying a bed that would otherwise go to a new patient.” There were more than 31,500 cases among nursing home residents in the week ending 9 January, nearly as many as last winter’s peak, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Cases among staff are even higher – more than double last year’s highest record, with more than 57,000 confirmed cases in the week of 9 January, a tenfold increase in just three weeks. The rapid rise in infections compounds existing worker shortages, with 234,000 caregivers having exited the industry during the pandemic so far – a 15% reduction in the workforce in only two years. In Wisconsin, the shortages are so acute that more than 200 members of the national guard will be trained to work as nursing aides. “Right now, the only thing that is on their minds is the essential of, ‘How do we stay open without shortchanging our patients?’” said Leemore Dafny, professor at Harvard Business School. Yet the acute care offered by some nursing homes is “a really important release valve for the hospitals”, she said, adding that without it hospitals may become even more overwhelmed: “It causes this ricochet effect.” Care facilities, already buffeted by the pandemic, are a little-acknowledged part of the health system, particularly for patients who don’t need hospital-level care but aren’t yet ready to go home. “Nursing homes, including the post-acute care parts, have just always been kind of secondary to hospitals, and I think that comes back to bite us. Because it turns out they’re a pretty essential link in the chain,” said R Tamara Konetzka, professor of public health sciences at the University of Chicago. “Nursing homes throughout the early part of the pandemic were really the epicenter of the tragedy of Covid-19,” Konetzka said. At various times, they accounted for 30%-50% of the total deaths in their areas. Residents of nursing homes have had some of the highest fatality rates of the pandemic, because of their close living quarters and the increased susceptibility of residents to Covid-19. The pandemic was also brutal on staff. “They put themselves at risk. Cases among staff have been among the highest” among workers, Grabowski said. At one point in the pandemic, he said, being a nursing home worker was the most dangerous job in America, based on the death rates. Nursing homes had already struggled with understaffing for decades, and the pandemic amplified those issues. Workers feared getting sick and bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some struggled to find child care during school and daycare closures. Others became disabled, and still others died. Some, meanwhile, found they could work elsewhere for equal or better pay. Yet having enough staff during nursing-home outbreaks can be a defining factor in how well residents do, according to research from Konetzka, Grabowski, and others. “You really need enough staff to try to stem the outbreak,” Konetzka said. Nursing home staff test patients regularly, move those who are positive into isolation areas, and provide care both for Covid and any underlying conditions. Admissions to nursing homes remain below pre-pandemic levels. The pandemic has seen some patients defer care and hospitals delay scheduled procedures, such as hip replacements, that would require a stay in a step-down facility. Many patients were worried by headlines about high rates of cases and deaths in nursing homes, as well as isolation and loneliness. “There was a real reluctance to enter a nursing home during the pandemic,” Grabowski said. Omicron has so far led to significantly lower deaths than previous Covid waves, though deaths can be a lagging indicator, following cases and hospitalizations by a few weeks. High vaccination rates among residents – 87% are fully immunized – ​​may keep fatalities low. “The original vaccine effort was one of the real success stories during the pandemic when it comes to nursing homes,” Grabowski said. However, there is high turnover in care facilities, both of staff and residents. “Even if you got everybody vaccinated the first time around, a few months later, there are going to be different people there,” Konetzka said. Residents of nursing homes are also at generally higher risk of breakthrough infections, in part because the vaccines don’t work as well to spark lasting immune systems of older adults. Boosters can help, Konetzka said, but “that’s also not been very organized or systematic.” Staff vaccination rates are lower, too, at 81%. That means one in five nursing-home employees are unvaccinated, putting them at higher risk of passing the virus on to residents and getting several ill themselves. Even if staff are out for a few days, it puts pressure on the entire system. But staff vaccination rates may soon increase with the federal vaccine mandate for facilities accepting Medicaid and Medicare, which could help reduce soaring cases and shortages.",News/US news,Rising Covid cases in US nursing homes prompts hospital warnings,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/covid-coronavirus-us-nursing-homes-hospital-
1/24/2022,"Lately, the prospects for young, straight, male American novelists of unruly talent who aspire to more than underground recognition haven’t looked particularly bright. Stateside culture war partisanship has narrowed the bandwidth of permissible literary expression, with the heterosexual white male regarded as inherently suspect. To get along under the new order, ambitious young Americans might be tempted to walk on eggshells while presenting themselves as paragons of virtue – and dissent could spell career suicide. (If the general point seems exaggerated, recall that Americans elected Donald Trump as their president, then ask yourself how many pro-Trump literary novelists you can name.) Into this vexed monoculture steps Sean Thor Conroe, with his winningly titled first novel, Fuccboi. The challenge he confronts is a real pickle: how to update the tradition of the American male autobiographical novelist, writing about the concerns of a twentysomething on the make (which naturally include wrong-think and that notoriously problematic condition, lust) without censoring himself into insipidity. To pull it off and remain credible, he may have to play both sides: writing neither as simpering literary beta-cuck, nor as obtuse and toxic reactionary. Magas to the left of me, wokists to the right!  Set between late 2017 and summer 2019, Fuccboi is an autobiographical picaresque that follows its narrator, Sean, as he attempts to become a published writer, endures an alarming skin condition, cycles around Philly in his job with a food delivery company, hustles on a book podcast and deals with the fallout from his sex life (“ex bae”, “side bae” and “editor bae” are his love interests, while male friends go by single initials: Z, C, V). Back in 2014, he tried and failed to walk across the US, then wrote a novel about it which he is now trying to sell with the help of editor bae, a woke feminist starting out in New York publishing (their working relationship is complicated by our hero having slept with her). History simmers just out of shot – “After navigating past two police blockades for an anti-Proud Boys march, I finally found a sign to lock my bike to.” This isn’t a plot novel, nor even much of a story novel. Conroe bets most of his chips on voice and by and large his writing has enough charm and freshness to keep him solvent. Americans have always been at the vanguard of minimalist prose, from Hemingway to Tao Lin. Conroe’s punchy variant includes rap slang and internet speak, bc that’s how it is now, bruh. He also fucks with those one-line paras. Quick blunt insights, stacked up n shit. It’s kinda fun. Often funny! No verbs needed in this dude’s bars. Word. What book people have lately started calling autofiction has a clear parallel in rap – a lingual art form in which practitioners exploit their life stories in intimate first-person reports, inviting the listener to both thrill at the personal disclosure and identify with the rapper’s struggles and triumphs. The egotism is franker (rappers are less embarrassed to drop a sex boast) but the narrative strategy is basically the same – a crossover was only a matter of time. Sean is a SoundCloud rapper and along with his digressive hot takes on poetry and books (Knausgaard, Sheila Heti) are reflections on rappers such as XXXTentacion and Lil B. Fuccboi’s main claim to newness lies in the narrator’s middle-way attitude to the ball-aching social justice religion that clogs the air of American cultural life, demanding moral and doctrinal purity. A reader of Nietzsche and Houellebecq, Sean cultivates a “hatred of neoliberal feminism” and rankles at “woke kids” and the “puritanical, ultimately fascistically western roots of their apparently woke language-censoring” (his spleen fuels such tin-eared, adverb-clogged phrasing). Elsewhere, though, the internalised contradictions of his dementing culture manifest in amusing ways. Unable to get an erection while in bed with “side bae” and offering her medical advice instead, Sean feels intoxicated and “almost turned on” by his “wokeness”. In another scene, he is thrilled to move in with a female housemate because doing so “immediately established me as non-predatory. Like Fuck outta here – I live with a woman!” Those who fear that US writers now come to us filtered through a de facto system of censorship will not be reassured by a scene in which Sean’s unpublished novel is subjected to an edit that erases “every savage, ugly, testosterone-fuelled, shameful thing it had been most difficult to write”. By this meandering novel’s final third, I was no longer sure what the story was meant to be about, beyond the narrator’s ongoing presence on the page. The auto-novelist’s liberation from plot comes at the cost of submergence in life’s essential formlessness. Nevertheless, I enjoyed being led through the vagaries of Sean’s “sus hetero bro” existence and appreciated his attempt to do what in 2020s America is tricky verging on taboo: to write like a man, not an ideal.

1/24/2022,"Q I am a single first-time buyer in Wales and am struggling to get my foot on the housing ladder. I am currently 29, have saved up £50,000 and think the maximum mortgage I could get by myself is £140,000. I currently rent a house from friends, so have been able to save a bit each month, but I am very aware that my savings are not keeping up with house prices or inflation.  As in many places, the property market has ballooned here and there are very few houses for sale within my price range. The ones that are in my price range aren’t where I want to live long term and don’t look particularly easy to sell on, which concerns me. I am now considering whether I should borrow more money from my parents to bolster my deposit and stretch for a £210,000 property so I can buy something that gives me more options such as renting out a room or Airbnb. However, I am concerned that with wages stagnating and interest rates and the cost of living set to rise that things could get financially sticky. There’s also the property price bubble. I appreciate that you need a crystal ball to answer these with certainty but my questions are: am I better off buying something within budget or stretching myself for something that I want to live in longer term? Or am I better off waiting, continuing to rent and investing my money elsewhere?AN A There is one thing I can say with total certainty: you shouldn’t buy in an area where you don’t want to live long term and where you think properties don’t look easy to sell on. If you did, you would regret it. I can also be certain that in purely financial terms you are better off upfront buying something within your original budget. If you stay within budget and buy a property costing £190,000 (your deposit of £50,000 plus a mortgage of £140,000) you will pay £350 in land transaction tax (LTT) – the equivalent of stamp duty land tax in Wales. If you buy a £210,000 property, your LTT bill will be £1,050. Note that Wales doesn’t have first-time buyer relief from LTT whereas first-time buyers in England do get SDLT relief on the first £300,000 of the price of a property costing up to £500,000. However, if stretching your budget would mean that you could buy somewhere where you would be happy to live for several years – especially if it meant that you could have a lodger, for example, who could help with the extra cost – it could make more financial sense in the long term. While I don’t think it’s wise to compromise on buying in an area you would be happy to live, you may need to make compromises in other aspects. Would you be prepared to buy a flat rather than a house, for example? If you would be happy in a new-build property, would you consider stretching your budget by making use of the Help to Buy Wales scheme which runs until March 2023 (but doesn’t let you sublet any part of the property)? Finally, it might cheer you up to know that the mortgage lender Halifax’s crystal ball suggests that house prices may rise by only 2% in 2022 or even not rise at all. So waiting before you buy shouldn’t be too detrimental if an afternoon with your calculator shows that stretching your budget isn’t an option.  Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

1/24/2022,"Police officers called to a Maryland residence by a concerned neighbour found a 49-year-old man dead – and surrounded by more than 125 venomous and non-venomous snakes, held in tanks on racks.  The discovery by Charles county sheriff’s deputies and emergency responders at the house in Pomfret became even more bizarre when they established that none of the reptiles, including a 4.3m (14ft) Burmese python, had escaped or were slithering free. “At last count it was over 125 individual snakes that were racked or in cages inside the home,” Jennifer Harris, a Charles county government spokesperson, told WUSA news. “I want to assure anybody living within this neighbourhood that we have not seen that any of the snakes were not properly secured or could have escaped. People were concerned there was some danger but we’ve not determined any of the snakes were not secure after this gentleman’s death.” The reptiles were removed in the county animal control department’s largest rescue operation to date. The deceased man, who was not immediately named, and who lived alone according to neighbours, was taken to the medical examiner’s office in Baltimore. Harris said locals appeared unaware that he kept snakes. A statement from the Charles county sheriff’s office said first responders were alerted by a neighbor “who indicated he went to check on the resident, whom he had not seen since the day before, and observed the resident lying on the floor and unconscious”. Deputies broke down the front door. They called animal control when they found snakes of varying species and sizes in rooms throughout the house. There were so many, Harris said, that snake experts from Virginia and North Carolina were called in to help. Not all of the reptiles were immediately identified, she said. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 7,000 and 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the US each year. The average number of fatalities is five. The US is home to numerous species of venomous snakes, including rattlesnakes, copperheads, water moccasins and coral snakes. Most snake bites happen outdoors. “The number of deaths would be much higher if people did not seek medical care,” the CDC says.",News/US news,Maryland man found dead amid collection of more than 125 snakes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/maryland-man-dead-collection-snakes
1/24/2022,"Find out the speed you are getting using a computer connected to your router via an ethernet network cable. Many routers and other devices come with one, or they cost about £5 separately.  You may also need a USB ethernet adapter (about £10) if your computer does not have a port built-in. If you can’t connect via ethernet, use a modern phone, laptop or tablet on wifi as close to your router as possible with a clear line of sight. Ookla’s Speedtest.net and Netflix’s Fast.com are reliable speed-testing services. Some more advanced routers have speed testing services built into them, too. They are typically accessible via a router’s settings pages in your browser or a companion app, if they have one. If your broadband is slow at the router, it might be time to switch providers. Some fixed-line ISPs offer speeds in excess of 200Mbps in certain areas, while 4G/5G home broadband is an alternative. If you are not getting near the speed your ISP advertises, you may be able to get a discount, or switch to a plan with higher speeds. When it comes to broadband the faster the better, particularly with multiple people and devices using the internet at once. However, the minimum speed needed for most online activities is fairly slow. Video calling services, such as Zoom, typically need up to 4Mbps upload and download. Online gaming services, such as Xbox Live, need at least 3Mbps down and 0.5Mbps up, while game streaming services need a minimum of 10Mbps down. Video streaming, such as Netflix, needs at least 5Mbps for HD or 25Mbps for 4K content. The median broadband speed in the UK is 50.4Mbps down and 9.8Mbps up, according to data from Ofcom in March 2021. That means that the majority of connections should be able to handle most popular services. But bear in mind that with more than one device, or person, using your connection simultaneously, including updates and downloads when idle, slower broadband packages can quickly get choked. If your broadband connection is fast enough but your wifi is weak, there are things you can do. If possible, move the router closer to the centre of the house, or towards the rooms in which you need the strongest signal. Keep it in the open, not in a cabinet, and away from solid and metallic objects. And try to position it away from dense walls, particularly those made out of concrete blockwork or with pipes and wires running through them. Most modern routers will automatically select the best settings for your home, but you can manually check using the web interface of your router accessed through a browser on a computer. Consult the help pages for your ISP’s router for how to do so. Wifi operating at 2.4GHz uses a range of frequency “channels”, only some of which do not overlap with each other. To reduce interference from your neighbours’ wifi, switch to channel 1, 6 or 11, which do not overlap, and therefore are less likely to cause or suffer interference. If you have a connection under 200Mbps, enabling prioritisation or “quality of service” for your key devices, might help. This stops other things from sucking up all the available bandwidth – it will prevent a game download on an Xbox cutting off a video call on your laptop, for instance. Set a strong wifi password using at least WPA2 security, not the lowest WEP option. This will make sure no wifi thieves can log on to your network and steal your bandwidth. An internet slowdown may be down to your devices rather than your router. For older computers, upgrading the wifi adapter may help. USB wifi 5 adapters cost under £15, while the latest wifi 6 models cost about £50, but you will need a compatible router to take advantage of the extra speed. For a non-portable device, such as a media streamer or a console, use an ethernet cable if it is close to the router, as this will be faster and more reliable than wifi. If you have about 40 devices connected at once, consider disconnecting unnecessary ones to help provide more bandwidth for those you need most. Weaker routers struggle with lots of devices connected at once. If your wifi can’t reach parts of your house you can extend the signal of your current router with add-on gadgets. Powerline networking devices use your home’s power cables to transmit data. They typically cost between £20 and £70. They plug into standard electrical sockets with one connected to the router via an ethernet cable, and others placed about the home providing ethernet ports and/or wifi for your devices. The speed you get through them is dependent on the condition of your electrical wiring. Wifi extenders (£25-70) do a similar thing, but simply connect to your router via wifi, then rebroadcast it for other devices. A network switch (under £20) can add more ethernet ports to your router if you need to connect more devices. Replacing your existing router is often the most effective way to improve your wifi, but is also the most costly. Before committing to a third-party router, speak to your ISP as it may be able to provide you with a more modern one for free. Virgin and other ISPs are currently rolling out more powerful wifi 6-capable routers. Otherwise, there are broadly two options: a beefy single router with much more powerful wifi broadcasting ability than the cheap one provided by your ISP, or a mesh system, which uses a series of satellites dotted about your home to blanket it in wifi. Both typically use your existing router as a modem and then broadcast their own more robust wifi network. Single unit wifi 6 routers start at about £60 but can reach the hundreds for powerful gaming-orientated devices. They connect to your old ISP box via ethernet cable, which means they are often easier to place in a more central area of your home. Running a long ethernet cable under floorboards, carpets, behind skirting boards or picture rails, or just under furniture can help keep things neat. Good wifi 5 mesh systems start at under £100 for a triple pack of satellites, which should be enough for most homes with connections under 200Mbps. For those with faster broadband, good tri-band wifi 6 models cost about £300.",Lifestyle/Money,How to speed up your broadband internet,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/24/how-to-speed-up-your-broadband-internet
1/24/2022,"A month ago my four-year-old Mercedes-Benz GLC had a serious malfunction as I was driving through town. On a bend, the power steering failed causing the car to jerk severely to the left and leaving me with no control over the steering. The fact that I was driving slowly almost certainly saved me and our one-year-old child from an accident. The car had to be towed to the local Mercedes dealer which has identified a faulty power steering electrical motor. I have been told that this is only supplied as part of a complete steering rack, and have been quoted about £3,500 plus labour costs.  I bought the car used from another Mercedes dealer two years ago and it has a low, 34,000, mileage. I was not told of the importance of having the car serviced at a Mercedes dealership, and it has received two services at local garages. This has seemingly nullified any goodwill that my local Mercedes-Benz branch is able to offer. It feels unreasonable to have to replace a sealed unit which you would expect to last the lifetime of the car. To me, it is clearly not fit for purpose. It would seem there is no course of action other than a small claims case, but who do I level the charge against? EF, Guildford I am always amazed at how the German carmakers treat customers, many having spent well in excess of £30,000 on vehicles that develop serious faults not long after the warranty has expired. Mercedes recalled GLC cars made in 2019 and 2020 in both Australia and the US for having faulty power steering, but claims those problems are unrelated to your earlier model. A search online will show that GLC models have been beset by steering problems. I asked the company about your case, and it has now offered to repair the car for a discounted rate of £2,250 as a gesture of goodwill. It has also offered a courtesy car while this is resolved. I asked the company about your case, and it has now offered to repair the car for a discounted rate of £2,250 as a gesture of goodwill. It has also offered a courtesy car while this is resolved. This leaves you with a dilemma: you can either take its offer, and stump up the cash through gritted teeth then seek to recover some of your losses in the courts; or get the car fixed more cheaply by an independent garage. The Consumer Rights Act allows you bring a claim against the retailer – the dealer you bought from, rather than Mercedes itself – for up to six years. I think most courts would agree that an electric power steering motor should last longer than four years, or 34,000 miles, and would make some kind of award in your favour. The lack of a Mercedes service history should not make any difference because the power steering motor would have not been touched. The dealer has so far refused to reply to your letters, but will probably have a change of heart when presented with the official court claim. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

1/24/2022,"The Law Council and defamation experts have panned the Coalition’s anti-trolling bill, warning it will deprive defamation victims of redress and does little to solve the problem of online trolling. The Law Council and academics David Rolph and Michael Douglas have warned giving companies operating social media pages a defence may worsen online abuse and harm victims’ access to justice, while new complaints procedures still allow anonymous commenters to block release of their details.  The submissions were made to the attorney-general’s department, which is conducting consultation on the draft bill yet to be introduced to parliament. The Morrison government released the proposed anti-trolling bill in early December, claiming it could help victims of trolling by incentivising social media companies to set up complaints-handling procedures that can reveal the identities of anonymous commenters. The bill primarily helps operators of social media accounts by deeming they are not the publishers of comments by other users on their posts. Instead, the social media companies will be held liable as publishers, although they can access a defence if they have an appropriate complaints procedure. The Law Council submitted that the reform should wait until after a separate review by state and federal attorneys-general into liability for digital defamation, which was launched after the high court found media companies could be liable for third-party comments on their social media posts. Rolph also warned the reform could be “premature” as the court in Dylan Voller’s case is yet to decide on the defence of innocent dissemination, and media companies could seek to recover any damages ordered against them from Facebook or the commenters. The Law Council submitted that “defamatory material comprises only a small component of ‘trolling’ activity online”, while Rolph agreed the bill’s title was a “misnomer” because it is “not really concerned with ‘trolling’”. The Law Council warned a “blanket protection” for companies running social media pages “does not adequately balance competing public interests, may leave victims without recourse and … provide unwarranted complete protection from liability”. Rolph warned this “is likely to increase, rather than decrease, poor online behaviour”. That is because page owners will not be liable “even if they have actual notice of the defamatory third party comment and have the power to remove the comment” – thus alleviating them of a need to moderate comments. Rolph suggested that social media page operators should still be liable if they are given notice of a defamatory comment. Douglas submitted that the bill will benefit commercial media companies and internet giants but does “very little for the vast majority of ordinary working Australians”. “It will do nothing to better protect children online.” Douglas warned the bill “would remove the ability of those who suffer reputational harm online to obtain meaningful remedies”. “If the government wants to reduce online harms inflicted on Australians, then it should incentivise those with the power to moderate social media comments to do a better job.” Douglas submitted “legislation could mandate that providers have a complaints scheme” rather than creating an incentive to set one up. Creating a defence for social media companies is “undesirable” because “it removes one of the more effective avenues for Australians to protect themselves from harm caused by social media”, he said. Rolph noted that under the proposed complaints procedures, anonymous users can block the release of their identifying information, and they are “unlikely” to regularly agree to be unmasked. A group of top defamation barristers and solicitors led by Sue Chrysanthou submitted that “no change” was required to the law to respond to the Voller case. The decision “has no impact on the law” of publication or the defence of innocent dissemination which is still available, the submission said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The submission by prominent plaintiff practitioners was co-signed by solicitors Patrick George and Rebekah Giles, and barristers Richard Potter, Kieran Smark and Nicholas Olson. The defamation practitioners warned against giving media companies immunity for social media posts “no matter how defamatory, and even once they had been put on notice of the defamatory character of the comments”. Given that “non-defamatory trolling may still be deeply hurtful”, the practitioners suggested giving federal courts the power to issue injunctions to prevent publication of cyber-abuse material, to supplement eSafety commissioner powers to force such material to be taken down.",News/Australia news,"Proposed anti-trolling laws could worsen online abuse, Australian law experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/proposed-anti-trolling-laws-could-worsen-online-abuse-australian-law-experts-say
1/24/2022,"Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you the best stories of the day.  Boris Johnson is facing calls to launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party after the former minister Nusrat Ghani claimed she was told her “Muslimness” was “making colleagues uncomfortable”. The prime minister was dragged into the controversy as he awaits the findings of a make-or-break investigation into alleged lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. No 10 conceded on Sunday that Ghani had raised her concerns personally with Johnson at a meeting in 2020, and said he had responded by encouraging her to make a formal complaint with the Conservative party. Ghani says that when she was sacked as a junior transport minister in a reshuffle in 2020, Tory whips told her that her “Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable”. In a sign of the tensions with the party, chief whip Mark Spencer called the claims “completely false”.Ghani, the first female Muslim Tory MP, has described the comment as like being “punched in the stomach”, and has reignited fears about racism in the party. The case added to the febrile atmosphere at Westminster where the findings of Sue Gray’s investigation into alleged parties at Downing Street are expected this week. Doing the rounds of TV stations yesterday, Dominic Raab, deputy PM, refused to say whether the report would be published in full. Ukraine order – The US government has ordered the families of all American personnel at the US embassy in Ukraine to leave the country amid heightened fears of a Russian invasion. The US also issued a statement last night noting the buildup of Russian troops on the border and that “security conditions are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice”. Anthony Blinken, US secretary of state, said Nato would be united and respond “swiftly” if Russia crossed the border. It came as Ukraine’s government said it was reacting “seriously” to UK allegations that Moscow has plans to invade the country and install a puppet government, adding that Kyiv is resisting Russian efforts to destabilise its government and economy. Long Covid impact – NHS trusts in England lost nearly 2m days in staff absences due to long Covid in the first 18 months of the pandemic, according to an all-party group of MPs. The group’s chair, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, said the government had paid “almost no attention to long Covid and the severe impact it was having on vital public services”. In another study into the impact of Covid, nearly half of those who became ill in the first wave of infections may have long-term and even permanent changes to their sense of smell. Peng ‘capitulation’ – The tennis legend Martina Navratilova has condemned as “pathetic” the Australian Open’s decision to stop fans wearing “Where is Peng Shuai?” T-shirts, accusing Tennis Australia of “capitulating” to China. Late last week spectators at Melbourne Park were asked to remove their T-shirts and security confiscated a banner emblazoned with the same words, on the grounds that TA prohibits “clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political”. Exclusive – A committee of MPs has produced a report which says the gambling watchdog is “too harsh” on the industry and criticises the regulator’s attempts to reduce addiction. The MPs accuse the Gambling Commission of a “bullying attitude that has caused mental harm” within the industry and calls for it to be placed in special measures. The findings by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gaming have been described as “ludicrous” by a campaigner for regulatory reform and met with a frosty reception from the regulator. Several members of the committee have faced criticism for taking thousands of pounds worth of freebies from betting firms. Truss accused – Paul Keating, the outspoken former Australian prime minister, has accused Liz Truss of making “demented” comments about Chinese military aggression and urged the foreign secretary to hurry “back to her collapsing, disreputable government”. Keating also said Britain “suffers delusions of grandeur and relevance deprivation” after Truss visited Australia for meetings with counterparts last week. Thierry Mugler dies – The French designer, Manfred Thierry Mugler, who was at the forefront of the 1980s power-dressing look, has died at the age of 73 of “natural causes”. A former ballet dancer, Mugler’s continued to dress the world’s most famous women such as Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian. “He was timeless and ahead of his time,” supermodel Jerry Hall said of the designer. Nipsey Hussle was one of LA’s most-loved rappers and a pillar of his community. But records disclosed after his death revealed that he was also the target of an extensive Los Angeles policing operation. Guardian tech reporter Johana Bhuiyan explains.

Antonio Conte bemoaned the “incredible” decision to disallow Harry Kane’s first-half strike as his unbeaten league start as Tottenham manager came to an end against Chelsea, before admitting his former club are on “another level” to his present squad. A livid Patrick Vieira was unsparing in his criticism of the referee, Kevin Friend, and VAR after his Crystal Palace side were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool. An injury-time strike from Tobin Heath salvaged a point against Manchester City at the Academy Stadium but there was controversy about the opening goal that led the Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall to call for greater support for WSL referees. England won the second T20 international at Kensington Oval after Jason Roy provided the platform to survive a late surge from the West Indies, who finished with the highest-ever ninth-wicket stand. Tennis Australia maintains Peng Shuai’s safety is its “primary concern” despite asking fans at Melbourne Park to remove T-shirts and a banner bearing the words “Where is Peng Shuai?” The Los Angeles Rams and Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the championship games after two thrilling NFL clashes on Sunday. On a weekend where complaining golfers were hardly difficult to come by, Thomas Pieters delivered a timely redemption tale with a one-stroke victory at the Abu Dhabi Championship. And Youssef Msakni scored with a long-range shot to hand Covid-hit Tunisia an improbable 1-0 win over 10-man Nigeria in Garoua to advance to the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals. Large cities have lost almost a year’s worth of sales during the pandemic thanks to lockdowns, resulting in a “levelling down” of historically more prosperous high street destinations, a study by Centre for Cities says. London lost 47 weeks’ worth of sales between March 2020 and November 2021, while Birmingham, Edinburgh and Cardiff also lost nearly a year’s worth of sales as people stayed away from big cities. The FTSE100 looks like dipping around 0.2% at the opening bell, while the pound is on $1.355 and €1.196.
