3/3/2022,"Unseen footage of Ghislaine Maxwell’s father, Robert, filmed by staff on his boat just before his mysterious death, recordings of phones he bugged and a survivor of Jeffery Epstein’s crimes who has never spoken publicly before are to be revealed in a new BBC documentary – one of the highlights of the corporation’s biggest push of its factual shows for years. Launching the exploration of the Maxwell dynasty along with a slew of other programmes coming up this year, including two David Attenborough-fronted series, Frozen Planet II and Last Day of the Dinosaurs, the BBC’s factual, arts and classical music director, Fiona Campbell, claimed that “no other broadcaster has such incredible breadth of factual content” from across the UK. The lineup includes Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff setting up a cricket team in Preston in Freddie’s First Eleven, and All at Sea which follows British fishing trawlers. With the growth of the US streaming companies providing competition for talent and audiences, the ability of the BBC to shine a light on British stories can help to set it apart from its new rivals. One such series is The House of Maxwell, which charts the rise and fall of the media mogul Robert’s family. It features footage taken by staff on his boat in the days before his death, including of Maxwell swimming. There are also secret, bugged recordings – ordered by Maxwell – of conversations his executives were having at the time about financial irregularities. In one exchange, which has been re-voiced by actors to protect identities, an executive says: “I’m fucking furious … I’m fucked if I know what he’s done … He’s gone away on his boat … I’m still trying to track this bloody money down.” The BBC’s head of documentaries, Clare Sillery, said producers obtained the recordings having used them for research about a previous Maxwell drama. They also obtained access to lawyers who investigated Ghislaine, plus “a survivor of Epstein and Maxwell who’s never spoken before who spent three years on the road with [them], spent time on the island in the Virgin Islands and her photographic record.” The producers have also approached the Maxwell family for interviews.  Frozen Planet is returning after 11 years, using tiny new drone cameras that cause less disturbance to animals. Last Day of the Dinosaurs will air in tandem with the results of a dig in the US in April aiming to prove how dinosaurs were wiped out. The BBC is also broadcasting what it calls its most ambitious environmental series to date: seven years in the making, Our Changing Planet is fronted by Ade Adepitan, Liz Bonnin and Chris Packham. In another first, the BBC’s natural history unit has stayed on location for four years to track animals in Zambia for Kingdom. Other shows include Then Barbara Met Alan, a drama about the Disability Discrimination Act; Idris Elba’s Fight Club; a David Olusoga series called Union; documentaries marking 40 years of Aids and the Falklands War anniversary; and a series called Trouble at Top Shop. In addition, from April, every week BBC Four will air Sunday Performance, featuring a performance such as The Play What I Wrote, starring Tom Hiddleston.",News/Media,Maxwells in spotlight and Frozen Planet returns in BBC’s documentaries push,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/03/maxwells-in-spotlight-and-frozen-planet-returns-in-bbcs-documentaries-push
3/3/2022,"Police in Moscow detained two women and five children who wanted to lay flowers at the Ukrainian embassy. Photographs of their detention showed the children holding a poster saying “No to War.” The children, aged 7 to 11, were held with their mothers in a police van before being taken to a police station. They were released hours later, according to anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova. Arkhipova said that the two women detained were Ekaterina Zavizion and Olga Alter along with Liza, 11, Gosha, 11, Matvey, 9, David, 7, and Sofya, 7. The anthropologist, who works at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, wrote on Facebook: “None of what’s happened is holding up in my head.” Video footage on social media apparently showed one of the women explaining to a crying girl from inside a cell that the “task is for fewer people to gather and say they’re against the war”. Arkhipova said that police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody over the five children. They face a trial and a fine on unspecified charges, Arkhipova added. She wrote: “The parents are in fear.” Another sign held by one of the children featured a Russian flag followed by a plus sign and a Ukrainian flag, equalling a heart. The OVD-Info website, which monitors protests and arrests across Russia, said that children up to the age of 14 cannot be legally held for more than three hours. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who shared images of the children, said it was another sign of the toll that Putin’s war against Ukraine is taking on children. He wrote on Twitter: “Putin is at war with children. In Ukraine, where his missiles hit kindergartens and orphanages, and also in Russia. 7 y.o. David and Sofia, 9 y.o. Matvey, 11 y.o. Gosha and Liza spent this night behind bars in Moscow for their ‘NO TO WAR’ posters. “This is how scared the man is.” A 77-year-old artist and activist, Yelena Osipova, was also marched away by a group of police while she protested against the war in St Petersburg. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences including fines, arrests and even imprisonment. OVD-Info said that authorities have arrested more than 320 anti-war protesters across 33 Russian cities. A total of 6,840 people have been detained since Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, ordered the invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.",News/World news,Moscow police detain children for laying flowers at Ukrainian embassy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/moscow-police-arrest-children-for-laying-flowers-at-ukrainian-embassy
3/3/2022,"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to reverse decades of progress made towards gender equality, according to a global study that reveals women have been hit much harder socially and economically than men. Previously, coronavirus-related gender disparity studies have focused on the direct health impacts of the crisis. It is well known, for example, that across the globe men have experienced higher rates of Covid cases, hospitalisation and death. However, until now, few studies have examined how gender inequalities have been affected by the many indirect social and economic effects of the pandemic worldwide. The research, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and published in the Lancet, shows that women have experienced greater negative social and economic impacts than men. The greatest and most persistent gender gap was seen in employment and uncompensated labour, with 26% of women reporting loss of work compared with 20% of men globally in September 2021. Women and girls were also more likely to drop out of school and more likely to report an increase in gender-based violence than men and boys. “This study provides the first comprehensive global evidence on gender disparities for a wide range of health-related, social and economic indicators throughout the pandemic,” said senior author Prof Emmanuela Gakidou. “The evidence suggests that Covid-19 has tended to exacerbate previously existing social and economic disparities rather than create new inequalities. “Society is at a pivotal moment where investment in the empowerment of women and girls is critically needed to ensure that progress towards gender equality does not get stalled or reversed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. We cannot let the social and economic fallouts from the pandemic continue into the post-Covid era. Action must be taken now to not only reverse the current disparities, but to further close the gaps present before the pandemic began.” The study analysed publicly available datasets from 193 countries using surveys taken from March 2020 to September 2021 on health and wellbeing during the pandemic. In every part of the world, women experienced higher rates of employment loss than men since the start of the pandemic. By September 2021, 26% of women and 20% of men had reported losing their job during the pandemic. “Economic impacts have affected women more than men in some countries because they tend to be employed disproportionately in sectors harder-hit by Covid-19, such as the hospitality industry or as domestic workers,” said Dr Luisa Flor, the study’s co-lead author. “Moreover, gendered social norms in many countries attribute household and childcare responsibilities preferentially to women and reduce their time and ability to engage in paid labour.” Women were more likely than men to report forgoing paid employment to care for others, with the gender gap widening over time. In March 2020, the ratio for women to men was 1.8 but by September 2021 it had increased to almost 2.4. More than half of respondents reported an increase in unpaid labour such as domestic work and caring for others during the pandemic, with women significantly more likely to report such increases everywhere except north Africa and the Middle East. Globally, women and girls were more likely to drop out of education than men and boys. The largest gender gaps were seen in central Europe, eastern Europe and central Asia where four times more women than men dropped out of education. Overall, 54% of women and 44% of men said they perceived that gender-based violence had increased in their community during the pandemic. “The further we progress in this pandemic the more we feel that the inequities being exacerbated are only going to worsen, and that any pre-pandemic progress towards gender equality will be reversed,” said Rosemary Morgan of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which was not involved in the study. “Hopefully this data will reenforce the need for decision-makers to act before it is too late.”",News/World news,"Covid has intensified gender inequalities, global study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/covid-intensified-existing-gender-inequalities-global-study-finds
