4/7/2022,"At last, the energy security strategy has been published, after weeks of hedging, briefing and delays. The original aims of the strategy, which was initially promised on 7 March, were worthy: to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from Russian fossil fuels after the invasion of Ukraine. There was also hope in the climate world that the strategy would go further and faster in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The cost of renewables has tumbled, and the UK’s leaky housing stock is crying out for retrofitting. This was an opportunity for an urgent response both to the climate and cost of living crises. But for something that was motivated by a war and an energy crisis, the headline policies of the resulting document strikingly fail to address either. One of the cornerstone issues is timescale: the strategy is big on infrastructure commitments such as new nuclear power plants and offshore wind farms, which won’t be fully operational for years, if not decades. Radical reform of the planning system to allow more onshore wind, one of the quickest and cheapest short-term salves to high energy bills, is absent. In its place there is a milquetoast commitment to “consulting on developing partnerships for a limited number of supportive communities”. Months after Cop26, the strategy has committed to licensing and drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. Its climate ambitions are therefore deeply questionable. The majority of this oil is tagged for export; as Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, pointed out, domestic production won’t address energy bills but will only help fossil fuel executives get richer. Without nationalisation, new oil and gas will be sold at the market rate. Shell made a profit of $19.3bn (£14.7bn) last year. Other energy companies have also been raking it in, benefiting from the extortionate price of gas. Instead of imposing a windfall tax on these oil and gas companies that could help fund energy saving measures, the government’s strategy does the precise opposite. New oil and gas could blow a gigantic hole in the UK’s carbon budget. Licensing new exploration is a brazen move even for the Johnson government, committing to oil and gas in the same week as the devastating IPCC report confirmed existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will far exceed the 1.5C limit. This rushed energy security strategy, which is likely to be incompatible with the government’s other stated climate targets of net zero by 2050, is what happens when you push policies through the weird prism of the Tory party. Although the Johnson administration is no stranger to disorder, producing the energy security strategy has been chaos on a new scale. Over the past few weeks, the prime minister has been attempting to put out multiple fires across his party. Headlines have been peppered with briefings and counter-briefings. On 23 March, the Guardian trailed that Johnson would champion onshore wind in defiance of his Nimby backbenchers. A mere fortnight later, he apparently backed away from onshore wind after over 100 backbenchers lobbied against the policy. As a result, the new strategy has something for everyone, but pleases no one. A new survey into fracking has been ordered as bait to the Tory right, with Kwarteng claiming the government will be “guided by the science on shale gas”. But little has changed in the UK’s geology since the moratorium on fracking was enforced in 2019. Another problem with this strategy is deeply familiar. While it presents a bundle of promises, there is no money to back these up. The key phrase to look out for is “up to”. Nuclear power could provide “up to 24GW by 2050”. The government will “look to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to 5 times by 2035”. Even “we would like to see up to 5GW from floating offshore wind”. These are not targets, they are vague intimations. The energy strategy is silent on one fundamental issue – reducing energy demand. Widely reported wrangling between the Treasury, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Number 10 is to blame. Energy efficiency measures are the quickest and cheapest way to lower energy bills and end reliance on Russian fossil fuels. They are also necessary for decarbonisation. But the Treasury blocked a proposal to expand the Energy Company Obligation scheme, which provides insulation measures to low-income households. This spat seemed petty to the point of ridicule: departments are bickering over a £200m top-up to an existing policy when an enormous, nationwide retrofit campaign will be both necessary and inevitable as our planet warms. The problem is not only of ideological difference, but also ideological vacuum. Most civil servants had no idea a strategy was even in the pipeline when Johnson promised it four weeks ago. But a frenzy in Whitehall to make up policy on the hoof has become a common trait of this government, whose manifesto was slender and whose party consensus is messy on almost every issue. Coordination across the cabinet is beyond Johnson’s reach, partly because he is weak and partly because he doesn’t know what he stands for. In 2012, he called wind turbines “white satanic mills” whose “collective oomph wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”. Now, he’s blowing hard for offshore wind. Johnson finds himself up against a popular, anti-spend chancellor and the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. Despite his 80-seat majority, he is unable to convince his backbenchers of the need for swift commitments to the cost-of-living and climate crises, whilst we career towards 3.2C warming. He has to squeeze everything past a reticent chancellor and a party whose backbenchers are a decade behind public opinion. The result is a mash of promised policies which don’t tackle the issue of energy security. Without seriously contemplating a reduction in our energy demand or fast-tracking renewables, the strategy simply does not address what it was created for in the first place – ending dependence on a belligerent Russia, and bringing down eye-watering bills. Instead, the ragged Tory consensus is to deliver high-intensity infrastructure at some indefinite point in the future, and a failure to rise to the urgency required on energy for both people and planet.

4/7/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, Last Saturday, I spent the day at Donald Trump’s rally in Washington, Michigan, a suburb about 45 minutes north of Detroit. The former president was in Michigan to rally for Kristina Karamo and Matthew DePerno, two little-known Republican candidates running for secretary of state and attorney general respectively. Both have never held elected office and have fashioned their entire political identity by spreading misinformation about the 2020 election. If elected, both would wield considerable influence over the rules of how ballots in Michigan, a critical battleground state, are cast and counted. For the last year, my colleague Ed Pilkington and I have been closely following how Trump and allies are trying to take over or get elected to offices that have more control over election rules (you can read Ed’s recent profile of Karamo here). In Michigan, Republicans have appointed people who have embraced the idea of a stolen election to local boards of canvassers, which certify election results. With those positions filled, and Trump loyalists like Karamo and DePerno holding statewide office, many see a clear effort to put pieces in places to block a Democrat from being declared the winner of the next presidential election. I wanted to know whether people at the rally continued to believe the election was stolen, and whether there was anything that could convince them otherwise. More than 250 local audits have affirmed the results in Michigan. A Republican-led review by the legislature has also debunked Trump’s claims of fraud. From the moment I got to the rally on Saturday morning, I saw the strategy of focusing on election machinery on display. Over and over, I heard many people being solicited to become election workers. That included two men I was interviewing as they waited in line. “You guys think we’re gonna have a fair election?” a canvasser with a clipboard asked Christian Howard, 25, and Marco Braggion, 26. “We need to keep eyes on what’s going on. If we don’t have eyes on it, they’re gonna do what they want,” he said. When both men declined to sign up – one was from out of state and the other couldn’t get time off work – the canvasser didn’t give up. He asked them if they knew anyone else who might be interested. Another group was trying to get people to sign a petition to “decertify” the 2020 election in Michigan, something that is not possible. Inside the rally, organizers placed a petition that would tighten voting rules in the state on every single seat. It wasn’t until the end of the day that I realized that for all of the petition signing and election worker signing, I hadn’t heard anyone asking people if they wanted to sign up to register to vote. A few people had heard of either DePerno or Karamo, but it was clear that Trump’s endorsement was elevating the two candidates. “Trump endorsed them, that got my attention. So I’m here to see that,” said Diane Zechmeister, 67, who traveled from nearby Oxford to the rally. Nearly everyone I spoke to who believed the 2020 election was stolen said it would be nearly impossible to convince them otherwise. “Not with what I’ve seen. I really, I just can’t see that,” said Greg Taylor, 38. “The only way that we could know is, I guess, through an audit, I guess. But who knows about the audit?” he said. “It’s so hard to trust anybody. I don’t trust either side, you know.” I asked Taylor where he gets his news from and he told me Telegram, the popular messaging app, where there are concerns about the spread of misinformation. Wayne Wallace, 58, said he had been voting in the same precinct in Arenac county for years, but when he and his wife went to vote in 2020 there were several people he didn’t recognize. “It all seemed shady and sheisty, and now I understand how it could have happened,” he told me. “I don’t run elections. I just know bullshit when I see it.” He also noted Trump had warned for months about vote totals changing in the middle of the night, which wound up happening in 2020. Election officials and experts had warned it would take longer than usual to count votes in 2020 because of the influx of mail-in ballots and that vote totals could change. And he said he remained unconvinced by the multitude of audits Michigan did to affirm the election results. “It’s not in the vote. It’s in who counted the vote,” he said. Also worth watching … A federal judge didn’t just strike down several new voting restrictions in Florida last week, but went even further and said the state had to pre-clear certain voting changes with his court for the next 10 years. Florida is appealing. Trump allies are pushing to have jurisdictions count ballots by hand, something experts warn is prone to error and could be a “recipe for some chaos”. Ohio officials are again making the case to the state supreme court for why they shouldn’t be held in contempt for ignoring previous orders to make the state’s legislative districts less distorted in favor of Republicans. Texas rejected nearly 25,000 mail-in ballots in its 1 March primary, meaning the state had a staggeringly high 12.38% rejection rate. Several Republican-led states have made it illegal to receive outside funding for elections, which will make it harder for local election offices to serve voters.",News/US news,"At the Trump rally in Michigan, talk of a stolen election still holds sway",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/trump-rally-michigan-stolen-election
4/7/2022,"It is the weight of an elephant, can move like a crab and in a previous life was reviled by environmentalists. The Hummer, that avatar of gas-guzzling machismo, has returned as an electric vehicle with an unlikely billing as an ally in the effort to avert the worsening climate crisis. The reincarnation of the hulking pickup truck, test-driven by the Guardian in the searing heat of Arizona, has been lauded by manufacturer General Motors (GM) as proof that electric vehicles (EVs) can now reach even middle America’s most obdurate devotees of supersized car culture. GM hopes to crush, under a brawny Hummer wheel, the notion that green cars only look like a Prius. “We want to turn EV skeptics into EV believers,” said Mikhael Farah, a GM spokesman. This Hummer has even been endorsed as a climate boon by the White House – in November, Joe Biden screeched around GM’s Detroit plant in a Hummer EV. “This sucker is something else!” the president, a self-confessed “car guy”, exclaimed. It’s a startling reframing of a brand that was spawned from a spartan, military-grade Humvee and became a sort of muscular invading force on roads in the early 2000s. Arnold Schwarzenegger, before he started issuing earnest warnings about climate change, championed it. Boxy and unrefined, the Hummer embodied an outlandishly masculine aesthetic that seemed to almost revel in its gargantuan fuel consumption. Even in an era where the size of cars has been put on steroids, concerns over the climate crisis made the Hummer a standout, cartoonish villain. In 2003, dozens of Hummers were vandalized and set on fire by environmentalists in Los Angeles, with many of the vehicles spray-painted with the words ‘‘gross polluter’’ and ‘‘fat, lazy Americans”. In 2010, the Hummer was discontinued. The electric resurrection of the Hummer, first announced in 2020, has produced a vehicle that does not emit the carbon pollution that overheats the planet nor many of the other toxins that routinely kill thousands of Americans, and millions worldwide, who inhale befouled air. But in many ways it still pushes the boundaries of absurdity. The vehicle weighs more than 4.5 tons, a bulk closer to that of a small bulldozer than the sort of cars typically seen on American streets a decade or so ago. The huge Ultium battery that powers the vehicle is nearly 3,000lb, about the same as two grand pianos. The wheels look like they could traverse Mars. The big display panel in the chunky interior of the Hummer does, indeed, show a graphic of the car on Mars when you put it in its off-road mode. Most trips are on roads, of course – almost half of car journeys in US cities are three miles or less – meaning Hummer drivers will be piloting a metal behemoth weighing the same as a young blue whale when popping out to get some milk. “The Hummer is a niche statement of excess,” according to Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. The price of the first Hummer EV iteration – subsequent models will be cheaper – is a princely $110,000. About 66,000 people have put in an order for a pickup or SUV version of the Hummer and while GM says most have never owned an EV before, many are also simply adding it as a second or third vehicle, somewhat negating the climate benefits. “It’s huge, it’s terribly expensive and it doesn’t fit every lifestyle,” said Carla Bailo, chief executive of the Center for Automotive Research. “GM won’t overproduce it because there’s a limited base of people who will want it.” On its own terms, however, the Hummer EV is an adroit piece of engineering. Fully charged, the battery will propel the vehicle 329 miles before a top-up is needed. The Hummer is smoothly powerful in rocky terrain, with the test drive showcasing its ability to effortlessly traverse plunging, pitted trails in the cacti-dotted desert west of Phoenix. The task is aided by a wealth of technology – the Hummer has 18 different camera angles from below and around the vehicle you can view via the screen, as well as an innovation called “crabwalk”, where each of the tires are set at a 10-degree angle to allow for a sort of sliding, diagonal movement to manoeuvre away from precipitous edges of tracks. On the flat there is raw pace, too, with the instant response of electric acceleration hurling the Hummer forward from a standstill to 60mph in three seconds, a speed that can cause passengers and drivers alike to emit a yelp of surprise. Inside, the Hummer EV is more comfortable than the original and features designs of the moon’s topography – a nod to GM’s role in creating a lunar-roving buggy, which of course was electric – but it maintains a certain butch aesthetic. This points to the Hummer’s broader significance – a demonstration that electric vehicles can now provide the sheer power, size and sensibilities that US buyers cherish, even if they still only command a small fraction of sales. “What we wanted to do is get a truck buyer who would never buy an EV in his life, or never even think about it,” said Brian Malczewski, a chief exterior designer of the new Hummer. “We’re hoping to get, finally, the truck buyers who may be the hardest people to get into this space. This is the perfect conduit for that, I think.” GM is not alone in attempting this. Ford has announced an electric version of its F-150 truck, which has been the best-selling vehicle in America since Ronald Reagan was president, Tesla has its much-hyped Cybertruck and newcomers such as Rivian have garnered plenty of attention. At a different end of the market, you will even be able to get an electric Maserati this year, even if the price, like many EVs, is eye-watering. “I think electric power trains for heavier work trucks, SUVs and pickups, like the Hummer, will be amazing,” said Chris Gearhart, director of NREL’s Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences. “The torque profile of an electric motor will give these vehicles a lot of towing power and the potential for using some of the electrical power in the batteries to directly power worksites and provide backup power could make these vehicles incredibly useful.” While EV options are expanding, it’s still unclear whether production levels, and sales, will ramp up with the urgency of the climate crisis. GM has vowed to sell 1m EVs in 2025 before going all-electric a decade later but only delivered 26 electric cars to customers in the final quarter of last year. Toyota wants to sell 3.5m EVs annually by 2030 but currently has none for sale in the US. Public charging infrastructure, meanwhile, remains spotty across the US and Biden’s attempt to fund 500,000 new chargers has yet to be fulfilled by Congress. Phasing out gasoline cars by 2035, which the US must do if it is reach net zero emissions by 2050 and help avoid climate catastrophe, remains a steep challenge but several experts say replacing them with similar electric alternatives will be the quickest, and most pragmatic, way of slashing emissions from car-dominated American life. “EVs are by far the best and most economic way to reduce greenhouse gases in transportation,” said Sperling. He added that better public transport, cycle paths and denser housing would be beneficial too but these actions are “far less important for reducing greenhouse gases, at lease in the US and other affluent car-centric countries”. Others argue for a more fundamental change that moves people out of cars altogether, rather than simply replacing one type of large vehicle with another. Last month, Harvey Miller was crossing the road in Columbus, Ohio, when he was knocked to the ground by an SUV, leaving him with bruising. Miller said the “mortified” driver, who said she hadn’t seen him, fortunately stopped the car before fully crushing him to death. Miller was walking home from Ohio State University’s campus where, ironically, he teaches classes on transportation safety and urban mobility. The incident underlined to him the lingering problems of America’s fixation upon wide highways, sprawling suburbs and huge vehicles, even if EVs do become the norm. SUVs are far more likely to kill pedestrians than cars, research has found, due to blind spots from the elevated seating position and bulky front ends that strike people high in the torso and head rather than lower in the body. Their ubiquity in American life can also crowd out or scare away those seeking other ways of getting around. “The Hummer scares me, it’s massive and not compatible with life in cities,” Miller said, adding that SUVs could be dangerous. “These large vehicles use up a lot of space and are expensive. I’m disappointed that Biden is championing them and not other forms of mobility, such as walking and biking infrastructure. Cars should fill in the niches for some people, not be the default. “I’m not against EVs, they are the future, but you’ve got to support buses, walking and cycling too or it’s like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. People need options. Unfortunately, car culture is so ingrained that even painting a bike path can get a huge amount of pushback.”",News/Environment,I test-drove the all-electric Hummer.

4/7/2022,"The presence, or even the thought, of friends and family can lull people into a false sense of security when it comes to Covid, researchers have found. Marketing experts have revealed that those who believe they previously caught Covid from a friend or family member are less likely to think they would catch it again than those who were infected by an acquaintance or stranger. The team from University Carlos III in Madrid, Spain, say their experiments also suggest this so-called “friend shield effect” appears to be stronger among those who are politically conservative rather than liberal. “Limiting interactions to close friends and family members is a common protective measure to reduce Covid-19 transmission risk, but the study findings demonstrate that this practice also unintentionally creates other issues, in that people tend to perceive reduced health risks and engage in potentially hazardous health behaviours,” the authors report. The findings appear to tie in to what is known as the “intimacy paradox” – the idea that those we feel closest and safest among may in fact pose the biggest risk. The issue has previously been raised by experts in relation to gatherings of friends and family over Christmas and other occasions during the Covid pandemic, with concerns that people tend to drop their guard among those close to them, raising the risk of infections spreading. The researchers, Prof Eline De Vries and Dr Hyunjung Crystal Lee, carried out a series of online experiments involving participants in the US carried out a series of online experiments involving participants in the US. In one task, the team split 495 participants into two groups and asked them to write down a few thoughts about either a friend or an acquaintance. They were then asked to read a paragraph suggesting junk food increased the risk of severe Covid, unlike sanitisers and masks, before being offered a special offer in an online shop for either chocolate bars and crisps or face masks, disinfecting wipes and hand sanitiser. The results, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, reveal 27% of those who made a purchase after writing about a friend chose the junk food, compared with 21% who wrote about an acquaintance. In another task involving 262 people who had not had Covid before, the team found people who were asked to imagine catching the disease from a friend planned to spend an average of $9.28 on items such as masks or hand sanitiser over the next two months – about half of that planned by those who imagined being infected by an acquaintance or stranger. Prof Stephen Reicher, of the University of St Andrews, a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science – who was not involved in new work – said the study added weight to a long line of research that had reached similar conclusions. But he said that despite experts raising the issue, ministers in the UK had repeatedly endorsed the idea that those familiar to us are less of a risk. For example, the minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said Conservative MPs did not need to wear masks during debates in the Commons because they knew each other and had a “convivial, fraternal spirit”. Reicher said studies had also found that people not only trust friends more, but trust members of the same group, such as supporters of the same football team, more even when they are strangers. “There is no moral judgment associated with being infected. Anyone can have Covid, whether friend or foe, acquaintance or stranger,” Reicher said. “And, paradoxically, the more we assume that ‘people like us’ won’t have the virus, the more likely we are to get it from them.”",News/World news,People have false sense of security about Covid risks among friends – study,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/people-have-false-sense-of-security-about-covid-risks-among-friends-study
4/7/2022,"UK Sport says it will support transgender cyclist Emily Bridges with lottery funding in the build up to the Paris 2024 Olympics if she is allowed to compete in the women’s category. The confirmation by the funding body for British Olympic and Paralympic sport came less than 24 hours after Boris Johnson said he did not believe “biological men should be competing in female sport events”. The UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, said that Bridges would be entitled to public funding up to £27,000 a year, plus benefits, if world cycling’s governing body, the UCI, allow her to compete as a woman – and also praised her “incredible resilience”. “We will support every or any athlete who a sport or governing body has deemed to have future potential and is eligible to compete,” said Munday. “I have huge empathy for everyone involved in this. I have huge empathy for Emily. I have huge empathy for the women whom she would have been potentially competing against. I think this is a complex topic. “Emily has shown incredible courage, incredible resilience, and huge determination. When you are in the centre of something which is of national interest, which this has become, then clearly that creates a pressure and environment on any individual. But this isn’t simply about Emily. This is a much bigger topic.”Bridges, who set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018, had hoped to race as a woman for the first time at the British National Omnium Championships last Saturday before she was barred by the UCI, which questioned whether she was eligible. That ruling came after Bridges’ competitors held talks about a boycotting the event in protest at the UCI’s transgender rules – requiring trans women to lower their testosterone to five n/mol for a year. The riders believe the current guidelines are insufficient to stop anyone who has been through male puberty having a major advantage in the female category – a position supported by Sara Symington, the head of Great Britain’s Olympic cycling programme, who has signed a letter to the UCI calling for a rule change. Mundaysaid UK Sport had been in regular talks with British Cycling to make sure that Bridges was receiving support, along with the riders who threatened a boycott. “We must not lose sight of the fact that this is much bigger than a single person,” she added. “And we have to have these conversations respectfully because humans, human feelings and human experiences are at the centre of this.” Munday dismissed suggestions that Johnson’s comments on transgender athletes would change the funding template for UK Sport, as it was up to the individual sports to decide who was eligible to compete. “What is really important is that we make sure as a sporting industry we are inclusive, that we are welcoming, that we enable everyone who wants to play sport to play sport,” she added. “Where inclusion bumps up against fairness and safety, it’s down for an individual sport to consider and make the decisions that are most appropriate for that sport.”Munday was speaking at an event to announce a pilot scheme which aims to give athletes and coaches an independent and confidential way of reporting allegations of bullying, discrimination and abuse in UK Olympic and Paralympic sports. So far only four sports have signed up to the Sport Integrity scheme, which will be run by Sport Resolutions, an independent sport specific dispute resolution service.

4/7/2022,"‘So do you sing?” Scottish star tenor Nicky Spence asks, smiling encouragingly. We’re talking in the marble bowels of a Mayfair hotel after a preview screening of Sky Arts’ new four-part series Anyone Can Sing – and this isn’t how the conversation was supposed to go. I find myself confessing my embarrassment about being an opera historian and music critic who, no, does not sing. And about the time I sang a folk song in a school music competition, crossing the fine line between the just-tolerated nerdery of a teenage violinist and instant social death. “I love you for that!”, he squeals, as I recoil from the horror dredged up from over 20 years ago. That single solo outing aside, I enjoyed singing in choirs as a child. But these days I’m long out of the habit and will do anything to avoid having to sing on my own in front of others. I’m far from alone, of course, which is where Sky Arts’ series comes in. Created in partnership with English National Opera, Anyone Can Sing is TV with a mission. Three vocal coaches – Spence, mezzo-soprano Sarah Pring and countertenor Michael Harper – have three months to provide a “musical SAS” for six participants drawn from what the show’s narrator cheerfully calls “the nation’s vocally challenged”. The hope is to demonstrate that, as the title proclaims, anyone can sing. You’d be forgiven for remaining sceptical in the first episode. There’s a painful compilation of some of the show’s 600+ applicants offering up their best “La”, the results more Florence Foster Jenkins than Frank Sinatra. Beverley, a publican from North Wales, auditions with a few seconds of Stand by Your Man. “At points it looked like you were having a procedure done”, Spence ventures. “Well it’s the first time I’ve sung it sober”, retorts Beverley. Pring gently asks Chris – long hair, big beard, loud shirt – why he thinks he can’t sing. “I’ve listened to myself”, he says with a shrug. And Ellen, a priest and the first female dean of King’s College London, admits she hasn’t sung in front of anyone for 30 years. Her verdict after lesson one with Spence? “They say anyone can sing … I’m not yet convinced.” But what is it about singing that can reduce us so swiftly to shame and silence? Singing, Spence reckons, gets to “the essence of somebody. It’s like putting your soul on a dinner plate in front of you. You have to let go of all bodily functions to be able to sing well.” That takes confidence, clearly – and physical as well as emotional strength. After 25-year-old Luke suffered a brain injury four years ago he has had Tourette’s. “I feel like every time I meet someone new, the tics are the only thing they see”, he explains. Harper has him flapping his arms like wings to release tension. By the end of episode two, we hear a beautiful tenor voice starting to take flight. Sixtysomething Shirley used to joke she was “probably the only black person who can’t dance and can’t sing” and relies heavily on a stick. Pring exhorts her to stand tall and the impact on her voice is extraordinary. “Listen to that power!” Pring roars. “It’s fantastic!” At the end of her first lesson, Shirley walks out unaided, with both women in tears. “I’m not going to become an old lady”, she vows. “I’m going to be diva Shirley!” Ellen, meanwhile, was told as a child that she couldn’t sing (“Shame on anybody that says their kids can’t sing”, Spence thunders when we chat) and has struggled with pitching ever since. The undeniably discordant results will be familiar to anyone who’s ever been labelled tone-deaf – not to mention their loved ones. Although none of the participants could be described as a good singer at the show’s outset, Ellen most audibly challenges its headline premise. Her bravery in allowing TV cameras to capture her warts-and-all attempts is staggering and the effectiveness of Spence’s interventions is a genuine revelation. Watching her dance around her chapel with him while singing more-or-less in tune is a surreal highlight. Most of us can’t hope to be coached into vocal confidence by famous singers. But it’s the personalities that make this such heartwarming telly. Pring emerges as a sort of vocal fairy godmother, Harper as the honeyed voice of zen and Spence as a phenomenally big-hearted teacher, with a one-liner for every occasion. They’re worlds away from both the catty scoring systems of conventional talent shows and the draconian 19th-century singing manuals that decreed aspiring singers must avoid “bicycling, rowing, dancing, long walks, reading late at night, singing too soon after meals and exposure to excessive heat or cold”. Not that this show’s participants would stand for such nonsense. From Shirley’s visible shock as soprano Natalya Romaniw hits one of Puccini’s high notes to Chris’s response to the news that their final challenge will be singing to an audience of 2,500 at the London Coliseum (“There’s a level of panic right now … but it’s going to be fine”) – their down-to-earth warmth is irresistible. Back in the hotel basement Spence admits, “We had no thought that we would find the next Maria Callas or Pavarotti. This is basically unpacking opera and putting the process in a microwave to show them what is possible with this amount of time in terms of making a difference in their lives.” Even halfway through the series, that broad impact is remarkable. We don’t yet know how they’ll fare on the massive stage of the Coliseum, but Sky Arts director Philip Edgar-Jones has apparently enjoyed the show so much he has started singing lessons. Perhaps it’s time for me to do the same.

4/7/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg is looking to develop virtual coins, nicknamed “Zuck bucks” by staff, for users of Facebook and Instagram as part of a suite of products designed to reduce his platforms’ dependence on advertising in the future metaverse. Facebook’s parent group, Meta, is looking to develop a range of virtual products – including digital tokens and “creator coins” – to diversify income and revitalise its user base, which is increasingly turning to newer rivals such as TikTok. While Meta remains the dominant social media network provider – its revenues rose 37% to $118bn in 2021 as advertisers clamoured to reach the 4.9 billion monthly active users of Facebook and Instagram – TikTok has also built up a massive non-ads business based on in-app purchases and e-commerce. Meta, which has proven quick to ape successful products rolled out by rivals such as Snapchat, is now exploring ways to further monetise its user base, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story. Products being looked at include “social tokens” or “reputation tokens”, which could be used as rewards by users. It is also looking at “creator coins”, which could be used by influencers on Instagram. Like Amazon’s Twitch, TikTok uses a tipping system whereby fans can buy its coins to then buy gifts to give to their favourite creators. Creators can also buy coins to use tools such as Promote to boost a TikTok video’s profile, increasing viewers or followers. The initiatives, led by Facebook’s financial arm, Meta Financial Technologies, follow the company’s ill-fated foray into attempting to create a global cryptocurrency, a project called Libra and later Diem, which was abandoned earlier this year after issues with US regulators. That was not the first time Facebook had looked to move into the world of virtual finance. In 2009 it launched Facebook Credits to facilitate in-app purchases in then highly popular games such as Zynga’s FarmVille. While successful, it was shut four years later after Facebook’s international growth made for costly foreign currency conversions. Meta is also looking to enter the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with plans to allow their integration into Instagram and Facebook.",News/Technology,Meta plans ‘Zuck bucks’ virtual coins for Facebook and Instagram users,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/07/meta-plans-zuck-bucks-virtual-coins-for-facebook-and-instagram-users
4/7/2022,"A woman accidentally bought the wrong lottery ticket after an unknown stranger bumped into her as she made a purchase from an automatic machine – only to discover she had hit the jackpot and scooped a whopping $10m prize. California TV station KABC reported that LaQuedra Edwards was at a Vons supermarket in the city of Tarzana when she put $40 into a vending machine. She described how “some rude person” bumped into her as she was selecting her options and she ended up mistakenly purchasing a $30 ticket. “He just bumped into me, didn’t say a thing and just walked out the door,” Edwards said in a statement released by the California Lottery. She then returned to her car, scratched off the ticket and discovered she had won a gigantic sum of money. “I didn’t really believe it at first, but I got on the 405 Freeway and kept looking down at [the ticket] and I almost crashed my car,” Edwards said. According to the statement, Edwards plans on buying a house and setting up a charity organization.",News/US news,California woman wins $10m after accidentally buying wrong lottery ticket,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/lottery-california-woman-wins-10m-accidentally
4/7/2022,"BT has given 58,000 workers a £1,500 pay rise that it says is its biggest award in two decades, despite its biggest union rejecting the deal as soaring inflation fuels a cost of living crisis. Last week BT had a £1,200 pay rise offer rejected by the Communications Workers Union (CWU), which represents about 40,000 of its 100,000 employees, with union bosses describing it as “insulting” and a “relative pay cut”. The union has been pushing for a 10% rise in the face of rampant inflation, currently at 6.2% and forecast by the Bank of England to peak at 10% by the end of the year. BT said the flat-rate pay rise – going mostly to its lowest-paid staff – worked out to a rise of between 3% and 8%. It has been backdated to 1 April to coincide with households being hit by multiple price increases, from council tax and VAT on hospitality to broadband and phone bills, and will cost BT about £90m. “While we have continued to extend and strengthen our networks to support the country’s recovery, the pandemic has hit our financial performance, like that of most companies,” said Philip Jansen, the chief executive at BT. “We know that the cost of living continues to rise and by making this award, we’re ensuring that our lower-paid workers will benefit most and as soon as possible.” The staff who will receive the pay rise are mainly those who work at BT’s retail stores, engineers who work at its Openreach subsidiary, and call centre employees, all of whom are based in the UK. BT said talks with unions about a pay award for the remaining approximately 42,000 staff were ongoing. About 83,000 of BT’s total 100,000 workforce are based in the UK. Last year BT awarded 59,000 frontline workers a special bonus of £1,500 in recognition of their work during the coronavirus pandemic. This comprised a £1,000 cash bonus and £500 in shares, which will be awarded after three years as part of the employee share scheme. The bonus award cost BT about £110m, and the company said the payments represented about 5% of the average employee’s salary.",News/Business,"BT gives workers £1,500 pay rise despite union rejecting deal amid cost of living crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/bt-gives-workers-1500-pay-rise-despite-union-rejecting-deal-amid-cost-of-living-crisis
4/7/2022,"Commuters to London’s Liverpool Street were treated to a taboo-busting billboard last week, featuring a mother of two weightlifting, while leaking actual liquid. The ad is part of the “leaks happen” campaign, from the women’s health brand Elvie, aiming to raise awareness of a common, but largely obscured, problem – postpartum incontinence. Claire Hackett, the Alliance party rep for Mid Ulster in Northern Ireland, can testify first-hand how women are suffering in silence, and says that openness is exactly what’s needed. When she returned to work 10 months after the birth of her third child, the impact of injuries following all three births continued to complicate her life. “I can remember the sweat and the fear of ‘Oh my God, what might happen if I don’t get to the toilet’. It’s things like this that you don’t really want to talk to people about.” Hackett’s difficulties started about 10 years ago, after having her first child, which left her with a third-degree tear – meaning the rupture went as far as the muscle that controls the anus. After surgery, Hackett was handed a leaflet for pelvic floor exercises. Eight months later, she still hadn’t healed, and was experiencing stinging while urinating as well as bladder control problems. “My husband and I hadn’t had sex at that point because I was still so scared of what was going on with my pelvic region,” she says. She was referred to a “back class”, where women got together and did a circuit of back exercises, which helped strengthen her core, but achieved little else. Many women, says Hackett, are too afraid, ashamed or embarrassed to draw attention to their pelvic problems after childbirth. Added to this is the coy acceptance of the problem, “like in Tena ads for your little ‘oops’ moments. Like this is just what happens to women,” she says. “Yes, it’s common to experience incontinence. But it’s not normal: there are things that can be done.” Myra Robson, a clinical lead physiotherapist and co-founder of the pelvic health campaign group Pelvicroar, says part of the problem is that women aren’t adequately prepared for birth trauma. “There’s still a much greater emphasis on this lovely romantic version of childbirth. People aren’t prepared for the fact that there can be a problem when you’re trying to get a whole human being out of this relatively small space,” she says. “I think we’re very unrealistic about that. We need to empower women to vocalise when they’re having problems and do something about it.” It’s certainly not a niche concern: as many as one in three women experience urinary incontinence in the three months after childbirth, according to the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). And it can also develop in the years that follow. According to Julie Cornish, colorectal consultant at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and vice-president of the MASIC Foundation – a charity that supports women who have been severely injured during childbirth – research shows that one in five women develop problems controlling their bowels in the first five years after giving birth vaginally. Being pregnant and giving birth can also weaken the pelvic floor – the supportive hammock made of muscles and tissues that keeps the pelvic organs (the uterus, bladder and bowel) in place. When the pelvic floor is overstretched – if the baby is large, during an assisted birth (using forceps, for example) or if labour is prolonged – one or more of these organs can descend (prolapse) into the vagina. One writer described the experience as a feeling of constantly sitting on an egg. But women are not necessarily warned of these risks, says Ranee Thakar, vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “Mothers tell me – when I see them – that nobody ever told them that these [pelvic floor disorders] could happen.” After childbirth there is a lot of focus on the baby – and rightly so, says Thakar. “But we also need to think about the mother, especially given pelvic problems are not always readily apparent after delivery.” Undetected or mild birth trauma can escalate into more serious conditions as women age, she adds. Postnatal care has long been patchy – even before the pandemic – partly due to a lack of education among healthcare professionals as well as the embarrassment and stigma that impedes mothers from reporting their issues in the first place. Covid simply exacerbated these underlying fissures, says Cornish: “We are facing a massive uphill battle, because cancer cases are going to be taking priority and so pelvic floor problems get pushed to the back of the queue again.” For the most part, pregnant women are offered some education by the NHS about what to expect all the way through to delivery, but these classes are not uniform across the country. After birth, women are typically given a leaflet with instructions for exercises they can do to get their pelvic floor muscles back into shape (although pinpointing those muscles can be tricky). Meanwhile, postnatal care is largely the responsibility of community midwives. Around the six- to eight-week mark, a postnatal check on mother and baby is conducted by GPs. If a serious injury emerges, mothers are typically referred to secondary care. Twenty years ago, there were three or four clinics focused on pelvic floor problems across the UK, but while there are many more now, says Thakar, “they’re not there everywhere”. Waiting lists are long and increasing staff shortages haven’t helped. “In terms of a full pelvic floor assessment,” says Robson, “it’s usually the physiotherapists that do it, and there’s just simply not enough of us to go around.” Christine Sweet, who lives in Greater Manchester, gave birth for the first time in June 2021. Her delivery involved an episiotomy (an incision between the vaginal opening and the anus to make more space for the baby), as well as forceps, both well-known risk factors for future pelvic complications. She was discharged from hospital about 24 hours after giving birth and put in the care of a community midwifery team. A few days later, her episiotomy stitches came apart. In pain, Sweet went to her GP, who diagnosed her with an infection, suggesting it was acquired in hospital. The doctor was “horrified at the sight of the wound and didn’t know what to do. She rang gynaecology at the hospital, and they said that until the infection had been cleared, they weren’t prepared to see me.” Sweet says that having an open wound that wasn’t healing was more painful than the labour. “Nobody seemed to know what to do with it, or what should be done to keep the wound clean and who was meant to be reviewing it.” Eventually, after four courses of antibiotics, the infection cleared, but Sweet was told her problem did not satisfy the criteria for urgent referral to gynaecology. The waiting list for a standard appointment was hovering between six months and a year. Twelve weeks after the birth of her son, she managed to find some childcare, and went to A&E. After hours of waiting, it was determined her wound needed to be cauterised – a process in which electricity or chemicals are used to burn tissue in order to close a wound. It was done there and then, and healed soon after, but that wasn’t end of her problems. Finally, more than three months after giving birth, she had a full internal examination with a pelvic health physio team, where it was confirmed that she had developed a prolapse. “It seems that if you have a baby, you should expect to be in pain,” said Sweet. “But the more you try to keep a lid on it … it doesn’t give women the true picture of what can go wrong, and then importantly how you can fix things once they have gone wrong.” Melissa Bubnic, a freelance script writer in London, has been on a waiting list for reparative surgery for more than a year. Bubnic initially realised something was wrong in 2019, three months after giving birth to her second child. Sitting on the bus on her way to an event, she smelled something odd. A visit to the loo confirmed her fears – she had soiled herself. Fortunately, she had wet wipes on hand, but about a month later, it happened again. When she saw her GP that May, she was referred to pelvic specialists at a London hospital. With demand far outstripping supply for such services, it could take up to a year to get an appointment. Finally, in November 2019, she went for an endoanal scan. “I wanted to believe that everything was OK,” says Bubnic, “so I asked if everything was OK back there. She said, ‘No, it’s really not OK.’” “It was the first time anyone had told me that something was really wrong – I had had a fourth-degree tear that had been missed.” It was likely, she was told, that the tear had occurred back in 2015, during the birth of her first child, when she was given an episiotomy and forceps had been used. By May 2020, she still hadn’t been able to see an NHS physiotherapist – and felt as if she was being dissuaded from seeking the opinion of a colorectal surgeon. “I was told that a referral would be made but whenever I called, they couldn’t find the referral in the system. And I had to kind of get a bit cross.” She finally saw a colorectal surgeon in November 2020 and was put on the waiting list for surgery, but the pandemic has increased delays. Tired of waiting, she took a punt on an advertisement posted by a PhD student investigating the impact of serious birth trauma. She was assessed by a medical team at St Mark’s hospital, a specialist bowel hospital in Harrow, London, earlier this year, and underwent surgery there last month. “I have been so incredibly lucky,” she said. Both Bubnic and Hackett have sought out private physiotherapy, too. “I just always thought, you have babies, you wet yourself,” says Hackett. “It’s just what you have to put up with. So, to find out that I could rehab my pelvic floor to the level that I have, and it’s still not even perfect … I couldn’t believe it.” The cost for private physiotherapy can be prohibitive at about £100 for the initial consultation (depending on geography), and slightly lower rates for follow-up appointments. Many campaigners cite France as a country with better pelvic healthcare. Mothers there are automatically prescribed multiple sessions of physio to “re-educate” their pelvic floor after delivery. But there is acknowledgment that postpartum care in the UK is ripe for improvement, and earlier this year NHS England announced the opening of 14 new pelvic health clinics, bringing together midwives, specialist doctors and physiotherapists to improve the prevention, identification and treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction. Physical injuries aside, the sexual and mental health impact of postpartum trauma is devastating, says Bubnic. “You just feel so sexless and dirty. Incontinence is so mortifying. The mental health impact of being scared to leave your house, or having an accident – every women who has these injuries has to deal with that.” When Bubnic first discovered the severity of her injury, she didn’t know anybody else who had faced a similar situation. “I felt so ashamed and embarrassed,” she says. “I need a lot of support around managing the injury and navigating this labyrinthine health system. Even when you want to talk to NHS staff, who are trying to help you, bringing up the sex aspect, everyone looks a bit awkward and doesn’t really know what to say. “I just don’t believe that if the genders were reversed,” she adds, “if it was men, in the act of becoming fathers, who were ripped from testicles to anus and left incontinent – that we wouldn’t be doing something to address that.”",News/Society,‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/07/it-seems-if-you-have-a-baby-you-should-expect-to-be-in-pain-the-women-living-with-postpartum-incontinence
