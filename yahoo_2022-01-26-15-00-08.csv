1/26/2022,"A defense attorney for an officer charged in George Floyd's death said Derek Chauvin called ""all of the shots."" Three ex-MN officers are standing trial on civil rights charges of depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights. Former Minneapolis officer Chauvin was convicted of Floyd's murder in June 2021. A defense attorney during the trial of the former Minneapolis police officers charged in connection to George Floyd's death said convicted fellow former officer Derek Chauvin called ""all of the shots"" in Floyd's arrest, the Associated Press reported. Three former officers Thomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J. Alexander Kueng face civil rights charges of depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights during the fatal police encounter on May 25, 2020. The trial began on Monday, January 24. Thao and Kueng are also being charged with failing to intervene in the use of unreasonable force. The three officers pleaded not guilty. During opening statements, prosecutor Samantha Trepel accused the three men of standing by as Chauvin ""slowly killed George Floyd right in front of them."" ""They chose not to protect George Floyd, the man they had handcuffed and placed in their custody,"" Trepel continued. A defense attorney representing Kueng claimed Chauvin called ""all of the shots"" during the arrest, as he was the senior officer at the scene, adding that Chauvin served as his client's field training officer and had ""considerable sway"" over his future. ""You'll see and hear officer Chauvin call all of the shots,"" attorney Tom Plunkett said, also saying there was a lack of training at the Minneapolis Police Department, specifically on the intervention against unreasonable use of force. A representative for the Minneapolis Police Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In May 2020, Floyd died after Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for 9-and-a-half minutes while he was handcuffed. Kueng, who is Black, was seen pressing on Floyd's back, and Thao, who is Hmong American, supervised the crowd, according to the AP report. Video footage showed Lane, who is white, holding Floyd's feet, and at times he was holding one of Floyd's calves. In some instances, Lane's hands were not on Floyd at all and he appeared to be just nearby him, the AP reported. In June of last year, Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter in the murder of Floyd. He was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison. Chauvin also faces additional charges related to violating Floyd's constitutional rights during the fatal encounter. He also pleaded not guilty to the charges. Trepel said videos show Thao standing next to Chauvin and taunting Floyd for using drugs, telling bystanders ""this is why you don't"" use drugs. She added that Kueng ""never once"" told Chauvin to get off Floyd. Kueng's attorney said his client was the one who told Chauvin he could not detect a pulse in Floyd. Attorney Earl Gray, who is representing Lane, said his client suggested using a hobble restraint to allow Floyd to be on his side, but claimed Chauvin refused, the AP reported. Gray added that Lane called an ambulance for a cut on Floyd's lip and gave the instruction to elevate the urgency of the call as the incident escalated. The attorney went on to say Lane also got in the ambulance with Floyd and performed chest compressions on Floyd, according to the AP. ""Mr. Lane, from the beginning of the time that he came into contact with George Floyd until the time he walked out of that ambulance, he was totally concerned and did everything he could possibly do to help George Floyd,"" Gray said. Lane, Thao, and Kueng also head to trial in June for state charges related to Floyd's killing, including aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. The three have pleaded not guilty.

1/26/2022,"An elderly Asian American man who fell victim to a brutal attack in broad daylight in San Francisco two years ago is launching a federal lawsuit against the city’s District Attorney’s Office for allegedly mishandling his case and mistreating him in the process.

Anh Lê, 69, was out for a walk in Chinatown on Nov. 2, 2019, when a father-and-son duo threatened to kill him and repeatedly struck him with a baseball bat. He managed to call 911 after running away as far as he could.

Lê said it all started after he politely asked the teenage son, who was riding a bicycle, to be careful since it was a crowded sidewalk and he nearly collided with him.

Shortly after, the teenager took out a baseball bat from his mother’s bag and hit Lê multiple times. His father, identified as Jimmy Tanner Sr., then raised a glass bottle and threatened to kill Lê.

 

The incident, which was witnessed by a shocked crowd, occurred in front of a Chinese grocery store at 1118 Stockton St. Lê said Tanner’s wife, who was with another teenage son, “seemed to watch with glee” as the attack unfolded.

“I pleaded with the Tanners to stop, but they relished in their ability to inflict pain and

fear on a defenseless senior citizen,” Lê said in a victim impact statement provided to NextShark. “The attack was the most brutal, terrifying, and humiliating experience of my life, and has stayed with me ever since.”

After the incident, Lê, who is Vietnamese American, learned that the Tanners had targeted other Asian Americans on the same day. The alleged attacks also took place in Chinatown.

The Tanners reportedly entered S&M Ginseng Inc. and Chinese Herbal Store at 1000 Stockton St., just a few blocks from where Lê was attacked, and threatened its store owner and customers. The teen who struck Lê with the baseball bat allegedly used the same object to hit a customer.

Lê said he also learned of a third “terroristic” attack committed by the family near Broadway and Stockton Street. The alleged incident occurred after the attack on himself.

Lê quickly reported his experience to San Francisco police, which led to the Tanners’ arrest later on the same day. The father, Tanner Sr., was taken into custody for battery, felony elder abuse and felony terroristic threats.

The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, however, refused to prosecute either the father or son with hate crime enhancements and agreed to a lenient plea deal with Tanner Sr., who pled guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge for no jail time and only a year of probation — all without Lê’s knowledge.

In addition to failing to notify Lê of plea deal discussions, the District Attorney’s Office allegedly also failed to provide him a chance to enter a victim impact statement during the proceedings. Consequently, no such statement was read at the plea deal hearing.

Additionally, the office allegedly refused to correct a Criminal Protective Order (CPO) that omitted Lê’s last name — identifying him only as “Anh L” — and misstated his age. Such errors led to Lê doubt the enforceability of the order.

Lê spent months trying to correct the CPO, but his requests have fallen on deaf ears, according to him. Even after retaining pro bono counsel, the District Attorney’s Office allegedly continued to ignore him, even telling him at one point that he had no right to be at hearings.

Lê, who is represented by King & Spalding LLP — a member of the Alliance for Asian American Justice — is now suing the District Attorney’s Office under the Fourteenth Amendment. He is accusing the office of applying procedures that resulted in discriminatory effects on Asian Americans and creating practices that deny victims adequate due process protections.

Lê is also bringing a claim against the City and County of San Francisco, which may be liable for any constitutional violations found to have been committed by its officials. With anti-Asian hate crimes still on the rise, he fears facing another attack and similar failures in the justice system.

The 69-year-old said the incident has left him with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He spent 52 weeks in psychiatric therapy, according to court documents.

“Ever since November 2019, I cannot help but picture the attack over and over again. I no longer feel safe walking the streets of our city, as I used to love to do. I look over my shoulder and wonder if there are people who want to hurt me, because I am Asian American,” Lê said.

“Although I was extraordinarily lucky not to have been seriously injured or killed, the attack has left me with a profound and lasting feeling of fear, anxiety, helplessness and hopelessness.”

In a statement, Quyen Ta, a member of Lê’s legal team at King & Spalding, said they are proud to represent the 69-year-old victim.

“We are grateful that the Alliance for Asian American Justice brought this case to our attention. We are proud to represent Mr. Lê, a courageous Vietnamese American hate crime victim who is willing to speak out to ensure that other AAPI hate crimes victims will be treated fairly by the San Francisco DA’s office,” Ta said.

“We look forward to working with the DA’s office to ensure that victims like Mr. Le have a voice in the criminal justice system — including during the sentencing of defendants who have attacked AAPI victims.”

1/26/2022,"An online gathering of Asian American women and allies, including actress Olivia Munn, aimed to tackle anti-Asian hate but was interrupted by racist Zoombombing.

The “Newsroom” and “X-Men: Apocalypse” star posted on Instagram that she and a group of Asian American women were hosting a virtual Lunar New Year event on Monday about “how to stop anti-Asian hate” when the gathering was “targeted by a zoom bombing of horrific, violent, racially charged images and audio.”

The gathering was shut down after the Zoombomber shared vulgar images and anti-Asian hate speech, but the discussion resumed 15 minutes later with attendees rejoining the conversation, a National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum spokesperson told NextShark.

NAPAWF’s executive director Sung Yeon Choimorrow, Priscilla Tsai of Cocokind and Amy Liu of Tower 28 Beauty, as well as the Asian American Girl Club and more than 100 AAPI creators, were all present for the event.
 


""We were communing to celebrate, elevate and protect the AAPI community and we were subjected to a hate crime in real time,"" Munn continued to say. ""It was a cowardly and unconscionable act.""

She said the Zoombomber “momentarily disrupted” the gathering, but that it didn’t stop the group’s conversation.

Choimorrow said she is not surprised that communities discussing racism and misogyny would be targeted by Zoombombing.

“Even in a space created by us and for us, the very things we were talking about happened while we talked about it,” she added. “There is so much work that still needs to be done and unfortunately it often falls on the back of women of color. But we will not let the hate directed at us deter us from building our collective power as AAPI women.”

Tsai, who was also the organizer of the virtual gathering, explained that there needs to be more spaces for AAPIs.

“The only way I know how to get through it and process what happened is through community,” she said. “We are all AAPI leaders and this is the perfect example of us needing to make space for each other. And for us to really make a pledge that we are not going to be silent. We’re not going to let something like this happen to us and retreat.”

Liu expressed the same sentiments about the importance of advocating for each other and different communities.

“We came together with such great intentions and ended up becoming victims of hate. But we will fight back and we will hold space again,” she said.

“Cheap tactics like these won't stop our quest for equality, equity and to stop Asian hate,” Munn wrote in her post, calling the act “cowardly and unconscionable.”

She told event attendees in an Instagram story, ""We are so sorry to have gone through this traumatic experience together. We are here for you, as you are here for us.""

Munn further shared ways on how to help fight anti-Asian hate, including donating to NAPAWF and supporting small Asian-owned businesses.

Munn has been vocal about the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes across the country brought about, most often than not, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
