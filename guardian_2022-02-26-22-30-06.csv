2/26/2022,"Prominent figures who have dyslexia have accused ministers of putting up more barriers for those with the condition, after proposals that would see anyone failing GCSE maths and English barred from securing higher education loans in England. The plan to link student loans eligibility to GCSE results was revealed last week as part of sweeping reforms to university access. There were immediate concerns that the measures would impact disproportionately on poorer students when they were unveiled alongside new rules about how loans and fees will be repaid. Dyslexia charities and advocates are concerned that the measure could severely impact on the life chances of students with the condition. Benjamin Zephaniah, the writer and poet who is a professor of creative writing at Brunel University, told the Observer that his struggles with dyslexia showed that the government should find a “more open-minded, more accessible” approach to eligibility for a student loan. “I’m a professor at Brunel University, and I oversee a whole department of creative writing,” he said. “I tend to start my term looking at my students and saying to them: ‘On paper, you’re all more educated than me’. I had a completely different life journey from all of my students. Some of it was luck, but a lot of it was just passion for a language I was dyslexic in. “In school, I was a failure. Now they study my books to pass exams. We have to be a bit more creative and open-minded about the way we get students into university. I’m a huge fan of apprenticeships. But in many things, you can’t have a one-size-fits-all approach. Not everybody should go to university, but not everybody who fails their GCSEs shouldn’t go to university.” Theo Paphitis, the retail entrepreneur who featured on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den and is chancellor of Solent University in Southampton, said the idea was “frankly ridiculous”. Paphitis, who also has dyslexia, said: “Taking those with dyslexia as an example, they might not do so well in their exams on the day – I know I didn’t – and this immediately, and unfairly, puts them at a financial disadvantage to their fellow students. “Everyone should be given the opportunity to discover what they are passionate about, and in some cases attending higher education is one of the best ways to do this. The world is rapidly changing, and it’s time that the UK’s education system caught up and removed barriers, rather than putting more up for those who already may not be on a level playing field to others. Education isn’t one-track – there are different paths for all. To discriminate against giving a loan, which is to be repaid, and to potentially harm the future of a student with special needs, such as dyslexia, in this present world, is beyond the imagination of anyone with any knowledge of education and skills for the future.” Gillian Ashley, chief executive of the British Dyslexia Association, said: “Creating a blanket rule with set grades required to enter university discriminates against those with dyslexia. It excludes the strengths they might demonstrate through other forms of assessment.” The Helen Arkell Dyslexia Charity said the government’s proposal was “misconceived and conflicts with its intention to level up society. This proposal fails to consider the needs of neurodivergent students, such as those with dyslexia, many of whom have strong oral communication skills, but struggle to convey their knowledge and understanding through the written word.” The consultation on minimum requirements for loans comes with ministers trying to control the costs of higher education. About 71% of pupils in England achieve a grade 4 in GCSE English and maths, falling to 52% among disadvantaged households. It is part of the government’s delayed response to the Augar review of post-18 education and funding in England, ordered by former prime minister Theresa May. Meanwhile, changes to the period over which loans are repaid mean that, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, high-earning borrowers “stand to benefit substantially”. Graduates on lower-middle earnings would suffer the biggest proportionate loss. The Department for Education said minimum educational requirements for a student loan were part of a consultation, and there could be exemptions to the rules for certain types of students.",News/Society,"Student loan ban will hit dyslexic people hard, says Benjamin Zephaniah",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/student-loan-ban-will-hit-dyslexic-people-hard-says-benjamin-zephaniah
2/26/2022,"The nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson is an attempt to “defile” the supreme court and “humiliate and degrade” the US, the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson claimed on Friday night. If confirmed, Jackson, whose nomination was announced by Joe Biden earlier on Friday, will be the first Black woman on the court. Carlson said Jackson was nominated “because of how she looks”. He said: “Do you want to live in that country? Most people don’t, of all colors. They think you should be elevated in America based on what you do, on the choices not on how you were born, not on your DNA, because that’s Rwanda.” One columnist called his comments “the perfect distillation of white supremacy”. Biden promised to put a Black woman on the court. Chosen from a short list of three, Jackson was introduced on Friday. Biden called her a “proven consensus builder” with “a pragmatic understanding that the law must work for the American people”, and said: “For too long, our government, our courts, haven’t looked like America.” If confirmed, the former public defender will replace the retiring Stephen Breyer. The balance of the court will stay 6-3 in favour of conservatives. At the White House, Jackson paid tribute to Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to be a federal judge, for her “steadfast and courageous commitment to equal justice under law“. Carlson claimed Jackson’s appointment showed Biden was committed to undermining equality. “Now maybe she’s great,” he said, “that’s not the point. The point is she was picked because of how she looks, so what does that tell you not about the nominee but about Joe Biden? “It tells you that he is absolutely happy to defile a system built by other people over hundreds of years, this is the best system in the history of the world, and he is happy to destroy it. Doesn’t care at all.” Carlson also claimed Jackson wasn’t “much of a jurist … not simply ignorant of the law” but also “a political activist”. Pointing to a forthcoming case concerning affirmative action in college admissions, Carlson said most Americans “think you should be elevated … based on what you do … not on how you were born, not on your DNA, because that’s Rwanda.” Jennifer Rubin, a conservative Washington Post columnist, called Carlson’s comments “the perfect distillation of white supremacy”. Justices have been nominated on grounds of identity. Ronald Reagan promised to pick a woman and installed Sandra Day O’Connor. Donald Trump promised to pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg and installed Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative. Most observers say Jackson, who was confirmed to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit with three Republican votes, is eminently qualified. On Friday, Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, pointed out that she has almost nine years of trial court experience, more than four current justices including the chief, John Roberts, combined. Vladeck told CNN: “Only Justice [Sonia] Sotomayor among the current justices has trial court experience … and so I think what we’re really talking about here is diversity along so many axes, and from a nominee who really ticks every conceivable box.” Vladeck also said it was “really hard to figure out what the line of attack would be against someone with Jackson’s credentials, her background, her experience, you know, her resumé”. Republicans have been happy to offer previews. Ted Cruz of Texas has complained about Biden’s promise to pick a Black woman and about how Democrats treated Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second pick who denied accusations of sexual assault. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who backed a candidate from his state, said the “radical left” was behind the Jackson pick. Democrats will most likely not need Republican votes, even those (Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska) who voted to confirm Jackson last year. Democrats need only their own 50 senators and the casting vote of Kamala Harris, the vice-president. Carlson pressed on. “Let’s say you really didn’t care about the country you lead,” he said. “Let’s say you wanted to humiliate and degrade it and undermine its ancient institutions. What would you do? “Well, you might take the single most important appointed position in the entire government and announce in public that you are filling that position on the basis of appearance. Not on the basis of skill or wisdom or fealty to the founding documents of the United States, but on the basis of the way the person looks. “… That would send a very clear message that you don’t like the country you run and you don’t care about the institutions that its ancestors built.” The supreme court was founded by and has been almost exclusively populated by white men. Of 115 justices, two have been Black men and five have been women.",News/US news,Tucker Carlson condemned for Ketanji Brown Jackson ‘Rwanda’ comments,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/rwanda-tucker-carlson-ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-biden-fox-news
2/26/2022,"Russian troops continued to press their offensive against Kyiv as well as other cities across Ukraine on Saturday, as residents sought shelter in the capital’s metro and basements through a third day of fierce bombardment. As Russian strikes continued to pound the capital, the country’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy refused a US offer to evacuate, insisting that he would stay. “The fight is here,” he said as street fighting continued largely around the edges of the city. Zelenskiy also offered renewed assurance that the country’s military would stand up to the Russian invasion. In a video recorded in the street close to the government quarter, he said he remained in the city and that claims the Ukrainian military would put down arms were false. At a later press conference, he said: “We are successfully holding back the enemy’s attacks. We know we are defending our land and the future of our children. Kyiv and the key areas are controlled by our army. “The occupiers wanted to set up their puppet in our capital. They didn’t succeed. On our streets, there was a proper fight going on.” Ukraine’s health minister reported on Saturday that 198 people have been killed – including three children – and more than 1,000 others wounded since the Russian offensive started before dawn on Thursday, with massive air and missile strikes and troops forging into Ukraine from the north, east and south. Among the Kyiv buildings hit in the latest wave of Russian strikes was a high-rise residential building. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko posted an image showing a gaping hole in one side of the building and ravaged apartments on several floors. “We are all scared and worried. We don’t know what to do then, what’s going to happen in a few days,” said Lucy Vashaka, 20, a worker at a small Kyiv hotel. An intelligence update by the UK ministry of defence posted on Saturday, however, said that Russia had yet to gain control of airspace over Ukraine and that the majority of Russian forces were still about 18 miles from Kyiv. With Kyiv’s defenders fending off Russian attacks in the early hours of Saturday, there were reports of Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces including Sumy in the country’s east. A resident in Kherson – which Russia claimed to have taken – who was reached by the Guardian by phone, said that while Russian troops were in the city there was continuing fighting and the Ukrainian military had blown up a key bridge into the city. The Ukrainian military also claimed to have shot down two Russian transport planes loaded with paratroopers although this could not be confirmed, and the Russian military did not comment on either plane. It came amid evidence that in some areas Russian forces were also facing mounting logistical difficulties, with Ukrainian language social media accounts posting footage of captured Russian soldiers and reports of shortages of vehicle fuel and food for troops. In a deeply ominous development, however, footage captured by CNN just across the Russian border in the Belgorod region showed a TOS-1 heavy flamethrower system which fires thermobaric rockets being moved on a flatbed truck towards the Ukrainian border. “Peacekeepers” https://t.co/nXRvcUzjbZ The deployment came as the international criminal court’s prosecutor has put combatants and their commanders on notice that he is monitoring Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. The latest fighting came as Ukraine appeared to be winning mounting diplomatic support for expelling Russia from the international Swift banking system, with the office of the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, saying it would support any EU move on sanctions and Cyprus, which has extensive banking links with Russia, indicating that it would no longer object to the move. A decision is expected within days. “We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from Swift. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe,” Zelenskiy said on Saturday. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said the country was banning Russian flights from its airspace and France said it had decided to send defensive military equipment to Ukraine. As large numbers of Ukrainians in the country’s south and east have sought to flee, including into neighbouring Hungary and Poland, queues at some border crossings snaked back for 20km and more. Evacuation trains were organised from cities, including Lviv, to help people leave. An estimated 120,000 people have fled – including 100,000 into Poland since Thursday. The movement of Russian troops after less than three days of fighting further imperilled a country clinging to independence in the face of a broad assault, which threatened to topple Ukraine’s democratic government and scramble the post-cold war world order. Western officials believe Russian president Vladimir Putin is determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own. The invasion represents Putin’s boldest effort yet to redraw the map of Europe and revive Moscow’s cold war-era influence. It has triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin. The US government had urged Zelenskiy earlier Saturday to evacuate Kyiv but he turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, saying he needed anti-tank ammunition but “not a ride”. The Russian invasion was anticipated for weeks by the US and western allies and was denied to be in the works for just as long by Putin. Putin has not disclosed his ultimate plans for Ukraine. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov gave a hint, saying: “We want to allow the Ukrainian people to determine its own fate.” Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia recognises Zelenskiy as Ukraine’s president, but would not say how long the Russian military operation could last.",News/World news,Russian strikes pound Kyiv as Zelenskiy refuses US offer to evacuate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/ukraine-russian-strikes-pound-kyiv-as-zelenskiy-refuses-us-offer-to-evacuate
2/26/2022,"You know, I am beginning to think I have a superpower, albeit one that only manifests itself in very specific circumstances. Whenever someone finds out what I do for a living, I can predict with unwavering certainty what their next question to me will be. Whether it’s in an interview with the press, in chats with cabbies, or discussions with non-botany colleagues: “So, what first made you interested in plants?” It’s a question that is almost always accompanied with a look of incredulity, and heavy emphasis on the word “plants”. Then comes: “Does it run in your family?”; “Did you have a particularly inspirational teacher at school?”; “Is it a cultural thing in Asia?” Yet no one has ever asked my football-mad big brother what it was that first caused him to take an interest in sport. Trust me, I was curious, so I called him once to double-check. It’s never instantly attributed to some kind of epiphany moment, mysterious external influence or somehow – ahem – stitched into his DNA. To me, the great irony is, I see this question precisely the other way round. I find plants so intrinsically fascinating, and have done since my earliest memories, the very idea that some people aren’t as obsessed with every aspect of them as I am is totally bizarre. After all, as a plant scientist I know that billions of years of co-evolution alongside the botanical world has directly determined every aspect of our culture, civilisation, even our basic biology. In a very real sense, plants made us human. The very way we see the world, our eyes on the front of our faces, rather than on each side like many mammals, is the result of the need for binocular vision to negotiate the three-dimensional terrain of tree canopies in our distant biological history. Our colour perception, rare in the animal kingdom, evolved to allow us to pick out easily ripe, red fruit against green backgrounds. Even in today’s concrete jungle, if you wonder why our eyes are inevitably drawn to red warning signs, red sports cars, red cocktail dresses, you have our co-evolution with plants to thank. Ever wonder why night-vision goggles show the world in shades of green? It’s largely because human eyes can detect far more shades of green than any other colour which, in our deep evolutionary past, allowed us to distinguish between toxic and tasty plants better. We are built to be botanists. That’s why I find it such a weird cultural quirk that, in modern western society, we tend to dismiss plants, and in particular gardens, as frivolous. At best, some kind of quaint, suburban hobby, at worst, merely frivolous decoration. The outdoor equivalent of drapes and scatter cushions. I’ve sat in meetings on major urban design projects when teams of fancy architects will openly refer to gardens as “developers’ parsley”: a useless garnish chucked on at the last minute. However, the reality is that study after study has consistently shown how green space can profoundly affect how we understand our surroundings, navigate the world around us, and feel about ourselves. It affects not just our mental and physical health, but how we interact with others, how we structure society. Trials demonstrate that exercise in green spaces tends to feel easier, even if subjects are burning more calories. Our levels of stress and anxiety are measurably reduced when we are surrounded by plants. Healing times in hospitals have been reported to be faster when patients are given green views. Antisocial behaviour decreases, even crime rates are statistically reduced. This research is still very much in its infancy, but it all points to some seriously transformative stuff. Of course, all of this should come as very little surprise, as we know the health of any species is dependent on its access to an ideal habitat. And whether we are doing it consciously or not, that is exactly what we are doing when we garden: engineering our surroundings to mimic the fertile, forest-edge ecosystems in which we evolved. No matter how different they appear, gardens around the world all share the same basic elements. A sheltered area, screened from view to refuge from predators, contrasted with a comparatively open space to spot prospective prey. A clean water source, ideally a fast-flowing one, which is more likely to be safe to drink, and, of course, lots of flowering species – a tip-off for the future location of tasty fruit. When we garden, not only do we make the world a more beautiful place, we also improve local biodiversity, cool overheated cities, mop up pollution and mitigate against flooding, all while improving our own health and well-being, which together have been shown to directly determine how effectively our society functions. Plants are key solutions to pretty much every major problem that faces our species today. So maybe I really do have a superpower, but I share it with all gardeners, and the only thing you need to start participating in this miracle of life is a packet of seeds. So, without further ado, here’s the Observer’s special supplement to inspire you and give you some ingenious ideas on how to get growing.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Green planet: how gardening can save the world,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/26/green-planet-how-gardening-can-save-the-world
2/26/2022,"“Iheard you are writing an African version of my book,” George RR Martin emailed Marlon James, after the Booker prize-winning novelist told a magazine that he was going to “geek the fuck out” and write an African Game of Thrones. “George was a great sport about it,” James says. A mashup of mythology, Middle-earth and Marvel comics, James’s Dark Star trilogy – which began with bestseller Black Leopard, Red Wolf and is now joined by Moon Witch, Spider King – is a slippery beast to summarise. Even for its author: “Damn it, if I could I wouldn’t have written such a long book,” he jokes on a video call from his home in Brooklyn. Each novel in the trilogy will tell the same story from a different perspective: Black Leopard was narrated by the mercenary Tracker; and its readers will recognise many of the characters in the new novel, including the eponymous Moon Witch, otherwise known as Sogolon. There is an evil royal host, a love story and a dizzying array of mythical characters, not to mention enough sex and gore to satisfy GoT fans. “I think writing a book should be something like reading a book, meaning I should have fun,” he says. “And it was great fun to write.” But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be taken seriously. “We sometimes look at fantasy as child’s play, that once we get into fantastical creatures we must be telling a kids’ story,” the 51-year-old says. “There is still this idea that the social realist novel is the novel grown up, which I’ve always considered ludicrous because there are so few adult women in those novels.” He gives his big laugh. James has never been afraid of poking the literary establishment (after winning the Booker he accused the publishing industry of “pandering to white women”). James is wearing a woolly beanie: it is freezing in New York, although he is used to the cold after 14 years in Minnesota, where he still teaches creative writing for part of the year. But the early Saturday morning sunshine picks out titles on the eclectic bookshelves behind him: Sophocles’s Theban plays, a four-volume history of the hundred years war and a compendium of punk. He has a whole shelf devoted to Kazuo Ishiguro, a particular hero. Our conversation ranges from the Incredible Hulk (“the saddest music ever in TV history”) to Rachel Cusk (“I love the unforgiving gaze”). For all the talk of Game of Thrones, two very different novels were on his desk while he was writing the new book: Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall. “I am in awe of those writers.” James himself has been compared to everyone from Charles Dickens to David Foster Wallace, with Quentin Tarantino thrown in (he much prefers Jane Austen). But such acclaim was a long time coming. His first novel, John Crow’s Devil, about two rivalrous priests and set in rural 1950s Jamaica, was rejected 78 times before finally being published in 2005. His second, The Book of Night Women, a brutal 18th-century slave narrative and “easily one of the best Jamaican novels ever written” according to a critic in this paper, was turned down 20 times. “It’s a hell of a thing when you’re not white enough to write a black novel,” James wrote in 2006, pointing out that a white man (Yann Martel) had won the 2002 Booker prize for a novel about an Indian (Life of Pi). In 2015, he became the first Jamaican to win the Booker for his next novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings, which used a cast of more than 70 narrators to circle around the attempted murder of Bob Marley in 1976 like a record on a turntable: the New Yorker called it “a kaleidoscopic, coke-spiked Our Mutual Friend”. A Brief History of Seven Killings was followed by Black Leopard, Red Wolf, which his editors feared might be “too sci-fi for the literary crowd and too literary for the sci-fi crowd”. They needn’t have worried: the novel received rave reviews (even from the New York Times’ much-feared Michiko Kakutani) and is being made into a film by Black Panther star Michael B Jordan. It wasn’t such a departure as it might seem. Creating a vast cast of diaspora characters during a turbulent year for Jamaica, Brief History led him to ask: “How did we get to this point? What is it that we don’t have? I thought, well we don’t have a mythology. We don’t have an origin narrative,” he explains. “If you play rock’n’roll, sooner or later you have to go back to the blues.” So he started obsessively researching African folklore. To say that his mythical world is set in Africa “is like saying Lord of the Rings is set in Europe”, he points out. “I’m writing an African world but I’m also a Jamaican and I’m also in the diaspora,” he says. “You can tell it went through the Jamaican blender.” James describes his upbringing in the town of Portmore, outside Kingston, as “very middle class and suburban”. “If you grew up in the 80s anywhere in the world you had the same childhood,” he says. “We were all raised by TV, thinking we were cool by saying we were listening to the Smiths but really we were listening to Madonna.” Both his parents were in the police force: his father (who died in 2012) left to become a lawyer, his mother was a detective. “She puts them in jail, he takes them out,” was a running family joke. He read whatever he could get his hands on – “the only category I needed for a book was ‘next’” – coming late to classic fantasy fiction simply because there wasn’t a drugstore paperback of The Lord of the Rings. Instead he gorged on film tie-ins, fairytales and comics. He attended the “posh” school, where he always felt a bit of an outsider. It was this sense of “having to negotiate a world you don’t belong to”, that he associated with Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell, and which he gives to Sogolon and also to the ambitious Nina Burgess in A Brief History, the character closest to him, he says. James was gay in an overwhelmingly macho culture (sex between men is still illegal in Jamaica), though he assumed this was “just a phase” that he would grow out of by the time he reached his 17th birthday. “Man, poor 17! I hinged a lot on that year. And it didn’t happen.” So he turned to the church, which gave him “all sorts of equipment for pushing it aside”. Church was the first place he came out, an “electrifying” experience initially, but then it was “now let Jesus change you”. An “exorcism” in his early 30s – “basically preachers locking you into a room to drive out the gay” – relieved him of his faith but not his sexuality. “Funnily enough, the exorcism made me more gay.” Although he didn’t go looking for it, researching for Black Leopard and Moon Witch, he was shocked to find so much queerness in African mythology: “These are queer characters, this character – he gay!” he says. “We were way more open and accepting of all these things before. Everything was cool until contemporary Christianity told them ‘no’.” He’s not a fan of fantasy as allegory, which usually means reinforcing Judaeo-Christian beliefs of good and evil – “I wanted to write characters that stood against all that” – but this novel unwittingly came to present his vision of an “idealised world”, full of non-binary characters and a wild pluralism of body forms. It is both ancient and very 21st century. “Some people neither night nor day,” Keme, Sogolon’s lover and father of her children tells her, as he reveals himself to her ashalf-lion, half-man in a moving scene where James says he felt the safest to be himself. “It mirrors my shapeshifting and the realisation that I wasn’t necessarily trying to go from one point to another point. I kind of like this midway.” His fascination with shapeshifting goes back to his early love of comics and has continued ever since. In a much-shared piece in the New York Times entitled From Jamaica to Minnesota to Myself, written in 2015 after the publication of Brief History, he described “peeling New York off his skin”, by changing out of his hoop earrings and skinny jeans in public toilets, Clark Kent-style, before meeting Jamaican relatives or boarding a plane back to Kingston. A gay Jamaican writer nearly a decade younger told James recently that he didn’t identify with his piece at all: “I said, ‘Dude, you have no idea how happy that makes me,’” James says now. “I wrote that article hoping for a day when you’d never have to read that article any more.” He no longer feels the need to literally change outfits: “My mother is still very much alive and I am still very much out. We find a way of dealing with it.” But as a Black man living in America, “code-shifting” is still part of his everyday life: “My white friends speak to their friends the same way they speak to their family, the same way they speak to their employer. They never have the self-consciousness to think: ‘OK – stop, adjust language, speak.’ Whereas I do it all the time.” Back when James was struggling to find a publisher in the late 90s, he was infuriated by the vogue for cultural appropriation in fiction: had he been white, his first novel, John Crow’s Devil, would have been sold as “a feat of narrative ventriloquism”, he says, a phrase he has always hated “because it means somebody that makes us a dummy”. Writers of colour who did get published had to stick to particular narratives, the colonial legacy or the immigrant experience, and “everyone had to talk about the sweet smell of jasmine in the air, and the characters couldn’t be cranky or a complete pain in the ass”. Even today there is a pressure to write stories with some sort of “uplift,” he says. “You can’t be a black Dennis Cooper or Kathy Acker. We don’t talk about it a lot, but we should.” One evening he and a bunch of other writers drew up a drunken list of novels they vowed never to write: a coming-of-age novel (he may be having second thoughts on this one); a campus novel; and a mid-life crisis novel, “because the world doesn’t need another novel about a straight man having a 20-year-old girlfriend”. For writers outside the establishment, even “something that seems fresh can also seem like another formula,” he says now in regard to his comments after the Booker, about the kinds of stories found in magazines like the New Yorker – “older mother or wife sits down and thinks about her horrible life”; literary heresy at a time when this sort of writing was hailed as the antidote to the big male beasts of late 20th‑century American fiction. “That was a warm time for me because I got in a lot of fights,” he says. “There is nothing wrong with the-suburban-white-woman-experiences-ennui story, if we are going to have to tolerate hundreds of bored-white-men-staring-at-their-penises stories. But you know what? We are bored with that shit.” Things have changed “tremendously” in the seven years since he won the Booker. Young writers such as Raven Leilani, Carmen Maria Machado, Eloghosa Osunde might not have been published 20 years ago, he says. “It’s Black voices, it’s Black, queer voices. God bless Black lesbians who are having a grand old time!” But he thinks the stories told by all writers “have gotten wider and broader and deeper. I think we have become more diverse and more open-minded readers.” A lot of bad stuff happens to poor Sogolon over 177 years and 600 or so pages. There are an awful lot of references to “koos” (female genitalia). But none of James’s fiction shies away from sex and bloodshed. He acknowledges he is “walking a tightrope” between an unflinching stare and “a pornography” of violence. As he says: “Are you writing a novel full of sexists and cruelty to women or are you writing a sexist novel? I think a lot of novels don’t know the difference.” “Violence is violent and sex is sexy,” he says. “You are supposed to be appalled.” We have been “conditioned to see violence without suffering” by action movies and TV. The same goes for the “elegant suffering” in literary fiction: “Have you ever been with somebody who is about to die from cancer? The room smells, it’s not elegant. Dying is not cute.” And too many writers are guilty of what he terms “space-break sex” – coyly closing the bedroom door. “It is very easy for literary authors to write boring sex or unrewarding sex,, or what I call indie-movie sex,” he says. “Intimacy is not a taboo.” Shapeshifting as a writer once again, James has just completed a six-part Channel 4 TV series, Get Millie Black, about a Jamaican detective who returns to London on the trail of a missing person case: “She’s not based on my mum, whatever my mum might think.” Though he likes to believe some of the detective work has “rubbed off” on him. “I am my mother’s child,” he says. “I look at writing as a mystery that I have to solve. I start with a character and follow them.” Then it is back to his fantastical Africa for the final instalment of the Dark Star trilogy. Fans of Black Leopard, Red Wolf are already asking whose version we should believe, Tracker’s or Sogolon’s? “I’m like, ‘Dude that’s up to you, because I’m never telling you.’” Moon Witch, Spider King by Marlon James is published by Hamish Hamilton on 3 March, £20.

2/26/2022,"The US oil and gas industry is using Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to pressure the Biden administration to throw open more land and ocean for domestic drilling and to loosen regulations for large companies attempting to ramp up their fossil fuel extraction. Just hours before Russian troops began their unprovoked assault on Ukraine, the American Petroleum Institute (API) posted a string of tweets calling for the White House to “ensure energy security at home and abroad” by allowing more oil and gas drilling on public lands, extend drilling in US waters and slash regulations faced by fossil fuel firms. API, which represents oil giants including Exxon, Chevron and Shell, has called on Biden to allow an expansion of drilling and to drop regulations that impede new gas pipelines in order to help reduce fuel costs for Americans and support European countries that have seen gas costs spiral due to concerns over supply from Russia, which provides Europe with around a third of its gas. “At a time of geopolitical strife, America should deploy its ample energy abundance – not restrict it,” said Mike Sommers, the chief executive of API. Sommers added that Biden was “needlessly choking our own plentiful supply” of fossil fuels. Some leading Republicans have joined the calls. “No administration should defend a Russian pipeline instead of refilling ours,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told her state’s legislature this week. “Every day, I remind the Biden administration of the immense benefits of Alaska production, energy and minerals alike, and every day I remind them that refusing to permit those activities can have harmful consequences.” Environmental groups were quick to criticize the renewed push for more drilling, accusing proponents of cynically using the deadly Ukrainian crisis to benefit large corporations and worsen the climate crisis. “Expanding oil and gas production now would do nothing to impact short term prices and would only accelerate the climate crisis, which already poses a major threat to our national security,” said Lena Moffitt, chief of staff at Evergreen Action, a climate group. “We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and stand opposed to actions by leaders of the fossil fuel industry that attempt to profit off of these harrowing atrocities.” Russia has faced a barrage of sanctions from the US and the European Union, although the western allies have so far largely steered clear of targeting the country’s vast oil and gas industry. Biden has said the sanctions will “end up costing Russia dearly, economically and strategically” but has not applied punitive measures to Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned oil company. The US president faces the opposing pressures of dealing with the climate crisis while avoiding the political headache of rising gasoline prices for American drivers. On Thursday, the price of a barrel of crude oil rose to more than $100 on the global market for the first time since 2014, amid fears over Russia’s supply. A group of 10 congressional Democrats wrote to Biden on Thursday to urge the president to release more oil from the US’s strategic petroleum reserve in order to lower fuel costs for consumers in the short term. “We know that in the long-term, eliminating US dependence on oil will provide the stability we need to keep energy costs low for American households,” the lawmakers acknowledged. The European bloc is thrashing out a plan for a long-term shift away from dependence on the fluctuating fossil fuel markets, with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, outlining the need for “strategic independence on energy”. Europe is “doubling down on renewables”, she added. The Ukraine crisis could prove to be a “turning point” in global energy consumption, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. “There will be a transition to clean energy... it will be a difficult one, but I believe the governments will have to manage a transition if we want a planet that is safe and clean in the future,” he said. The development of solar and wind power has grown strongly in the US in recent years, although fossil fuels still account for about 80% of domestic energy consumption. Scientists have warned that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas must be rapidly and drastically slashed if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate impacts such as heatwaves, floods, food insecurity and societal unrest. “Clean energy is affordable and reliable; we can’t afford to wait any longer to free ourselves from the volatility of the fossil fuel market and the dictators and violence it enables,” said Moffitt.

2/26/2022,"No winged fairies populate the pulsating darkness of Scottish Opera’s new A Midsummer Night’s Dream. These sprites are woolly-wigged ragamuffins, a devious bunch who inhabit the crevices of Duke Theseus’s mirrored palace like beady brown woodlice. Night is a time of alarm and subversion, which is as it should be: Britten’s 1960 opera, in every fantastical and textured detail, from tap-tapping harpsichord to belching trombone, speaks of churning mystery. Directed by Dominic Hill (artistic director of Glasgow’s Citizens theatre) and conducted by Scottish Opera’s music director, Stuart Stratford, this is a bewitching staging of high theatricality, ending with big-hearted, over-the-top hilarity. The wolf whistles and cheers at the final curtain suggest the company has a hit on its hands. Anti-pastoral but murkily beautiful, the look in Tom Piper’s designs (lighting by Lizzie Powell) is last century retro doused in messy gothic. Unmade beds hang from the ceiling. Tytania, sung by Scottish Opera’s talented emerging artist, coloratura soprano Catriona Hewitson, has a touch of the Helena Bonham Carter in her silvered, vintage hair and gown. Making his Scottish opera debut, the American countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, striking as the ethereal, almost disembodied Oberon, is pale-faced, purple-lipped, ghoulish. A punk Puck (Michael Guest), blessed with limbs that bend in all directions, manages the remarkable feat for this spoken role, of prompting delight rather than irritation. Consisting of many roles and a children’s chorus (gutsy and excellent here), Britten’s opera is ideal for introducing new voices. Jonathan McGovern’s Demetrius, Charlie Drummond’s Helena, Lea Shaw’s Hermia and Elgan Llŷr Thomas’s Lysander – all singers to watch – found maximum character in the quartet of lovers. Glen Cunningham as Francis Flute, tottering in high heels, let rip in his limelight moment as Thisbe, high comedy, well handled. His co-Rustics, led by David Shipley as the winningly bumptious weaver Nick Bottom made merry in their last act entertainment, to much audience laughter. You can forgive the work’s longueurs at the start – Britten and his partner, Peter Pears, made their own libretto from Shakespeare, hastily – given the dazzling musical ingenuity of the finale. The orchestra of Scottish Opera and Stratford, the company’s music director, deserved their extra-loud applause. Pastoral came in a double dose last week. Janáček called his 1924 opera The Cunning Little Vixen a “forest idyll” that would awaken our sense of the unity of life and nature. English National Opera’s new staging, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, directed by Jamie Manton in his first main-stage production, have honoured the work with a lively cast, a degree of chaos and minimal sentimentality. Small insects hurtle in on kick scooters. Frog, cricket, dragonfly variously flit and croak. Jolly hens wear frilly white frocks and yellow plastic shoes. They cheer the staging, but it errs too far on the side of drab. Any idyll is in the music alone. When, in the last act, the poacher (a notable Ossian Huskinson) shoots dead his foxy prey, this endlessly bubbling, twittering and boiling score abruptly stops. Soft woodwind curls up out of the silence until the full orchestra unfolds, timpani thudding out a funereal beat. This is the moment the work takes an emotional grip, speaking as one who has not got the gene to find “singing animals” automatically alluring. In Tom Scutt’s stripped-down set a narrow screen rolls down to indicate seasons, sunrise, sunset. Eventually the black line drawings of twigs and birds shift into an abstraction of notes and staves, reflecting the works touching orchestral close. Brabbins and the ENO Orchestra catch Janáček’s mix of angular and folk-inspired idiom, the performance well-paced but not breathless. Vixen Sharp Ears, of the title, sung by Sally Matthews with bright energy, finds love with the warm-voiced, alluring Fox of Pumeza Matshikiza, in her house debut. As their offspring, children of two Westminster primary schools sang their hearts out, engaging wholeheartedly with the ENO Chorus. Lester Lynch’s sympathetic Forester had powerful stage presence. Alan Oke and Clive Bayley, as schoolmaster and priest, compete for the title of most droll, leading a classy lineup of cameos. The Bath BachFest, like many small festivals dealing with pandemic shutdowns, has adapted and now streams live events, reaching a wider audience. The final concert, given at the Assembly Rooms by the Academy of Ancient Music, featured two Bach suites, No 2 in B minor and No 3 in D major. The flautist Rachel Brown gave a short, spirited discourse on 18th-century dance forms. Bach united the traditions of different countries through minuet, sarabande, polonaise. In a critical week for Europe, this was a sobering thought.

2/26/2022,"One of the first things we knew back in early 2020 was that we wouldn’t be going to work for a while. We thought that we would take a quick break – a week, maybe – and then reassess. So we cleaned out our cubicles and desks, and grabbed a few snacks from the kitchen (and toilet paper from the bathroom). One week became two, which became a month, which became a series of question marks spanning endlessly into the future, as the Zooms and FaceTimes and home office conversions gradually made the very idea of spending our workdays with other people seem like a quaint memory. Like childhood birthday parties, or answering machines, or properly functioning democracy. Some of us might never go back. Every so often we will hear about companies reassessing their relationship to the office, which has been proved unnecessary or at least outdated. Maybe it’s better. Maybe the fuel we save and traffic we avoid is better, in the long run, and it took this forced separation to reveal that. ‘In 1987,’ photographer Steven Ahlgren says, ‘when I was bored and unfulfilled, working as a banker in Minneapolis, I began taking frequent trips to look at a painting by Edward Hopper, Office at Night. What first drew me was its setting, which I related to each and every workday at the bank. But what kept pulling me back was its ambiguous narrative – who were these two people, what was their relationship, and why was the woman looking at that piece of paper on the floor?’ But I’m a defender of the office, despite all its annoyances. I’m here to pay tribute to the big, dumb, lumbering buildings, with their slow elevators and water coolers, and common bathrooms with mysterious and disconcerting odours. I’m standing up for the poorly designed parking lot, the faulty wifi router in conference room B that drives everyone nuts, the bundles of power cords and the sun-faded personal photos hanging at a five-degree angle because Janice from accounts knocked the holes into the plasterboard too close together. Maybe I’m biased. I wrote for the American version of the ultimate workplace show, The Office, for its first four seasons. That show, like its British predecessor, didn’t exactly celebrate the concept of a common workplace as much as present it as a necessary and banal evil. It’s simply the place, said Wernham Hogg sales representative Tim Canterbury, where you share a bit of carpet with other people for eight hours a day, and that shared bit of carpet might be all you have in common. ‘I am reminded of these photos every time I enter an office building,’ Ahlgren says, ‘or overhear a fragment of conversation about office life: a promotion won or lost, the challenges of a new firm, a difficult relationship with a superior or subordinate. Sometimes I remember these conversations and try to imagine how the moment described would have looked as a picture.’ It is not exactly the most romantic ode, but after two years of commuting from my bedroom to my living room, a shared bit of carpet sounds delightful. Because, for all its problems, the office is one of the only places we encounter and have to deal with other people. This was true before the pandemic. The world had already atomised. Should we head to the grocery store? Eh, let’s just have them delivered. Need to buy a book, a toy, a flashlight, a humidifier? Why drive to the shop when we can order it from our couch as we watch Netflix? The one place we reliably bumped into other people, the one place we knew we had to share a bit of carpet, was at work. ‘It wasn’t until I’d left banking to study photography that I went into an office with a camera to try and portray some of these ideas. I eventually worked at this project from 1990 to 2001, in law firms, insurance companies, government agencies, but always with the same approach: nothing would be staged and only the light that was available would be used.’ I would imagine that, for many, the loss of that shared carpet was something to celebrate, not mourn. I get it. Offices can be sites of drudgery, emotional pain, or even abuse at the hands of cruel co-workers or bosses. Working from home has also given some of us the chance to spend more time with our kids. (Although, counterargument: we’ve had to spend all our time with our kids.) I would imagine that, for many, the flexibility to work from home might have been, and might forever be, a blessing. But a world where we never encounter other people, no matter how annoying or boring they might be, is not the world that humans were designed for. We’re meant to be around each other, gently bumping into each other, exchanging small moments of conversation and mutual interest. We’re meant to share experiences, bond over common annoyances, celebrate each other’s birthdays with dumb hats and cupcakes. The shared office is one of the last places where we can practise being around other people. ‘As I gradually became more interested in photography and less interested in banking, I began to notice scenes around me that reminded me of Edward Hopper’s paintings. When working late I was fascinated by how the light in some empty offices and corridors appeared almost theatrical.’ I’ve spent the last six years or so reading and writing about ethics. Ethics, in the nutshelliest of nutshells, is the art of negotiating with the people we share bits of carpet with. It’s the art of learning about what others value, comparing that with what we value, and learning how to coexist. It’s messy and discouraging and frustrating, and it’s also the very essence of being alive. Our offices are ethical laboratories, and we are both the guinea pigs and the scientists. Again, I will admit my own bias. Not only have I made a living from writing about people in offices, the offices in which I’ve made that living are among the most fun in the world. They’re filled with funny and smart people who make going to work feel like the opposite of “going to work”. The 50 hardest laughs I have had in my life all happened at my job. The same is probably not true for you, which means you may read about the demise of the shared office and say: good riddance. ‘In meetings, my attention would occasionally drift from the matter at hand, and I would observe the subtle expressions and gestures of those around me. Sometimes I saw that what was being discussed had profound consequences – professional and personal – for others in the room, although their emotions were usually veiled by professional decorum.’ But something will be lost if we stop working while surrounded by others. There will be one less place on Earth where we have to negotiate with people we didn’t choose to negotiate with. I submit, to those of us who may just now be slowly returning to our desktops and water coolers and wonky wifi routers, that maybe it isn’t all bad.
