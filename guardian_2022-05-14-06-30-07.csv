5/14/2022,"The podcast host Deborah James said she is “completely lost for words” after her Cancer Research fundraising initiative passed the £5m mark in just five days. James, 40, known online as Bowelbabe after campaigning to raise awareness of bowel cancer, launched the JustGiving page on Monday after revealing she was receiving end-of-life care for the condition. Having set her original target at £250,000, the presenter of BBC podcast You, Me And The Big C has now raised more than 20 times her goal. In a post on Instagram, James wrote: “Thanks to an incredibly generous donation earlier today, and to every single person who’s donated to the bowelbabefund, we’ve just reached the unbelievable total of £5m. “We’re completely lost for words. This is all just beyond anything we could have ever imagined. The last 5 days have been surreal. “Thank you for putting a huge smile on my face, and helping us to launch a legacy to hopefully impact a lifetime cutting edge cancer care.” The donations came from more than 240,000 supporters, including high-profile figures such as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. According to her JustGiving page, the money will fund “clinical trials and research into personalised medicine for cancer patients” and support campaigns for bowel cancer awareness. James is also set to receive a damehood in recognition of her campaigning efforts. She began co-presenting You, Me And The Big C with Lauren Mahon and Rachael Bland in 2018, earning praise for their frank discussions about cancer. Bland died in September that year at the age of 40, two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. James, a former deputy headteacher, was diagnosed with bowel cancer at the end of 2016 and has documented her treatment for her more than half a million Instagram followers frankly throughout. In an Instagram post on Monday, she said she did not know how long she had left, and that while the last six months had been “heart-breaking” to go through, she had been surrounded by “so much love” and had “no regrets”.",News/Society,‘Lost for words’: Deborah James’ cancer fundraiser raises £5m in five days,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/lost-for-words-deborah-james-cancer-fundraiser-raises-5m-in-five-days
5/14/2022,"Ministers have banned official contact with the National Union of Students over long-running allegations of antisemitism within the organisation, despite the NUS’s pledge to work with Jewish students in an internal investigation. The allegations have become a focus for the government since the election of Shaima Dallali as the next NUS president, with groups including the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) raising concerns after alleged historic comments resurfaced. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, announced the suspension of NUS recognition, saying he was “seriously concerned” by the reports of alleged antisemitism. “Jewish students need to have confidence that this is a body that represents them, and we need to be sure that the student bodies that we engage with are speaking fairly for all students, which is why we are disengaging with the NUS until the issues have been addressed,” Zahawi said. “From the NUS’s initial response to our concerns, I am confident that they are keen to take action and welcome further updates from them.” Michelle Donelan, the minister for higher and further education in England, announced that she had written to the electoral body that oversaw this year’s NUS presidential election, asking for information on how the election was carried out. The NUS represents seven million students at universities and colleges, with 600 student unions affiliated. The suspension only affects its relations with the government in Westminster and not those in other nations. Matt Western, Labour’s shadow universities minister, said it was important that Jewish students felt safe and able to participate in student organisations. “It is important that the NUS is listening, and I hope that the independent inquiry they have rightly set up resolves these issues to the satisfaction of all concerned,” he said. The Department for Education (DfE) said: “Although the NUS has shown a willingness to respond to concerns expressed by ministers, including beginning to kickstart a process of independent investigations, this will need to lead to substantive action. “This decision to disengage from the NUS will be kept under review as the organisation demonstrates it has suitably addressed these issues.” A spokesperson for the NUS said: “We are disappointed that the universities minister has press-released that the DfE will be disengaging from the NUS, rather than seeking to engage with us directly. “Following a complaint about antisemitism, we launched an independent investigation. We will be appointing a QC, in consultation with the Union of Jewish Students, next week. We have sought to undertake the investigation in a serious and proper way, and are working in collaboration with UJS at every step of the way. “Once the QC has been appointed, we will be able to update on the process and timeline. We look forward to working with the government constructively on this matter.” The DfE said that during the suspension, the NUS will be removed from all government groups and replaced with alternative student representatives. The department is asking arm’s-length bodies, including the Office for Students, the higher education regulator, to take similar action. After Dallali’s election earlier this year, the UJS objected to comments she is alleged to have made, including a tweet posted 10 years ago that read: “Khaybar Khaybar O Jews … Muhammad’s army will return Gaza”, referencing a AD628 assault on Jews. Dallali – who is president of the City, University of London students’ union – has apologised for the tweet, saying she is not the same person she was then. In an interview with the Guardian, Dallali, 27, revealed that since her election she had received a lot of Islamophobic and racist abuse online. “Unfortunately, as a black Muslim woman, it is something that I expected, because I’ve seen it happen to other black Muslim women,” she said.",News/Education,UK government suspends engagement with NUS over antisemitism allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/13/uk-government-suspends-engagement-with-nus-over-antisemitism-allegations
5/14/2022,"Before this frayed, scrappy but thoroughly engrossing tie the Luton captain, Sonny Bradley, had fretted that it could be his last chance to become a Premier League footballer. He is hardly on his last legs at 30 but nights like this do not come along often. The Hatters’ presence in the playoffs is a thing of wonder and it was Bradley himself, equalising Danel Sinani’s early goal, who ensured Wembley will be within tantalising reach when they play the second leg in West Yorkshire on Monday. The same is true for Huddersfield, who will be happy enough to have left a raucous, hostile environment with a draw and now hope to make home advantage tell. Kenilworth Road has not hosted a top-flight fixture since 25 April 1992, when a win over Aston Villa could not stave off relegation and a sliding-doors moment with the riches of the Premier League. The ground, rickety and ramshackle, appears to have been frozen in time since then; Luton’s on-pitch fortunes have been far more fluid and, as they were roared out by a sea of orange-clad fans, it scarcely felt believable that a five-year stint in what is now the National League only concluded in 2014. Built on a shoestring and playing to the most distinct of galleries, Luton and Nathan Jones have contrived a fairytale. Five years ago Huddersfield achieved their own unlikely promotion and, while they did not last too long at the top, this season’s third-placed finish in the Championship under Carlos Corberán has primed them for a repeat. After a dozen frantic minutes they came closer to making that a reality. They had been denied a fair penalty shout after 12 seconds when Harry Toffolo was bundled over at the far post by James Bree; almost immediately it was Bree, the right wing-back, who came close to setting the occasion ablaze when a fierce drive was tipped over by Lee Nicholls. The tempo was relentless but, given his chance, Sinani kept a cool head. The loanee from Norwich had space to exploit when, in attempting to pursue him, Kai Naismith stumbled. Toffolo found the gap with a slide-rule pass and, with Bradley unable stop the shooting chance despite drawing him wide, Sinani shot crisply inside Matt Ingram’s near post. Shortly afterwards, Bradley was sharper in blocking from Danny Ward. Luton could ill afford a second concession but steadied, asking questions with a series of crosses from either side. The 35-year-old Cameron Jerome was an obvious target but Huddersfield had not been overly stretched before Bradley’s leveller. It came on the half-hour after Jerome had been fouled by Tom Lees on the left. The free-kick was whipped across deliciously by Naismith and Bradley met it with a close-range volley that Nicholls could not keep out. The two Luton defenders had made Sinani’s life too easy earlier on, but now they had made emphatic amends. Jerome, as awkward a foe as ever, had his own strong penalty appeal rejected when Naby Sarr appeared to clumsily stall his run towards goal. He gathered himself to curl narrowly over from 25 yards; Henri Lansbury and, at the other end, Ward would also come close towards the end of a half that had rattled by. Bradley opened the second half by stooping, under heavy pressure, to meet a Naismith corner but finding the side-netting. It did not take long for Nicholls’ propensity for taking his time over goal-kicks to catch the crowd’s attention. Rather than a suggestion Huddersfield had already settled for a draw, it seemed a ploy to slow Luton’s more frantic approach and bring a more measured style to bear. It was not far off succeeding when Ward saw a shot on the turn deflected just over. The visitors began to manoeuvre the ball around with a degree of freedom as the hour mark passed. They were served a reminder of the hosts’ threat when Nicholls had to paw away a tricky cross from Bree, but the kind of chance that might tilt the balance in either direction remained elusive. That remained the case, although Huddersfield stayed broadly on top and almost scented a winner when Reece Burke got in the way of Lewis O’Brien’s shot. For Luton, the miracle is still on.",Sport/Football,Luton’s Wembley dream alive as Sonny Bradley secures draw with Huddersfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/lutons-wembley-dream-alive-as-sonny-bradley-secures-draw-with-huddersfield
5/14/2022,"Pro-choice demonstrators continue to turn up outside the homes of supreme court justices, with the latest target being conservative Amy Coney Barrett, who signed on to a majority draft opinion that was leaked to reveal an intention to overturn the constitutional right to seek an abortion in the US. “The right to your own body – to do what you want with your own body – is the most personal freedom you can have,” one protester said from among a group wearing long red “handmaid” capes and white bonnets earlier this week to symbolize forced childbearing, as members of the Virginia state police watched nearby. Handmaid's Tale is at Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s home. pic.twitter.com/mCQrrgo4Lt Several organizations, led by Planned Parenthood and the Women’s March, are preparing for a nationwide day of pro-choice marches on Saturday. Protests have been occurring intermittently since the 2 May leak of the draft opinion that sent shockwaves across America by indicating five of the nine justices favor overturning the landmark supreme court decision in Roe v Wade that paved the way for legal abortion across the US in 1973. Protesters have so far gathered outside the residences in the Washington DC area of Samuel Alito, who wrote the scorching draft opinion, and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as Barrett and the chief justice, John Roberts, who did not sign on to the draft opinion, unlike the other three and Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. The court’s final decision on Roe, which is wrapped up in a pivotal Mississippi case before the court, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, is expected next month. Meanwhile Republican lawmakers are urging Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, to employ a 72-year-old federal law that outlaws demonstrating outside judges’ residences. The protests, both outside the justices’ houses and outside the supreme court, have been peaceful, with no known arrests, although new barriers have been erected to block off the sweeping marble steps and columns of the supreme court building. But there is a growing fear from pro-choice activists that women seeking abortion or even using abortion medication, and medical professionals, could be criminally charged if Roe is struck down and individual states can choose to ban the procedure. On Wednesday, Garland’s office issued a statement saying: “Attorney General Garland continues to be briefed on security matters related to the supreme court and supreme court justices. “The attorney general directed the US marshals service to help ensure the justices’ safety by providing additional support to the marshal of the supreme court and supreme court police.” It is against the law in Virginia to picket in residential areas. A source in the office of Virginia’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, advised the Guardian that they are doing “all they can” to provide security. Fairfax police sent a statement saying: “Our civil disturbance unit (CDU) is trained to handle crowds that gather to express their views and are well versed on the laws that govern these planned gatherings. Our officers work to provide a safe space for individuals to exercise first amendment rights and also maintain community safety.” On Friday morning pro-choice House Democrats held a rally in Washington after the US Senate on Wednesday failed to pass legislation that would codify the rights provided by the landmark Roe case. “People should continue to exercise their rights within the first amendment,” the House Democratic caucus chair, Hakeem Jeffries, told the Guardian when asked about activists protesting at the homes of members of the supreme court bench.",News/US news,Protesters rally outside US supreme court justices’ homes ahead of pro-choice marches,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/13/us-abortion-protests-pro-choice-marches
5/14/2022,"It’s hard to predict arrival times on any long road trip, especially when you are not sure of the destination or the conditions along the road ahead. In a pandemic we know that the journey is shaped by a dynamic interplay between the virus, human host and environment, and that generates unpredictability. Not good news when the coronavirus has already subjected us to two years of uncertainty, but we are making progress towards emerging from the official pandemic period. A pandemic is declared when a new human pathogen appears, or with an unexpected rise in the spread or severity of an existing disease that crosses international borders. We can no longer say that waves of Sars-CoV-2 infections are unexpected after two years of global transmission and four major waves, but the other important aspect of calling a pandemic is that it signals the need for global cooperation and resource mobilisation. It is this that keeps us in pandemic mode with some countries still straining to access vaccines, control waves, or manage the burden on health systems or the impacts of strict control measures. Eradicating a new human pathogen is the holy grail, but that was always a very long shot for a coronavirus – we knew we would be lucky to create a vaccine that could mitigate the impact of the virus. The virus has now also moved into animal reservoirs, taking eradication off the table. Whilst the virus has evolved, so have we. Vaccine and infection induced immunity, along with our environmental and behavioural changes, have curbed the disease potential of this coronavirus, and higher rates of infection no longer risk overwhelming our health systems in most parts of the world. Our progress down this path has only been possible because of the vaccines, with high uptake in Australia. This, together with new monoclonal antibody and antiviral treatments, help keep most infections out of hospital and allow us to provide optimal care to those that do end up there. The risk of ending up in ICU if you have an infection is now substantially lower than it was in any other time in the pandemic, but of course more people have infections now that community transmission is Australia-wide. We have just under half the number of people with Covid infections in ICU now (133) as we did in October last year (300), even though on average we have over 40,000 new cases reported each day, compared with 2,750 new cases a day in 2021. This equates to a 33-fold reduction in the ICU rate among reported infections in just six months. Rising vaccination rates over this period is the most impactful prevention measure. Another shift is in the dominant variants, with Omicron often described as “milder”. However, Omicron is as virulent as early variants, with the lower hospitalisation rate among infections down to immunity and treatments preventing disease escalation, and a study in the US released last week found Omicron to be just as virulent as all previous variants when patient characteristics and vaccination status were taken into account. Omicron being “mild” may therefore be less about the virus and more about our success in managing this virus. With Omicron’s arrival and the easing of restrictions, Australia has amongst the highest “reported infection” rates per capital in the world, sitting just behind New Zealand. However, if you look at hospitalisation rates or deaths per capita, we are well down the list. Take the UK, for example. They are further through their BA2 wave, reporting a case rate that is 10% of ours, yet twice the hospitalisation rate. This tells us that it is not possible to directly compare infection rates as some wind down their testing programs. We are in fact likely to have half the infection rate of the UK today. But Australia’s infection rates are still 15 times higher than with Delta, and even with a smaller proportion of infections ending up in hospital from their infection, the sheer number of cases still translates to higher death counts than we have seen previously. There is an urgent need to understand more about who is becoming severely ill, and whether this may have been avoidable. The booster doses have been critical for rebuilding protection from serious disease with Omicron, and Israeli data show that this protection is sustained beyond six months. GPs can now prescribe antivirals, making these readily available to those at risk of severe disease early in their infection. But there may be factors contributing to poor health outcomes that we can address, including delays in diagnosis and missing the critical time window when antivirals can be effective. Infection rates remain high, with a succession of Omicron variants now increasing the risk of reinfection. It is not surprising that subvariants appeared after massive BA.1 and BA.2 waves hit the northern and southern hemispheres simultaneously – every infection increases the chance of seeing a new variant and new infections peaked at over 3.8 million a day globally on 21 January this year where previous waves never reached a million. We are not out of the woods yet as it can take some weeks for a new variant to spread sufficiently to be detected. On the upside, to be successful new variants must be even more transmissible than Omicron, and this reduces the proportion that will pose a threat. I believe we will not know that we have left the pandemic period until after the event, when we have entered a period of greater control of the virus and consistency in variants and our public health responses and, with that, certainty. We are on the way, but in Australia we need to be sure that preventable deaths are addressed before we set expectations for this disease in the transition out of the pandemic period. We must also remember that everything we each do to avoid getting the virus, or passing it on, helps us make that transition sooner.

5/14/2022,"A Catholic order made the “unthinkable” decision to appoint a known child abuser as the principal of one of its Melbourne schools, allowing him to molest boys in his office unchecked on a “regular basis”, a court has heard. The Marist Brothers are being sued over the abuse of a series of boys at the Immaculate Heart College in Preston in the 1980s by Gregory Vincent Coffey, the school’s first lay principal and a former Catholic brother. The Marist Brothers are defending the case, disputing the extent of the order’s knowledge about Coffey prior to his appointment. On Friday the Victorian supreme court heard shocking allegations about the extent of the order’s knowledge of Coffey’s abuse of children before employing him, first as a teacher in the early 1970s and then as principal in 1980. Coffey, now dead, began working as a lay teacher at Immaculate Heart in 1972, arriving just weeks after pleading guilty to abusing a boy as a Catholic brother with the Salesians at a school in Port Pirie, South Australia, which resulted in a conviction and a two-year suspended prison sentence. The highest ranks of the Salesians knew of his conviction, the court heard, with the acting head of the order giving evidence in criminal proceedings on Coffey’s behalf, while the order also knew of other complaints about his abuse of boys at Rupertswood, another Salesian school in Sunbury, Victoria. The Marist Brothers also knew “enough about him to know he was a risk around young children” when they first employed Coffey as a teacher in 1972, the court heard. Before being sentenced in 1972, Coffey himself told a psychiatrist that the Marist order “knew about” the Port Pirie abuse when it employed him. “There is no evidence about [the Marist Brothers] doing anything whatsoever in relation to that,” David Campbell SC, acting on behalf of two abused boys, told the court. Eight years later, the Marist Brothers promoted Coffey to principal. “To elevate him [to] status of principal later on … was just something that was unthinkable,” Campbell said. “Because then he was the supervisor, not the supervised.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app One of the Catholic brothers who provided a “glowing reference” supporting Coffey’s application for school principal had directly received complaints from boys abused by him, the court heard. The reference was “no doubt instrumental” in him getting the job, the court heard. Once in the office, Coffey used his authority to facilitate his abuse of children without scrutiny, the court was told. He constructed an extra door to his office, allowing the children he brought in to leave unseen without having to pass an administrative office. “Many of them have given accounts of being distressed, crying, when they left that office, so that this device meant no-one was able to assess the fact that there were distressed children leaving his office on a regular basis.” “Of course, that is a circumstance that could have come about by someone who was put in a position of absolute authority.” The trial involves two plaintiffs, both represented by Ken Cush and Associates, who were abused by Coffey as boys. The court on Friday heard harrowing evidence about the abuse of one of the plaintiffs who was repeatedly called into the principal’s office as a prepubescent boy. On the first occasion, he was asked explicit questions and beaten with a metal ruler when he could not provide answers. On the second, he was made to expose himself to Coffey while crying in distress. Coffey allegedly said to him: “Wipe your eyes and go back to class.” The abuse continued over multiple years until the boy, unable to bear any more, refused. “He said, ‘No, I’m not dropping my pants’,” Campbell told the court. “Coffey then says, ‘Well, if you don’t do what I tell you, you’re going to be expelled and you’ll get in big trouble from your parents’.” “So the plaintiff reacted … it’s a shame he missed, but he threw a tape dispenser at him and told him in no uncertain terms – his words not mine – ‘fuck off’.” The court heard the abuse devastated the boy’s life. He “went off the rails” and began using drugs and alcohol, getting into fights and struggling at school. The abuse fractured his life with his family, the court heard, and he soon moved away and took up long-haul truck driving so he could be alone. The court heard his mother often asked: “What did I ever do so wrong as to lose my happy boy?” The trial continues before justice Jacinta Forbes.",News/Australia news,"Marist Brothers appointed known child abuser as principal of Melbourne school in 1980, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/marist-brothers-appointed-known-child-abuser-as-principal-of-melbourne-school-in-1980-court-told
5/14/2022,"Leo Williams sits on his esky having a smoke by the side of the road. His gumboots are covered in mud that has spattered up on to his hands and face and is starting to cake. His boss, Noel Elliott, slinks down next to him up against an empty weatherboard building near the centre of Gladstone in central Queensland, where they’re doing some work on the drain. It’s the Labour Day public holiday in Queensland. The crew have been here since the early morning, trying to get their job done while there’s no traffic in the city centre. “Blokes working on Labour Day, that says a bit doesn’t it!” says Williams, to explain why he’s a lifelong Labor voter. Elliott says he has been a swinging voter in recent years but will support the Liberal National party this time. “We’re on different teams,” he says of the group of workmates. “There’s a lot of [blue-collar] workers around here. A lot of the small businesses are struggling. There’s a lot of empty shops. “Everybody’s down on Morrison at the moment but it hasn’t been really a fair time for him because of the Covid and that sort of stuff.” The third member of their crew, Brian O’Shea, rips crumbs from his sandwich and tosses them to a peewee on the footpath. He reckons the bird would do a better job than either Scott Morrison or Anthony Albanese. “I just vote so I don’t get fined, mate,” he says. As the Gladstone Labour Day march moves past the vacant office of the retiring Liberal National MP Ken O’Dowd, one of the CFMEU members raises a middle finger and screws his face up in defiance. Gladstone is the largest population centre in the electorate, and home to about a third of its enrolled voters. This part of the seat is blue-collar Labor heartland, but these are also some of the folks whose shift away from Labor – amid a fraught debate about coal and climate change – became a defining story of the 2019 election. At Gladstone’s largest booth, the two-party swing to the LNP was more than 10%. Paul Higgins, a manufacturing worker, says he thinks the energy transition is “an inevitable thing”. “I think the biggest fear is that people are going to lose jobs straight away,” he says. His mate, fellow Manufacturing Workers’ Union member Adam Hamilton says: “I’m a little bit more sceptical. I think there’s still a place for coal and there needs to be a balance in the transition. “Sometimes I think we try to rush this, the new clean energy and all of that sort of stuff instead of slowly transitioning.” Flynn was one of the country’s most marginal seats before the 2019 election, but is now held by the LNP by about 8%. The state member for Callide, Colin Boyce, is running for the LNP in place of O’Dowd. Labor has chosen the popular Gladstone mayor, Matt Burnett. One Nation polled almost 20% of the primary vote in 2019, but Pauline Hanson’s party has previously endorsed Boyce and declined to campaign against him. The LNP candidate has been a vocal supporter of the coal industry and said during the campaign that the Coalition’s net-zero commitment was a flexible, non-binding plan that leaves plenty of “wiggle room”. Burnett tells the May Day rally he supports the coal industry, but that the LNP wants to “fight this on coal [alone]”. “We want to fight this on everything. “Even if you can’t put us first,” he told the crowd of unionists, “you’ve got to put us above the LNP, because we’ve got to get rid of Morrison.” Emma Smith, a teacher from Boyne Island near Gladstone, says she is voting for the Greens and that real-world concerns of regional communities – such as inequality, healthcare, housing and education – have become obscured by phoney city v regions debates. “I get it, sometimes we feel like a poor cousin to Brisbane. But I get a bit annoyed that politicians often like to say we don’t care about the same things as city people. Of course we do,” Smith says. “We’d just like a plan. We’d like [politicians] to be upfront, acknowledge that changes are going to come, and say ‘Here’s what we think about how we’re going to tackle them’, rather than just saying that coalmines are going to be open forever.” The seat of Flynn covers 132,824km of central Queensland – in country that takes in broad-acre farms, coal-seam gas drilling and unionised towns at the southern end of the Queensland coalfields. About an hour’s drive to the west of Gladstone, Cassandra Sorensen and Tamara Francis are having breakfast at a cafe in Biloela town centre. Cass says they don’t have too long to talk, she’s about to drive to Rockhampton “to hear Craig Kelly speak”. “This is one of the most important elections I can remember, and I think the United Australia party are aligning with my values,” Sorensen says. “My whole family are union delegates, Labor voters, and there’s no way in hell I’ll vote for them again. “There’s a lot of National party stalwarts around here who say there’s no way they’ll get their vote this time, too.” Francis says she’s always been a Liberal and National voter, but she’s “had enough of both the major parties”. Next door, barber Steve Bates has a chat about his signed picture of Melbourne gangster Mark “Chopper” Read. He’s also likely to vote for one of the minor parties. “The [major parties] keep saying they’re going to do everything for us, but they won’t, they don’t.” Albanese or Morrison? “I don’t like either of them to be honest. I don’t think major parties are going to get what we need until they lose multiple seats. It’s been the same for too long now.” Biloela is an agricultural hub and home to the Callide coal-fired power station. The town might be better known to outsiders as the conservative community that embraced – and fought for – the Murugappan family of Tamil asylum seekers. Sorensen says many UAP and other minor party voters also support the family. Angela Fredericks, a local psychologist who has helped lead the campaign to bring them home, says the issue has brought many of the town’s National voters to reconsider. Labor’s promise to bring them home could have an impact. “I was a long-time LNP supporter, family background LNP, and last election was the first election I voted Labor, purely on this issue,” she says. “I know multiple other people who, since the last election, will change their voting preferences, too.” Even the back roads, like the one from Banana to Baralaba, are plastered with election signs. The billboards attempt to sell farming equipment, roadside motels and political candidates to weary travellers. Barry Tucker drives his prehistoric tractor down the main road through Baralaba, population 317, to a mechanic’s workshop on Stopford Street. Tucker has lived here for 60 years. He worked in a coalmine straight out of high school. He says many locals are opposed to plans for a new coalmine nearby, and they’re growing frustrated at the impacts of coal dust from the existing one. “I was pretty strong for Labor, but since I’ve retired I’ve got different views on things,” says Tucker. “I don’t reckon Labor is for the worker any more. From what I can gather with Albanese, he’s nowhere near it. “And Morrison … have you seen that ad on TV, the one ‘That’s not my job?’ Well he’s got the dollars mate, so whose job is it?” Another few hours along the Capricorn Highway, in the town centre at Emerald, Jeanette Bunting and Nancy Daniels are opening their post boxes and having a chuckle at the Liberal National party’s flyers. Both will vote for the LNP. “For my money I would hate to see a change in government,” Bunting says. “You need to have a great amount of expertise to do the work that needs to be done at the moment. I think the worst thing that could happen would be a hung parliament.” Tish Ryder, who runs an engineering mechanical business in Emerald, says she’s leaning towards the United Australia party. “I am a conservative … and I feel the [LNP] has moved more towards the left with net zero, they’ve lost me. They’re not truly representing their electorates,” she says. “People are getting annoyed with that usual election cycle, politicians come out of the woodwork and … we’ve heard it all before. They’ll say we’re going to fix the hospital. Well, we keep hearing that every time.”",News/Australia news,Coal not the only burning issue in Queensland’s blue collar seat of Flynn,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/coal-not-the-only-burning-issue-in-queenslands-blue-collar-seat-of-flynn
5/14/2022,"A record number of Australians are voting early in the 2022 federal election, with many saying they’re “sick” of the drawn-out election campaign and want to avoid expected queues on 21 May. Some 314,095 Australians cast their ballots on the first day of early voting this year, almost three times the 120,000 people that voted on day one of pre-poll in 2019. As of Friday more than 1.2 million of the 17 million Australians registered to vote had already pre-polled after just four days of early voting. The safe Nationals-held seat of Hinkler topped the list, with 18,060 early voters, followed by the marginal seats of Gilmore (16,902), Paterson (16,271) and Richmond (15,111), according to data released by the Australian Electoral Commission. At an early polling centre at Sydney University, one man said he was casting his ballot because he “just wants to get it over with”. “People are sick of it,” he said of the six-week election campaign. Another group of three were voting early for accessibility reasons. Older and living with disability, one woman said: “We can’t stand in lines all day.” Three others said they were voting early to avoid the crowds. “I don’t want to be part of record numbers standing in queues,” one person said, while another said they’re avoiding a potential Covid super-spreading event. “There’s going to be a lot of people during the day. I’m not willing to stand in line for an hour and a half, or two, or three or four and possibly get Covid,” they said. In the marginal western Sydney seat of Reid, early voters said they were either avoiding the queue, or would be working on 21 May, but a couple said they had better things to do on election day. “Well, we go up to Queensland every winter, in the caravan, so the election came at an inconvenient time for us,” one of them said. Some said they had arrived at pre-polling to avoid the potential Covid risks that could come with the large crowds expected on election day. “Three reasons: to avoid any Covid risks, because pre-polling is quicker and because it is simpler,” said Gavin, who did not want to share his last name. There has been a steady increase in early voting over the past few federal elections. In 2019, early votes including pre-poll and postal votes constituted 40% of all ballots cast. That compared with 31% in 2016 and 26.4% in 2013. In 2021, the parliament passed legislation limiting the pre-polling period to 12 days before the election to balance the “opportunity to participate in an election as a voter with the logistic demands placed on those who participate as contestants”. Nevertheless, the AEC said if trends continued, up to half of all votes may be cast prior to election day this year at the nations’s 550 early voting centres. The electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, said Covid precautions, including socially distanced queueing, capacity limits and sanitising, would undoubtedly slow the election process but the AEC worked hard to minimise queues for voters “as much as possible”. “The fact is that when you run an in-person process to the scale of a federal election where people effectively choose when and where they attend, and then you add Covid safety on top, you simply cannot prevent all queues,” he said. “Australian elections are in-person, community events held once every three years and built around election day, so if you can vote on election day then that’s what you should do.” For some, the reasons for pre-polling were more logistical.

Work, a lack of time and pre-planned medical procedures were also listed by early voters. One couple were on holiday from Brisbane and said they “may as well”. Another man said he’d cast an early ballot every election, however this year he was particularly keen to bid the campaign adieu. “I live in the Blue Mountains, and I pre-vote every year because on polling day there it takes much longer, sometimes all day,” he said. “And I want to get it over and done with. I’m sick of seeing it, I now just ignore everything. I don’t like it.”",News/Australia news,‘Sick of it’: why so many Australians are voting early this election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/sick-of-it-why-so-many-australians-are-voting-early-this-election
5/14/2022,"The Coalition, Labor and the Greens (plus the wave of independents) are getting most of the headlines in this election. But your ballot papers will also be full of candidates representing parties you might not know much – or anything – about. From the big-spender ads of the United Australia party and the re-election desires of One Nation, to a bunch of micro-parties representing niche interests, Australia’s democracy and elections are a rich tapestry – and it takes all types to make a campaign. Here’s a quick rundown of these lesser-known parties and what they stand for. Animal Justice party: with representatives in NSW and Victoria’s state parliaments, the party says it wants “to give a political voice to animals”, including promoting animal protection and “animal-friendly policies”. They campaign for increased penalties for animal abuse, animal trade, and supporting sustainable and ethical practices. Running in: the Senate in all states besides Northern Territory, as well as lower house seats in most states. Australian Values: led by the former special forces soldier Heston Russell, the party says it aims to “bring balance into the Centre” of politics. AVP wants to create an American-style National Guard to assist in emergencies, better support for defence veterans, a review into ABC funding, “greater certification requirements for media organisations and journalists to be permitted their special exemptions under legal legislation”, and “greater consequences” for “negligent” media reporting. Running in: the Senate in Queensland, NSW, WA and Victoria, and several lower house seats in Victoria and Queensland. Australian Christians: the party wants to elect “a Christian voice amidst the voices in Parliament”. It wants to see marriage as only between a man and woman, “zero tolerance” to drugs, and suggests an inquiry into increasing the legal drinking age to 21. It also says the settled scientific view that carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change needs “further scrutiny”, opposes euthanasia, and wants to restrict IVF to married couples. Running in: the Senate, as well as nine lower house seats, in WA only. Australian Citizens party: saying they were “inspired by the policies of old Labor”, the party wants to start a public bank at post offices, repeal the prohibition on nuclear power, wants a “dramatic” increase to health resourcing and a moratorium on house and farm foreclosures. Running in: the Senate in Queensland, Victoria, SA, WA and NSW. Australian Democrats: Once a major player in the Senate, the party’s presence has faded significantly since it was formed by the former Liberal politician Don Chipp. In the small-l liberal tradition, it pursues broadly centrist economic policies, social liberalism and puts an emphasis on political accountability. Running in: the Senate in SA, NSW, Victoria Derryn Hinch’s Justice party: named after its leader, the former journalist, the Justice Party is calling for reforms to bail, parole, family courts and domestic violence law, campaigning for sentencing to “reflect community views” and “more jail, less bail”. Running in: the Senate and several lower house seats in Victoria Drew Pavlou Democratic Alliance: named for the anti-Communist party activist, the party wants to “stand up to China”, support Hong Kong, Uyghur and Tibetan communities and repeal Australia’s free trade agreement with China. The party also is calling for welfare rates to be raised above the poverty line, and wants to boost renewables and put dental health into Medicare. Running in: NSW, SA and Queensland. Federal Icac Now: the name pretty much sums it up. As the party says, it is “a single-issue party and that issue is anti-corruption”. It wants a national Icac, to limit donations to political parties, real-time disclosure of donations, and to restrict politicians from being appointed to government positions or commercial businesses connected to their former portfolios. Running in: the Senate in NSW, Queensland and WA. Federation party: the party backs Christian values, opposes late-term abortions and the teaching of “gender fluidity” in schools, and wants to consider “corporal punishment models” to penalise rape and other serious crimes. Running in: the Senate and lower house seats in Victoria, WA, SA, Queensland and NSW. Fusion: a “fusion” of the Science, Pirate, Secular, Vote Planet and Climate Change Justice parties. Its policies include a 10-year transition to negative emissions, a carbon price, 800% renewables, high speed rail, and a $500 weekly universal basic income. Running in: NSW, Queensland, SA, Victoria and WA in the House and Senate Great Australian party: led by the controversial former One Nation senator Rod Culleton. GAP backs “mandatory” jail for violent crimes and boot camps for juvenile offenders, would relax firearm laws, has policies for a “concealed carry licence”, and would abolish income tax and remove compulsory superannuation. Running in: the lower house and Senate in WA, Queensland, NSW, Victoria, SA, NT. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Indigenous-Aboriginal Party: the party is calling for the protection of rivers and better water management, an end to detention for Indigenous children and ending adult incarceration “except for the most serious offences”, and replacing fines with community service. Running in: NSW and Queensland. Informed Medical Options: Imop campaigns for people’s right to refuse or choose medical products and procedures like Covid vaccines, including advocating the removal of No Jab No Play and vaccine mandates. It also wants to remove fluoride from drinking water, promote alternative therapies, legalise medical cannabis nationwide and pause the rollout of 5G technology. Running in: ACT, NSW, Queensland, SA, Tasmania, Victoria and WA. Jacqui Lambie network: the Tasmanian senator wants to get more supporters in parliament. She wants to lower donation caps and introduce real-time disclosure, boost local manufacturing and start an inquiry into Chinese foreign interference. Running in: Tasmania Katter’s Australia Party: Bob Katter’s organisation wants to lower power prices, relax firearms and crocodile culling laws, have an opt-out scheme for organ donation, increase access to vaping products and boost north Queensland infrastructure such as roads and rail. Running in: Queensland Kim for Canberra: With some financial support from Climate 200, law academic Kim Rubenstein is campaigning on climate, integrity and a federal Icac, women’s safety and a First Nations voice to parliament. Running in: you guessed it, the ACT Legalise Cannabis: unsurprisingly, the party wants to legalise, tax and regulate weed. It wants a moratorium on arresting users and to expunge historical sentences for personal use, as well as to allow people to grow cannabis at home. Running in: all states and territories. Liberal Democrats: still running under their original name (despite a high court challenge), the libertarian party’s run is being headlined by the former Liberals Campbell Newman and John Ruddick. Calling for smaller government and low taxes, the Liberal Democrats want to institute American-style “recall elections”, wind back Covid and mask rules, immediately cut all government departments and politicians’ pay by 10%, and a flat tax of 20% for all. Running in: all states and territories. Local party: focusing on candidates who are “independent local leaders who are already contributing to their neighbourhoods”, this party has a larger focus on Tasmania-specific issues such as salmon farming, the state’s energy mix, and further restrictions on poker machines. It also advocates for “citizens’ juries”, or the process of deliberative democracy, to decide contentious issues. Running in: Tasmania and SA. TNL: formerly known as the New Liberals, TNL advocates for net zero emissions by 2030, a retrospective federal Icac, a legislated charter of rights, boosting foreign aid, new lyrics for the national anthem, restricting mass political advertising, real-time political donation disclosure, and restricting politicians to serving only 12 years in parliament. Running in: Queensland, NSW, Victoria and SA. Pauline Hanson’s One Nation: looking to hold Hanson’s Senate seat in Queensland, One Nation wants to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and Paris climate agreement, boost government subsidies to apprentices, block sale of property to non-citizens, and place further restrictions on abortion. Running in: all states and territories. Progressives: the fledgling party says it aims to end poverty, homelessness and the climate emergency, and dismantle corruption. It wants an emissions trading scheme and a federal Icac. Running in: Victoria, ACT, Queensland, SA Reason Australia: a centrist party, Reason seeks to decriminalise all drugs and legalise cannabis, promotes comprehensive sex education in schools and supports more progressive policies on Indigenous Australians, women, the LGBTIQ community and immigration. Running in: Victoria, NSW, Queensland. Rex Patrick team: led by the sitting senator and former Centre Alliance member, Patrick is campaigning on greater transparency and accountability in government and addressing foreign interference. He also has numerous South Australia-specific policies such as boosting manufacturing jobs and the submarine industry, as well as protecting the Murray-Darling. Running in: SA Shooters, Fishers and Farmers: they want greater scrutiny on foreign land purchases, the expansion of the live export trade, reduced restrictions on “law-abiding firearms owners”, to implement a bill of rights and to expand private game reserves and hunting areas. Running in: NSW Seniors United: pushing for policies to benefit retirees and pensioners, the party wants reforms for dementia and palliative care, simpler rules around aged care and a public TV channel for seniors. They also want more staff and money for aged care, expansion of the veteran’s “gold card” and more support for army veterans. Running in: NSW and WA Socialist Alliance: promoting “revolutionary change”, the party is campaigning for equality and against gas mining. They want to repeal the GST and the stage 3 tax cuts, raise company tax and a new “wealth” tax, nationalise mines and banks, go to 100% renewables within 10 years, more progressive policies on refugees and asylum seekers, and to abolish Asio and other spy agencies. Running in: NSW, Queensland, Victoria and WA Sustainable Australia party: the party is campaigning to stop overdevelopment and corruption and to protect the environment. SAP wants free university for all, a ban on all new coal mines and fracking, a ban on further foreign ownership, a national job guarantee program for full employment and a universal age pension. Running in: all states and territories. United Australia party: Clive Palmer’s pet project is blanketing the country with ads about low interest rates, abolishing Hecs debts and ending a range of anti-Covid measures such as masks and vaccine mandates. UAP also want to increase the age pension, enact more generous rules for mining and freeze fuel excises. Running in: all states and territories Victorian Socialists: running on a similar “revolutionary” platform to the national Socialist Alliance – including scrapping the GST and increasing taxation on the rich and corporations, lifting welfare payments to at least $1,500 a fortnight and nationalising the banks – the party also calls for governments to pursue a long-term Covid elimination strategy. Running in: Victoria Western Australia party: a “centre-based” party, it spruiks policies focused on WA, including basing more federal government workers and public spending in the state. It also wants to abolish political donations from property developers, reform stamp duty and property taxes, and direct more mining royalties to regional WA.

5/14/2022,"The increasing number of credible campaigns from independents in the federal election is making for some intriguing contests, and in some seats may raise questions for voters about where to place their preferences, as well as their primary vote. The role of preferences in Australia’s election may at times seem complicated, but what voters need to consider is really quite simple (in the lower house, at least). On election night, votes are tallied up according to the first preference, or primary vote. Once all the votes have been counted, preferences are distributed. The candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated, and their votes are distributed to the next preference, and so on until only two candidates remain. In most cases it is clear on election night who those two candidates will be, so a special count is conducted just between these two candidates, without having to wait for all the votes to be counted before a full distribution of preferences. But in some races the identity of the top two candidates is not clear – in particular where there is a close contest for second place. These races are becoming more common as more independent and minor party candidates mount serious challenges. They are likely to cause delays in calling races, as some seats will require a full count before we know which candidates will make the final two. In some seats, the order of elimination can determine whether the second-placed candidate gains enough preferences to catch the leading candidate, and thus can change the ultimate outcome. This sometimes happens when Labor and the Greens are competing for second place and attempting to chase down a leading Coalition candidate. Labor voters tend to give their preferences to a Greens candidate, and Greens voters to Labor, at very high and even rates. At the 2019 election Labor polled 25.4% of primary votes in the Victorian seat of Higgins, to the Greens’ 22.5%. Similarly in the seat of Brisbane, Labor won 24.5% to the Greens’ 22.4%. In this kind of seat, whichever party comes second will normally have a roughly equal chance of beating the Coalition candidate (in both cases they failed to do so in 2019). But there are also races where the preference flows are not symmetrical. This is most common when there is an independent competing with a Labor candidate, both vying to make it to the final count against a Coalition candidate. A recent example was in the seat of Warringah in 2019, where the independent candidate Zali Steggall won 57.2% of the two-candidate-preferred count against Tony Abbott. The Australian Electoral Commission also conducted a count between the Liberal and Labor candidates, with the Labor candidate receiving just 47.9%. That means 9.3% of voters in Warringah preferred Steggall over Abbott, but preferred Abbott over Labor. In this case it didn’t matter, because Steggall had no trouble making the final two (in fact she topped the primary vote count), but in a closer race those voters could make a difference. The charts below show a simplified example. There are three candidates, and the vote splits 41%-30%-29%. Candidate 1 is the clear leader, but the other two candidates’ preferences tend to favour each other over Candidate 1. In the first case, Candidate 2 comes second, and Candidate 3’s preferences decide the outcome. While Candidate 3 voters do favour Candidate 2, they don’t do so overwhelmingly, and Candidate 1 wins narrowly. But in the second case, Candidate 3 comes second, and Candidate 2’s preferences flow overwhelmingly towards them, allowing them to narrowly defeat Candidate 1. If you knew this was how the primary votes would fall, and your goal was to defeat Candidate 1, you would want to vote for Candidate 3 in the first instance. But it’s also worth noting that in the first scenario, Candidate 2 comes within 2% of winning. They are not an unelectable candidate, and might have won in slightly different circumstances. If Candidate 2 is the one you really want to win, do you sacrifice their chance to try to ensure defeat for your least favoured candidate? Some have called for voters to consider casting a strategic vote in this way. I think voters should instead stick to a principled vote: number your ballot paper in the order of your genuine preference. To continue with the example of two chasing candidates competing to defeat a leading candidate: there will be seats where one candidate is well clear of the other and isn’t troubled by the order of elimination (like Warringah in 2019). There will be other seats where both candidates are strong enough to beat the leader on preferences, so a vote for either will achieve that outcome. There may be races where the two candidates are in a close race for second place and only one will receive a strong enough flow of preferences to go on to win. And there may even be seats where there are more than three plausible contenders for the final two spots (Hughes in Sydney may be among those at this election). How do you know which scenario may play out in your seat? You don’t, I don’t. I could make a list of seats that I think fall into each category, but I’m sure I would get some wrong. None of us have a crystal ball, and seat-level opinion polling is not accurate enough to be confident. I expect many people who previously voted Labor or Greens in conservative electorates will switch and vote for a viable independent, either because they prefer that candidate or would like to vote for someone they think can win. But voters should not feel pressured to switch from their preferred candidate because of a possible outcome which is quite unlikely, particularly if their preferred candidate has a genuine chance of winning. We are lucky to live in a country where voters don’t have to weigh up which candidates are likely to win when deciding how they vote, as they do in the UK. Unintended outcomes can happen, but are rare enough and unpredictable enough not to change the advice I would give every voter: number the boxes in the order that you genuinely prefer.",News/Australia news,Election preferences: do you need to think strategically before voting in the lower house?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/election-preferences-do-you-need-to-think-strategically-before-voting-in-the-lower-house
5/14/2022,"Blink and you might miss it – the latest international sporting event heading to these shores. Such is the rate at which major tournaments are being announced, it is hard to stay up to date. This week not one but two major tournaments were confirmed, with rugby union’s governing body officially rubber stamping Australia as host of the 2027 men’s World Cup and 2029 women’s World Cup. These are just the latest additions to what is shaping up as a golden decade on the Australian sporting calendar. In August, Australian and American swimmers will face off in the “duel in the pool” in Sydney – the return of an event that saw its heyday in the 2000s. In September, Australia will host the UCI Road World Championships, with the world’s best cyclists racing on the scenic roads around Wollongong. At the same time, Sydney is set to host the basketball women’s World Cup. Soon after the men’s cricket T20 World Cup will begin, after a two-year pandemic-induced postponement. These three major events are just the beginning. The Fifa Women’s World Cup in mid-2023, co-hosted with New Zealand, will be the biggest international sporting event of the year. It will build on a hugely successful last edition in France in 2019 and cement the Matildas’ status as one of the country’s favourite national teams. Then comes the Commonwealth Games in 2026, spread across regional Victoria, the Netball World Cup in 2027 in Sydney, the two Rugby World Cups, and a host of other major events (including world championships for BMX and canoe slalom, and the British and Irish Lions Tour). No doubt more will be added. It all builds towards the main event: the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics, in Queensland, the third time in history that Australia has hosted the crown jewel on the global sporting calendar. In attracting these major tournaments, Australia has many natural advantages: a relatively wealthy, sports-loving population, high-quality infrastructure, commercial interest and plenty of government support. But it remains remarkable that so many high-profile events have been persuaded down under in such a short space of time, particularly given the disadvantages posted by our time zone (disliked by American broadcasters) and the parochial local sporting codes (who are not keen on sharing stadia). The decade ahead, then, will be unprecedented for Australia, a parade of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Let’s not waste it. Because despite appearances, not all is well in Australian sport. At a participation level, sport is expensive – and rapidly becoming out of reach for some families, particularly as the cost of living rises. Recent data from AusPlay, an arm of government agency Sport Australia, found that the average cost of participation sport in almost $1,000 per year. 20% of children surveyed who didn’t participate in sport identified the cost as the primary barrier. Earlier Sport Australia research found a major gulf in child sporting participation between low-income and high-income families. While the pandemic has interrupted many sporting seasons, making year-on-year comparison of participation data unreliable, a survey by the Australian Sports Foundation (ASF) found that 43% of polled sports club had seen a decrease in participation numbers, and a similar decline in volunteering. On average, Australians are less active, and more overweight, than we once were. Each year the federal government spends about a quarter of a billion dollars on elite sport. Depending on who you ask, this is either too much or not enough. While that perennial debate will never be settled – and Australia’s equal best-ever showing at the Olympics last year suggests the funding is being well-spent – structural change is needed. The funding model is transitioning from year-on-year to more sustainable, longer-term funding, but that remains a work in progress. At the grass roots level, money is a major problem, made worse by the Covid-19 interruptions. The ASF’s research found that that 9,000 sporting clubs across Australia were at risk of insolvency. The future of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), established in the early 1980s and the source of many medals over the decades, is unclear; with its facilities ageing, it requires a major funding boost, a relocation (a move to Queensland to coincide with 2032 has been mooted) or a new approach entirely. The crumbling infrastructure at the AIS’s leafy campus in Canberra is a poignant, if not entirely accurate, metaphor for the flagship program’s uncertain outlook. Australian sport also has much work to do on ensuring safe, supportive environments and diversity among participants, athletes and leadership. Allegations of mistreatment in sport, contemporary and historic, and at all levels, are sadly all too commonplace. It is hard to think of an Australian sport that has not been rocked by allegations of sexual harassment, sexism, racism or abuse in recent years. At a senior level, sporting codes remain dominated by men. Despite considerable improvement, money and media coverage in this country is still disproportionately directed at male sport. The golden decade of sport will present Australia with abundant opportunity, with heightened interest and the likelihood of a significant funding injection. If we seize the opportunity, Australian grass roots and high-performance sport can enter the 2030s in a better place. Equally, just as it is possible to blink and miss new hosting announcements right now, so too will the following decade pass quickly, and opportunities be missed, if sporting administrators fail to rise to the challenge. Done well, the sport ecosystem is tightly-integrated and self-sustained. Participation sport is a pipeline for elite sport; medal glory and school visits from Olympians inspire the next generation; money invested in sport ensures active lifestyles and minimises the need for health spending. The golden decade ahead can turbo-charge that ecosystem. But nothing in sport is inevitable.",Sport/Sport,A golden decade on home soil looms for Australian sport – let’s not waste it | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/a-golden-decade-on-home-soil-looms-for-australian-sport-lets-not-waste-it
5/14/2022,"The car was packed lightly as we drove to the ocean. Just towels, water bottles and a couple of buckets and spades. In the back seat, our two girls were fighting over the solitary pair of goggles we had remembered to bring. But we were happy. It was school holidays. We were going to the beach. We arrived and the sky above us was so thick with blue it was as though we could wrap ourselves in it. It had been a long, wet summer. The wettest start to a year ever in Sydney. The children had barely made it to the water all season, but in the lingering afterglow of summer we hoped to grasp a last chance at a swim. The girls ran through the sandy path cutting the bush scrub towards the ocean. Blue water, white water and golden yellow sand. Then I smelled something. Not that fresh salt sting, but something foul. There was something in the air. Something in the water. I called my friends over: something was wrong. Back! Out of the water! we called. The parents have to check something. The children stood barefoot on the sand, already slathered in sunscreen and wearing rashies covered in dinosaurs or flowers, goggles pressing into their foreheads and bouncing as they watched the waves roll ashore. The four adults huddled together, looking at a NSW government water quality website. We zoomed the map in on where we were; red diamonds, red diamonds, red diamonds. All around us the water was polluted. Run-off from the historic, catastrophic floods that had battered the east coast, we suspected. My mother had always told me salt water was a cure for sickness. Sea water could fix rashes, stings – all manner of slings and arrows. It was an Australian cure (even doctors would prescribe sea air and salt water for good health). So clean and good and pure was this water, it could heal. And now, I would tell my own daughters and their friends the opposite: Get out of that water, it could make you sick. ____ We define ourselves as a country by our summers. By the oppression and freedom of the long hot days, by our squinting under the light. Central to that understanding of ourselves as a nation basking in the sun is the role of the beach. It is something beyond our famed surf culture, extending to all of us, even those who might not consider ourselves “beach people”. Conflicts over beaches take on a greater symbolism because we all understand the role of the beach in our national imagination; take our shared horror at proposals to privatise beaches (anti-egalitarian!) or riots over who can access them. The idea of the beach as a place of rest, recreation and health is epitomised in images which have become a form of shorthand for Australia. Max Dupain’s monochromatic Sunbaker, of an anonymous man at rest on the hard sand, or Charles Meere’s Australian beach pattern, featuring a beach crowded with children and adults at play; these are images baked into the national consciousness because, while sanitised, glorified representations of the beach, they reflect something we all know or understand. And nowhere is the beach more entwined with our ideas of a uniquely Australian experience than in childhood. In his memoir, Land’s Edge, Australian author and chronicler of the coastline Tim Winton writes of his suburban upbringing – the sprawling quarter-acre blocks and accoutrements of suburbia. “When I dream, when I remember, when I doze into reverie, I don’t see the picket fences and the Holden in the driveway,” he writes. “Because in my memory of childhood there is always the smell of bubbling tar, of Pinke Zinke, the briny smell of the sea. It is always summer and I am on Scarborough Beach, blinded by light, with my shirt off and my back a map of dried salt and peeling sunburn.” The shocking chill of the first ankle in the ocean. The weightless pull of a wave as we float up and over it, the glorious power of the wave as we dive through it. We know that cleansing, enlivening feeling of trudging out of the shallows of the water, hair slicked back, wet skin catching the breeze as we rub the salt water out of our eyes. Generations of Australians have navigated it, hold it in their memory as something good and theirs. But the memories today’s children are forming of the beach, of summer, are fundamentally different from those of Australian children before them. ____ The first time I took my daughter to the beach, it was early spring 2017. She was about six months old. We sat in a beach tent and stared out at Bondi’s shores. We were not local, but taking her to the ocean for the first time felt like the beginning of a gift. It was as if to say: “Here, you Australian child! Welcome to this refuge, this playground, this beauty. This is now for you.” In the four and a half years since, that gift I thought I was giving her has not materialised. The gift that was my own Australian childhood – schlepping from the dusty suburbs to the refuge of the beach – would not be hers. And while we talk about the losses of climate change as a future threat, we have failed to see what, for this generation of young children, has already been lost – the surefire promise of a beach you can swim in at summer. These have been my daughter’s five summers: Her first was one of heatwaves, and in Sydney some places recorded their hottest days in nearly 100 years. She was still so little, and susceptible to that heat. We spent those days indoors, keeping the heat out. Her second summer included the hottest January on record. Again we shielded. Her third summer was Black Summer. At her daycare, they kept the children inside because the air was no longer safe. We did not go to the beach because the ash from trees burning tens of kilometres away turned the shallow water black. She learned, wrote into her forming brain, that sometimes the air is not safe to breathe. Her fourth summer was defined by Covid. Her fifth summer by extreme, endless rain, unprecedented floods, polluted water and pandemic. There is no normal summer in the memories of multitudes of young Australian children. What to the rest of us has been an aberrant few years has to this generation been their whole life. Of course, yes, we have been to the beach and it has not been polluted. We have made it there when the heat hasn’t been too great, or the weather too wet. There will be in the memories of children today buckets of sand, salt water in their eyes and the delight of white water crashing into their bodies under a blue sky. But there will also be another memory, rotting away at the first. Memories of stinking beaches, black water, red suns. An understanding of these things as the way of summer. There is a classic children’s book, Magic Beach by Alison Lester, which is able to be recited by memory by many Australian children and parents. It interweaves the everyday magic of the beach with the imaginary, an ode to the beach as an endless playground. It begins: “At our beach, at our magic beach we swim in the sparkling sea Surfing and crashing and splashing the waves, shrieking and laughing with glee.” As I watched my girls at the polluted beach, shouting at them to keep out of the water, Lester’s words drummed in my head like a nasty tease. And then it occurred to me with the force of a fist to the stomach that for our children, this is just what can happen at the beach, in the summer. It is not an aberration. It is what they know now.",News/Society,Glorious beach summers are part of the Australian imagination.

5/14/2022,"In July last year, Dominic Perrottet, then the New South Wales treasurer, was asked a pointed question about how the government squared its commitment to addressing problem gambling with its forecasts for increased revenue from poker machines. Given that increases in pokie tax revenue mean increased losses for gamblers, Alliance for Gambling Reform representative Kate da Costa asked at an industry breakfast, must it not reflect “increased harms from gambling from financial stress, family relationship damage, mental and physical ill health and worse?”. Perrottet’s response was typical of a politician who relishes the chance to go off script and enter the cut-and-thrust of public debates. Problem gambling, he said, was “one of the worst blights on our country”. So too was the fact “we provide and facilitate an environment where people pour their savings down a pokie machine”. “To the question, it is an annual reminder of the travesty in this area, and it is something that needs to be, to be brave, it’s something that needs to be addressed and I completely understand and agree with the premise of the question,” he said. “It’s something that needs to be addressed and I know that Victor is working closely in that space.” Victor is Victor Dominello, then the state’s liquor and gaming minister. Dominello featured prominently in a report this week in the Nine newspapers, which revealed that senior police had warned the government in December they felt like they were armed with “pool noodles” when it came to fighting sophisticated organised crime rings. The member for Ryde was quoted as telling the meeting the public would be horrified if they knew the extent of organised crime and money laundering across Australia. As the minister responsible for the gaming portfolio, Dominello did more than most to try to address the problem. But six months after he publicly backed him, Perrottet, now the premier, stripped Dominello of the job. At the time of Perrottet’s answer at the breakfast, Dominello had for months been working on plans to address problem gambling while becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of illegal money laundering. After allegations of organised crime inside Crown Resorts’ Melbourne casino were reported by the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in 2019, Dominello had tasked former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin to investigate the company. Bergin’s report confirmed much of the newspaper’s reporting, including evidence of money laundering and links to alleged criminal involvement at Crown, and Dominello began pushing for the introduction of a compulsory gambling debit card. Designed to address problem gambling as well as money laundering, the plan had support from some within the cabinet including, a senior government source told the Guardian, Perrottet himself. Dominello reportedly shored up crossbench support for the proposal, including from the Greens and One Nation in the upper house. But Dominello’s policy idea was fiercely opposed by the key lobby group for clubs and hotels in the state, ClubsNSW, because of revenue hits to the industry during the pandemic. Both a source of political donations and multi-million dollar grant funds, the clubs and hotel sector have substantial sway in the state. In February last year the now-former deputy premier, John Barilaro, wrote an opinion piece in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph saying the proposal was a “massive overreaction” and said the card would “strangle pubs and clubs with red tape”. Barilaro insisted his National party would never support the proposal. The Guardian later reported he had met with ClubsNSW 13 times in eight months during the pandemic. When Dominello declined to attend a ClubsNSW dinner in the NSW Hunter Valley last year, Barilaro went instead. He sent a text message to Dominello in which he called the minister a “deadset dick” for not attending. He wrote: “What about just looking after your stakeholders. Like Clubs NSW.” Of most concern to MPs around the cabinet table was the possibility of the clubs and hotel organisations mounting a marginal seat campaign in the lead-up to next year’s state election. The Perrottet government is already in minority, and the political cost of former premier Mike Baird’s attempt to ban greyhound racing is still fresh in the minds of many MPs. When Barilaro quit parliament at the same time as the former premier, Gladys Berejiklian, Perrottet announced a major reshuffle of his ministry. Among the changes he stripped Dominello – who is also the minister for customer service – of the liquor and gaming portfolio. The office of the state’s gaming regulator was also moved from his ministry cluster. Instead the portfolio was handed to a junior Nationals minister, Kevin Andrews, who has indicated no desire to go ahead with the gambling debit card. Instead the government is trialling a so-called opt-in “digital wallet” favoured by the gambling lobby. The new deputy premier and police minister, Paul Toole, said on Friday that he was “a bit concerned” after reading the story about the organised crime briefing in the Sydney Morning Herald. “We speak with the police commissioner almost weekly. We also talk about what additional resources and what things need to happen there to ensure they have enough support, and the premier is very active to that,” he said. A cashless gambling card may not have been a panacea for money laundering or organised crime, but one has to think it would help. Just as it would in tackling the scourge of addiction, so top of mind for Perrottet last year. The premier’s ideals failed to save Dominello, though, who is not the first person to take on the gambling lobby in NSW and lose.",News/Australia news,"Victor Dominello set out to reform gambling in NSW, but the odds were always against him",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/victor-dominello-set-out-to-reform-gambling-in-nsw-but-the-odds-were-always-against-him
5/14/2022,"We are at that point of the campaign – seven days to go. Both a sprint and an eternity. Not enough time and too much time. Enough time to win and enough time to lose. Campaigns have seasons. We’ve entered the final season of this political cycle, the season where the soft votes firm. Strategists say the contest is much closer than the published polls suggest. I don’t think they are lying, so the way soft voters break will determine the outcome, pushing either party into a win, loss or minority government. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese understand that’s the terrain. Labor has a nose in front but this contest is not yet decided and – given that the combatant who wins this week will win the campaign and, more importantly, the prime ministership – the final few days will be chock full of all the old tricks and tropes, and a few new ones as well. Morrison is running a bit ragged, his gear changes are all pretty obvious. But the prime minister is certainly not thrashing around devoid of purpose. He’s executing his strategy to hold on – a strategy that peaked on Friday when Morrison distanced himself from himself. Not content with throwing down a late-campaign Dr Who regeneration exercise, Peter Dutton then went Back to the Future. In a homage to the Howard era, Peter Dutton decided to reveal (hey, presto) the presence of a Chinese surveillance ship off the west coast that Defence has known about for a week. While Morrison and Dutton have been busy adjusting the campaign frequencies of fear and loathing, Albanese’s confidence on the hustings has been growing. He’s settled into his campaign form sufficiently to show a bit of personality rather than presenting as a blank slate waiting for Morrison to lose. But any catastrophic error over the coming days will end Labor’s hopes – and the party leader knows that. Albanese has spent a whole campaign trying to recover from his brain fade on day one. And given Clive Palmer – the prime vote harvester of Australia’s Covid-disaffected – is recommending preferences to the Coalition in most of the marginal seats that matter, Labor is going to need every primary vote it can muster for insurance against an unpredictable preference distribution. Another loss next Saturday night, after the rout of 2019, will certainly break Labor’s heart and trigger significant generational change in the leadership and shadow ministry, as well as a new round of progressive handwringing. But the Liberal party is also facing two potential disasters: losing the election and losing a significant chunk of moderates in the event next Saturday night delivers a “tealwash” in the party’s progressive metropolitan heartland. Like most politics watchers, I’ve seen the polls indicating that some or all of the seats under challenge will fall to independents on Saturday night, including the jewel in the Liberal crown, Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg’s seat. But insiders believe these contests could break either way. It is possible none of these seats fall. It’s also possible all of them do. If it’s the latter scenario, then the Liberal party will almost certainly have lost the election and a potential progressive leader in Frydenberg. The fear of that eventuality may be sufficient for the voters of Kooyong to rally for the incumbent. But persisting with our wipeout scenario, if this happens (everybody heard the if there I hope) Dutton is in the box seat to become opposition leader. Our scenario then naturally tracks to the reflexive horror of Liberal moderates at the idea of Dutton being their frontman. But I suspect the reality here is more nuanced. Obviously, Dutton is not a positive for the electoral fortunes of any remaining metropolitan moderates south of the Tweed. But private Dutton is different from the political character the Queenslander has spent a career cultivating. I suspect a chunk of the remaining moderates would enter this transition hopeful that Dutton (who, in dealings with colleagues is personable, and is also regarded as a competent minister) would try to use the opportunity of the party leadership to broaden his political identity. The problem with this theory is Dutton would be in opposition, not government. In opposition, the incentives for broadening identity are less pressing. In contemporary times, the Liberal party’s preferred model of opposition has been brutal hyper-partisan weaponisation. If you are young enough to need a prompt to remember those times, this is the party that dumped Malcolm Turnbull in 2009 because he wanted to collaborate with his opponents to settle climate policy. This gesture to the national interest was seen as creating insufficient product differentiation with Labor, so the leader was promptly deemed surplus to requirements. As well as the obvious short-term incentives for Dutton to dig in and play to his caricature rather than broaden and iterate his way to big tent leadership (where moderates would be permitted to do what needs to be done to woo back the rusted-on voters Morrison lost by being Morrison – professional, thirtysomething women being the most important cohort), there is the question of what the Liberal party chooses to learn from any defeat. A defeat bad enough to wipe out metropolitan moderates would strengthen the hand of the internal brains trust that contends the Liberal party must now part company with educated, socially liberal inner city-dwelling progressives, and fully execute the political realignment it has been lining up for 30 years. That realignment would see the party’s base become, exclusively rather than selectively, outer-suburban and regional voters, leaving the progressive city “wets” to the Labor party or to some new political force that grows from the teal independents. This post-election pivot is far from hypothetical. We’ve seen the Republicans in the US execute a similar structural shift – a function of changing demographics and Donald Trump’s organisational grip, which is grounded in his intrinsic value of firing up the base in a system where voting isn’t compulsory. If the Liberals lose next Saturday’s election, these politicians should learn the right lesson from that defeat, which is about the enduring value of competency and decency, and of broadcasting rather than narrowcasting in politics. That should be the lesson. But there is no guarantee the right lesson will be learned, and that’s troubling for anyone who cares about the institutional building blocks of representative democracy in this country.",News/Australia news,"If the metropolitan moderates are wiped out next week, the Liberals must learn the right lesson from defeat | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/if-the-metropolitan-moderates-are-wiped-out-next-week-the-liberals-must-learn-the-right-lesson-from-defeat
5/14/2022,"Shortly after Sarah Holland-Batt’s father Tony was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease – and told he was no longer fit to drive – he bought himself his dream car. A Jaguar. He made the purchase via eBay, sight unseen; the first his wife knew about it was when it was delivered to their front door. It was an impulsive act of rebellion, but also symptomatic of the loss of judgment and compulsive spending that can accompany the early stages of the illness. In the title piece of her third volume of poetry, The Jaguar, Holland-Batt writes that the vehicle – an emerald green vintage 1980 XJ – “shone like an insect in the driveway”. Sometimes, her father would defy doctor’s orders and his family’s wishes and take off, ignoring his tremors and impaired vision. More often, though, the former engineer tinkered obsessively with the machine, until, eventually, it could no longer be driven: … it sat like a carcass in the garage, like a headstone, like a coffin Holland-Batt’s grief for her father, who died in March 2020, is at the core of The Jaguar. She describes the collection as an act of bearing witness. “It is a profoundly intimate thing to watch someone you love go through a long decline and then die,” she says. “The poet’s task, really, is to look at the world and find a language for things that seem to escape language. Watching someone decline can feel beyond language.” Holland-Batt once called poetry “fishing for lightning”, later the title of a collection of essays originally published in the Australian. The Brisbane-based author and academic is arguably the most recognised and lauded Australian poet of her generation, having won a swathe of awards since her first volume Aria was published in 2008. She claimed the Prime Minister’s Literary award in 2016 for her second collection, The Hazards. Her name even features on a TISM band T-shirt. But it’s her work as an aged care advocate, driven by the indignities endured by her father – whose abuse and neglect in care was originally exposed by a whistleblower – that has brought Holland-Batt to wider public recognition through multiple television and radio appearances and, more vitally, in her devastating submission to the royal commission into aged care quality and safety, which was finally tabled in March 2021. The inquiry exposed a litany of appalling human rights abuses, but the prime minister has held only one press conference about it, convened before any journalists had had a chance to read it. Holland-Batt has written extensively about the issue, including for this masthead, relentlessly documenting shortfalls in the government’s official response. The Jaguar is an intimate collection of poems, and Holland-Batt says she wrestled with how much to give up to the reader. But that was nothing compared with her appearance before the commission. The night before giving testimony, after six months of preparation, “I just had this moment where I thought, ‘Oh my god, am I actually doing this?’” she says. “It felt so much more exposing than a poem.” She points to previous royal commissions into banking and child abuse, which also involved thousands of hours of harrowing testimony. “I think when governments call a royal commission, there is and should be an expectation of major reform to follow,” she says. “You’re asking people to give up these intimate and personal stories, surely, for an outcome that honours that gift.” In another poem from The Jaguar, she describes turning down a marriage proposal. Accused of hardness by her suitor, she owns the intended pejorative with pride: … I did not rise to object, because I praise whatever it is in me that is stony and unbending, I praise my hardness To it and it alone I say I do. That hardness, she says, is at the heart of her advocacy. She is, by her own admission, “incredibly stubborn, just exhaustingly, ask my mother”. But her obduracy has purpose. Aged care is not a sexy topic; Holland-Batt aims to keep the conversation going. “We can be quite selective about the human rights issues that we get exercised by and those that we ignore, and what’s going on in aged care is a human rights crisis.” Holland-Batt was born on the Gold Coast, an unlikely place for poetry in the 1980s, but her father nurtured her interest. “He would take me into all of these different worlds,” she says. “He was interested in so many things – in philosophy and literature and classical music, which was the tragedy, when he got Parkinson’s, because he had such a fantastic brain, and he’d always been such a generous intellectual mentor.” When Holland-Batt was 12, her family moved to Colorado, where she saw out high school. It was in the United States, where poetry has far greater national standing, that her ambition bloomed after a patient English teacher introduced her to TS Eliot’s The Waste Land. Allen Ginsberg and other Beat writers had lived in nearby Boulder; Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson were household names, and there were huge poetry sections in the local bookstores. In Australia, AB Paterson, Henry Lawson, Judith Wright and Les Murray are among the few to have captured popular imagination. The tone of Australian poetry is different, she says. “A lot of the Australian poetry that I first encountered when I moved here was quite satirical and also laconic, and that took a little while to acclimatise to.” In America, she says, there’s a more declarative tone, evident in her own work – that hardness, again. But there is a luminosity in her lyricism, too. The poems were, she says, very difficult to write – but they are easy to read, if at times discomforting. They are consumed with mortality, but also endurance. Her father’s illness lasted 20 years. “It was sort of a privilege to watch Dad through that trajectory, and it does require a kind of stamina. And I feel like that is the act of these poems – looking when looking is hard.” The Jaguar by Sarah Holland-Batt is out now through UQP.

5/14/2022,"The New South Wales treasurer Matt Kean’s warning that the loss of moderate MPs would leave the Liberal party at risk of a Trump-like lurch to the right was not exactly a compelling election pitch for the federal Coalition. But Kean is right about what happens to conservative politics when true moderate voices are crowded out. He doesn’t need to look all the way to the US for a case study – just north of the border. A decade ago, when she left the federal parliament, the progressive Queensland Liberal senator Sue Boyce spoke about her hopes for the future of the party. “In the past few months I have been asked numerous times if, as a moderate and a feminist, I am concerned about our party’s perceived move to the right,” Boyce said. “Yes, I am concerned, but … I am hopeful that debates about important issues such as same-sex marriage and responses to climate change will continue to be conducted robustly, but respectfully, within our party. “I also expect that pragmatism will ultimately triumph.” In 2022, pragmatism seems hard to detect as the Queensland Liberal National party puts the careers of the dwindling number of “small l” federal Queensland liberals at risk. The state LNP – an organisation whose grassroots membership has become increasingly conservative, and influenced by a hardline Christian faction – on Wednesday voted in support of a motion from Robbie Katter opposing transgender women participating in women’s sport. “This is not a debate about sport or women’s rights,” the Labor frontbencher Stirling Hinchliffe said. “It is an attempt to cause fear and division and is unnecessarily dragging an extreme right-wing trope into this parliament”. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, said: “There’s nothing in that motion that I think Queenslanders will be overly uncomfortable with.” The past decade has seen the Queensland LNP pursue conservative causes – such as proposals to wind back abortion rights, or opposition to a ban on gay conversion therapy – that are unlikely to find much support in the centrist or progressive city seats the party needs to win. I just found out that *every* member of the LNP in Qld Parliament voted *against* a proposed law to ban gay conversion ‘therapy’. How do gay MPs in the Liberals cope with being in that party? https://t.co/r1lEqRV9Bc At a state level, the LNP’s attempts to court the rightwing fringe have contributed to the party being all but banished from greater Brisbane. Queensland shows how when a party’s broad church of views is thrown out of balance – in this case by the loss of moderates in city areas – other voices come to dominate. Without a pragmatic leader who seeks to bring the LNP back towards the centre (one who would have walked away from the anti-trans debate), that cycle will only intensify. This week I spoke to a few moderate liberals in Queensland who were worried about the impact the women’s sport debate would have on two inner-city federal seats, Brisbane and Ryan, which could fall to Labor or the Greens. It’s true that there are some parts of outer-suburban and regional Queensland – maybe much of Queensland – where pushing an anti-transgender line might help the Coalition. But pragmatic politics it is not. Especially when the two most likely LNP seats to be lost in Queensland are in inner-Brisbane. “Honestly, I wish someone would tell Katherine Deves to go back into hiding,” an LNP member working on one of the inner-city campaigns said this week. Trevor Evans, whose views on social issues are relatively progressive, is considered the most at risk of losing his seat of Brisbane. A few weeks ago while travelling around the electorate, I spoke to several voters who said they’d met Evans, they thought he was a good local member, but that they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for the Coalition. The electorate of Ryan, held by Julian Simmonds, sits to the west of the city – the historic stronghold of progressive and moderate Liberals in Queensland. “Small l” liberals have a long and proud history in Queensland politics. People like Boyce, who who crossed the floor to support Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme and same-sex marriage; and Rosemary Kyburz, who stood up to intimidation to protect abortion rights in the 1980s. More recently, the LNP threatened with disendorsement MPs who backed a conscience vote on abortion – one of those, Jann Stuckey, later resigned from the party and claimed it had been “slowly but steadily taken over by the Christian right”. Compounding the rightward slide on social issues is the LNP’s backslide on its climate commitments. Comments from Nationals like Matt Canavan and Colin Boyce that undermine a net zero policy might prevent some right-leaning voters in regional areas from flirting with minor parties, but they don’t play well in inner Brisbane. Nor does pork barrelling on questionable dams in regional Queensland, when kitchen table concerns like the cost of living are front and centre of urban voters’ minds. Flooding in March left 3,600 homes – most in the Brisbane area – uninhabitable. More than 4,400 more were damaged. Action on climate change is also a kitchen table issue when your kitchen table is floating down the street. The rain began again about the same time that pre-polling opened on Monday, and it has been pouring in the city for a week. People were queuing for sandbags on Friday.

5/14/2022,"As the weather gets colder, it’s no surprise that more of us are hearing about sick friends or colleagues, or have experienced the dreaded symptoms ourselves: cough, fever, sore throat, runny nose. But negative rapid antigen or PCR tests have some asking the question: if not Covid, what’s making us sick? After historically low transmission in previous years as a result of the pandemic, influenza cases are now on the rise. In New South Wales, they have doubled in a week: the state reported 2,000 cases in the week to 7 May, compared with 1,024 the week before. The latest data from the FluTracking surveillance network – which monitors for respiratory symptoms each week in more than 60,000 volunteers across Australia – found that respiratory illness levels are trending upwards, particularly in children aged 17 and under. The network asks participants to log symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, headache and runny nose, and tracks the proportion of symptomatic people who test positive for Covid or influenza. Of people who were symptomatic in the week to 8 May, more than half tested positive for Covid. “We think that the second Omicron wave has peaked,” says the FluTracking creator Craig Dalton, a conjoint associate professor at the University of Newcastle. Dalton says there has been a rapid rise in influenza cases in children under five. “Some of them would not have seen flu at all in their lives. “This is a common occurrence in infectious diseases where there is some immune protection … that comes with age – that you had time to encounter a range of different diseases and develop immunity.” Flu cases in people over 65 were “sitting pretty flat”, Dalton says. “That could be a combination of [high] vaccination in the elderly, and prior immune response.” In addition to influenza, there’s also transmission of rhinovirus – the common cold virus. “It hasn’t taken off. In fact, it was higher about a month ago, but it’s still there,” Dalton says. “About about one in four to one in three people who are tested for the common cold virus are positive at the moment.” “The biggest reason to have a big flu year is a change in the actual virus,” Dalton says. “It’s too early to say at this stage.” The last pre-pandemic flu season in Australia, in 2019, saw 313,033 laboratory-confirmed cases and 953 deaths. “This year is going to look really bad because of the increased testing,” Dalton says. “Lots of people who go and get a Covid test at a drive-through [clinic] will also now be getting a flu test. That increased testing will lead to a massive increase in detection of flu.” Experts will then need to look at the proportion of flu tests that come back positive to determine whether higher figures are just due to increased testing, or if flu activity is truly higher compared with previous years. “Flurona” refers to infection with both Covid and influenza at the same time and does not mean the viruses have merged. Co-infection is possible but uncommon – it affects an estimated less than 1% of people with Covid in the general population. Nigel Stocks, a professor of general practice at the University of Adelaide, previously told Guardian Australia that the risk of co-infection with two viruses existed prior to the pandemic. “In the past it was influenza and respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus,” Stocks said. “Some unlucky people can be infected with both [influenza] A and B at the same time, but that’s very unusual.” Co-infection with both Covid and the flu can increase the severity of symptoms. One study of more than 212,000 people in the UK of people admitted to hospital for Covid found that those co-infected with influenza had four times greater odds of being put on mechanical ventilation, and twice the odds of dying in hospital. Experts have been warning for weeks against complacency around influenza vaccines this winter. Influenza vaccine coverage in Australia dropped last year compared with 2020. According to an Atagi statement published in December, there was an estimated 20% reduction in flu vaccination uptake in young people aged five to 14. Influenza vaccinations are free for groups at highest risk, including children aged six months to five years, and people who are over 65, pregnant or have chronic health conditions.

5/14/2022,"In Latham, in Western Australia’s wheat belt, the telltale signs of mice holes are everywhere on Dylan Hirsch’s canola farm. As winter approaches, the rodents have moved in, digging up seeds before they’ve germinated and chewing his newly laid crop. “The numbers are higher than I’ve seen and building,” he says. “In previous years, we saw isolated areas of paddocks which have had mice eating young seedlings. “But this year we’re seeing mice activity right across some of our paddocks – as well as in the house and sheds.” Australian farmers are on high alert for a second coming of the mouse plague that ravaged north-west New South Wales and southern Queensland last year. Images of homes and crops overrun with record numbers of mice shocked Australians, and farmers are still recovering from the impact of losing millions of dollars’ worth of crops. The NSW Farmers vice president, Xavier Martin, says patchy reports of mouse activity have already been detected, “surprising” and concerning his members. “We’re getting reports in areas that were plagued this time last year but also areas that weren’t so intense … it’s coming in everywhere,” he says. Martin says La Niña patterns that caused heavy, prolonged rainfall prevented a surge of mice this summer. But the same wet conditions also fostered a bumper harvest, which had left pastures heavily seeded and a lot of grain in the paddock for rodents to snack on. “Even though there’s only low numbers, they’re becoming quite obvious around hay sheds and more elevated parts of paddocks,” he says. In the central NSW city of Dubbo – hard hit last year – Andrew Johnson has begun trapping and killing mice. “They came from nowhere … it’s not one or two, it’s 20,” he says. “They’re not small.” CSIRO mouse researcher Steve Henry says farmers have reported increased mice numbers in northern NSW, central Queensland, north-west Victoria and South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula. But the wheat belt of Western Australia has been worst hit. “There are widespread high numbers [there]. They’ve got a nasty outbreak for the second year in a row,” he says. “It’s a little unusual … but they did have a fantastic season last year and in some cases there was a lot of food left behind after the harvest as a result of hailstorms or frost.” On Western Australia’s south coast, Max Szulc has caught more than 2,000 mice on his Esperance property in a matter of weeks. “I’ve never had so many mice in all the time I’ve lived here,” he says. “It was a perfect summer breeding environment for the numbers to build up. “I’m waiting for a weather event to kill off most of them.” Some 500km closer to Perth, Braydyn Grylls is baiting on his farm in Bulyee, nestled in the state’s central wheat belt. “We’ve never had mice problems here before. It’s the first time we’ve ever baited,” he says. “They’ve increased in numbers and damaged our canola … It’s early stages but a good five metre squared around the holes they’ve chewed it off. “I’ve seen them in the paddocks. They’re running riot through the house and sheds.” Grylls puts it down to a high amount of feed left over from last year for the mice to eat, and the wet year getting them breeding early. “I’ve dug some of the burrows up and you can see their new offspring in there – four or five ready to come out … that’s going to be the next plague,” he says. The CSIRO’s Henry says as the weather cools, mice are moving into sheds and dwellings, and with lots of food around, they’re stocking their pantries. “It’s not the broad, widespread outbreak we were seeing last year but we’re counselling vigilance,” he says. Henry says farmers from Geraldton to the Mallee, Wimmera and the Riverina are spreading mice bait as they sow their winter crop to try to keep numbers down before breeding season in spring. In an ominous sign of what may come, Henry says farmers he’s spoken to in Wagga Wagga have been “absolutely shocked” to find mouse holes littered across their paddocks after burning off in preparation to sow. Other areas, like Maryborough on Queensland’s Fraser Coast, are reporting 20 to 30 mice in homes at night. Last year, the NSW government introduced a rebate for the pesticide zinc phosphide bait as part if a $150m package to deal with out-of-control rodent numbers. Henry urges farmers to get out and walk through their crops. “One of the key times farmers can deal with mice is as they sow their crop – it’s a good, strategic time to apply bait.” The breeding season for rodents begins at the end of winter when, from six weeks old, mice can have up to 10 babies every 21 days. “As soon as they give birth, they fall pregnant with their second litter, there’s no break,” Henry says. “Over in the west they’ve got a two-year trajectory where numbers went high, plateaued and have gone again in spring … We want to make sure it won’t be the same scenario in NSW, where they’ve been so badly affected. “Given some crops are going to be worth a lot of money this year, it’s a form of insurance to keep those mice numbers low … so you can be on the front foot.” NSW Farmers’ Martin says the state needs to remain “on alert” after the destruction of last season and monitor the infestation before food crops are spoiled. A survey of more than 1,000 farmers last year found one third estimated stored grain and fodder losses between $50,000 and $150,000 due to mice damage. “We know in the last plague what seemed to be low numbers exploded without a lot of warning into the springtime … It’s far easier to deal with these rodents proactively than to try and react once we have huge populations,” he says. In Western Australia’s wheat belt, Hirsch is trying to be proactive to avoid a repeat of devastating scenes from NSW last year. “We, like many farmers, are spreading mouse bait in our canola paddocks, which can be particularly prone to damage,” he says. “The high price of grain and inputs means damage is greater risk to us than normal, which is making us more likely to bait to protect our crop, rather than wait and see.”",News/Australia news,Return of the rodents: Australia’s farmers on high alert for another mouse plague,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/return-of-the-rodents-australias-farmers-on-high-alert-for-another-mouse-plague
5/14/2022,"A proposed third runway at Melbourne airport could impact sleeping patterns – potentially leading to increased rates of cardiovascular disease – and may affect children’s cognitive development, an independent health assessment of the $1.9bn project says. The report, commissioned by Brimbank Council in Melbourne’s outer west, recommends the airport consider a curfew between 11pm-6am, similar to that in place for Sydney Airport, to minimise sleep disruption. Alternative directions for take-offs were also recommended to provide noise respite for locals, the report, by Dr Lyn Denison from environmental and engineering consulting firm Tonkin & Taylor, said. A Melbourne Airport spokesperson said it had not been provided with a copy of the report and was unable to comment on the content. “Melbourne Airport has been very upfront about the benefits and impacts associated with construction of the third runway,” a spokesperson said. The proposed 3km-long third runway is expected to be completed by the end of the decade and is designed to increase the airport’s freight and tourism capacity and ease pre-Covid delays.

Under the proposal, it will run parallel to an existing north-south runway. Residents in areas to the north and south of the airport, like Keilor, St Albans, Bulla and Tottenham, will be most affected by the additional aircraft noise. The council-commissioned health risk assessment concluded that existing sleep disturbances and anxiety from aircraft noise in the Brimbank local government area would worsen with the airport’s proposed expansion. “There will be significant increase in sleep disturbances in the exposed community which may lead to increases in health effects such as cardiovascular disease and anxiety and depression,” it said. Melbourne Airport uses the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (Anef), a measure of predicted noise disturbances standardised across Australia for statutory planning purposes. Across Australia, land with an Anef of less than 20 is regarded as being acceptable for residential dwellings. The new report said the airport’s proposed noise forecasts exceeded the World Health Organization’s 2018 guidelines on aircraft-generated noise. The assessment said children who live and attend schools in the Anef 20 and 25 zones were predicted to “experience a delay in reading and oral comprehension of between 3 and 5 months compared to children in lower noise areas.” “This impact is predicted to occur within a population that is known to be delayed in their language and cognitive skills compared to the rest of Melbourne,” it said. Brimbank is the second most disadvantaged council area in greater Melbourne. The council-commissioned report comes after the release of the draft major development plan for the third runway released by Melbourne airport. The plan includes an independent and peer-reviewed health assessment that said in locations within 15km from the airport, the severity of potential health effects on schools and childcare centre would be “moderate”. The plan also said the severity of the potential health effect of heart attacks arising from aircraft noise was projected to be “negligible.” Melbourne airport has estimated the new runway will allow an extra 23 million passengers to pass through, and an additional 136,500 flights a year by 2046. It has pledged to engage with residents in the hope of avoiding a repeat of the situation at Brisbane airport, where local residents claimed they were misled about the noise from a second runway. Brisbane Airport is now trialling interim noise-reduction changes after an independent forum – established by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce – made a series of recommendations, following noise complaints made about the airport’s parallel runway which opened in mid-2020.
