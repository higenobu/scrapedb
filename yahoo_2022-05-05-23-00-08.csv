5/5/2022,"Leonardo DiCaprio urged Brazilians to vote for a ""healthy planet"" in the upcoming election. In response, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro told the actor to ""keep his mouth shut."" Bolsonaro, who is running for reelection, has faced criticism for his environmental policies. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro told Leonardo DiCaprio on Tuesday to ""keep his mouth shut"" after the Hollywood actor called on Brazilians to vote for pro-climate candidates. Bolsonaro, who is running for reelection in October, made the comments during a speech to supporters in front of his official residence in Brasilia, CNN reported. ""Now, DiCaprio has to know that it was the very president of the World Trade Organization who said that without Brazilian agribusiness, the world would be hungry,"" Bolsonaro said, according to CNN. ""So, DiCaprio better keep his mouth shut instead of talking nonsense,"" he added. His remarks come after DiCaprio, who is also an outspoken environmental activist, encouraged voter registration among young Brazilians in several posts on his official Twitter account — some of which were written in Portuguese. ""Brazil is home to the Amazon and other ecosystems critical to climate change,"" he wrote last week. ""What happens there matters to us all, and youth voting is key in driving change for a healthy planet."" Since taking office in 2019, Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism for his environmental policies. Last year, a group of climate lawyers called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Bolsonaro for his actions in the Amazon, Reuters reported. In their complaint, they accused the far-right leader of ""fuelling the mass destruction of the Amazon with his eyes wide open and in full knowledge of the consequences,"" per Reuters. Brazil set a new record for Amazon deforestation earlier this year after government satellite data revealed that the number of trees cut down in the Amazon in January far exceeded deforestation for the same month last year, the BBC reported. This is not the first time Bolsonaro has publicly lashed out at DiCaprio. In 2019, he accused the actor of funding nonprofit groups that he said were responsible for fires in the Amazon. He did not provide evidence for this claim. The election in Brazil, where voting is mandatory for anyone aged between 18 and 70, will be held on October 2.

5/5/2022,"Whether you’re considering ending a pregnancy, have questions about abortion or just want to learn more, here are some important facts that everyone should know about abortion. For pregnant people considering terminating a pregnancy, there are two types of abortions: a medical abortion (also known as abortion pills) and a surgical (or procedural) one. With a medical abortion, patients take an FDA-approved regimen of two different medications — mifepristone and misoprostol — “for the purpose of ending the pregnancy,” Dr. Deyang Nyandak, a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, tells Yahoo Life. “Many providers offer prescription medications to support potential side effects of these medications, including pain and nausea.” Dr. Andrea Henkel of Stanford University, tells Yahoo Life that medication abortion is “routinely offered as an outpatient — at home — [procedure] through 10 weeks of pregnancy, though there is data for efficacy and safety later. Each facility will have their own comfort level with the upper gestational age limit.” Procedural, or surgical, abortions are typically done in a clinic and involve emptying the uterus with suction — the most common option — or suction and medical tools, according to Planned Parenthood. “People choose procedural abortions if they are over 11 weeks of pregnancy and no longer are eligible to have a medication abortion,” says Nyandak. “Many people opt to have a procedure as it is a faster process in most cases compared to medication abortion.” For most people, an in-clinic abortion is a “one-day process,” says Nyandak, “and they can opt to have general anesthesia if available. Many people opt to have the procedure done while they are awake so that they can preserve their privacy without needing someone to drive them to and from the clinic — something they need if they receive general anesthesia, and similar to when someone has a colonoscopy or their wisdom teeth removed.” Medical abortions currently account for more than half of all abortions performed in the U.S., surpassing surgery for the first time, according to a February 2022 report by the Guttmacher Institute. “Although there are major technical differences between medication and surgical abortions,” says Nyandak, “many of my patients choose medication abortions as they prefer to go through the process in the privacy of their own homes. They can take the medications they need for the abortion at home without medical supervision in most cases,” depending on state law. Nyandak explains that patients in states where medication abortion via telemedicine is legal and available, “patients do not need to come in for an in-person appointment for their medication abortion. Therefore, patients may choose to have a medication abortion since they can have the medications directly delivered to their preferred address without needing to physically see their providers.” “Modern abortion is incredibly safe,” says Henkel. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), complications that require hospitalization are rare. “Serious complications requiring hospitalization for treatment of infection or transfusion occur in less than 4 per 1,000 patients,” says Henkel. To put the safety of abortions into perspective, Nyandak explains that “the risk of death during childbirth is 14 times higher compared to abortion.” About 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by age 45, according to the ACOG. Women in their 20s account for more than half of all abortions in the U.S., according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Up until 2019, abortion rates had reached record-low levels, but then went up slightly that year. Organizations, including the Guttmacher Institute, state that “abortion restrictions were not the main driver of the decline.” Rather, it appears to be related to fewer pregnancies, as well as contraceptive use. Although some people may confuse the two, morning-after pills (also known as emergency contraception) and medical abortions are “very different,” notes Nyandak. The former prevents pregnancy in women who have had unprotected sex or whose birth control method failed, according to the Mayo Clinic, while the latter ends an existing pregnancy. “Morning-after pills prevent ovulation so an egg doesn’t have the opportunity to meet sperm in the reproductive tract,” explains Henkel. “In contrast, abortion disrupts an established pregnancy where a sperm and egg have already come together.” Dr. Jennifer Villavicencio, lead for equity transformation at ACOG and an ob-gyn trained in complex family planning, tells Yahoo Life, “Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive medical care. Access to abortion care improves the health and well-being of those who need it, and data have long shown that restrictions to access to care only cause harm.” Nyandak says that people who are the most vulnerable will be hit the hardest if Roe v. Wade is overturned. “Restrictions on any type of health care service have the most negative impact on people of color and people of low income,” she says. “Similarly, abortion bans mostly affect people of lower socioeconomic status.” She explains that “people with means,” on the other hand, “will be able to travel across state lines to find an abortion clinic, pay for their hotel stay, take off time from work and afford child care. However, people who do not have such means will face inequities in obtaining basic and essential medical care. Therefore, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade will have a significant impact on the health and well-being of many people in the United States.” Experts also point out that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, that doesn’t mean an end to abortion. It would be up to individual states to decide whether abortions are legal and up until what point in a woman’s pregnancy. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, abortion would “likely be prohibited” in 24 states if Roe v. Wade is overturned. But as Henkel puts it, “Banning abortion will not stop people from ending pregnancies that are undesired.” Instead, restricting access to safe and legal abortion services will have “important negative health implications,” Ana Langer, professor of the practice of public health and coordinator of the Women and Health Initiative at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, explained in a recent interview published on the school’s website. She added: “We’ve seen that these laws do not result in fewer abortions. Instead, they compel women to risk their lives and health by seeking out unsafe abortion care.” Villavicencio adds: “Quite simply, people will always need access to abortion. Contraception fails, lives change, unexpected complications occur. No matter what an individual’s reason for an abortion, it is essential that they have access to an abortion when they need it.” Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

5/5/2022,"Russia’s war against Ukraine has leveled cities, killed tens of thousands of people and forced millions of others from their homes. But quietly, some military analysts and Western officials are asking why the onslaught has not been even worse. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Russia could be going after Ukrainian railways, roads and bridges more aggressively to try to stanch the flow of Western weapons to the front line. It could have bombed more of the infrastructure around the capital, Kyiv, to make it harder for Western leaders to visit President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in shows of unity and resolve. And it could be doing far more to inflict pain on the West, whether by cyberattack, sabotage or more cutoffs of energy exports to Europe. Part of the reason appears to be sheer incompetence: The opening weeks of the war demonstrated vividly that Russia’s military was far less capable than believed before the invasion. But American and European officials also say that President Vladimir Putin’s tactics in recent weeks have appeared to be remarkably cautious, marked by a slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine, a restrained approach to taking out Ukrainian infrastructure and an avoidance of actions that could escalate the conflict with NATO. The apparent restraint on the ground stands in contrast to the bombast on Russian state television, where Moscow is described as being locked in an existential fight against the West and where the use of nuclear weapons is openly discussed. The issue is whether, as the war grinds on, Putin will change tack and intensify the war. That is a particularly urgent question ahead of the Victory Day holiday in Russia on May 9, when Putin traditionally presides over a grandiose parade marking the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany and gives a militaristic speech. Ben Wallace, the British defense secretary, predicted last week that Putin would use the speech for an official declaration of war and a mass mobilization of the Russian people. American and European officials say that they have not seen any on-the-ground movements that would show any much larger push with additional troops beginning on May 9 or soon after. Those officials now expect a slower, grinding campaign inside Ukraine. But they do not disagree that Putin could use the speech to declare a wider war and a deeper national effort to fight it. For the moment, Putin appears to be in a military holding pattern, one that is allowing Ukraine to regroup and stock up on Western weaponry. On Monday, a senior Pentagon official called Russia’s latest offensive in eastern Ukraine “very cautious, very tepid.” In Russia, there is grumbling that the military is fighting with one hand tied behind its back, with the strategy and aims not understood by the public. “This is a strange, special kind of war,” Dmitry Trenin, until recently the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, said in a phone interview from outside Moscow. “Russia has set some rather strict limits for itself, and this is not being explained in any way — which raises a lot of questions, first of all, among Russian citizens.” Trenin is one of the few analysts from his think tank, shuttered last month by the Russian government, who chose to stay in Russia after the war began. He said that he was struggling to explain why the Kremlin was fighting at “less than half strength.” Why isn’t Russia bombing more bridges and railway networks, he asked, when they are allowing Ukraine’s military to receive more of the West’s increasingly lethal weapons deliveries with every passing day? Why are Western leaders — like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday — still able to visit Kyiv safely? “I find this strange, and I can’t explain it,” Trenin said. To be sure, Russian missile strikes have targeted infrastructure across Ukraine, including an important bridge in the country’s southwest on Monday and the runway of the Odesa airport on Saturday. But across the Atlantic, officials and analysts are asking themselves similar questions as Trenin. For weeks, officials in Washington have discussed why the Russian military has not been more aggressive in trying to destroy the supply lines that send Western arms shipments into Ukraine. Part of the answer, officials say, is that Ukrainian air defense continues to threaten Russian aircraft, and the deeper Russian planes go into Ukraine the greater the chance they are going to be shot down. Russia has also struggled with its precision munitions — missiles or rockets with guidance systems. Many of those weapons have failed to work properly, and Russian supplies of the weapons are limited. Strikes on rail lines or moving convoys must be very precise to be effective. Other officials have argued that Moscow is eager to avoid destroying Ukraine’s infrastructure too severely, in the possibly misguided hope that it can still take control of the country. Russia would be stuck with a huge rebuilding job if it took over cities devastated by its own bombing. A senior American defense official said that Putin may have avoided destroying Ukraine’s rail network because he did not want to hurt his own ability to move equipment and troops around the country. The Russians have been more focused on destroying weapon storage areas than the rail network. American officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private military and intelligence assessments. Then there is the question of why Russia hasn’t hit back harder against the West. The Kremlin narrative is of an existential war with NATO being fought on Ukrainian soil, but Russia is the one taking military losses while the West keeps a safe distance and supplies weapons that kill Russian soldiers. “A lot of people in this town are asking why they haven’t retaliated yet,” said Samuel Charap, a former U.S. State Department official in Washington and a Russia analyst with the Rand Corp. “It seems low probability that the U.S. and its allies will experience no blowback from having put this many Russian soldiers in their graves.” Russia has the tools to do widespread damage to the West. The gas shortages caused by the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline last year showed the disruption that Russian hacking can inflict on American infrastructure. Berlin has warned that a cutoff of Russian gas could throw the German economy into a recession. And then there is Moscow’s world-leading nuclear arsenal, with an estimated 5,977 warheads: Their catastrophic capability is being hyped in ever-shriller terms in the Russian media. “You thought you could destroy us with other people’s hands and observe from the sidelines from a safe distance?” Sergei Mironov, an outspoken hawk in Russia’s Parliament, said Saturday, claiming that his country’s new intercontinental ballistic missile could destroy Britain in a single strike. “It won’t work, gentlemen — you’ll have to pay for it all in full!” he added. Putin has also warned of retaliation, but he values ambiguity, too. Last year, he said that those crossing a “red line” would face an “asymmetric, fast and tough” response — an indication that the response would come at a time and place of Moscow’s choosing. “Nobody really knows where the red line is,” Charap, the analyst, said. “I don’t even think the Russians know, because we are in such uncharted waters.” American and allied officials have debated why Putin hasn’t tried widespread or more damaging cyberstrikes. Some say that Putin has been effectively deterred. The Russian military, struggling to make gains in Ukraine, cannot handle a wider war with NATO and does not want to give the alliance any excuse to enter the war more directly. Others argue that a cyberstrike on a NATO country is one of the few cards Putin can play and that he may be waiting for a later stage in his campaign to do that. While Putin has been unafraid of escalating the rhetoric, his actions have suggested he does not want to do anything that could prompt a wider war. “The general sense is that he wants to snatch some sort of victory out of this debacle of his,” said the American defense official, suggesting that Putin was not interested in “borrowing more trouble.” Before the invasion on Feb. 24, Trenin, of the Carnegie center, predicted that the Ukrainian military would put up a fierce resistance and that Putin would discover a lack of political support for Russia in Ukraine. On that, Trenin turned out to be right. What he was wrong about, Trenin said, was the information that aides and commanders would provide to Putin about Russia’s capabilities, which turned out to be flawed. Trenin says he still sees Putin as fundamentally rational, rather than someone willing to engage in a nuclear war, with a “maniacal determination to destroy mankind.” “That would not be a mistake — that would be a total departure from rationality,” Trenin said. “I hope that now I am not wrong.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,"Russia's War Has Been Brutal, but Putin Has Shown Some Restraint.
