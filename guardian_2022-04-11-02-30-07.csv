4/11/2022,"The Greek historian Herodotus is said to have made one of the earliest lists of seven wonders of the world. These were man-made structures, including the still mysterious feat of ancient horticulture known as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. More recent times saw natural alternatives to these marvels of classical architecture proposed: waterfalls, mountains, canyons, reefs. Dramatic landscapes, features and wildlife, and the pleasure and excitement they offer to visitors, are staples of tourism. As environmental consciousness has risen in the west, attitudes to such sightseeing have changed. Yes, it is thrilling to visit remote forests or spot rare species. But travelling to far-flung destinations is carbon-intensive when flights or long road journeys are involved, and conservation can be made more difficult as well as assisted by sightseers. There is a balance to be struck, and ethical governments and businesses around the world try to maximise the benefits while minimising the harms. Colombia, for example, recently introduced laws aimed at promoting sustainable tourism. Most of us, in the rich countries where people take most holidays, understand better than ever that there are costs as well as benefits associated with exploring. One of the six pledges proposed by an environmental campaign launched last month, The Jump, is to “holiday local”, taking short-haul flights once every three years and long-haul flights very rarely. Fortunately, the UK’s 15 national parks, 86 areas of outstanding natural beauty (known in Scotland as national scenic areas), and countless other landscapes that are without formal status, but beloved nonetheless, mean that there is no shortage of special places for domestic nature tourists to visit – while a host of European beauty spots are accessible by rail. One recent survey found that Windsor Great Park and Kew have become Britain’s most popular attractions, while Covid has created difficulties for indoor spaces which do not apply to outdoor ones. Visitor numbers at wildlife trusts are high, with waiting lists for beaver-spotting. Some companies that formerly ran foreign trips have adapted to the pandemic by taking people to watch dolphins and other marine life off British coasts instead. This is not to minimise the destruction of nature that is also taking place. Sewage outflows are out of control due to failed water industry regulation. The owners of a popular rewilded estate in West Sussex – Knepp – have warned that plans to build 3,500 homes next to their land would be catastrophic for the species that live there. But as we confront an environmental emergency that grows ever more dangerous, it is essential to cultivate appreciation for the nature that surrounds us. In a small way, holiday outings to watch dragonflies, kingfishers or seals, or be surrounded by trees that are coming into leaf, could help us to focus on what matters.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on nature tourism: tread lightly | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/10/the-guardian-view-on-nature-tourism-tread-lightly
4/11/2022,"Your article (PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK’s energy strategy, 6 April) refers to Sizewell C as one of the major projects that has “already been through some form of planning”. The planning process is still going on, and thousands of interested parties have objected. Six months of Planning Inspectorate meetings exposed the mistakes of trying to build two gigantic reactors in the middle of an area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest, pushed against the Minsmere nature reserve, on an eroding coastline, and with no available water for construction or operation, among other problems. This hasn’t stopped Kwasi Kwarteng promising millions in taxpayer funding for Sizewell C when the planning process has not been completed and while he refuses to meet the community to hear alternative views.Josie BassinetteWalberswick, Suffolk  In your major article on the government’s new energy strategy there is no mention of a major reason for opposing more nuclear power: there is still no method of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste safely. This is hugely irresponsible with regard to future generations, unlike some indigenous Americans like the Iroquois, who have a principle that every plan of action must be considered with regard to its effect on the next seven generations.Morag CarmichaelLondon  In light of Boris’s new enthusiasm for lots of Rolls-Royce’s so-called “mini-nukes” to generate electricity, it should be better known that the Ministry of Defence has not scrapped any of its 21 similarly Rolls-Royce-powered old nuclear submarines, berthed for up to 40 years. It has made a start dismantling the hull of one, but there are still no plans for dealing with the reactors beyond burying them. Indeed, no country in the world has properly made safe a worn out mini-nuke-powered ship or submarine.Bob CannellBradford  I would argue that we do not need new nuclear power at all. It is costly, dangerous, slow and unsuitable as an adjunct to renewables. We certainly don’t need it in Wales. In 2021, planning inspectors advised that the Wylfa Newydd development (What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?, 6 April) should be rejected due to its impact on the local economy, housing stock, local ecology, nature conservation and the Welsh language. Yet still politicians say it’s the best place for a new nuclear power station. No wonder Boris Johnson wants to cut the “red tape” of the planning process. He cannot be allowed to.Linda RogersLlangoed, Anglesey  If the government is considering investment in long-term non-fossil energy projects like nuclear, why does its strategy make no mention of tidal power? Proven technology at a variety of suitable sites around the UK could provide baseload renewable electricity. True, the old Severn Barrage scheme raised fears for wildlife, but better design and the realisation that climate change will do far worse damage to wildlife should still such fears.Jon ReedsAlston, Cumbria  A quick win for additional energy supplies should be expansion of anaerobic digestion plants running on waste organic materials. This is a known and improving technology that can be scaled up and built quickly on farms. Organic waste materials can be sourced from farms, food factories, kerbside collections, verge and hedge cutting, etc. This process would be a better use of forestry waste than inefficient burning for electricity as it produces gas for the grid, from where it would be used much more efficiently, and fertiliser that is currently made from fossil fuel gas. CO2 can also be captured to replace that currently made from fossil fuel gas.Malcolm ScottWirral  There are several glaring omissions from the energy strategy, including our ability to produce energy from waste (EfW) and our ability to sell UK EfW products to UK customers. As a nation, we are embarrassingly behind Europe on this matter, and to our shame we are sending waste either to landfill or to other countries to produce energy from. This, coupled with a ridiculous red tape system in the UK means that we (and companies like ours) are also more likely to sell our EfW pellets to Europe while UK power plants import pellets made from wood from other countries.Ian JonesCEO, Waste Knot Energy  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/11/2022,"I was a boarding pupil (on a Devon county scholarship) at Plymouth College, a direct grant school, from September 1960 until July 1968. The art master there was Derek Holland. He ran an after-school art class, where it was possible to make sculpture and use materials that were difficult within the confines of a school timetable. At first this existed in a dusty basement beneath the library, but after my second year it was moved to what had been the canteen, now also relocated. This was another basement but much more extensive and had been equipped with workbenches, a casting room, pottery equipment including kilns, and even a lithography press. Derek ran the art club (as we called it) every weekday afternoon and on Sunday afternoons for any boarding pupils who were interested. This was an incredible extra-hours commitment, and Derek soon needed help to keep it going. For this he turned to David McKee (Obituary, 8 April), who he must have known from McKee’s time at Plymouth College of Art. David replaced Derek on odd afternoons and most Sundays. This was before David had published the first Elmer book, but I could see his work in the not infrequent covers and cartoons he produced for Punch. Derek Holland was also visible outside the school environment, exhibiting sporadically with the Redfern Gallery. I spent countless hours in that art club basement. It was through the kindness, engagement and hard work of these two gentle and delightful men – David McKee and Derek Holland – that I learned that it was possible both to be an artist and to exist in the world.Richard DeaconLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/11/2022,"They will be talking about this one for a while. At one of Europe’s most famous stadiums, Leicester scored five tries against Clermont in a thumping win, underlining the club’s resurgence under Steve Borthwick. Already qualified for the Premiership playoffs, they now look assured of a spot in the Champions Cup quarter-finals. It was simple rugby. A formidable pack marshalled by the relentlessly busy Ellis Genge claimed ascendency in the tight channels and around the fringe. Their lineout and maul, expertly drilled by Borthwick, meant any penalty won in Clermont’s half carried the threat of seven points. It was the home side that opened the scoring when a baying crowd at Stade Marcel-Michelin convinced them to turn down a kickable penalty and instead nudged it in the corner. Leicester held the ball up over the line but George Ford’s drop-kick clearance didn’t go far enough and was collected by Alivereti Raka on the right wing. Clermont went left, then right, then left again, creating disharmony in Leicester’s line. Kotaro Matsushima straightened and fed Cheik Tiberghien who finished a superb move. Morgan Parra made a difficult conversion look easy. Leicester hit back within five minutes through a trademark try registered by a man who has embodied their fight this season. A lineout in the red zone was cleanly won by Ollie Chessum. Julian Montoya came close from the maul but it was Genge, the Tigers’ captain, who dotted down after an explosive carry. Parra started the match with a perfect record from the tee in this competition and he kept it alive by slotting a penalty before the half-hour. Clermont’s scrum had gained an early supremacy but Leicester’s lineout was firing so it was no surprise when the visitors went to the corner after winning a penalty. Their first attempt at a maul was brought down illegally so they went again. Their second ended with Montoya scoring after he burrowed over from close range. Ford missed again and the teams remained locked at 10-10 until the half-time break. Leicester took the lead in the second half when Jack Van Poortvliet, starting in Ben Youngs’ absence through a mid-week illness, sniped from the base of another rolling maul off an attacking lineout, dummying past Parra and scoring unopposed on the blind-side. If that shocked this usually boisterous arena, Hosea Saumaki’s try stunned it into silence. Van Poortvliet’s box-kick was gathered by Hanro Liebenberg before the ball was swiftly sent left. Freddie Steward on the gallop caught and passed to the Tongan winger who slid over. Ford finally found his range to open up a 12-point lead. Leicester have a poor record in France, having won in just two of their last 16 trips over the Channel. But Borthwick’s team has proved their steel across the Premiership campaign so far and defended like cornered tigers when Clermont threatened their line with sustained pressure before the hour mark. The game might have turned when Guy Porter moved to tackle Fritz Lee. Their heads came together but it was Clermont’s No8 who had the worst of it with a gash spilling blood down his face. Though there was clearly no malice, Porter’s challenge was deemed sufficiently dangerous for a straight red card as the team of referees believed he had an obligation to stoop lower before the collision. Leicester’s resolve would face its sternest test yet. Rather than hold on to what they had, Leicester went in search of more. Steward did what he does best and won a hanging kick from Ford. He off-loaded in the tackle and flicked the ball to Harry Potter who skipped one way and then the next to score a magic try. Even with a man advantage, Clermont never came close to reducing the deficit. Leicester will enjoy a 19-point cushion at Welford Road next week. Their fans will already be planning their next trip to the continent.",Sport/Sport,Ellis Genge leads 14-man Leicester to famous first-leg victory at Clermont,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/clermont-leicester-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
4/11/2022,"Boris Johnson had been in a running argument with his security detail about the feasibility of a visit to Kyiv for weeks, and on Saturday he finally won his battle. It was more than a fortnight after the prime ministers of Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland took the train to Kyiv on 15 March, at a time when the capital was under greater assault from Russia; a week after the president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, spoke to the Ukrainian parliament; and a day after the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and her foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, stood horrified in Bucha. Borrell, clearly moved by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s bravery, said he had returned with a clear to-do list. But Johnson is the most high profile national leader to have visited since the war began, and if his walkabout in the capital had a heavily stage-managed air, he will have embedded his reputation with Zelenskiy as his greatest military ally. His visit was ecstatically received in Ukraine. In his latest video address Zelenskiy heaped praise on the prime minister, whom he referred to warmly as Boris. “It was a great honour for me to welcome in our capital a sincere friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson. His visit to our country demonstrates as clearly as possible there are no obstacles to freedom and to leadership,” Zelenskiy said. Speaking to Ukrainians, he added: “Boris was among those who did not hesitate for a moment whether to help Ukraine.” He said the UK’s assistance in terms of the tangible supply of defensive weapons and sanctions policy against Moscow “will remain forever in history”. “Ukraine will always be grateful to Boris and Britain for this,” he declared. He described London as the leader of what he called the “antiwar coalition” that was trying to force Russia to end its invasion and to seek peace. A video of the Johnson-Zelenskiy walkabout in Kyiv on Saturday, posted by Ukraine’s defence ministry, clocked up an impressive 6.1m views. The respected defence correspondent of the Kyiv independent newspaper, Illia Ponomarenko, was enthralled by the footage. He described it on Twitter as “one of the greatest videos the internet has ever seen”. In practical terms the visit could probably achieve little that the two men’s near daily phone calls on a secure line cannot, but the symbolism of the visit is hard to surpass. It serves a useful dual purpose. It normalises Kyiv and makes Johnson a little more extraordinary. Britain has been the country most hostile to Russia for years, and well before the invasion it had developed a close military partnership with Ukraine. So Britain’s role in the past five week as Ukraine’s closest military ally is hardly a surprise. France and Germany as the guarantors of the Minsk accords were more deeply embedded in the diplomacy around Ukraine’s future, and Germany is only now emerging from its long, complex relationship with Russia and militarism. That left a space vacant for the UK to adopt the post of the unambiguous military ally, chairing the ad hoc meetings on the supply of arms to Ukraine, a role Nato has not been able to fulfil. But Johnson at the outset was clear-minded about the gravity of what was at stake. In his largely self-penned speech on 15 February to the Munich security conference, he said explicitly that Vladimir Putin had to be seen to fail, and that if Zelenskiy was toppled it would be the west’s duty to arm the resistance. It is true the war could not have come at a more opportune moment for the prime minister. If Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, had not belatedly intervened on 25 January in the Downing Street Partygate affair the full report commissioned by Downing Street from Sue Gray would have been published in late January, the number of letters from Tory MPs demanding Johnson’s resignation might well have gone past the trigger point, and Johnson might have been forced to resign, leaving him as caretaker prime minister at the point that Russian tanks started trundling over the Ukrainian border. In practice, democracies can choose leaders and fight surrogate wars at the same time – in recent months there have been scheduled elections in France, Hungary, Malta and Portugal. But there is no appetite among Tory MPs, even if the prime minister is given a fixed-penalty notice for a breach of Covid regulations, to trigger a leadership election. That does not mean Johnson can shape this into a Falklands moment. No British troops are directly involved, and this is not going to end with the union jack being hoisted above the Kremlin. The polls so far seem to have retained the turn against the Conservatives that started with Partygate. But wars change perceptions and perspectives. It is still possible for Johnson to emerge as a more serious figure from this. But even then the cheers of liberated people abroad can be dangerously alluring – and ephemeral. David Cameron stood alongside Nicolas Sarkozy to receive a rapturous reception from the people of Benghazi in Libya in 2011. Tony Blair was hailed by the people of Kosovo in 1999. Streets are named after John Major in Kurdistan. Winston Churchill saved Britain from Nazism. Much good it did them at the polls in the years that were to follow.",News/World news,Johnson’s Kyiv visit achieved little but was a symbolic win for PM and Zelenskiy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/johnsons-kyiv-visit-was-a-triumph-but-it-may-not-save-him-at-the-polls
4/11/2022,"The newly appointed general in command of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine is likely to usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians, the US has said. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser in Washington, said the appointment of Alexander Dvornikov as theatre commander of Russian forces in Ukraine could not disguise the strategic failure of Vladimir Putin’s war so far. “Ukraine will never be subjugated to Russia; it doesn’t matter which general President Putin tries to appoint,” he told CNN. Dvornikov’s appointment follows the withdrawal of Russian forces from around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Dvornikov, 60, came to prominence at the head of Russian troops in Syria in 2015-16, when there was particularly brutal bombardment of rebel-held areas, including civilian populations, in Aleppo. Sullivan said Dvornikov’s promotion would lead to more atrocities. “This particular general has a résumé that includes brutality against civilians in other theatres – in Syria – and we can expect more of the same” in Ukraine, he said. “This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians, and the United States is determined to do all that we can to support the Ukrainians as they resist him and the forces that he commands.” Dvornikov’s ascent, disclosed by US officials on Sunday, signals an effort by Moscow to impose military order on a campaign that has had serious setbacks. In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance supported by US, UK and European armaments, Russia appears to be regrouping for a potentially long battle for Donbas, in the east of the country. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told NBC News: “Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv. Now another battle is coming – the battle for Donbas.” Asked whether the Ukrainian military was capable of responding to an even more ferocious onslaught from the Russians under Dvornikov, Kuleba said history would demonstrate who would prevail. “Whatever Russia is planning to do, we have our strategy based on the confidence that we will win this war and we will liberate our territories.” In what seemed to be further evidence of Russia’s intention to attack Donbas, satellite images showed a 7 mile-long Russian convoy moving south in the Kharkiv region. It included armoured vehicles, trucks with artillery and support equipment. After failing to capture Kyiv, the Kremlin has rebranded its invasion. It now says its objective is to restore the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which are partly controlled by pro-Russia separatists. Moscow wants to seize additional Ukrainian-controlled territory and cut off Kyiv’s defending army. In an update on Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said the “enemy” was trying to break through near the city of Izyum, south of Kharkiv. It claimed Ukrainian forces had wiped out another “large column of enemy equipment and manpower” heading towards Izyum during an overnight operation. They had also cleared the village of Vilkhivka, immediately east of Kharkiv. Ukrainian soldiers discovered the corpses of Russian soldiers left behind in a pit, said Oleg Synegubov, a regional military administration head. “This is an example of how these scoundrels act even with their own,” he declared. The northern column is trying to link up with Russian forces advancing from Mariupol to the south. A number of Ukrainian soldiers from the Azov battalion still control a few central areas, more than a month into a Russian siege in which thousands of civilians have been killed. The regiment released a video that appeared to show a Russian armoured vehicle next to a beach being blown up. The occupants had been sent “to hell”, it said. Ukraine’s armed forces claim 19,300 Russian soldiers have been eliminated since the invasion, and 1,911 armoured vehicles destroyed. The Kremlin says the figure is lower, but Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has acknowledged that there have been terrible casualties. Russian rockets completely destroyed the airport and nearby buildings in the city of Dnipro. In occupied Kherson, troops broke up another large peaceful rally in the city’s main square. There was a much smaller pro-Russia rally in Novaya Kakhovka, in the southern Kherson region. Ukrainian officials described the meeting as fake, and part of an attempt by Russia to establish a so-called Kherson people’s republic. Yurii Sobolevskyi, the first deputy head of the Kherson regional council, described the rally as a “gathering of clowns”. “When thousands turn out of their own free will for a pro-Ukrainian rally, it’s a call of the heart,” Sobolevskyi said. “When a few dozen people carrying the flag of a nation of murderers try to make any kind of picture of a rally, these are purely theatrical actions,” he said, adding that those who attended were not Ukrainian citizens. As evidence of Russian atrocities including the torture of civilians continues to emerge, the White House is coming under pressure to declare the war an act of genocide. So far the Biden administration has been wary of adopting the term. Sullivan said Russia’s record of “systematically targeting civilians, the grisly murder of innocent people … absolutely constitutes war crimes”. But he stopped short of embracing the international legal concept of genocide. He told ABC News that a specialist unit within the state department was equipped to make that assessment. “That is a determination that we work through systematically,” he said. Under the UN definition, first codified in 1948, genocide constitutes killing and otherwise inflicting destruction “in whole or in part” on “a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.",News/World news,"New Russian war chief will bring more brutality in Ukraine, US warns",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/new-russian-war-chief-will-bring-more-brutality-in-ukraine-us-warns
4/11/2022,"The buoyancy and warmth of the British jazz singer Tina May, who has died of a brain tumour aged 60, were lifelong virtues that made a difficult art sound natural, drew every listener into an intimate space that seemed to be receiving her full attention, and allowed her to impart a beguiling freshness to lyrics that she might have sung hundreds of times before. Like many of the best vocal artists of the genre, May understood and liked the company of jazz’s instrumentalists, and closely studied their phrasing and timing – but she used these informal lessons in her own ways, interpreting lyrics in both English and fluent French. She avoided the temptation to mimic iconic American models except in an effortless alertness to swing, and shaped her own palette of blues inflections, beboppish rhythmic twists, wordless improv and inventive new lyrics to old songs. She was a shrewd handler of classic materials. As the Observer critic Dave Gelly wrote of May’s 2014 album My Kinda Love, “she can sing a straight melody, such as I’m Through with Love, and make it open like a flower”. Across the decades from her emergence as a theatre, cabaret and jazz performer in the late 1980s, May’s career reflected her openness to many ways of making music. She was at ease in big, hard-riffing outfits including the BBC Big Band and Stan Tracey’s orchestras, and shared breezy trad-to-mainstream gigs with Humphrey Lyttelton’s bands. She tiptoed through delicate chamber-jazz spaces requiring listening skills as delicate as her vocal ones, as she did in some closely attuned 2004 performances in a quirkily lyrical trio with the great British saxophonist Tony Coe and Nikki Iles, the pianist, who would become her regular playing partner and close friend. Iles was one of several world-class jazz pianists May was inventively at ease with - a group including Tracey, Enrico Pieranunzi, Patrick Villanueva and Ray Bryant. May was born in Gloucester, the younger daughter of Daphne (nee Walton), a cosmetics-company manager, and Harry May, a former professional footballer, and by then a manager in the engineering industry. Tina’s older sister, Vivienne, learned the guitar and violin, while Tina played the clarinet, until switching to lessons in classical singing at the age of 16. Their parents were both amateur pianists (show tunes for Daphne, stride-piano jazz for Harry), and Tina’s early influences as a child in the quiet village of Frampton-on-Severn were her father’s Fats Waller records. She attended Stroud high school and Cheltenham ladies’ college, and continued vocal lessons and clarinet studies, but when her mother died suddenly at the age of 46, she followed her distraught father’s wishes that she should pursue a more orthodox path than a musical life, and took up French at University College, Cardiff. The course took May to a year in Paris, where she began singing in jazz clubs with the city’s musicians. In a Paris cafe, she also met the budding impressionist and satirist Rory Bremner, with whom she formed a revue duet that found its way to the Edinburgh festival fringe. Returning to Cardiff, May sang in Frevo, a Latin American band with the folk/jazz guitarist Dylan Fowler, and in 1990 the group played the Bath festival alongside the Brazilian player and composer Egberto Gismonti, who invited May to guest with his trio on the gig. She divided her time between theatre workshops and jazz gigs (as a founder member of the Back Door Theatre Company, she was a regular at the Edinburgh Fringe), and continuing to sing with Fowler, but on moving to London, began recording the first of many albums for the Luton-based jazz indie 33 Jazz. Highlights among many fine releases for the label included the chanson-themed Jazz Piquant - N’Oublie Jamais (1998), with Coe on saxes and clarinet, One Fine Day (1999), a flawless standard-songs album with Iles and the reeds virtuoso Alan Barnes, the improvisationally impetuous May/Coe/Iles collaboration More Than You Know (2004), and a crackling classic-jazz get-together with Bryant for The Ray Bryant Songbook (2007). In later years, a standout May triumph was the heartfelt and skilful tribute she crafted to the American vocalist Mark Murphy with Cafe Paranoia (2017). May also recorded fruitfully for the Scottish labels Linn Records and Hep. Among wider collaborations, May’s career also included participation in the powerful Tracey orchestral account of Duke Ellington’s sacred music at Durham Cathedral (Duke Ellington - The Durham Connection, 1998), and in 2000 she recorded the popular show Ella Fitzgerald Song Book Revisited for Spotlite Records with her fellow singers Barbara Jay and Lee Gibson and the saxophonist Tommy Whittle. She also lectured and taught at Trinity College of Music, Leeds College of Music, Birmingham Conservatoire, the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, and the University of West London, as well as regularly attaching workshops and masterclasses to her own tours. A witty and inventive creator of lyrics for famous jazz instrumentals, May also wrote words for pieces by Bryant, Weather Report’s Joe Zawinul, the trumpeter Nat Adderley and the saxophonist Dexter Gordon. Just before her diagnosis at the end of 2021, May and her partner, the saxophonist and jazz historian Simon Spillett, were about to start work on a new venture stretching her librettist’s skills – setting words to the 1950s/60s compositions of the saxophonist Tubby Hayes. As she told the pianist Terence Collie in an interview/performance podcast last summer: “I’m happy when I’m learning new things. And there’s an awful lot of music out there.”’ May is survived by Simon; by her son, Ben, and daughter, Gemma, from her marriage to the drummer Clark Tracey, which ended in divorce; and by her sister.

4/11/2022,"Richard Attenborough, the late Oscar-winning director and chair of Channel 4, would be “turning in his grave” to see the broadcaster privatised, his son has claimed. Michael Attenborough said that Michael Grade – Channel 4’s chief executive from 1988 to 1997, who will monitor the privatisation process as chair of the broadcast regulator, Ofcom – was breaking a promise to his father by supporting the sell-off. In a letter to the Guardian, Attenborough, who is a theatre director, said: “Perhaps Lord Grade needs reminding of the promise he gave my father, Lord Attenborough, when he was running Channel 4 and my father was its chairman. Namely that he ‘would die in a ditch before he’d see Channel 4 privatised or its public service commitment in any way diminished’.“My father must be turning in his grave. I only wish he was here to face, expose and oppose him.” He added: “Grade knows only too well that once profit becomes the prime motive, undertakings about risk, diversity, regional spread, grassroots commissions etc will inevitably be eroded and tragically disappear.” As chief executive and chair of Channel 4 respectively in the late 1980s, Grade and Attenborough fought off the first attempt by Margaret Thatcher to privatise the channel she herself had greenlit in 1982. Attenborough said he had written privately to Grade, a Conservative peer, to express his dismay and that while Grade wrote back quickly, he failed to properly explain his change of heart. “He used a phrase like ‘the landscape of the media has changed massively and it’s not just as simple as there being the famous four main terrestrial channels’,” Attenborough said. “But that doesn’t really explain anything. He’s of course right – the landscape has massively changed. What I don’t understand is why the rationale behind this unique creation, Channel 4, needs to be altered.” He added: “I have openly said to him, Michael, you have betrayed everything that you went out and stood for and everything that you and dad fought for: how could you do such thing?” Channel 4 is unique in being publicly owned, thus retaining its independence, and with a public service remit. Attenborough said: “To turn it into a private enterprise, to privatise that, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of its inception. I’m absolutely bewildered by it. There are very few people on earth who can say they knew my dad better than I did and I am absolutely sure he would be spinning in his grave.” In a column for the Mail on Sunday, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who is leading the privatisation process, said Channel 4’s state ownership was a “restrictive incongruity in itself on to the scene, with juggernauts such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ upending the old order”. She said Netflix spent £779m on UK original productions in 2020 – more than twice as much as Channel 4. She also criticised Channel 4 for decreasing the amount it spent on new content by £158m “at a time when it should be investing in new programmes, technology and skills”. The Channel 4 board said in its 2020 annual report that it made the cuts during a period of huge uncertainty owing to the coronavirus pandemic “to ensure liquidity and safeguarding of the business through a wide range of situations”. Dorries said those criticising her were the “leftie luvvie lynch mob” and claimed that there was “no reason” the sale couldn’t result in more of Channel 4 moving north out of London.",News/Media,Lord Attenborough’s son says he would be ‘turning in his grave’ at Channel 4 sale,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/10/lord-attenboroughs-son-says-he-would-be-turning-in-his-grave-at-channel-4-sale
4/11/2022,"A rash of coronavirus infections among elites in Washington that came close to Joe Biden shows a new reality facing Americans including the president, his chief medical adviser said: that life will involve daily decisions about individual risk from Covid. “It’s going to be a person’s decision about the individual risk they’re going to take,” Dr Anthony Fauci told ABC’s This Week, adding that protocols protecting the president were “pretty strong”. Fauci and his host, Jonathan Karl, both attended last weekend’s Gridiron Dinner, a staple of the Washington social scene at which politicians, appointees and those who cover them gather for satirical speeches and roasts. Senior lawmakers who attended events with Biden were among those infected, prompting questions to Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, about how well the 79-year-old president was protected. “It’s important for [Biden] to be able to continue his presidential duties now, and even if he tests positive in the future,” Psaki, who herself has tested positive twice, told reporters on Friday. “This is a time where we are certainly living with the virus but we have a range of tools at our disposal to do that.” On Sunday, Karl said the Gridiron Dinner “had about 600 or so attendees. So far I believe we’re at 67 people that have tested positive who were at the dinner. I’m told at least so far no indication of anybody seriously ill. But, you know, about 10% of those [who attended were] infected. What is the lesson here?” Fauci said: “It’s going to be a person’s decision about the individual risk they’re going to take. “I think the people who run functions, who run big dinners … like the White House Correspondents’ [Dinner] or, thinking back, the Gridiron Dinner, are going to have to make a determination looking at the CDC guidelines and seeing where the trends are. “I mean, there are some places you go, not only is it required that you show proof of vaccination, but you have to have a negative test the day you go to a particular place.” On Sunday, the US Covid death toll stood at nearly 985,000. Fauci recommended that those who have not been vaccinated get the shot and those who have been vaccinated get recommended boosters. “The protocols to protect the president are pretty strong,” he said. “The president is vaccinated. He is doubly boosted. He got his fourth shot of an mRNA [vaccine]. “When people like myself and my colleagues are in the room with him closely for a considerable period of time – half-an-hour, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, all of us need to be tested. “Yes, he is mingling there, but we feel that the protocols around the president are sufficient to protect him. And as Jen said, the fact is he could get infected. We hope he doesn’t. We’d do everything we can do protect him. “But remember, he’s fully vaccinated. He’s doubly boosted and most of the time, people who get anywhere near him need to be tested. So we feel the protocol is a reasonable protocol.” Federal Covid guidelines have been relaxed but case rates have increased thanks to a subvariant of the Omicron strain which itself fuelled a steep rise last winter. “This is not unexpected, that you’re going to see an uptick when you pull back on the mitigation methods,” Fauci said. “If you look at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] calculation with their new metrics, it’s clear that most of the country, even though we’re seeing an uptick, is still in that green zone, which means that masking is not recommended, in the sense of not required in indoor settings. “… What we’re hoping happens, and I believe it will, is that you won’t see a concomitant comparable increase in severity, in the sense of … hospitalisations and deaths.” Fauci also said the public should remember that authorities have said measures including indoor-mask-wearing could be brought back if hospitalisations rise.",News/US news,Fauci says protocols to protect Biden ‘pretty strong’ amid rash of Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/fauci-biden-covid-cases-spread-gridiron-dinner-washington
4/11/2022,"Natasha Alexandrova was at home when three Russian soldiers banged on her front gate. It was 4 March. Vladimir Putin’s army had captured the city of Bucha, 18.5 miles (30km) north-west of Kyiv, after ferocious fighting. One unit parked at the bottom of Alexandrova’s street, Ivan Franko, next to a pine forest and a train track. The soldiers went from house to house. Alexandrova lived at No 10, together with her 26-year-old nephew, Volodymyr Cherednichenko, and his mother, Nadezhda. “They wanted to know who was living there. They demanded to see our documents and our mobile phones,” she said. “They didn’t beat us. But they had guns.” Alexandrova hid her phone and gave away a spare. Her nephew handed over his real mobile. It contained photos he had taken of a Russian military column, which Ukrainian forces had wiped out the previous week. The ambush took place in Bucha’s railway street. He had sent the images to a friend. “You are coming with us,” the soldiers told him. They escorted her nephew, dressed in a T-shirt and slippers, to No 6, a yellow-painted cottage. Alexandrova said she peered over the picket fence, half up a tree, and eavesdropped on the conversation. “He was crying and sobbing. They’d done something bad to his hand. He was cradling it. He told them repeatedly: ‘I don’t know any fascists.’” Later the soldiers shoved Cherednichenko into their armoured personnel carrier, which was parked in the property’s apple orchard. His mother brought him a warm coat and shoes. “They told us they were taking him into town for further interrogation and would bring him back after three days,” Alexandrova said. “Nadezhda begged them. She pleaded: ‘Return my son to me.’” For three weeks there was no news. Alexandrova talked to one of the Russians, who told her her nephew had been taken to a “non-active zone” in Belarus. “The soldier was 18. I asked him why he had come to Ukraine? He replied: ‘Money.’ Another said he was missing home, hadn’t eaten pelmeni [dumplings] for two weeks, and had been given rations for three days.” Cherednichenko’s mother continued to believe he was alive. On 29 March, Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv region, in a staggering setback for Moscow’s plan to conquer Ukraine. It seemed Putin had reckoned on a quick victory that would remove President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his pro-western government. Instead, his forces got bogged down and sustained massive casualties. Given an order to retreat, the troops rolled chaotically out of Ivan Franko Street and headed north, back towards the Belarusian border. They left behind smashed-up cars adorned with the letter V, a military symbol, some of them flattened by tanks after drunken joyrides. And a lot of bodies. One was found in a dank garden cellar in the neighbouring street, at the bottom of a brick staircase. It was a young man: Cherednichenko. “They made him kneel and shot him in the side of the head, through the ear,” Alexandrova said. “He was wearing the same coat his mother gave him.” In the cellar on Sunday was the bloodstained mattress her nephew had lain on in his final hours, captive and terrified. His was a cold, pitiless killing. There was a pink cuddly toy and the smell of death. Across Bucha, and the once pleasant suburbs of Hostomel and Irpin, similar crimes were committed during Russia’s savage and dark occupation. Residents say the soldiers confiscated mobile phones, demanded car keys and took people away. Some were shot in basements, hands bound. Others were killed inside their homes, or as they drove or cycled along the road. About a dozen people were murdered on Ivan Franko Street. They included brothers Viktor, 64, and Yuri, 62, who were left lying in a ditch next to the railway line. Sergei Gavrilyuk, a security guard, his brother-in-law Roman and an unknown person were also among the dead. “We couldn’t identify him. Half his face was blown off,” Alexandrova said of her nephew. She buried him in her back garden. The grave was small. Spring daffodils grew nearby. Last week, investigators dug up the body, to the barking of Alexandrova’s dogs. The family was able to hold a funeral service with Russian prayers. Other relatives were less fortunate. A pile of six charred bodies were found at the beginning of Ivan Franko. A older man lay in nearby Rydzanych Street for several weeks. Sitting in the kitchen of her neighbour at No 5A, Alexandrova talked about the horrors she had witnessed. After the Ukrainians launched an attack, a Russian soldier accused her of passing on information to the enemy, and threatened her with a grenade. She fetched water from a well with a bucket in one hand and a white flag in the other. Cherednichenko’s father fought with the Ukrainian army in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and started a conflict in Donbas, she said. He died last year. “Volodymyr wanted to be like his dad, to defend his country. We told him it was dangerous and to think of his mother. He was an electrician, and never a soldier,” she said. Over the weekend, Ukrainian rescuers sifted through the ruined street for mines and further human remains. The house where the Gavrilyuks had once lived was now a phantasmagoric mess. A shell had destroyed a Russian armoured vehicle and flung a sleeping bag and a pair of trousers into a tree. There were unexploded mortars, an empty whisky bottle and a white DAF lorry cab, which had been used by the Russians as a bench and checkpoint. The soldiers had looted everything: underwear, socks, gold, cash, laptops and drinks cabinets, residents said. The invaders were taken aback by the level of prosperity in Ukraine, the family added. The soldiers began stealing as soon as they arrived in Bucha, a popular weekend destination for Kyiv’s affluent classes. “The first stolen vehicle I saw with a V on it was a Tesla,” Alexandrova said. “They would steal cars and sleep in them.” Over in Railway Street, emergency workers were towing away mangled infantry vehicles one by one. A blue and white striped shirt, used by airborne troops, had been hung on a gun turret, as if awaiting its owner’s return. The Russian vehicles – about 30 of them – pointed mazily in different directions. It signified a panicked retreat. This scene of destruction cost Cherednichenko his life. Several locals wandered around on Sunday taking photos. One, Viktor, said he had talked to the Russians during the first day of their occupation of Bucha. “They told me they had orders to take Kyiv and to capture Zelenskiy,” he said, adding that two of them had told him they came from the Siberian republic of Buryatia, 4,350 miles away. Viktor put a few souvenirs from the battle into a bucket: a box used for machine gun ammunition and a chunk of tread. “They are going to the Bucha museum. It’s so our children won’t forget,” he said. Did he feel any sympathy for the Russian soldiers, some of whom perished? “No. They lived in our houses, put snipers on our streets, invaded our country. If we only had a catapult, we would still fight them.”",News/World news,‘We couldn’t identify him’: Bucha tells of a dark and savage occupation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/bucha-tells-of-a-dark-and-savage-occupation-deaths-russian-forces
4/11/2022,"Emma Lavelle, the trainer of Eclair Surf, said on Sunday morning that her eight-year-old gelding had become the second horse to die as a result of an injury sustained in the Grand National at Aintree on Saturday, further confounding hopes raised in the immediate aftermath – and shared widely online – that all 40 runners had returned to their stables with “no fatalities” in the race. Lavelle said on Twitter that Eclair Surf had sustained “a traumatic head injury” at the third fence, and that after being treated at the racecourse he had been transferred to Liverpool University’s equine hospital, where “he was treated all night, however very sadly it was not to be”. The news that Eclair Surf had been put down followed the announcement by Paul Nolan on Saturday evening that Discorama had suffered a fatal injury between the 12th and 13th fences. He was the third horse in the last three runnings of the National to die as a result of an injury while galloping rather than in a fall. This year’s Grand National is the first since 2011 in which two horses have suffered fatal injuries. There were no fatalities in six consecutive runnings between 2013 and 2018, while a single horse died in both 2019 and 2021. Elle Est Belle, trained by Dan Skelton, also died during racing at Aintree on Saturday, having suffered a suspected heart attack before collapsing on the run-in in the Mersey Novice Hurdle. Neil Mulholland’s Solwara One, meanwhile, was the first of four horses to die at this year’s meeting, having broken down in a handicap hurdle on Friday. “We are all extremely saddened by the fatal injuries at the Grand National festival,” James Given, the British Horseracing Authority’s director of equine health and welfare, said on Sunday, “though no one will be more upset than the trainers, owners and stable staff who will have given these horses unparalleled care throughout their lives. “Following a detailed review in 2011-12 the BHA and Aintree racecourse worked together to introduce a number of significant measures which have helped in the intervening years to reduce the injury rate at the Grand National meeting. “However, welfare and safety is an ever-evolving commitment and the BHA works constantly alongside our racecourses to further improve the sport’s safety record and reduce avoidable risk.” Screens around the injured horses were visible to millions of TV viewers, first as the field was directed around the third fence on the second circuit and then as they passed the point where Discorama had earlier been pulled up. The race on Saturday was off almost to time at 17.18 and Noble Yeats, the 50-1 winner, crossed the line just over nine minutes later. At 17.50, Racing TV’s Twitter feed listed the first 10 horses across the line, with an additional statement that “all horses are OK”. This followed a statement issued to broadcasters by Jockey Club Racecourses’ on-site media team which read: “All horses returning to stables. (No fatalities. Further assessment will now be carried out where necessary).” Hexham 1.00 Shaw’s Cross1.30 Hatos2.05 Marsh Wren2.40 Without Conviction3.15 East Street 3.50 Shanroe Street4.20 Theatre Man  Windsor  1.50 Papas Girl 2.20 Monsieur Patat2.55 Zephina 3.30 Equality 4.05 Yummylicious (nb)4.40 Maplewood5.10 He’s A Latchico5.40 Eklil Pontefract  1.55 Comedian Leader2.30 Cotai Class3.05 Autumn Festival (nap)3.40 Huddle Up 4.15 Distinction4.50 Beggarman5.20 Esken Rose5.50 Some Nightmare  ITV Racing, the Racing Post and At The Races used the same statement as the basis for tweets which have since been deleted. The tweet deleted by At The Races read: “Brilliant news! All 40 runners have returned to their stables after the Grand National” with a hand-clapping emoji. Ed Chamberlin, ITV Racing’s lead presenter, was more circumspect, telling viewers shortly before the end of its coverage: “The horses have also all come back to the stables. Some are being assessed, in particular Discorama. If we get any news before we go off air, we’ll bring it to you first.” While the brief statement from the course did not claim that all the runners had returned uninjured, the inclusion of the words “no fatalities” raised hopes among fans that the incidents which led to screens being erected had not been as serious as many had feared. As a result, when news broke nearly three hours after the race that Discorama had been put down, there was an angry reaction from some social media users, who felt that they had been misled. Some also accused the course of trying to conceal news of the seriousness of the injuries to Discorama and Eclair Surf until after ITV’s coverage had concluded. A spokesperson for Aintree Racecourse said: “Following the Grand National we provide a preliminary information update regarding the welfare of horses before ITV shows the race re-run. This contained accurate information provided by the veterinary team. We confirmed that all horses would be returning to the stables, there had been no fatalities in the race and some horses would require further assessment. We then provided updates to the media based on those further assessments. We always provide accurate information in a timely manner.”",Sport/Sport,Eclair Surf becomes second horse to die after Grand National on Saturday,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/eclair-surf-becomes-second-horse-to-die-after-grand-national
