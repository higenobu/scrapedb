2/8/2022,"(Reuters) - Rumble Inc, a YouTube-style website popular among U.S. conservatives, has offered Joe Rogan $100 million over four years for all his shows, days after the podcaster apologized for using racial slurs in his content. Rogan is also facing backlash for COVID-19 misinformation in his program hosted on Spotify, after singer-songwriters including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled their content from the streaming platform. The incidents prompted Spotify to add a ""content advisory"" to any episode featuring discussion of COVID-19 as scientists and medical professionals urged the platform to prevent Rogan from spreading falsehoods. ""Dear Joe, we stand with you, your guests and your legion of fans in desire for real conversation,"" Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in an email to Rogan posted on Rumble's twitter page on Monday. ""How about you bring all your shows to Rumble, both old and new, with no censorship, for 100 million bucks over four years?"" Rogan did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. His show, ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" has become one of the most popular podcasts on Spotify after the streaming platform started featuring it in 2020. The Wall Street Journal had then reported that Spotify's exclusive licensing deal for the show was worth more than $100 million. Shares of CF Acquisition VI, the SPAC that has agreed to take Rumble public, surged more than 18% on the news. The deal, announced in December, had valued Rumble at $2.1 billion. Launched in 2013, Canada-based Rumble has also entered an agreement to deliver video and streaming for Truth Social, former U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed social media app. (Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",Business/Reuters,Podcaster Joe Rogan gets $100 million offer from Trump-affiliated site Rumble,https://news.yahoo.com/podcaster-joe-rogan-gets-100-180940651.html
2/8/2022,"Jailed porn star Ron Jeremy is asking a Los Angeles judge to break up his serial rape case into separate trials for each of his 21 sex assault accusers. At a hearing Monday, the judge said he was ready to rule on Jeremy’s motion, filed Feb. 2, but prosecutors asked for more time to respond to the lengthy and novel severance request that seemed to catch them by surprise. More from Rolling Stone Mother-Daughter Duo Charged With Murder in Illegal Butt Injections Case Face a Judge She Asked the Army to Investigate a Rape Trial. They Fired Her Young Women Remember Chris Noth, Accused of Sexual Assault, As a 'Sleazy' Figure Around New York Jeremy, 68, who was born Ronald Hyatt, argues his right to due process will be violated if he’s forced into one umbrella trial for his long list of charges ranging from assaulting minors and drugging women for sex to forcible groping. “Mr. Hyatt moves to sever the allegations related to each individual Jane Doe, so that separate jury trials would result for each one of the Jane Does,” the motion reads. Jeremy’s attorneys also expressed concern in their motion that media coverage of the trial could sway jury opinion. “Mr. Hyatt must be tried for what he did, not for who he is perceived to be,” they wrote in the motion. “Here, it is clear from the prosecution’s November 8, 2021, briefing, replete with references to Harvey Weinstein, Rolling Stone magazine, YouTube, Daily Mail articles and Mr. Hyatt’s ‘oafish, goofball demeanor,’ that the prosecution seeks to try Mr. Hyatt not only in this court but also in the court of public opinion. “Allowing Mr. Hyatt’s jury to hear about dozens of allegations of alleged misconduct will prevent his jurors from judging him fairly on each charged count and from scrupulously applying the burden of proof.” Wearing a yellow surgical mask and a brown jail uniform, indicating that he is still in the jail’s medical ward (as he was when he last appeared in court in December), Jeremy didn’t speak throughout the hearing. He wore his snow-white hair long and also sported an unruly beard. Before Jeremy was brought in, his attorneys Stuart Goldfarb and Kate Hardie had a sidebar with Judge George Lomeli, during which they objected to a photo request from a member of the media. “I’ve been trying to get his beard shaved for a month at the jail,” Goldfard said, adding that he asked the watch commander to make sure it happens by Jeremy’s next court appearance. The judge denied the media photo request, saying he would allow it at the next hearing. In response to the motion, Deputy District Attorney Paul Thompson said that he and fellow Deputy District Attorney Marlene Martinez needed more time to address it. Judge Lomeli then said he would postpone his ruling until a follow-up hearing on March 3. In August 2021, Jeremy — long nicknamed the Hedgehog for his hirsute appearance — was indicted and charged with 34 counts of sexual assault from 21 complaining witnesses, including a dozen counts of forcible rape. The charges involve women ranging in age from 15 to 51 at the time of the assault, and go back as far as 1996. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. According to court documents, Jeremy allegedly used his role as a cuddly porn industry elder statesman of sorts to disarm women and entice them into secluded areas, such as hotel bathrooms. Many of the alleged assaults took place at the Rainbow Bar and Grill, a West Hollywood dining establishment where Jeremy was reportedly a regular. In the defense motion, Jeremy’s attorneys argued that due to the sheer number and breadth of the allegations against him, Jeremy would need to have separate trials to address the individual facts of each case: “the sheer fact that Mr. Hyatt will have to defend himself against 24 accusers and 25 incidents that took place over the course of nearly 40 years will necessarily mean that his defense to every charge will not be the same,” the motion reads. Jeremy’s attorneys were particularly concerned about the accounts of two accusers who were underage at the time of the alleged assault, including a then-15-year-old woman who has accused Jeremy of allegedly digitally penetrating her at a rave, and a then-17-year-old who alleged Jeremy raped her in her bedroom. “Hearing that Mr. Hyatt had allegedly assaulted minor victims would make it hard for the jurors in this case to judge him fairly on the allegations that did not involve minors,” the motion reads. Jeremy’s legal team applied the same argument to the two Jane Does who accused Jeremy of drugging them before sexually assaulting them, such as Jane Doe 10, who alleges that she became ill after Jeremy bought her a drink at the Rainbow and that he later digitally penetrated her on a couch at his friend’s home without her consent. “The implication that Mr. Hyattt drugged or poisioned [the Janes Does] is prejudicial and highly likely to inflame Mr. Hyatt’s jurors,” Jeremy’s attorneys wrote in the motion. “Consequently, those allegations should be severed from the remaining counts.” In 2017, Rolling Stone published the accounts of nearly a dozen women who alleged that Jeremy had forcibly groped them, digitally penetrated them, or had sexual intercourse with them without their consent.”If anyone was ever made to feel uncomfortable by ANY of our interactions, I’m deeply sorry,” he told Rolling Stone at the time in response to the allegations against him. “That was never my intention and it breaks my heart in half.” Rolling Stone published the accounts of an additional dozen women with similar allegations against Jeremy after Jeremy was charged in 2020 with having sexually assaulted four women in incidents dating back to 2014. He has continued to deny all charges against him.

2/8/2022,"YANQING, China — The slopes snake through jagged cliffs on the outskirts of a desert. Massive rock faces loom on either side. Snow rarely falls, but wind often whirls, and neither tourists nor residents ever ski here. But Olympians now do, because when China won the right to host these Winter Games, it embarked on a three-year project to build the National Alpine Ski Center “from scratch.” It was once uninhabited “steep mountain ridges,” as Li Changzhou, a deputy general manager with Beijing Enterprises Group, the property owner and constructor, said. Everything around it still is. Shrubby trees and barren hillside line the road that winds up Xiaohaituo Mountain. Everything outside the venue is some shade of brown. But then there are thin ribbons of white, visible from airplanes and miles away, striking proof that the Olympics have ventured outside their natural habitat. Beijing built them because it had no other choice. It bid for the 2022 Games without an Olympic-standard Alpine resort. So, shortly after winning an International Olympic Committee vote in 2015, it began blasting out massive chunks of its tallest mountain, near the Great Wall in this suburban district, Yanqing. It contracted dozens of foreign experts to turn rugged terrain into European-style slopes. Alpine legend Bernhard Russi designed them. American cowboy Tom Johnston manicured them. But first, this water-scarce region had to provide him with snow. So, local authorities began reaching far and wide for the natural resources to create it. Most international Alpine skiing competition requires snow-making these days. Beijing’s Olympic operation, though, is especially intensive. China, working with premier artificial snow supplier TechnoAlpin, built miles-long networks of pipeline to connect reservoirs outside Yanqing to another reservoir at Xiaohaituo Mountain. That smaller reservoir stores the water being used to coat the Olympic slopes. Pumps and hundreds of snow guns then turn it into the white surface you’ll see on TV. The skiers who’ll use it actually like it. The artificial snow, as U.S. star Mikaela Shiffrin said Friday, is “grippy” and “aggressive.” The setting, though, looks and feels odd. The IOC had warned that it would. A bid evaluation report explained long ago that “there could be no snow outside of the racecourse, especially in Yanqing, impacting the visual perception of the snow setting.” Organizers seemingly sought to address these concerns. Trees were planted in rigid, uniform rows, in an attempt to lend a foresty feel to the scenery. The snow guns have tried to dress some of them in white. The Beijing Organizing Committee once released renderings that depicted the Olympic venue as a recreation of the European Alps. The reality is much different. Small patches of leftover snow — perhaps fake, perhaps real — line some sections of mountainside. The rest of it looks dry and dead. On the other side of these mountains is the Gobi, the sixth-large desert in the world, and the reason none of this is surprising. The climate is cold enough. But it is arid. Vegetation is parched. Forecasts suggest some snow could arrive next weekend. But nowhere near enough to change the visuals. The most prominent element, instead, will continue to be wind. High-speed gusts postponed Sunday’s men’s downhill, one day after also cancelling a training session. “I think it is always gonna be windy,” U.S. skier Bryce Bennett said here Sunday. “It's just how this place is.”",World/Yahoo Sports,How Beijing built Olympic ski slopes ‘from scratch’ on the outskirts of a desert,https://news.yahoo.com/how-beijing-built-olympic-ski-slopes-from-scratch-on-the-outskirts-of-a-desert-094831125.html
2/8/2022,"The Wall Street Journal ripped into Donald Trump and Republicans after the party doubled down in its support of the former president. The newspaper also praised former Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to cave to Trump’s pressure to overturn the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021. “Mr. Pence was presiding over the vote counting as President of the Senate, but he refused Mr. Trump’s pressure to disqualify electors from some closely contested states,” the editorial stated. “It was Mr. Pence’s finest hour.” But that, the newspaper said, wasn’t common in today’s Republican Party. “Mr. Pence stands out as a rare Republican these days willing to stand up to Mr. Trump’s disgraceful behavior after the election,” the newspaper’s editorial said. “Too many in the GOP seem to have lost their constitutional moorings in thrall to one man.” The Journal warned the GOP about the cost of sticking to Trump no matter what, given his less-than-stellar track record at the ballot box: The conventional wisdom now is that Mr. Trump controls the Republican Party and can have the 2024 nomination if he wants it. But someone should remind voters that Mr. Trump ended as a three-time election loser.

2/8/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — Britain on Monday firmly rejected a statement from China that affirmed Beijing's support for Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands, as relations between London and Asia's leading power remain strained. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a tweet that the United Kingdom “completely"" rejected ""any questions over sovereignty of the Falklands.” “The Falklands are part of the British family and we will defend their right to self determination. China must respect the Falklands’ sovereignty,” she wrote. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Argentine counterpart Alberto Fernandez issued a joint statement on Sunday that said China “reaffirms its support for Argentina’s demand for the full exercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands,” using the Argentine name for the territory. The two leaders met as Fernandez was in Beijing for the Winter Olympics. Argentina believes the Falklands were illegally taken from it in 1833 and invaded the British colony in 1982. The United Kingdom sent troops and Argentina lost the two-month war for the South Atlantic archipelago in a conflict that claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 British soldiers. Argentina still claims the islands. London says the Falklands are a self-governing entity under its protection. Relations with China have already been strained on multiple fronts, including Britain's joining a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics to protest China's human rights record. The joint statement also said Argentina “reaffirms its adherence to the one-China principle,"" a reference to China's claim to the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. “China and Argentina agree to carry on with close communication and coordination in international affairs, and safeguard the overall interests of the two countries and other developing countries,"" the statement said. Xi and Fernandez also pledged closer economic cooperation and signed a memorandum of understanding on Argentina joining the “Belt and Road Initiative,” Xi’s signature project to build Chinese infrastructure worldwide. China has overtaken Brazil as Argentina’s main commercial partner, and if talks with Beijing remain on track, Argentina would become the first of the four major Latin American economies to join the initiative. “Belt and Road Initiative integration won’t be a paradigm shift but rather a continuation of broader trends of growing Argentina-China engagement,” said Pepe Zhang, director and fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. During his visit, Fernandez also laid a wreath at the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, where the embalmed body of Mao Zedong, the communist revolutionary who founded the People's Republic, is displayed inside a crystal sarcophagus. ___ Associated Press writer Débora Rey in Buenos Aires, Argentina contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,UK rebukes China for supporting Argentina's Falklands claim,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-rebukes-china-supporting-argentinas-115952404.html

2/8/2022,"Archeologists working on Britain's HS2 railway line uncovered a late Roman cemetery. 40 of the skeletons were decapitated, many with their heads between their legs. The decapitated skeletons could have been criminals or outcasts, archeologists said. About 40 beheaded skeletons were among 425 bodies found in a late Roman cemetery uncovered by archeologists in southern England. The team of around 50 archeologists made the discovery during an excavation at Fleet Marston, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on the route of the multi-billion pound high-speed rail link that is currently under construction, HS2 said. Around 10% of the bodies were decapitated. Many had their heads placed between their legs or next to their feet. Archeologists said that one interpretation could be that the decapitated skeletons were criminals or outcasts, although decapitation was a ""normal, albeit marginal, burial rite"" during the late Roman period. Video: 3,300-year-old sphinxes discovered at the 'Temple of a Million Years' Over the next few years, the researchers will study the exhumed skeletons, offering an opportunity to learn more about Roman civilization's historic lifestyles, diet, and beliefs.

The team also uncovered over 1,200 coins at the site, along with several lead weights indicating that this was an area of trade and commerce. Domestic objects including spoons, pins, and brooches were found, as well as gaming dice and bells which suggest gambling and religious activity took place there too.

2/8/2022,"By Anton Zverev DONETSK, Ukraine (Reuters) -A Russian-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine said on Monday that full-scale war could break out there at any time and his forces might need to turn to Moscow for support. Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, said there was a high likelihood of a war that would bring huge casualties, although it would be ""madness"" to embrace such a conflict. ""First of all we rely on ourselves, but we do not rule out that we will be forced to turn to Russia if Ukraine, with the support of Western countries, passes a certain line,"" he told Reuters in an interview in his fortified office. Some 15,000 people have been killed since 2014 in fighting between the Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian army, according to the government in Kyiv. Tensions have risen sharply since November, when Russia started massing a force of more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, raising fears of a much bigger war despite Moscow's insistence it has no plan to invade. Pushilin said the separatists had gaps in their weaponry when it came to electronic warfare, air defences and the ability to counter the Ukrainian army's Turkish-made drones. He said they were not in contact with Russia about providing weapons, but noted an ""important statement"" by a ruling party politician in the Russian parliament last month who said Moscow should supply certain types of arms to the separatists in Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk. In a second Reuters interview, an influential commander in the breakaway region, Alexander Khodakovsky, urged Russia to send 30,000 soldiers to reinforce the separatists and operate new weapons systems he hoped Moscow would supply. ""CONSTANT THREAT"" Russia says the Ukraine conflict is a civil war in which it has no involvement, but senior Ukrainian government sources say Russia has deployed a military force of about 2,000 to support an estimated 35,000 separatists in the eastern Donbass region. ""Russian forces have been waging war in Donbass for eight years,"" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said. Pushilin declined to give a clear answer when asked about the likelihood or desirability of Russia recognising his breakaway territory as an independent state, as some deputies in the Russian parliament are urging President Vladimir Putin to do. He said it would be ""selfish"" to focus only on the separatist regions and ignore the interests of ethnic Russians in other parts of Ukraine. Without providing evidence, he said there was a ""constant threat of military actions"" on the Ukrainian side, and clear signs of active preparations. Ukraine has repeatedly denied Russian accusations that it is planning to take back the breakaway regions by force. ""I'm even talking about some kind of big war. Which I would like to avoid, because this war could be the last one for humanity,"" Pushilin said, accusing the West of exacerbating the situation. He criticised ""naive"" statements by U.S. officials that the timing of any conflict would be influenced by whether the ground was frozen. ""It could all start at any moment, regardless of weather conditions. Sometimes unfavourable weather conditions are good cover for launching an attack.""

2/8/2022,"Archaeologists have discovered what might be the last Roman gladiator arena ever built. And it is a long way from the capital. In December 2021, a group of archaeologists supervising a boathouse construction along the Rhine River in Kaiseraugst, Switzerland, uncovered the remains of a 4th-century Roman amphitheater. And they believe it’s the youngest amphitheater ever discovered. Possibly, this discovery clocks in as one of the last-ever-built gladiator arenas we have unearthed. The discovery occurred in what was formerly the town of Augusta Raurica during the Roman Empire. Kaiseraugst, located in the Swiss canton of Aargau near France and Germany’s border, gets its name from the Roman city. The canton of Aargau Department of Education, Culture and Sport released their findings in a statement. (We first saw this at Smithsonian magazine.) According to the statement, this is the second Roman amphitheater discovered in Aargau and the third Augusta Raurica. The discovery was especially surprising given the site itself. Archeologists found the amphitheater at an abandoned Roman quarry. This means there was no reason to encounter any walls whatsoever… Let alone the peculiar oval-shaped walls of an amphitheater. Further excavation confirmed that researchers had, in fact, stumbled into an amphitheater. One that may have seen use for things ranging from public executions, chariot races, to, of course, gladiator fights. The findings better fleshed out the Roman amphitheater schematics, which also included the arena’s entrances and evidence of wooden posts for the grandstands and a tribune. The archaeologists noted that the building materials and location atop a previously-abandoned quarry suggest it dates sometime during late antiquity—around the 4th century. It all makes sense given the city’s importance as a military fortress doing this time period. Interestingly, the arena wasn’t all that big. When most people think gladiator arenas, the Colosseum in Rome usually comes to mind. But just as a high school football stadium and an NFL arena differ vastly, amphitheaters certainly vary. The recently discovered Augusta Raurica arena was about 50 meters long and 40 meters wide (164 ft x 131 ft). This pales in comparison to the Colosseum’s 189 meters by 156 meters (615 ft x 510 ft) with a cushy six-acre resting place. But then again, Maximus Decimus Meridius certainly needed the room. More notably, the Raurica arena is even smaller than the average amphitheater. Given it’s one of a few in the ancient Roman town, it makes sense. They can’t all hit regulation standard. Considering the gladiator arena discovery occurred at a construction site, it’s natural to wonder what might happen to it. Luckily, the statement indicated that the construction plans would likely change to best preserve this amphitheater. This isn’t too surprising considering Kaiseraugst is a known Roman site and features so many remnants of its antiquity roots. Still, we appreciate a firm confirmation that preservation ranks as a priority. We wouldn’t want to lose this piece of history. Especially a Roman amphitheater so young.

2/8/2022,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has shut down a news website for publishing a gruesome image of a man holding a large knife in one hand and what was said to be the head of his wife in his hand, the state-run IRAN newspaper reported Monday. According to the report, a media supervisory board on Sunday closed the Rokna website because of its continuing to “publish images and issues that violate public decency.” Authorities have arrested the man and his brother on charges of killing the man's wife on Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz. The photograph and a video of the victim have had tens of thousands of views on social media. The semi-official news agency ILNA quoted Sunday police officer Col. Sohrab Hosseinnejad as saying the two “defendants confessed to the murder during the police investigation and were introduced to the judicial authority.” It cited family problems as the likely motive for the killing, but added that the case is under investigation. Police didn't release the men’s names or elaborate on the killing or who filmed the video. Such violence is rare in Iran. In April 2021, a 50-year-old man shot to death his 9-year-old son and seven of his in-laws in the city of Ahvaz. In 2020, in the northern Gilan province, a father decapitated his daughter because he did not approve of her boyfriend. Rokna was started in 2016 and now has more than 20,000 subscribers on Telegram, a free social instant messaging service that provides video calling, file sharing and other features. Iran has had a long history of closures of media outlets. In 2020, authorities shut down Jahan-e Sanat newspaper after it quoted a former member of the national coronavirus taskforce as saying that the country’s death toll from the pandemic could be 20 times higher than officially provided figures.",World/Associated Press,Iran shuts down news website over image of decapitated woman,https://news.yahoo.com/iran-shuts-down-news-website-071912817.html
2/8/2022,"Low levels of vitamin D prior to catching COVID-19 were linked to worse illness, a study found. Vitamin D helps bolster the immune system to tackle viruses that attack the lungs, researchers said. Vitamin D is ""one piece of the complex puzzle"" underlying severe COVID-19, the scientists cautioned. Israeli scientists said they found ""striking"" differences in the chances of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 when they compared patients who had sufficient vitamin D levels prior to contracting the disease with those who didn't. A study published on Thursday in the research journal PLOS One found that about half of people who were vitamin D deficient before getting COVID-19 developed severe illness, compared to less than 10% of people who had sufficient levels of the vitamin in their blood. We know vitamin D is vital for bone health, but its role in protecting against severe COVID-19 is less well established. The latest research was the first to examine vitamin D levels in people prior to them contracting COVID-19, the study authors said. Dr. Amiel Dror, a study author and physician at the Galilee Medical Center, said of the findings, ""We found it remarkable, and striking, to see the difference in the chances of becoming a severe patient when you are lacking in vitamin D compared to when you're not,"" The Times of Israel reported. The findings come from 253 people admitted to Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, Israel, between April 7, 2020, and February 4, 2021 — a period before the highly infectious Omicron variant emerged. Dror said the findings suggested that vitamin D helped bolster the immune system to deal with viruses that attack the respiratory system. ""This is equally relevant for Omicron as it was for previous variants,"" Dror said. The research doesn't prove that vitamin D protects against COVID-19 and isn't a green light to avoid vaccines and take vitamins instead. Vaccines cut the risk of Omicron hospitalization, particularly after a booster, by up to 90%, the UK Health Security Agency said. Most vitamin D comes from direct sunlight on the skin. It's also found in foods such as fatty fish, mushrooms, and egg yolks and in supplements. Vitamin D levels of more than 20 nanograms per milliliter are considered sufficient for most people, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which is the benchmark used by the researchers from Bar-Ilan University and Galilee Medical Center. Research compiled before the emergence of COVID-19 and published in The Lancet found that vitamin D cut the risk of other respiratory infections, compared with dummy drugs. But for COVID-19, early findings have been inconsistent: Some studies have found a link between low vitamin D levels and severe COVID-19, while others have concluded that the vitamin wasn't protective. It wasn't clear — even from those studies with results showing a positive correlation between low vitamin D levels and severe COVID-19 — if depleted vitamin D came before or after people became sick, the Israeli researchers said. Despite the new data from Israel, we still don't know if low vitamin D levels cause people with COVID-19 to develop serious disease. Underlying conditions that reduce vitamin D can also make people more vulnerable to severe COVID-19, for example. The Israeli researchers cautioned that vitamin D was ""one piece of the complex puzzle"" underlying severe COVID-19, in addition to comorbidities, genetic predisposition, dietary habits, and geographic factors. ""Our study warrants further studies investigating if and when vitamin D supplementation among vitamin D deficient individuals in the community impacts the outcome of an eventual COVID-19 episode,"" they said.

2/8/2022,"Feb. 7—Dec. 3, a Friday, was the day that everything changed for the Kurtz family. Linda Kurtz was sitting on the floor in the living room of her Reading home. Her adult son Jason was behind her on the sofa. And her husband, Ken, was a few feet away on an easy chair. All three were fighting severe cases of COVID. All three needed help. ""Jason said, 'Dad's already gone,' "" Linda said, recalling that fateful day while sitting in that same easy chair last week. ""Before we even called 9-1-1 he was dead."" The rest of that day is a blur for Linda. She knows that someone did, at some point, call 9-1-1. An ambulance arrived and whisked her and her son away. Linda would end up hospitalized at Reading Hospital and a rehab facility for 17 days. Jason was taken directly into intensive care at Reading Hospital. The 47-year-old would never leave. Nine days after COVID took his father's life, it would claim Jason's as well. The days and weeks since have been difficult for Linda, to say the least. Her world was shattered by COVID. Reliving it all — the fear and confusion, the loss and longing — is painful. But Linda says her family's story is one that desperately needs to be told. ""I would like people to know what can happen,"" she said. ""Don't think it can't happen to you, because we didn't think it could happen to us."" Dealing with the pandemic differently Before the COVID pandemic breached the borders of Berks County, changing just about every aspect of daily life in its wake, Linda and Ken were a pretty active couple. Both retired, they enjoyed going to auctions and flea markets, with Ken always keeping an eye out for a remote controlled plane kit he could build at his basement workbench. They enjoyed heading out to the movie theater, Linda said. And they liked to travel, often taking trips to their time-share in Virginia or to spots in New York state. COVID forced them to change their ways. ""We stopped going out,"" Linda said. ""When COVID hit, at that point everything stopped dead. We weren't people to go out and be in crowds."" Linda said she pretty much only ventured out to get groceries. Most times she was accompanied by Jason, who was out of work and living with his parents. When vaccinations became available, Linda and Ken got their first two shots. They didn't, however, get their boosters. Jason was a different story. ""We just could not persuade him to get a shot,"" Linda said. Jason refused to get vaccinated. According to his mother and older brother, Jim, his stance was based on a mix of stubbornness, overconfidence, conspiracy theories and religion. ""He was one of those people who thought if he got COVID he'd get over it,"" Linda said. Jim, who is Jason's only sibling, said his brother shared a similar sentiment with him. But other factors were at play, too. Jim said his little brother's politics played a role, as did his unfounded belief that the COVID vaccines are a ""great social experiment"" the government is performing on the public. Jason also cited religion when speaking to Jim about vaccines, saying that getting a shot is ""the mark of the beast."" In conversation after conversation, Jim tried to reason with Jason. He tried to provide facts to his younger brother. He tried to keep him safe. ""I had that talk way too many times,"" Jim Kurtz said. ""But it was one of those things where if it was coming from his big brother he didn't listen to it."" Jim, who lives in Maryland, said knowing his parents didn't have their booster shots and that his brother wasn't vaccinated at all worried him. He had been taking the pandemic more seriously than the rest of his family, he said. He's fully vaccinated and boosted, and he and his wife are able to work from home and seldom venture out. And when they do — to pick up a takeout meal or for a quick stop in a store — it's a different situation than the one in Pennsylvania. Maryland, he said, still has a statewide mask mandate. ""I was just sitting here cringing,"" he said. ""I was scared for them."" Jim's fear grew when he learned his parents and brother were planning to gather with family this past Thanksgiving. Linda said she didn't share her son's worries. ""I wasn't nervous, but I knew some of the people who would be there were not vaccinated,"" she said. ""But I wasn't even concerned that something could happen."" Something did happen. Of the 15 people that gathered that day, 10 ended up getting COVID. Three of them — Ken, Jason and Ken's brother, Russell Kurtz — would die of the disease. Sickness, panic and loss The day after Thanksgiving, Linda started feeling sick. She didn't think she had COVID, claiming that she didn't feel all that bad. Jim tells a different story, saying he thinks a ""COVID fog"" may be altering her memories. Jim said that when he talked to his family on Black Friday his mom was ""off."" For example, he said, she had poured a fruit cup onto a paper towel instead of into a bowl. When Jim talked to his family the next day, it was a phone conversation with Jason. His brother told him that their mom was in the hospital and that she, their dad and him all had COVID. Linda wasn't admitted to the hospital that time, instead being treated and discharged. When Jim called again the following Tuesday, he learned his mom had broken her shoulder. No one knew how it had happened. In that conversation, Jim said, his dad seemed to be doing well. He was chipper and jokey. But Jim was still concerned. ""I said, 'You guys keep an eye on each other,' "" he recalled, saying he told his family that if they start feeling worse to call for help. Jim called again Wednesday, this time finding his dad grumpy and not feeling well. His mom was asleep. He skipped Thursday, but called once more about 3 p.m. on Friday afternoon. That was Dec. 3. Jim didn't get an answer on the house phone. Calls to his mom's and brother's cellphones went to voicemail. An iMessage went unanswered. He tried again later that night with the same result. And Saturday morning the story was the same. ""I had no idea what was going on,"" he said. Jim's mother-in-law called Reading Hospital about 2 p.m. on that Saturday and found out that Linda had been admitted to the hospital. Jim called the hospital himself and found out that his brother was in intensive care. The hospital had no record for his father. Jim assumed his dad was likely sitting in the hospital waiting room by himself. Having undergone knee replacement on both knees earlier in the year, he wouldn't have been able to drive himself home. ""At that point in time I didn't know what had happened,"" he said. ""I was worried about my dad being in the waiting room alone."" Jim reached out to a few of his dad's brothers. One was eventually able to get in touch with Linda. ""When he called me back he was crying,"" Jim said. Just after 4 p.m., Jim learned his father had died of COVID the previous day at his home. Linda had only found out just before that her husband had passed away. The hospital chaplain had come to her room to tell her that Jason had been right. Ken had passed away on his easy chair shortly before an ambulance arrived to take her and her son to the hospital. Unfortunately, the family's story didn't end there. A few days later, on Dec. 12, Linda was allowed to visit Jason. He had been put on a respirator and was suffering from kidney failure. Jason wasn't conscious, but his mother said she had a feeling he could hear her as she talked to him. ""I told him, 'This is mom,' "" she said. ""I gave him permission to go. We have a strong Christian background, so I said, 'God will take care of you now because I can't.' "" Thirty minutes after her visit, Jason was gone. ""It's really surreal,"" Jim said of the rapid loss of his father and brother. ""This is what I was afraid of."" The day after Jason's death, Russell, Jason's uncle and Ken's brother, died of COVID at his home in Lancaster County. A caring husband and a precocious son Linda was a senior in high school when she met Ken in 1969. A friend of Linda's was seeing a friend of Ken's and the couple set them up on a blind date. Linda recalls they went to see a movie, but can't remember which film they saw. ""I liked him right away,"" she said. ""He was very nice."" The two dated for a few weeks, and then Ken took Linda to her prom. About a year later they were married, wed in a simple courthouse ceremony. She was 19 and he was 20. The couple moved into their home in the first block of Arlington Street, the one were Ken would one day die and were Linda still lives. Ken worked at a bakery until retiring in the 1990s. He loved to bake and cook, handling most of the meals at home and teaching his eldest son the tricks of the trade. Jim recalls fondly getting calls from his mom in the late afternoon — she worked day shift and Ken worked night shift — instructing him to wake up his dad and tell him to start dinner. It would be a slow process, with Ken giving his son instructions one at a time each time the boy climbed the stairs to rouse him. First he'd tell Jim to get the pan out. Then to unwrapped a steak and put it on the pan. He'd tell him to pick out a vegetable, and Jim would drag a chair to the refrigerator so he could stand on it to see into the freezer and make a selection. Eventually Ken would roll out of bed and make his way downstairs to finish preparing the meal as Jim sat closely by working on his homework. To this day, Jim has a love of cooking. Both Linda and Jim said Ken was a gregarious guy, usually found in a good mood and ready with a joke. ""He was a very easy person to get along with,"" Linda said. ""He was funny. And it was hard to get his temper up."" Jim didn't hesitate when asked to describe his dad's personality. ""He was Santa Claus without the beard,"" he said. ""He was happy go lucky."" As for Jason, descriptions of what he was like weren't as simple. ""Jason was Jason,"" his mom said. Linda said her younger son was often free-spirited and had a similar happy demeanor to his father. He had lots of friends and was always running around with them, she said. He was also not big on planning ahead. ""He was last-minute Charlie,"" Linda said. ""If he had a choral concert he'd tell me in the morning that it was that night and he needed me to take him."" Linda also said Jason was a very caring person. That's what led him to pursue a career in nursing. He was a licensed practical nurse, and worked for a time as a traveling nurse. After cutbacks and changes in the medical field left him without a job, he decided to change paths. Again looking for a career that would let him help people, Linda said, he went back to school to become a minister. Jim said he was never particularly close with his brother. When they were growing up, Jason was seldom found around the house. He described his younger brother as impatient and impulsive with a deep stubborn streak. ""He wants what he wants when he wants it,"" Jim said. And the future It has been tough for Linda and Jim to come to terms with the fate that has befallen their family. Linda's stint in the hospital meant she wasn't able to take part in burying her husband and son. That was done simply and quietly at a cemetery she hasn't yet been able to bring herself to visit. She's been trying to keep herself busy, to keep her mind off of her now silent, empty house. A big chunk of her time and energy has been spent on cleaning out that house, saying she's planning on moving into something smaller and more manageable. ""You can't think,"" she said. ""If you try to think you're going to make it worse. There's nothing I can do about it. Sitting here crying isn't going to help."" Jim said he's glad his mother has been so resilient. For him, he said, the ordeal hasn't seemed real. For most of it he was in Maryland, communicating by phone. He did drive to Pennsylvania a few days before his brother died, stopping at his parents' home to pick up clothing for his mother. ""All she had at the hospital was her nightgown and house coat,"" he said. Jim said he likely won't feel the full weight of the loss of his father and brother until he's able to gather once again with family. ""It's probably not going to hit me until I come back to Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""When we get together as a family for Thanksgiving or Christmas or something and they're not there."" One emotion that Jim said he is feeling is anger. He's mad at people who aren't taking the pandemic seriously, at people who refuse to get vaccinated. He fumes at people who think the devastation of COVID won't happen to them. ""It can be us,"" he said. ""Every time I hear someone say something like that I want to go and smack them.""","U.S./Reading Eagle, Pa.",David Mekeel: Reading father and son both lose their lives to COVID,https://news.yahoo.com/david-mekeel-reading-father-son-141300159.html

 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) retrieved multiple White House record boxes last month that were improperly kept at former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago property, The Washington Post reported. The boxes reportedly contained important records of communication, gifts and letters from world leaders, which, according to the Post, is a violation of the Presidential Records Act. The newspaper added that the boxes retrieved from the Florida estate included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as well as a letter from former President Obama to Trump. The Post noted that recent administrations have all had some Presidential Records Act violations, including the use of unofficial email and telephone accounts as well as the destruction of emails. But a source told the newspaper that the transfer to Mar-a-Lago was ""out of the ordinary ... NARA has never had that kind of volume transfer after the fact like this."" The Hill has reached out to the National Archives and Trump's office for comment. The Presidential Records Act, which was put in place following the Watergate scandal, requires administrations to document and maintain records of the White House decisionmaking process.

2/8/2022,"By Kate Holton LONDON (Reuters) -Prince Charles on Sunday thanked his mother Queen Elizabeth for publicly stating her desire that his wife Camilla becomes Queen Consort when he becomes king, acknowledging the honour on the 70th anniversary of her accession to the British throne. The request - a blessing that will likely remove the need for any discussion about future titles - follows an earlier era when Camilla was vilified by the tabloid press for the breakdown of Charles' marriage to his first wife, the late Princess Diana. The 95-year-old queen said it was her ""sincere wish"" that when the day comes, Camilla would be known as Queen Consort. Charles made his response on Sunday when he led tributes from world and religious leaders to the monarch as she passed a milestone never reached by any of her predecessors in nearly 1,000 years of a line that traces its origin back to Norman King William I and his 1066 conquest of England. ""We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish,"" Charles said in a statement. ""As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout."" The long-time lovers were married in 2005, enabling Camilla to gradually take on a more prominent role. With a current title of Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla is now a popular member of the royal family and regularly appears at official duties alongside the queen, Charles and his son, William, and wife Kate. Diana, the mother of Princes William and Harry, died in a Paris car crash in 1997. The statement on the future of the monarchy comes as the country celebrates the queen's role over the last 70 years. Britain will hold four days of national events in June to mark her platinum jubilee. Charles was joined by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the White House, the Archbishop of Canterbury and other politicians in praising the queen for her dedication to public service. ""Throughout the past 70 years, she has strengthened the ties of friendship, shared ideals, and faith in democracy that forever unite our countries,"" the White House of President Joe Biden said. HUGE CHANGE During her seven decades on the throne, the queen has been a symbol of stability for the country during huge social, economic and political change https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeths-reign-second-golden-age-britain-2022-02-03, including the end of the British Empire. But her anniversary comes after a very difficult time https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/royal-crown-slips-elizabeth-prepares-mark-70-years-queen-2022-01-25 for the monarchy, following the sex abuse accusations her son Prince Andrew is facing in the United States, which he denies, and allegations of racism in the royal household from grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan. Elizabeth became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour aged 25. The news was broken to her by her husband Prince Philip, who died last year aged 99 after more than 70 years by her side. When she ascended the throne, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Harry Truman were running the Soviet Union, China and the United States, respectively, while Winston Churchill was British prime minister. The queen has continued to carry out official duties well into her 90s, but has been seen much less regularly of late after she spent a night in hospital last October for an unspecified ailment and was then instructed by doctors to rest. On Sunday, the palace released a new video of the queen, smiling broadly near a red despatch box that contains official government paperwork and discussing a message from Biden. On Saturday she was filmed meeting local community groups and joking with officials. ""I think I might just put a knife in it,"" she said when presented with a large cake.

2/8/2022,"The 1980s TV crime drama Hunter featured an eponymous main character who popularized the catchphrase, “Works for me.” Today’s crime drama surrounding Hunter Biden evokes a different repeated utterance: “Who did Hunter work for?” The troubled presidential scion is in the news again and raising questions about his father, President Joe Biden. This unwanted attention has also renewed questions about the media’s relative lack of interest in the younger Biden’s highly questionable business interests during the 2020 presidential election. Last week, Politico reported: “The New York Times is still digging into Hunter Biden’s business relationships.” The Gray Lady sued the State Department to get emails about Hunter Biden that were sent or received by the US Embassy in Romania. It will be interesting to see what, if anything, these new emails reveal. Although it garnered more attention on the right than in the mainstream media, last September, Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger, author of The Bidens, confirmed the validity of some of the controversial emails that surfaced during the 2020 campaign—including an email with a Chinese oil executive, referencing equity to be held for “the big guy.” (The big guy was Joe Biden, according to the recipient, Tony Bobulinski, a business partner of Hunter’s.) Trump’s Promise to Pardon Jan. 6 Rioters Is Worse Than Watergate Schreckinger also confirmed an email involving a Ukrainian business executive thanking Hunter for introducing him to his father at a dinner the previous night. (Joe Biden’s team denies the meeting.) Meanwhile, conservative media is turning up the heat. Fox Nation is currently streaming a four-part series called Who Is Hunter Biden, and author Peter Schweizer just published a new book called Red-Handed, which alleges that the Biden family “received some $31 million from Chinese individuals who are linked to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence.” According to Schweizer, one of those individuals was investor Che Fung, who is referred to in emails by Hunter Biden as the ‘Superchairman.’” Schweizer also alleges that “Hunter Biden was paying his father’s bills with the foreign money…” If true, these revelations dramatically advance the story from garden-variety corruption (Hunter Biden trading on his daddy’s name) to something much more nefarious. But how reliable is Schweizer’s reporting? On one hand, he is the president of a think tank that was co-founded by Steve Bannon, and is, as The Guardian reports, “part of the rightwing ecosystem.” His conveniently timed book Clinton Cash (published in 2015), raised legitimate questions about Bill and Hillary Clinton, but also included omissions and errors. On the other hand, Schweizer’s 2011 book Throw Them All Out took shots at both sides, and it sparked a 60 Minutes segment on how members of Congress cash in on insider information (which led to the creation of the STOCK Act). In short, Schweizer’s books often reveal important and overlooked information, but his motives are suspicious. This raises a question: Rather than outsourcing this investigative work to Schweizer (whose goal is to feed his reporting to mainstream outlets), shouldn’t the media just do this work themselves? Some, like Politico’s Schreckinger and The New York Times’ Ken Vogel, have spent considerable time doing just that. But let’s be honest, if this were any other president’s son, the coverage would have been through the roof. Even without these post-election revelations and allegations, there was always an appearance of impropriety. We know Hunter was paid a lot of money to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, apparently without ever visiting Ukraine and without any discernible expertise in the energy field. And his father just happened to be the point man there for the Obama administration. We also now know that Hunter has become an artist, with some of his paintings fetching upwards of $500,000. There’s a lot of juicy stuff here. So why didn’t this receive the coverage it might have deserved before Joe Biden was elected president? For one thing, Donald Trump—and his family—raised the bar for what qualifies as a newsworthy scandal, particularly when it comes to profiting off of the presidency. And, to be honest, there were multiple red flags. Way back in May of 2019, it was reported that Rudy Giuliani was planning to dig up dirt on Hunter Biden in Ukraine. We also know that on a July 2019 phone call, Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to work with Giuliani on this project. There was the not-implausible suggestion that this “October surprise” (the release of Hunter Biden’s emails) might be Russian disinformation (as former intel officials said). Further fueling skepticism, the email story first dropped in a tabloid, the New York Post, and one of the reporters refused to allow his byline to be included in the story, while another reporter only discovered that her byline was included after the story was published. Serious mistakes were also made by Trump and his allies. The original plan was to have the Wall Street Journal break the email story. But Trump spooked them by bragging that they were working on “an important piece.” Giuliani also scooped their reporting by leaking documents to the New York Post—and Bobulinski, Hunter Biden’s former partner turned Trump campaign witness, got tired of waiting and made his case to Breitbart. Biden Just Won’t Admit When He’s Screwed Up Meanwhile, Joe Biden continued to defend his son and vehemently deny any wrongdoing. I suspect there was also a natural hesitancy to go after Biden family members, especially considering the tragedies that they have endured. I’ve just explained why the story didn’t get the attention it probably deserved in 2020, but what about in the future? By suing the State Department, The New York Times has signaled that they are serious about investigating the new Hunter Biden revelations. That’s a good start. Media outlets and investigative reporters should pursue new allegations and leads aggressively, regardless of where that takes them. They shouldn’t let their fear or dislike of Trump guide their reporting. The credibility of the media is at stake. And in the unlikely event that (as Schweizer’s reporting would suggest) Joe Biden has been compromised by a foreign government, the stakes are a lot higher than that. Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/8/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inside one of the only federal women’s prisons in the United States, inmates say they have been subjected to rampant sexual abuse by correctional officers and even the warden, and were often threatened or punished when they tried to speak up. Prisoners and workers at the federal correctional institution in Dublin, California, even have a name for it: “The rape club.” An Associated Press investigation has found a permissive and toxic culture at the Bay Area lockup, enabling years of sexual misconduct by predatory employees and cover-ups that have largely kept the abuse out of the public eye. The AP obtained internal federal Bureau of Prisons documents, statements and recordings from inmates, interviewed current and former prison employees and inmates and reviewed thousands of pages of court records from criminal and civil cases involving Dublin prison staff. Together, they detail how inmates’ allegations against members of the mostly male staff were ignored or set aside, how prisoners could be sent to solitary confinement for reporting abuse and how officials in charge of preventing and investigating sexual misconduct were themselves accused of abusing inmates or neglecting their concerns. In one instance, a female inmate said a man, who was her prison work supervisor, taunted her by remarking “let the games begin” when he assigned her to work with a maintenance foreman she accused of rape. Another worker claimed he wanted to get inmates pregnant. The warden — the man in charge at Dublin — kept nude photos on his government-issued cellphone of a woman he is accused of assaulting. One inmate said she was “overwhelmed with fear, anxiety, and anger, and cried uncontrollably” after enduring abuse and retaliation at Dublin. Another said she contemplated suicide when her cries for help went unheeded and now suffers from severe anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. __ All sexual activity between a prison worker and an inmate is illegal. Correctional employees enjoy substantial power over inmates, controlling every aspect of their lives from mealtime to lights out, and there is no scenario in which an inmate can give consent. The allegations at Dublin, which so far have resulted in four arrests, are endemic of a larger problem within the beleaguered Bureau of Prisons. In 2020, the same year some of the women at Dublin complained, there were 422 complaints of staff-on-inmate sexual abuse across the system of 122 prisons and 153,000 inmates. The agency said it substantiated only four of those complaints and that 290 are still being investigated. It would not say whether the allegations were concentrated in women’s prisons or spread throughout the system. A hotbed of corruption and misconduct, the federal prison system has been plagued by myriad crises in recent years, including  widespread criminal activity among employees, critically low staffing levels that have hampered responses to emergencies, the rapid spread of COVID-19, a failed response to the pandemic and dozens of escapes. Last month, the embattled director, Michael Carvajal, announced he was resigning. On Monday, two inmates were killed in a gang clash at a federal penitentiary in Texas, prompting a nationwide lockdown. The AP contacted lawyers for every Dublin prison employee charged with sexual abuse or named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging abuse, and tried reaching the men directly through available phone numbers and email addresses. None responded to interview requests. A government lawyer representing one of the men being sued declined comment. Thahesha Jusino, taking over as Dublin’s warden at the end of the month, promised to “work tirelessly to reaffirm the Bureau of Prisons’ zero tolerance for sexual abuse and sexual harassment.” She said the agency is fully cooperating with the Justice Department’s inspector general on active investigations and noted that a “vast majority” of these cases were referred for investigation by the Bureau of Prisons itself. “I am committed to ensuring the safety of our inmates, staff, and the public,” Jusino said in a statement to the AP. “A culture of misconduct, or actions not representative of the BOP’s Core Values will not be tolerated.” The Justice Department said in a statement that “Zero tolerance means exactly that. The Justice Department is committed to both holding accountable any staff who violate their position of trust and to preventing these crimes from happening in the first place.” __ FCI Dublin, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) east of Oakland, was opened in 1974. It was converted in 2012 to one of six women-only facilities in the federal prison system. Actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman both served time there for their involvement in a college admissions bribery scandal. As of Feb. 1, it had about 750 inmates, many serving sentences for drug crimes. There are increasingly more women behind bars but they are still a minority — only about 6.5% of the overall federal inmate population. Union officials say the vast majority of Dublin employees are honest and hardworking, and are upset that the allegations and actions of some workers have tarnished the prison’s reputation. “We have a diversified staff. We have veterans. We have ex-law enforcement. We have good people, and they’re very traumatized,"" Dublin union president Ed Canales said. Inmates and prison workers who spoke to the AP did not want their names published for fear of retaliation. The AP also does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Women made the first internal complaints to staff members about five years ago, court records and internal agency documents show, but it’s not clear whether those complaints ever went anywhere. The women say they were largely ignored, and the abuse continued. One inmate who reported a 2017 sexual assault said she was told nothing would be done about her complaint because it was a “he said-she said.” The woman, who is now suing the Bureau of Prisons over her treatment, said she was fired from her prison commissary job as retaliation. When she went to report her firing, she said a Dublin counselor took her abuser’s side, responding: “Child, do you want him to lose his job?” The woman was moved to a different prison a week later. In 2019, another Dublin inmate sued — first on her own with handwritten papers, then with the backing of a powerful San Francisco law firm — alleging that a maintenance foreman repeatedly raped her and that other workers facilitated the abuse and mocked her for it. When an internal prison investigator finally caught wind of what was happening, the woman said she was the one who got punished with three months in solitary confinement and a transfer to a federal prison in Alabama. Then, in 2020, another inmate’s report that Dublin workers were abusing inmates broke through to the Justice Department’s inspector general and the FBI, triggering a criminal investigation that has led to the arrest of four employees, including former warden Ray J. Garcia, in the past seven months. They each face up to 15 years in prison, though in other recent cases, sentences have ranged from three months to two years. Two of the men are expected to plead guilty in the coming weeks in federal court to charges of sexual abuse of a ward. None of the men accused in civil suits has been charged with crimes. Several Dublin workers are under investigation, though it’s not clear whether the men accused in the civil suits are among them. The FBI said Friday that it is continuing to investigate and is looking for anyone who may have been victimized to come forward and speak with agents. __ The former warden, arrested last September, is accused of molesting an inmate as she tried to push him away. Garcia made her and another inmate strip naked as he did rounds and took pictures that were found on his personal laptop computer and government-issued cell phone when the FBI raided his office and home last summer, prosecutors said. The abuse ended when the pandemic exploded and women were locked in their cells, they said. Garcia was later promoted; the Bureau of Prisons said it didn't know about the abuse until later. “If they’re undressing, I’ve already looked,” Garcia, 54, told the FBI in July 2021, according to court records. “I don’t, like, schedule a time like ‘you be undressed, and I’ll be there.’” Garcia, who was placed on leave after the raid and retired a month after his arrest, is also accused of using his authority to intimidate one of his victims, telling her that he was “close friends” with the person responsible for investigating staff misconduct and boasting that he could not be fired, prosecutors said. Ross Klinger, 36, a Dublin prison recycling technician, is scheduled to plead guilty on Thursday to charges he sexually abused at least two inmates between March and September 2020, including inside a warehouse and in a shipping container on prison grounds while another inmate acted as a lookout. Klinger told the women he wanted to marry them and father their children, even proposing to one of them with a diamond ring after she was discharged to a halfway house, prosecutors said. Another prisoner aware of the abuse reported Klinger to the Bureau of Prisons in June 2020, according to the FBI, but he was still allowed to transfer to a federal jail in San Diego months later. Despite the move, prosecutors said, Klinger kept contacting one of victim through an email address he created with a phony name, sometimes sending lewd messages referencing sexual acts, and messaged the other woman on Snapchat, saying he loved her and was “willing to do anything” for her. Interviewed by investigators in April 2021, Klinger denied any wrongdoing, but said that because of the allegations his life was over and that he was concerned about going to prison and being labeled as a sex offender. He was in handcuffs two months later. “Sexual misconduct of a ward, you can’t come back from that,” Klinger told investigators in the interview, according to court documents. John Russell Bellhouse, 39, a prison safety administrator, is scheduled to be arraigned this month on charges he sexually abused an inmate he called his “girlfriend” from February to December 2020. He was placed on leave in March and arrested in December. James Theodore Highhouse, 49, a prison chaplain, has already signed a plea agreement and is scheduled to plead guilty Feb. 23 to charges he put his penis on an inmate’s genitals, mouth and hand and masturbated in front of her in 2018 and 2019, and that he lied to investigators when questioned about the abuse. He was arrested last month. __ Garcia, the highest-ranking federal prison official arrested in more than 10 years, had an outsize influence as warden over how Dublin handled employee sexual misconduct. He led staff and inmate training on reporting abuse and complying with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act, known as PREA, and had control over staff discipline, including in cases of sexual abuse. In his prior role as associate warden, he had had disciplinary authority over all inmates, but not staff. He was also in charge of the legally required “rape elimination” compliance audit, first scheduled for early 2020 but not completed until last September — about the time he was arrested. The Bureau of Prisons blamed the pandemic for the delay and said the audit, Dublin’s first since 2017, is not yet finalized and cannot be made public. In private, Garcia was flouting measures put in place to protect inmates from sexual abuse and he later panicked that he would get caught for his own alleged misbehavior, court records show. The woman Garcia is accused of assaulting told investigators that one instance of abuse happened while PREA officials were visiting the prison. Garcia assaulted her in a changing stall designed for PREA-compliant searches, she said. Publicly, Garcia appeared to take a hard line on abuse. In one of his first acts after he was named warden in November 2020, he recommended firing the maintenance foreman William Martinez, accused of rape in the 2019 suit — albeit for what the staff disciplinary process narrowed to a finding of an “appearance of an inappropriate relationship with an inmate.” Martinez has denied the allegations and has filed a discrimination complaint against the Bureau of Prisons with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He has not been charged with a crime. Garcia tasked another official with making a final decision on punishment and that person reduced the penalty to a 15-day suspension, but even that was later overturned. Internal documents obtained by the AP show that prison officials failed to look into the allegations against Martinez for nearly two years and then, after the investigation finished, waited another year to propose discipline. An administrative judge wrote in June that the prison’s protracted investigation “strains credulity” on a matter as serious as alleged sexual abuse. But the judge also found that prison officials cherry-picked evidence to bolster their case, only to end up unraveling it. He reversed the suspension and ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide back pay. ___ Sisak reported from New York. ___ On Twitter, follow Michael Balsamo at twitter.com/mikebalsamo1 and Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips",U.S./Associated Press,AP investigation: Women's prison fostered culture of abuse,https://news.yahoo.com/ap-investigation-womens-prison-fostered-140401465.html
