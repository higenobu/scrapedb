1/2/2022,"Kristina Graper, a 51-year-old New Hampshire woman, has been convicted after telling a Black child she'd ""kneel on his neck."" Graper threatened the child after he accidentally broke a toy that belonged to her son. Her son had pushed the child, causing the toy to break, according to a civil complaint. A woman from Dover, New Hampshire, has been convicted by the state's justice department after she told a Black child she'd ""kneel on his neck."" Kristina Graper, 51, in May of last year threatened the child, a 9-year-old boy, according to a release from the New Hampshire Department of Justice. She had also referred to the child using a racial slur. Graper became angry with the child after he ""accidentally broke her son's toy while playing in a neighborhood park,"" the release says. A civil complaint cited by the Associated Press says Graper's son had pushed the 9-year-old child, who had, as a result, broken her son's foam missile. When her son told Graper how that part of the toy broke, Graper went back to the park, the AP reported, and threatened the child. The Strafford County Superior Court ""concluded that this conduct was motivated by the victim's race and had the purpose to terrorize or coerce the victim,"" the release reads. ""The court reached this conclusion after the defendant defaulted by not filing a response to the Attorney General's complaint."" The civil complaint says the child ""understood the comments to be a reference to the murder of George Floyd last year."" Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck last year for nearly nine minutes, was convicted of second- and third-degree murder, as well as second-degree manslaughter. As a result of Graper's behavior, the child does not want to play in the park anymore, the complaint says. Graper must stay at least 250 feet away from the child and the child's family and received a $500 fine. If she violates the restraining order, she could face a heftier fine of up to $2,500 and potential jail time, according to the New Hampshire DOJ release.

1/2/2022,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to comments on one of her vacation photos in Florida on Friday. A former Trump adviser called her boyfriend's feet ""gross"" and ""pale"" and criticized mask mandates. Ocasio-Cortez said the tweet was evidence of ""sexual frustration"" among her Republican critics. New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to a political commentator who remarked on one of her vacation photos on Friday by suggesting that some of her Republican critics harbored ""sexual frustration."" Steve Cortes, previously a commentator for conservative TV network Newsmax and adviser to former President Donald Trump, posted a photo on Twitter of Ocasio-Cortez and her boyfriend on vacation in Florida. The two were pictured at a table with drinks, and neither of them wore masks. ""If Leftists like AOC actually thought mandates and masking worked, they wouldn't be frolicking in free FL,"" Cortes wrote. He added a jibe at Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, referring to his ""gross pale male feet"" and ""hideous sandals."" Ocasio-Cortez quoted Cortes' tweet with a reply. ""If Republicans are mad they can't date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend's feet,"" she wrote. ""Ya creepy weirdos."" 
""It's starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general,"" she added. Several of Ocasio-Cortez's critics accused her of attempting to deflect criticism with her tweet. A few wrote tweets using the hashtag #AocMeltdown, which was trending on Twitter on Friday evening. Ocasio-Cortez, a vocal member of the Democratic Party's progressive wing and frequent target of conservative commentators, has spoken out on several occasions regarding sexism directed toward her. In the run-up to her first congressional term, for instance, she discussed ""double standards"" such as criticisms of her clothing. Her visit to Florida has prompted online discussion among some of her political critics regarding mandates for masks and vaccines in response to COVID-19. Ocasio-Cortez represents portions of the Bronx and Queens boroughs of New York City, which has relatively strict guidelines for mask-wearing and vaccination in response to COVID-19. By contrast, Florida, under Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, has passed laws barring employers from mandating COVID-19 vaccines and prohibiting schools from adopting mask-wearing policies. â€”Team DeSantis (@teamrondesantis) December 31, 2021 On Friday, DeSantis' campaign commented on Twitter in response to Ocasio-Cortez's vacation photo. ""Welcome to Florida, AOC!"" the campaign team tweeted. ""We hope you're enjoying a taste of freedom here in the Sunshine State thanks to @RonDeSantisFL's leadership.""
