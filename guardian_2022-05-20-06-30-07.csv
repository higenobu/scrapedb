5/20/2022,"Good morning. The federal election campaign finish line is approaching and the Australian Greens believe they are in a position to gain up to three seats in the Senate. Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of a US-Palestinian journalist. And Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air. Australians go to the polls tomorrow but not everyone will be able to have their say due to an AEC anomaly preventing thousands of Covid-positive people from voting. A high-profile independent, Monique Ryan, who is running against the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong, is planning a federal court challenge over the issue. On the final day of the campaign, Labor is pledging to establish an independent environment protection agency to enforce national conservation laws and collect data on the plight of the country’s wildlife. Despite the independents taking media attention away from the Greens, the minor party is in a position to gain up to three seats in the Senate, with a potential, though unlikely, addition of another lower house seat in Brisbane. And the United Australia party may have more support than we realise, analysts say, with people too embarrassed to publicly admit they will vote for them. Australia had the highest levels of greenhouse gas pollution from coal per person than any other developed country in 2021, according to new data. But it shows per-capita greenhouse gas emissions from coal fell sharply last year, with a surge in solar and wind energy seeing rates drop well below the average of the previous five years. Australia is the second most coal-dependant country for power generation in the OECD, behind Poland, according to the data compiled by UK-based thinktank Ember. Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of the US-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh, which Palestinian officials and witnesses have blamed on Israeli soldiers. The Israel defense forces claimed that because Abu Aqleh was killed in an “active combat situation”, an immediate criminal investigation would not be launched, although an “operational inquiry” would continue. According to a report in the Haaretz, the Israeli military police branch has accepted the assurances of Israeli troops that they were not aware she was in a village adjacent to the Jenin refugee camp when she was killed on 11 May. The Biden administration and the UN security council have called for a transparent investigation. National disability insurance scheme participants are spending months longer than needed in hospital as they await funding packages from the agency that runs the scheme, a new report shows. The aged care sector has urged the government to reinstate Covid prevention funding as it grapples with outbreaks in almost 30% of the nation’s residential facilities. The call comes as aged care workers in South Australia and Queensland prepare to walk off the job over unfair pay and conditions. Chinese Australian community leaders are warning that the Coalition’s use of hardline rhetoric against China is turning voters off – and that it could potentially cost the government in the seat of Bennelong. With the cost of living rising and wages stagnating, Anthony Albanese supports lifting the minimum wage by 5.1%. But Scott Morrison says this will make inflation worse. Is he right? Antoun Issa checks the facts. We asked Guardian Australia readers about the local issues that matter most to them this election. Broadband speeds, regional public transport, support for children with cleft palates and pollution topped voters’ lists of concerns. We put their questions to candidates. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air, the country’s biggest media outlet has said. The order came in a statement from the Taliban’s virtue and vice ministry, as well as from the information and culture ministry, the Tolo news channel tweeted on Thursday. The statement called the order “final and non-negotiable”, the channel said. The US House of Representatives has passed legislation that would bolster federal resources to prevent domestic terrorism in response to the racist mass shooting in Buffalo, New York – but the bill faces the increasingly familiar burden of an uphill climb to pass the Senate. Students at a school in Bremerhaven, northern Germany, used chairs and tables to barricade themselves in their classrooms after several shots were fired at the building, seriously injuring an adult woman. Police say an armed attacker used an unidentified weapon to injure a female employee at the Lloyd Gymnasium secondary school yesterday morning. In 2018, after a bruising divorce, the British singer Sarah Brown was “broke, financially, emotionally and spiritually – I had nothing to live for”. At her lowest ebb, she turned to a voice that had given her crucial guidance and succour when she was a child: Mahalia Jackson, the pre-eminent gospel star of the 20th century. “Pop music was banned in my home growing up,” Brown says. “But my father owned records by Jim Reeves, Aretha Franklin and Mahalia Jackson. And Mahalia’s voice opened my spirit up. I grew up in a volatile home – my father beat my mum, he beat my older brother. I was seven years old, living in fear.” But in Jackson’s volcanic, resonant, impassioned voice, Brown found much-needed shelter and catharsis. “I was able to scream along with her, and release that fear. Mahalia helped release me.” Emmanuel Carrère was no stranger to depression but it was late in life that a major episode led to him being hospitalised and diagnosed as bipolar. In some ways it made sense of his problems, but in the midst of it, everything was broken. “It’s disturbing, at almost 60 years of age, to be diagnosed with an illness that you’ve suffered from your whole life without it ever being named,” writes Carrère. “Your first reaction is to protest.” This weekend Australians head to the polls. After a long and at times hollow campaign, devoid of big picture and big policy, have the major parties earned your vote? Or have the minor parties and independents influenced the campaign for the better? In this episode of Full Story, Gabrielle Jackson talks to Lenore Taylor and Mike Ticher about the Guardian view on the election, and the challenges ahead.

The deal covers the seventh season of the AFLW competition, which has been brought forward to start in late August. Cody Simpson always had a dream. It wasn’t to be a global pop star and heartthrob. Or date models and celebrities, perform on Broadway and act on television. His dream was to swim for Australia – just as his parents did. After having his swimming dream “sidetracked” by fame in the US, the Gold Coast prodigy has now qualified for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Major media outlets have published editorials outlining their view on who is best to lead the country. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age say Scott Morrison does not deserve another term; the Australian is backing the Coalition, arguing that Anthony Albanese is not ready. The AFR also says Labor has not made its case. From Abba to Zingers: here are the moments that lit up the election campaign.

5/20/2022,"This season cannot finish quickly enough as far as Chelsea are concerned. They have all but secured third place with a game to spare but this is a club crying out for a fresh start. Everything feels messy at the moment. The defence is vulnerable, the attack is unreliable and the worry for Chelsea is that nothing can move until Todd Boehly’s consortium has finally ushered in the end of the Roman Abramovich era. These are draining times for Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea have won one of their past six home games and this draw with Leicester did little to lift the mood at Stamford Bridge, which will only be full again once Abramovich has sold the club. There was a loose vibe to Chelsea. They had spent the day celebrating the 10th anniversary of their first Champions League title but there was only so much comfort to be found in the past. The present, after all, only offers uncertainty. The takeover is yet to go through and when the cameras picked out Boehly in the director’s box during the early stages it seemed the American was seeing exactly why Tuchel believes Chelsea will struggle to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool this summer. That much was clear when Tuchel turned away in disgust after Leicester went ahead after six minutes. The laxness, epitomised by Marcos Alonso allowing a clearance from Kasper Schmeichel to reach Timothy Castagne on the right flank, was appalling. It was shocking defending from Alonso and there was still no reaction when Antonio Rüdiger cut out Castagne’s cross, nobody smelling danger when the ball ran to James Maddison. Where were Jorginho and N’Golo Kanté? Where was the cover for Thiago Silva? The centre-back stepped up but he seemed off the pace after playing on with an injury against Liverpool. Maddison easily beat the 37-year-old in a flash and his finish, a thumping drive from 20 yards, gave Édouard Mendy no chance. Tuchel immediately retreated to his dugout. Brendan Rodgers applauded Schmeichel. There may be doubts over the Dane’s future but his value to Leicester cannot be underestimated. Schmeichel remains one of the best goalkeepers in the league and he was soon involved again, brilliantly denying Trevoh Chalobah an instant equaliser. Chelsea, who had gone close through Hakim Ziyech, were dominating possession. Yet frustrations lingered. Alonso, who could join Barcelona this summer, was jeered after undercooking a corner and there were howls when Romelu Lukaku hesitated after being released by Kanté, allowing Daniel Amartey to recover. However Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheanacho were isolated up front for Leicester. The away side dropped too deep, and the equaliser arrived when Reece James cleverly picked out Alonso. The Spaniard’s volleyed finish was a reminder of the stronger side of his game. Chelsea looked poised to take control. There was more urgency at the start of the second half. Christian Pulisic managed a few menacing dribbles. Lukaku stirred, flashing a low ball across the box. Leicester were offering nothing as a counterattacking force. Chalobah was handling Vardy well and Rüdiger was looking increasingly commanding. Chelsea will miss the German when he joins Real Madrid. The rebuild of the defence, as Tuchel has acknowledged, will be hard. Andreas Christensen, who was not involved again, is heading to Barcelona, while César Azpilicueta could also be off to the Camp Nou. Times are changing and Chelsea’s problems in defence are not helped by their attacking issues. This was another wasteful display. Lukaku was culpable, nodding wide from a Ziyech cross, but he was not the worst offender. Even Schmeichel looked shocked when Pulisic scuffed wide from six yards after being picked out by Lukaku. The frustration grew. Rüdiger, who had just stung Schmeichel’s palms, was fortunate only to receive a yellow card for a lunge on Wesley Fofana. Chelsea had fizzled out. Leicester, drifting in mid-table, held out. Chelsea could only look to the future.",Sport/Football,James Maddison strikes as Leicester earn draw to further frustrate Chelsea ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/chelsea-leicester-premier-league-match-report
5/20/2022,"Five minutes of normal time remained. Five minutes to preserve 68 years of top-flight football and to ensure Everton would not be fighting on the final day to avoid a first relegation since 1951. Dominic Calvert-Lewin timed his impact on Everton’s season to perfection. Throwing himself to meet Demarai Gray’s free-kick, the centre-forward who has missed so much of the season through injury launched himself into Goodison Park folklore with a diving header past Jack Butland. Frank Lampard’s team, who trailed Crystal Palace 2-0 at half-time, had completed a comeback to compare with the 1994 final-day escape against Wimbledon to secure their Premier League status with one game to spare. The fightback sparked an idiotic pitch invasion that contributed to seven minutes of stoppage time. It was a fightback, however, that will never be forgotten in these parts. Lampard had called for “11 Evertonians” on the pitch. The many thousands outside could not have done more to push their beloved club over the line to safety. For the third home game in succession the Everton coach was greeted by an impassioned mass of supporters on Goodison Road, but in far greater numbers and with far more blue smoke bombs than preceded Chelsea and Brentford. Repeated appeals over the PA system for supporters to make room “to allow players access to the stadium” gave a sense of the backing, and desperation, for one final victory in a torturous season. It felt more like the prelude to a cup final than a relegation scrap. Unfortunately for Everton’s survival prospects, the understandable desperation of the crowd seeped into the team’s performance. The hosts were frantic, nervous and overly reliant on the long punt towards an isolated Calvert-Lewin to construct an attack. The rudimental approach played perfectly into the hands of a composed and confident Palace team. Patrick Vieira dropped two of his most influential midfielders to the bench in Conor Gallagher and Cheikhou Kouyaté but the visitors dominated possession regardless. The guile and intent shown by Eberechi Eze, Wilfried Zaha and Jeffrey Schlupp was in stark contrast to the wastefulness of André Gomes and Abdoulaye Doucouré, bewildering paired in central midfield for the second game in succession by Lampard. Frequent lapses from Richarlison and Anthony Gordon also invited unnecessary pressure. The Brazil international did have the first shot on target of the night, whipping a free-kick he won towards the top corner and forcing a fine finger-tip save from Butland on to the crossbar. The referee, Anthony Taylor, awarded a goal-kick. The Goodison mood was punctured after Gomes and Doucouré were penalised for fouling Tyrick Mitchell deep in the Everton half. Eze swept a dangerous free-kick to the far post where Jean-Philippe Mateta easily escaped the weak attentions of Doucouré and Vitalii Mykolenko to guide a textbook header beyond Jordan Pickford at close range. Goodison was in uproar again when Gordon, having regained possession from Zaha near the touchline, was scissored by a dangerous challenge from Jordan Ayew. The Palace forward went over the top but escaped with a yellow card. Two minutes later he compounded Everton’s torment by doubling the visitors’ lead. It was a calamitous goal to concede, a litany of errors that underlines why Everton are perilously close to the relegation zone. It started when Séamus Coleman was easily dispossessed in midfield by Mateta, who darted down the left before crossing into the area. Five blue shirts had chased back but Pickford chose to punch clear and succeeded only in scuffing his clearance straight to Zaha. The winger’s shot bounced off the ground, Pickford flicked away a save, but only as far as Ayew who scrambled the ball past Mykolenko and Doucouré on the goalline. Everton created next to nothing in the first half, aside from a Mykolenko volley wide and a Richarlison drive straight at Butland. Something had to change and Lampard responded at the interval by introducing the lesser-spotted Dele Alli for the badly out-of-sorts Gomes. It was the former Tottenham playmaker’s first appearance since 1 May and his introduction helped ignite an immediate improvement, taking Everton higher up the pitch and offering more time on the ball. The home side needed an early response. It arrived when Mykolenko delivered a deep free-kick from the left and Mason Holgate steered an intelligent header back to Michael Keane. His central defensive partner controlled with his left thigh before drilling past Butland with his right. Everton’s relentless search for an equaliser left them exposed to the counterattack and Pickford saved well from Mateta after Eze and Ayew sliced through his defence. He also denied Schlupp seconds later. Keane was booked for scything down Eze, Calvert-Lewin was fortunate not to follow suit for a foul on Nathaniel Clyne, but just as Everton appeared to be losing their cool they found a way back. Alli was heavily involved, taking down Coleman’s cross on his chest on the left of the area and volleying low across goal. A Palace touch cleared only as far as Richarlison who miss-controlled with his first touch but managed to release a shot with his second. The ball struck Gallagher, who had replaced Schlupp a minute earlier, and looped beyond Butland. Goodison erupted, and there was yet more to come.",Sport/Football,Everton safe after Calvert-Lewin completes epic revival against Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/everton-crystal-pakace-premier-league-match-report
5/20/2022,"And then there were two. Burnley picked up a precious point at Aston Villa to ensure they head into the final day with the upper hand on Leeds and if they do end up securing safety by virtue of their far superior goal difference then they will surely reflect on Nick Pope’s superb performance here. Equally, Burnley will wonder how on earth Tyrone Mings prevented Wout Weghorst from side-footing in a winner five minutes from time, after Connor Roberts’s deft touch at the front post prompted an instinctive save by Emiliano Martínez. Pope made a trio of fine stops, arguably saving the best to last to deny the substitute Bertrand Traoré glancing in a header. In the end Burnley had to make do with a draw, after Emi Buendía made amends for conceding a first-half penalty, from which Ashley Barnes scored, by equalising early in the second period. The Burnley substitute Matt Lowton was awarded a straight red card in second-half stoppage time. In the buildup to this game Burnley’s caretaker manager, Mike Jackson, told how several of his players had pledged to play their part even if not 100% fit and James Tarkowski, who is out of contract next month, returned to the heart of defence following a hamstring injury that forced him off in the reverse fixture less than a fortnight ago, which Villa won 3-1 at Turf Moor. Ashley Westwood, who is recovering from a broken ankle, has been mucking in with opposition analysis and Matej Vydra paid the squad a visit on crutches after knee surgery. Ben Mee, Tarkowski’s usual sidekick and Burnley’s club captain, recently returned to training but remained on the sidelines in a club tracksuit here, instead helping Jackson with the warmup and instructing from the away dugout. Burnley had to live with some early Villa pressure, Kevin Long heading behind for a corner and soon after Jacob Ramsey’s shot after a surging run caused panic. Burnley were also indebted to their goalkeeper, Nick Pope, for making two fine saves to deny John McGinn, the first with his right hand to palm a curling effort to safety after collecting a quick corner by Buendía and the second with his left on the half-hour to prevent the Villa midfielder thrashing a shot into the roof of the net. Burnley created little aside from Barnes cleverly nodding Charlie Taylor’s scooped cross towards Roberts at the back post but Calum Chambers, who replaced the injured Ezri Konsa, intervened. But the visitors were gifted the chance to take the lead approaching the interval when Buendía upended Maxwel Cornet inside the box. Buendía got away with a barge in the back on Tarkowski at a free-kick but then proceeded to foul Cornet when the winger silkily chopped inside in the box. The referee, Paul Tierney, pointed to the spot. Buendía looked to the skies and shook his head. Some Burnley fans turned their backs, too nervous to look. They need not have worried, with Barnes coolly sending Martínez the wrong way in front of the Holte End to register his first goal for 15 months. Mee punched the air and Jackson legged it down the tunnel when the half-time whistle sounded soon after. Perhaps Burnley were guilty of getting ahead of themselves, Villa’s equaliser achingly poor from their perspective. Buendía freely wandered into the box to meet a floated McGinn pass and the unmarked Argentina midfielder smacked in on the volley from a central position, beating Roberts to the punch and exposing Pope in the Burnley goal. Pope equally may feel he should have done better. Villa supporters started to sing Buendía’s name and he located Douglas Luiz to his right, only for Burnley to clear the cross. Burnley were not so comfortable. Long was troubled by Ollie Watkins’s pace, earning a booking for a crude block, and the striker forced another alert save by Pope late on. Gerrard introduced Traoré and Phillipe Coutinho from the bench, the latter on 71 minutes after surviving a VAR scare when Lucas Digne was deemed not to have handled a ball into the box, much to the satisfaction of the hosts. The former Burnley forward Danny Ings arrived from the bench in place of Watkins and he went close to finding a winner with his first touch, smacking a shot narrowly wide after reading McGinn’s layoff. The drama increased as the game went on. Pope diverted Traoré’s deft header down to his right and then Villa survived a particularly episode when Martínez and Mings came to their rescue. Pope denied Matty Cash before four minutes of stoppage time, during which the former Villa defender Lowton was given a straight red card for a challenge on Chambers.",Sport/Football,Burnley climb out of bottom three after earning point at Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/aston-villa-burnley-premier-league-match-report
5/20/2022,"The average price of gas in California has surpassed $6 a gallon for the first time ever as fuel costs across the US reach record highs. Drivers in the Golden State are paying more for a gallon of fuel than anywhere else in the country at an average of $6.06, an all-time high for California and the US, according to AAA. The national average is nearly $4.59 a gallon, also a record, increasing 10 cents since Monday. Meanwhile, in some rural regions of California prices are even higher – fuel costs more than $7 a gallon in Mono county in the state’s east. Prices are surging due to rising demand and tighter supply, according to AAA, and consumers will continue to pay more at the pumps amid the switch to summer blends of fuel, which can add as much as 10 cents a gallon. “The high cost of oil, the key ingredient in gasoline, is driving these high pump prices for consumers,” Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson, said in a statement this week. “Even the annual seasonal demand dip for gasoline during the lull between spring break and Memorial Day, which would normally help lower prices, is having no effect this year.” With pandemic-induced inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuel prices in California have remained high in recent months, even as they fell in other states. Those costs have hit Californians hard, particularly gig workers for whom fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs. The record-breaking costs come as inflation, which is at a nearly 40-year high, has sent the prices of basic necessities soaring. In California, the governor has proposed an $18.1bn relief package to ease the pain of inflation. The plan includes $11.5bn earmarked for $400 checks that would be sent to eligible registered vehicle owners, more than $4bn for emergency rental assistance and past due utility bills, and millions to allow for free public transit for three months and waiving the diesel sales tax. Meanwhile, the state’s minimum wage could reach $15.50 an hour in January due to a law that requires an accelerated increase when inflation rises above 7%. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has faced growing criticism, particularly from conservative lawmakers, that he’s not doing enough to combat high fuel costs in the state. Republican lawmakers have advocated for suspending the state’s gas tax, which is the second-highest in the country at 51 cents a gallon, a proposal that is now gaining support from some Democrats. But Democratic leaders have generally been skeptical about pausing the tax as they worry oil companies would not pass the savings along to drivers. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, argues oil companies are to blame for high fuel prices and said his party should target them. “The reality is that every American is sacrificing at this time – paying five bucks, six bucks in my district – at the pump, and they’re seeing big oil making record profits at the same time because of the war in Ukraine,” he told Time earlier this month. “That’s not fair.” Residents in Mono county, which has some of the most expensive gas in the state, echoed Khanna’s criticisms. “Here we are struggling to even work enough to get enough gas even go to work,” Linda Dore told USAToday. “I mean it’s definitely, how many billions do they need?”",News/Business,Average price of gas surpasses $6 a gallon for first time in California,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/california-gas-average-6-gallon-record-high
5/20/2022,"Since the start of his military campaign against Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has railed aggressively against pro-western Russians, whose appetite for European cuisine and climates he said meant “their mentality is there, not here, with our people”. Yet his own daughter’s enthusiasm for sojourns to western Europe at least matches that of the oligarch “scum and traitors” he has decried, a joint investigation by independent Russian media outlet iStories and German magazine Der Spiegel suggests. According to flight records obtained by the two publications, Putin’s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, flew to Munich in southern Germany “more than 50 times” between 2017 and 2019, travelling on chartered flights with full state support and in the company of employees of Putin’s own presidential security service. Among the leaked cache of documents relating to a series of flights between Moscow and Munich in spring 2020 are the passports of a then two-year-old girl – apparently a previously unknown granddaughter of the Russian president – and Igor Zelensky, the former director of the Munich state ballet. The report said it is likely that Zelensky is Tikhonova’s partner and the father of her child. Unrelated to the Ukrainian president of the same surname, 52-year-old Igor Zelensky was an internationally feted dancer before he became artistic director of the Bayerisches Staatsballet in 2016. He stepped down from his role on 4 April citing “private family reasons”, having failed to react to calls to condemn Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine. Zelensky still has a job on the supervisory board of Russia’s National Cultural Heritage Foundation, which is building a cultural centre in Crimea and is understood to be close to Putin. An anonymous source at the Bavarian state ballet told Der Spiegel that Zelensky was “most likely a partner of Putin’s daughter”, before journalists had specifically asked about his family ties. Tikhonova, 35, herself a former acrobatic rock’n’roll dancer, was previously married to Kirill Shamalov, once Russia’s youngest billionaire, though the couple were reported as having separated in 2018. While iStories and Der Spiegel did not disclose the name of the 2017-born child, the outlets wrote that the girl’s patronymic was Igorevna, which would correspond to former ballet director Igor Zelensky. Tikhonova did not respond to a request by Der Spiegel. Her and Zelensky’s current whereabouts are unknown.",News/World news,"Putin’s daughter flew to Munich ‘more than 50 times’, investigation suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/putins-daughter-flew-to-munich-more-than-50-times-investigation-suggests
5/20/2022,"A senior police chief has admitted officers are consulting with counter-terrorism experts about threats from the far right at a military base in North Yorkshire where the Home Office is planning to house 1,500 asylum seekers. On Thursday night a meeting of residents in the small village of Linton-on-Ouse was told that the first people were due to move in in less than two weeks. The chief inspector for Hambleton and Richmondshire, David Hunter, also acknowledged at the meeting that police were being assisted with advice from Counter-Terrorism North East to prepare for the threat of far-right activity which could put the asylum seekers at risk. Home Office officials, along with their sub-contractors Serco who will be managing the accommodation, attended the meeting of Linton Parish council to answer questions about the plans from concerned villagers and campaigners. Approximately 10 far-right protesters gathered outside but were barred from entry by police. Asylum seekers held at other military barracks such as Penally in Wales, which has now closed, and Napier in Kent have experienced harassment from far-right demonstrators. The Home Office is planning to move 1,500 asylum seekers into the military base, a former RAF station which closed in 2020,in the village which has just 700 residents. The first 60 people are due to move in on 31 May. Villagers and activists who oppose the plans have launched a campaign against the Home Office using the slogan “wrong plan, wrong place”. On Wednesday evening Conservative-controlled North Yorkshire county council passed a vote of no confidence in the Home Office “due to the lack of consultation of local communities and stakeholders”. At the parish council meeting on Thursday evening residents were told that there would be guards on the gates at the base and an increased police presence in the village between 8.30am and midnight seven days a week. Home Office officials who attended the meeting said there would be multi-agency forums and sub-groups for local people to raise concerns. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is also to visit to hear their concerns, the meeting was told. Hunter said in response to a question about whether police are prepared for far-right activity at the site: “Counter-Terrorism North East are assisting us and advising us.” Nicola David, chair of Ripon City of Sanctuary and a member of the Linton-on-Ouse action group, said to Home Office officials at the meeting: “You treat asylum seekers like animals, like pawns in your political game.”",News/UK news,Counter-terror experts ‘assisting with far-right threat to asylum housing’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/counter-terror-experts-assisting-with-far-right-threat-to-asylum-housing
5/20/2022,"Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a break between visiting Amazon union workers and endorsing progressive candidates to get engaged to her longtime partner Riley Roberts. Ocasio-Cortez, 32, confirmed to Insider on Thursday that she and Roberts, who met while both were at Boston University, got engaged last month while visiting her parents’ home town in Puerto Rico. She then wrote on Twitter: “It’s true! Thank you all for the well wishes.” According to Insider, the pair were quiet about their relationship even before Ocasio-Cortez became a popular political voice, and their friends at university did not always know they were together. Roberts has also been one of her greatest support systems throughout her career, according to a biography published earlier this year, People magazine reported. “What we do know about Roberts doesn’t fit the stereotype of a politician’s partner,” writes Josh Gondelman in an essay in Take Up Space: The Unprecedented AOC by the editors of New York magazine. “He doesn’t seem focus-grouped or media-trained for state dinners and press conferences. We know he’s supportive and encouraging in private,” Gondelman writes. “And his expertise, as far as his public image goes, is his elusiveness and restraint.” The few times Roberts, a marketing professional, has popped up in media it has been with the couple’s dog, Deco, or in the 2018 documentary Knock Down the House.

5/20/2022,"An agent working for MI5 with a background in rightwing extremism abused his former partner and used his connection with the domestic intelligence agency to threaten her further, according to an investigation by the BBC. The man – known only as X for legal reasons – is said to have terrorised the woman and at one point attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her, as shown in a video captured on her mobile phone. “There was so much psychological terror from him to me, that ultimately culminated in me having a breakdown,” the woman said. The BBC was only able to tell her story after winning a high court battle with the government. Suella Braverman, the attorney general, had applied for an injunction preventing X from being identified, while the BBC argued it was in the public interest to name a man who allegedly poses an ongoing threat to women. In the end the BBC was blocked from identifying the man, a foreign national who worked as a paid informant for MI5 infiltrating extremists networks in the UK. But it was able to broadcast a film about him, released on Thursday. MI5 has a policy of never confirming the identity of its agents or paid informants, although Braverman’s case was mounted on the “hypothetical assumption” that X was an agent. He has reportedly left the UK, and went on to work for a foreign intelligence agency. His former partner, a Briton who the BBC has called Beth to protect her identity, said X told her she would not be able to report his abusive behaviour because of his work for MI5. “It meant that I couldn’t speak out about any of his behaviour towards me, any of the violence I went through, sexual or physical, because he had men in high places who always had his back, who would intervene and who would actively kill me, if I spoke out,” Beth said. During their time together, Beth said she was aware that X was having meetings with contacts, receiving payment and being given surveillance equipment. Although X was paid to inform on networks of rightwing extremists, Beth said he appeared to share their beliefs. The informant praised white supremacist mass murderers and even said that he wanted to commit a similar act of violence. Police did investigate the machete attack, during which X allegedly said he would kill Beth, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case as it came to court. Beth said the police did not take a full statement from or obtain the mobile video of the violent incident, where X tried to attack her with both the large knife and his fists. The police force and the CPS said the case was discontinued for lack of evidence. X returned to their home and Beth said he continued to threaten her, claiming the security services would support him and that she was “nothing”. But gradually their relationship collapsed. X became subject of another police investigation, which drew in countr-terrorism officers, after it emerged that he had had a private diary in which he allegedly wrote about killing Jews and kept Nazi materials. However, X left the country before the inquiry concluded. A second woman, who had a relationship with X in the same foreign country before he came to the UK, also told the BBC that X was violent to her. The woman, who was given the alias Ruth, said: “He said he would be able to kill me and my daughter, too, and then put our bodies somewhere and no one would ever know who I am.” Ruth had not met or been aware of Beth. She eventually fled to a refuge to escape X and said she was “psychologically broken” by their relationship. During their time together she remembered X kept a book contained lurid fantasies involving “eating children’s flesh”. The BBC said it had established X worked for MI5 as a paid informant for years using various false names. “This is the story of a dangerous MI5 agent, which the government tried to keep secret,” it added. In high court rulings, Mr Justice Chamberlain had said that alleging that X was an undercover informant would put his life at risk. He said the “experience and expertise” of the corporation meant it could make decisions about which details risked identifying X.",News/UK news,"MI5 agent ‘abused and threatened’ ex-partner, BBC investigation reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/mi5-agent-abused-and-threatened-ex-partner-bbc-investigation-reveals
5/20/2022,"The abrupt resignation of Alberta’s premier has shocked the western province and raised questions about the ideological direction of Canada’s conservative movement amid a surge in far-right and populist influences. Jason Kenney announced late on Wednesday that he was leaving the province’s top job after barely surviving a leadership review. A slim majority of party members – 51.4% – had voted in favour of keeping him in power but Kenney said that support wasn’t enough to justify remaining head of the governing United Conservatives. “The result is not what I hoped for or frankly what I expected,” Kenney told supporters. The premier had previously said he would view any result above 50% as a win. “He had seemed so doggedly determined to remain on his leader … with even a single vote more than those who voted against him,” said Lori Williams, a professor of political science at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. “So his decision was very much a surprise.” Once a star cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper, Kenney returned to Alberta to unite warring conservative factions and oust the governing leftwing New Democratic Party. He won a strong majority in 2019, but his tenure was marred by party infighting and threats of mutiny. His pugilistic brand of politics won him allies but also created a growing list of enemies and disaffected party members. “It takes a truly extraordinary leader to try to persuade people who may dislike and disrespect one another to work together for the sake of governance,” said Williams, pointing out the only Canada politician able to effectively take on this challenge was Harper. Kenney’s popularity cratered during the coronavirus pandemic as he fought off criticism from within his own party amid fierce debates over public health measures. Rightwing elements were angered by restrictions on businesses and movement, but more moderate party members feared an overwhelmed health care system. At one point during the pandemic, Alberta had one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in North America. As the debate intensified over who should speak for the party, the premier warned in March that conservative movement was being overrun by far-right “lunatics … trying to take over the asylum”. But turning on his own party probably accelerated challenges to his leadership, say former supporters. Rick Bell, political columnist at the Calgary Sun and longtime advocate of the outgoing premier, wrote that the fall of Kenney was “stunning” but expected. “He never listened. Never. He was right. We all were wrong. Until we were right,” wrote Bell. Even though the province has lifted its public health restrictions and significant revenue from oil and gas is flowing into the provincial treasury, voters seem unwilling to forgive Kenney. Kenney joins a growing list of conservative premiers unable to finish out their term: since 2004, Alberta has seen seven premiers. Only one – New Democrat Rachel Notley – served a full term. But Kenney’s departure amid bitter infighting over the ideological direction of the party, will loom over the current race for a federal Conservative leader. The national party has already turfed two of their leaders in recent years, Erin O’Toole and Andrew Scheer, both of whom campaigned to the right and then tried to woo centrist voters in a general election. “There’s almost competing imperatives facing a leader of a coalition Conservative party. One is to win the support of their own caucus – and the other is to win an election by appealing to a broader range of electors,” said Williams. “But neither really seems compatible.” A federal Liberal from Alberta called the recent resignations a “disturbing trend” among his political rivals. “The conservative movement in this country is heading to a dark place. And I find that very troubling,” Randy Boissonnault told reporters on Thursday. As conservatives in Alberta grapple with their party’s future, Williams sees a difficult and unenviable task for the eventual leader. “You really have to wonder who would want to take this on. Who would want to risk their reputation and their political future on the challenges we’re seeing boiling up within this party?”",News/World news,Canadian premier abruptly quits amid surge in far-right influences,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/alberta-premier-jason-kenney-conservatives-far-right-populism
