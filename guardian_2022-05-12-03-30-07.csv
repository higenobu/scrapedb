5/12/2022,"Piña coladas and other such retro cocktails are back in vogue, with many Britons keen to capture the tropical beach holiday vibe with parasol-garnished drinks after two years of holidaying in the UK. Bars and supermarkets said rising demand for kitsch tipples, such as mai tais, blue lagoons and tequila sunrises, reflected a post-pandemic desire among consumers for fun experiences and the Instagram-ready appeal of the colourful drinks. Waitrose’s latest drinks report said fruity feelgood cocktails have made a comeback among drinkers keen to make up for lost holiday time abroad due to the pandemic. Searches on the supermarket’s website for piña colada, a rum cocktail made with coconut milk and pineapple juice, are up by 40% from last year. The drink, invented in a luxury hotel bar in Puerto Rico in the 1950s for wealthy tourists looking for a taste of the Caribbean, is now the UK’s third most popular cocktail, after negronis and mojitos, according to a new survey. Jamie Matthewson, drinks trading manager at Waitrose, said: “I think what’s driving it is that people want something fun. Those types of experiences with friends that we’ve been missing out on so badly over two years.” A survey of 1,000 people by Drinks House 247 found piña colada was most popular among those aged between 25 and 44, and 55 and over. Kerry Maisey, who owns the Ridley Road Market Bar in Dalston, east London, said sales of kitsch cocktails were booming among millennials as their bright colours made the drinks popular to share on Instagram and TikTok. “Our frozen cocktails, which are our retro cocktails – blue margarita and our pink colada, a piña colada with pink food dye – have always been popular, but since October they are the most popular drinks,” she said. “Our sales have almost doubled.” Maisey said the drinks appealed to younger drinkers because they fitted their interest in the 70s aesthetic. “Suits in one colour for women, elements of 70s’ leather or denim coming into what people are wearing,” she added. But she said the appeal was not just ironic. “Younger people are viewing them in a different way than people have in the past. There’s no sense of them being passé. They have that visual element. We do have customers who have seen the drinks online and want to drink the same thing.” The drink’s appeal is countrywide. The Drinks House 247 survey found piña coladas were the most popular cocktail in Yorkshire and the Humber and the east Midlands. Meanwhile, Northwich in Cheshire has a festival dedicated to the drink, in tribute to Rupert Holmes, singer of 70s hit Escape (The Piña Colada Song), who was born in the town. Adam Gerrard, organiser of the festival on 20 August, said: “Most bars [and] now even our some of our traditional pubs are starting to sell cocktails. It’s a bit strange that you’ll see grown men stood in a pub drinking a piña coladas but it happens. Even the Wetherspoon’s sold them last year.” [From Felicity Cloake’s recipe] Piña coladas are made from rum, cream of coconut (or coconut milk) and pineapple, either blended or shaken with ice. They are often garnished with a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both.

5/12/2022,"As a health warning on the dangers of taking illegal drugs it couldn’t have been improved. Quite who in No 10 decided Michael Gove was the right person to front the government’s morning media round was unclear. But it must have been someone willing to gamble that the minister for levelling up would be more impressive than most of his colleagues even if he was clearly off his head. Unfortunately for the news anchors, they were rather obliged to take the overly chatty Gove seriously. It made for an excruciating couple of car crash hours of TV and radio. First he was asked if Downing Street being the most lawbreaking street in the UK during lockdown, along with Keir Starmer’s offer to resign if fined, meant that Boris Johnson should do the decent thing. The Govester started spewing drivel. The Convict had worked extraordinarily hard during the pandemic and had got most of the big calls right (really?) so he deserved a break. Regular all-night parties were the least that the prime minister should have been allowed by a grateful nation. Boris was born to be indulged. Kay Burley tried to get a word in edgeways but Mikey was sure he was the most fascinating person in the room and just talked over her. Rushing on his run. Even so, that proved to be the most sense Gove spoke all morning. Over on BBC Breakfast, he started speaking in silly voices. “Oh, Big News story in capital letters,” he said when asked why the Convict had insisted the government was going to do more on the cost of living if he hadn’t really meant it. “Calm down, calm down,” he added, channelling Harry Enfield’s 1990s scousers in a terrible Liverpool accent, before wandering on to the set of Good Morning Britain where he happily contradicted himself. When he caught up with the Michael Gove who had once said that reducing VAT on fuel would help the less well-off, he would be sure to give him hell. He ended his trail of destruction on the Today programme, where he said that the manifesto promise of building 300,000 new homes a year was a load of old bollocks. Far better to build just one that everyone liked rather than a whole load that most people were indifferent to. Thank you and good night. Or good morning. Whichever it was, it was hard to tell when you’ve been up all night. He stumbled off to have a lie-down, oblivious to the havoc he had caused. Still, at least the Govester had the excuse that he had been completely out of it. Priti Patel merely proved she was naturally that stupid as she opened the second day of the Queen’s speech debate in the Commons. Though, like many naturally half-witted people, she harbours the belief that she’s actually very bright. So she smirked and patronised her way through what turned out to be a long litany of failure. Her speechwriter in the Home Office must be a secret Labour supporter. Priti Vacant doesn’t do nuance. She only has one mode of engagement and that is to pick a fight. She’s as vicious as she is vacuous. So she kicked off by insisting that the Labour party were either all murderers, paedophiles and rapists or they had friends and family who were. Having got her insults in early, she then got down to the nitty-gritty. Crime was up 18% and prosecutions were down 18%. So the government was clearly doing something right. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, several times tried to intervene to point out that Vacant had got the wrong end of the stick, to save her from embarrassing herself further. But Patel just waved her away imperiously. “Beating crime is the plan to beat serious crime,” Vacant announced. Though she didn’t seem any the wiser how it would work. “We are going to stop people locking on to each other.” Everyone looked blank. Understandably. She then went on to say she was going to spy on spies. Labour’s Holly Lynch wondered whether she might want to start with the Convict who had gone to Italy in 2018 to meet ex-KGB agent, Alexander Lebedev. Patel ignoredthat and talked up the bill of rights – AKA the bill of wrongs – which she hoped would prevent any kind of peaceful protest. People should just learn to be more grateful for everything the government was doing for them. In reply, Cooper tried to explain to Vacant that she had just delivered a long suicide note on law and order on behalf of the government. This was too much for junior home office minister, Kit Malthouse, who said that some crimes had gone down last year. Cooper gently reminded him that it would have been a surprise if fewer people hadn’t been out on the streets robbing one another during lockdown. But not to worry, the figures had reassuringly picked up in the last few months. Malthouse looked as if he might burst into tears. Working for one of the dimmest people in government can do that to you. Still, at least he could console himself he wasn’t as mindless as Tory Lee Anderson, who suggested food banks were a waste of space and that the poor would be better off in a chain gang. Vacant gave him the thumbs-up. Over in Stockholm, the Convict was busy showing that he too embraced his government of all the talentless. As part of the new defence pact with Sweden, he happily signed up to an agreement that committed the UK to defending European institutions. From a prime minister who has undermined most European institutions and plans to ignore international law by triggering article 16. Anyone would think he hadn’t read the agreement he had just signed. Or was counting on no one else bothering to read the small print.",News/Politics,Michael Gove causes havoc on breakfast TV – but at least he’s not Priti Patel | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/michael-gove-havoc-on-breakfast-tv-priti-patel
5/12/2022,"Bakery chain Greggs is facing a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives after criticism by two respected investor advisory groups. Bonus payouts for Greggs’ outgoing chief executive, Roger Whiteside, amounted to more than double his basic salary of £575,209, taking his total package to £1.9m including benefits. As a result the investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the bakery chain’s remuneration report at the group’s annual meeting on 17 May, noting that Whiteside’s pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee. Meanwhile the proxy adviser Glass Lewis pointed to a 11.4% rise in basic pay for Greggs’ finance chief, Richard Hutton, last year that was followed by a 3.5% increase this year to £393,300. He is also lined up for an exceptional share bonus payout of 150% of salary despite Greggs not paying back £87m in government furlough support received in 2020. It did pay back £4.9m in furlough support received last year. Greggs said it had approved the higher potential payout for Hutton this year because he was “critical in helping to support [the] transition” from Whiteside to new boss Roisin Currie. “The committee believes his knowledge and experience will be essential and therefore his long-term incentive award should be appropriately pitched to reflect the key contribution he is expected to make over the next few years,” the company said. However, Glass Lewis said Greggs’ board has “failed to provide a robust rationale” for the higher than usual bonus for Hutton – which would usually be limited to a maximum of 125% of salary. Greggs’ remuneration committee said its annual bonus scheme had been “designed to ensure that bonus payments would only be made for appropriately stretching levels of performance”. It added: “The committee is cognisant that the payout of the bonus is very near to maximum but is satisfied that this outcome aligns well with the business performance in what were tough trading conditions in 2021.” On the additional share bonus, it said it was “very comfortable that vesting” was justified. The criticisms of Greggs come after a string of shareholder rebellions over pay this spring. Almost 30% of shareholders in Ocado rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist this month after it laid out a plan to pay the chief executive, Tim Steiner, up to £100m over the next five years. And just over 38% of shareholders who voted came out against a new bonus scheme at GlaxoSmithKline, which raised the annual bonus for executives at the drugs group from two times to three times their salaries.Almost a third of Standard Chartered’s shareholders voted against executive pay at its annual meeting, after advisers criticised the bank for not sufficiently cutting bonuses after a record UK regulatory fine. Nearly 11% of voting shareholders opposed the pay policy at Barclays on the same day. However, NatWest executives avoided a shareholder rebellion despite a controversial new pay policy that could net the bank’s chief executive, Alison Rose, as much as £5.2m a year. Nearly 93% of shareholder votes were cast in favour of the policy last month.",News/Business,Greggs feels heat from investors over ‘excessive’ pay for bosses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/greggs-feels-heat-from-investors-over-excessive-pay-for-bosses
5/12/2022,"Imagine that on the first day of 2020 you had magically been granted insight into the size and commercial impact of the coming Covid pandemic. From this shortlist of two food-related companies in the FTSE 100 index, would you have chosen to make a “forever” investment in Compass Group, a contract caterer set to be clobbered as offices and schools closed their canteens? Or would you have opted for Ocado, an online retailer with world-leading technology that was about to enjoy a whoosh of demand from locked-down shoppers? For the first 12 months of this race, the winner seemed blindingly obvious. Compass’s share price halved in anticipation of a plunge in annual operating profits that turned out to be as severe as feared – 82%. The group had to raise £2bn of fresh equity to strengthen its finances. Over at Ocado, the share price more than doubled between March and September 2020. The company also raised fresh capital – £1bn worth – but its motive was to capitalise on the many online opportunities that were opening up. “The current crisis is proving a catalyst for permanent and significant acceleration in channel shift globally,” declared its chief executive, Tim Steiner, when tapping shareholders and bondholders in June that year. And now? It turns out that, if your were obliged to hold your investment until now, you were better off backing boring Compass. From 1 January 2020, you’d now be down about 11%. Ocado, after its enormous hurrah, has given up all its gains and then some. From £12.73, the shares went as high as £28.95 and are now 764p. So Ocado is down 40% from the starting line. What happened? The Compass half of the tale was explained via Wednesday’s forecast-beating first-half set of numbers. Students are back, sports events are happening again and office workers have returned in sufficient numbers to make working-from-home factors almost irrelevant. Revenues were 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Inflation in food prices could become a problem, but Compass thinks more firms may be prompted to outsource their catering to save money and dodge the hassles of post-Covid hygiene requirements. Pre-tax profits were £632m in the half-year and the group boosted its forecast of revenue growth this year to 30%. The rebound from lockdown conditions has been rapid. At Ocado, recent noises have been far from bullish. In place of the predicted “permanent and significant” shift towards online, the group in March warned about a “return to pre-Covid shopping patterns”. It also fretted about inflation, the cost of living crisis and increases in energy costs, none of which contained a silver lining in its case. The company still has its long-term licensing deals to sell its kit and grocery-picking expertise to overseas supermarket groups but, say the sceptics, the pandemic really demonstrated the inflexibility of the warehouse model. Supply could not be ramped up quickly to meet the surge in demand. The great market opportunity slipped away. Don’t write off Ocado over the very long term, but the emphasis should be probably on the “very”. It now seems absurd that the company was briefly worth more than mighty Tesco when its stock market value hit £21.7bn in September 2020. At £5.8bn today, Ocado is now only a whisker ahead of the UK’s second largest supermarket group, Sainsbury’s (£5.4bn). One old moral of the tale is that hard bottom-line profits and dividends, which Compass, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have but Ocado doesn’t, still matter. Another is that the stock market has a terrible habit of jumping on short-term trends and assuming they will last forever. Life is rarely so simple. The reversal described here is just a miniature version of the more dramatic tech sell-off in the US, but it has had a feel of inevitability for a while.",News/Business,Compass v Ocado proves bottom-line profits and dividends still matter | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/11/compass-v-ocado-proves-bottom-line-profits-and-dividends-still-matter
5/12/2022,"A state judge struck down new congressional districts in north Florida on Wednesday, saying that Governor Ron DeSantis, who drew the lines, had made it harder for Black voters to elect the candidate of their choice. “I am finding the enacted map is unconstitutional because it diminishes African Americans’ ability to elect candidates of their choice,” circuit judge Lane Smith said on Wednesday, according to the Tributary. Lawyers for the state of Florida are expected to immediately appeal the ruling, and the Florida supreme court will probably ultimately decide the case. The decision dealt specifically with DeSantis’s decision to dismantle Florida’s fifth congressional district. It stretched from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, was 46% Black, and is currently represented by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. DeSantis’s new district chopped the district up into four districts where Republican candidates would be favored to win. A coalition of civic action groups and Florida voters immediately challenged the map, saying that they violated a provision in Florida’s constitution that says new districts cannot “diminish” the ability of minority voters to elect the candidate of their choosing. In late April, the plaintiffs asked the court to block the districts in northern Florida specifically from taking effect for the 2022 election. Smith ordered the state to adopt a map that maintained a fifth congressional district stretching from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, according to the Tributary. DeSantis has fumed against the current configuration of the fifth congressional district, saying considerations over race were too much of a factor when the district was drawn. Voting rights advocates say the district ensures Black voters in northern Florida do not have their votes diluted. The Florida map is one of the most aggressively gerrymandered maps in the US. Republicans currently have a 16-11 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation, but DeSantis’s plan would add an additional four GOP-friendly seats, increasing that advantage to 20-8 (Florida is gaining an additional US House seat because of population growth). It’s an effort seen as a critical part of Republican efforts to retake control of the US House in the midterm elections. DeSantis has also expressed skepticism about anti-gerrymandering language, including the anti-diminishment provision, in Florida’s constitution. He said in March that he believes courts could ultimately rule that the language, which also includes prohibitions against partisan gerrymandering, violate the US constitution’s 14th amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.",News/US news,Judge strikes down Florida governor’s ‘unconstitutional’ election map,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/florida-election-congressional-map-ron-desantis-judge
5/12/2022,"One day this week the prime minister promises that help with food and fuel prices will be announced in “the days to come”. The very next morning, one of his most senior ministers, Michael Gove, adopts a scouse accent and orders everyone to “calm down”. Surveys show that more than 2 million adults in the UK cannot afford to eat every day and the cabinet suggests it could help by relaxing the rules on MOTs. You might call this stuff a joke – only no one is laughing. The government is right to point out that many of the forces driving up the cost of basics are global and affecting numerous countries all at once. But it is also high time that ministers from the party of individual responsibility looked themselves in the mirror and acknowledged how, through their own complacency and carelessness, they have expanded and intensified this crisis. A social emergency is already upon us and yet ministers continue to act as if they have all the time in the world. The result is that this year more people will suffer and starve. Part of the responsibility for this disaster can be laid squarely outside the doors of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. When the chancellor delivered his spring budget, Russia had already invaded Ukraine. Oil and gas prices were already rocketing. He offered some help to households, but not enough, and promised to cut taxes at some point in the future. When he gave his statement last autumn, it was already clear that falling living standards were going to be the economic theme that defined not just this year, but this half-decade. The chancellor offered some half measures on universal credit and the rest, and boasted about a budget for “the age of optimism”. Such phrases may have felt good that afternoon in the House of Commons, but not anywhere else – and now they sound frankly hubristic. Mr Sunak had many chances and faced countless requests to make the pandemic-era uplift in universal credit permanent and to make benefits more generous. He ignored them all. Benefits are rising this year by less than half the rate of inflation and the very poorest members of society are squarely among those being hardest hit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, among Mr Johnson’s most prominent defenders of late, once described food banks as “rather uplifting”. Given what the Trussell Trust charity reports about the demand for their cans and packets, the minister will spend most of this year in a state of veritable ecstasy. On the day this administration finally tries to do something meaningful on fuel prices – be that a windfall tax on the oil giants or another policy – let it be called what it is: a U-turn, made late in the day because it couldn’t be bothered to act earlier. And time is of the utmost importance. Economists are already warning that a million households will be in destitution this year – unable to afford essentials such as eating and heating – unless their incomes go up. The cost of living crisis is often discussed as if it were all about rising prices, but that is only part of the picture. The rest of it is to do with stagnating or falling income, and the average British worker is currently enduring the third squeeze on real incomes in just over a decade. That fact alone underlines what a miserable period this past decade has been for the UK economy, with interest rates at near zero and ministers constantly promising that a boom lay just around the corner. From George Osborne to Philip Hammond to Mr Sunak, each chancellor has pledged unprecedented investment, exports and growth. What the UK has instead is tepid growth and record inequality. That is a shameful record for the party that has been in power since 2010. You might call it an indictment.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the cost of living: a crisis made in Downing Street | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-cost-of-living-a-crisis-made-in-downing-street
5/12/2022,"Hours after Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Lucy Shtein, a member of the daring art collective Pussy Riot, knew it was time to get out of Russia. But Shtein, 25, had been under house arrest for more than a year, with police officers patrolling the street outside her small flat in central Moscow. “I realised I could no longer stay in Russia. So I started plotting my escape, which wasn’t going to be easy,” Shtein said in an interview with the Guardian. As a longtime Kremlin critic and political activist, Shtein has an extensive history of run-ins with the authorities, which have forced her to think outside the box. “I have worn different disguises before to dodge the police. Sometimes I would wear long coats, I even dressed as a construction worker once.” So she was well prepared to cook up a new kind of camouflage. On a recent spring day she put on a bright green suit from a food delivery company, which she had ordered online, and slipped out into the streets unnoticed. “It was really convenient that delivery couriers have such big bags. I even managed to put my beloved Mr Rat in the bag,” Shtein laughed, referring to her pet rat who has become a prominent character on her social media accounts. “We have become so used to delivery couriers roaming Moscow, so it was a foolproof way to escape.” After leaving her flat, she took a series of pre-planned car trips, eventually crossing the border into Lithuania. Six months before the war, Shtein had been sentenced to a year of so-called “restricted freedom” for promoting a protest that called for the release of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is serving a nine-year sentence in a maximum-security penal colony. She was allowed to leave her flat only at certain times, and had to wear an electronic ankle tag 24 hours a day. While the authorities have frequently targeted Shtein and her fellow Pussy Riot activists since the group first came to their attention in the early 2010s, the invasion of Ukraine has brought a new, more vicious crackdown on any anti-war dissent. In an ominous speech a month after the war started, Putin announced a hunt for “national traitors” and a “fifth column” that he claimed was attempting to undermine the invasion. Taking cues from Putin’s speech, pro-Kremlin activists plastered Shtein’s door with pictures that labelled her a traitor who had “sold out the country”. Shtein, who was also a local deputy in Moscow, said she was initially committed to staying in Russia “as long as she could”. But before long she realised that the new climate of threats and intimidation had destroyed any chance of her living a normal life. “For a long time I aspired to change things from within the country, but the war simply made that impossible,” she said. “If I wouldn’t be able to continue any of my work in Russia, it didn’t make any sense for me to stay, just sitting around doing nothing.” With her escape, Shtein joined the tens of thousands of Russians who have fled the country since February and moved to cities across Europe. Pussy Riot first came to prominence in 2012 when five of its members staged a provocative protest in Moscow’s Christ the Saviour Cathedral against Putin and the Kremlin’s close relationship with the Orthodox church. Three of the participants on that day were sentenced to two years in prison, which they spent in a colony far from Moscow. “I think that protest really led to a personal vendetta from the authorities against us,” Shtein said. In many ways Pussy Riot’s protest foreshadowed the growing role the church has come to play in Putin’s third and fourth presidential terms, with the church’s leader, Patriarch Kirill, now one of the main backers of the Ukraine invasion. Shtein’s escape took place just over a month ago, on 31 March, but only now is she able to speak openly about it. She said she had to keep the move a secret because her girlfriend and fellow Pussy Riot activist, Masha Alyokhina, was still in Russia facing criminal charges – and plotting her own getaway. Earlier this month Alyokhina, wearing the same type of food courier outfit, which Shtein had left for her, also fled the country, describing her dramatic attempt to the New York Times. The couple have since been reunited. “It felt liberating to finally take off that electronic ankle tag,” Shtein said, adding that it would take time before she adjusts to her newfound freedoms in Europe. “Out of reflex, I still put on my socks as if the tag is there. And I still get shaken when I hear someone knocking on my door.” Together with other Pussy Riot activists who have left the country, Shtein and Alyokhina have now embarked on a series of performances across Europe to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees. “I will continue my work from outside of the country. I want to be useful in one way or another,” she said.",News/World news,‘It was foolproof’: Pussy Riot activist tells of courier-suit escape from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/pussy-riot-activist-lucy-shtein-tells-of-courier-suit-escape-from-russia
5/12/2022,"The Senate was poised on Wednesday to block a bill that would codify abortion rights into federal law, in a largely symbolic vote Democrats said was critical to mobilizing Americans around the issue ahead of a likely supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade. Democrats moved quickly to hold the vote after a leak last week of a draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito in February and confirmed as authentic, indicated that a majority of the court had privately voted to strike down Roe and subsequent rulings. The extraordinary disclosure ignited protests around the country, pushing the deeply divisive issue to the center of US political life. Wednesday’s vote, a repeat of one staged by Senate Democrats in February, when they failed to win even a simple majority to allow consideration of the House-passed measure, was again largely an exercise in futility. The bill was all but certain to stall in the Senate, well short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. Nevertheless, Democrats, under intensifying pressure to act, see a political opportunity in forcing Republicans to vote against a bill protecting abortion at a moment when the threat to access is urgent and polls show a majority of Americans want the procedure to remain legal in all or some cases. They hope to use the Republican blockade as a data point in their midterm message to voters: that the GOP has become a party of “ultra-Maga” extremists, on the cusp of fulfilling a decades-long goal to strip women of their reproductive rights. It is an issue Democrats hope will energize young voters disenchanted by the Biden administration and persuade Republican-leaning suburban women to back them again this cycle. “Before the day is over, every member of this body will make a choice: vote to protect the fundamental rights of women across the country, or stand with five conservative justices ready to destroy these rights in one fell swoop,” the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a floor speech ahead of the vote, which he called “one of the most consequential we will take in decades”. If passed, the bill would codify Roe v Wade into federal law, ensuring the right of healthcare providers to perform abortions and the right of patients to receive them. But it would also go further, in some cases invalidating state-level restrictions on abortion access enacted after the Roe decision in 1973. As such, Republicans are casting the bill as a “radical” attempt to expand reproductive rights that goes far beyond Roe and would legalize “abortion on demand”. “We will stand with the American people, stand with innocent life, and block the Democrats’ extreme bill,” the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday. Republicans are betting the economy will take precedence over abortion this November. Polling shows Republicans are well positioned to make significant gains in the midterm elections, buoyed by historical headwinds, discontent with the party in power and widespread concern over the rising cost of gas, food and rent. But there are signs that Republicans do worry about a potential political backlash if Roe is overturned and states move swiftly to outlaw abortion, as many are preparing to do. A day ahead of the vote, McConnell sought to tamp down conservative calls for a nationwide ban on abortion if they take control of the chamber in November, telling reporters: “Historically, there have been abortion votes on the floor of the Senate. None of them have achieved 60 votes.” Two Senate Republicans who support abortion rights have proposed an alternative measure they say is tailored to reflect the landscape of abortion rights. But many Democrats see their proposal, which is not expected to receive a vote, as too weak. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia who has generally opposed abortion rights, said he would support an alternative codifying of Roe, but would vote against the Democratic bill. In a dramatic shift, one of the only other Democrats in Congress with conservative views on abortion rights, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, said he would support the legislation. In a statement citing the leaked supreme court ruling, he said the “circumstances around the entire debate on abortion” had changed since the last time the Senate voted on the measure. Without a clear legislative path, Democrats are aiming at the fall elections, urging Americans to elect them as the “last lines of defense” against the end of Roe. Abortion is also likely to be a major issue in races for governor and state offices, as the battle lines shift to the states. The show vote on Wednesday only intensified calls from progressives and abortion rights groups for Democrats to eliminate the filibuster. The long-simmering debate has divided the party, which does not have enough votes to end the rule. It has also energized efforts to reform the supreme court, including controversial proposals such as expanding the number of justices on the bench or imposing term limits.",News/US news,Senate poised to block bill on codifying abortion rights into law,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/senate-abortion-rights-bill-vote
5/12/2022,"Films are often praised for being visually interesting, but rarely for being verbally interesting—in fact vococentrism is often discouraged, particularly through the famous screenwriting dictum “show, don’t tell”. Director Aaron Wilson’s absorbing period drama Little Tornadoes, however, manages a very compelling and unusual blend of pictures and an almost novelistic screenplay – the kind one might expect from Australian author Christos Tsiolkas, who co-wrote it with Wilson. Assisted by the timeless qualities of rural locations, Wilson and the talented cinematographer Stefan Duscio (whose striking work includes The Dry, Upgrade and Acute Misfortune) illustrate an early 1970s Aussie setting with an eye for lived-in period details. In tone and setting, Little Tornadoes couldn’t be further from an ostentatious historical piece, bunkering down as it does into the life of an intensely glum protagonist, Leo (Mark Leonard Winter), who works as a metal worker in a small town and struggles to deal with his wife suddenly leaving him to raise their two young children alone. But the voiceover strewn throughout the film, opening with the narrator’s observations about the differences between life in rural Australia and their old home in Italy, don’t belong to Leo or his wife. We are properly introduced to the speaker of these literary-sounding words (“I was told I was coming to a new world when I first arrived here … even the birds sang a different song”) well into the running time. While this person’s identity isn’t really a spoiler, I’ll leave it for audiences to discover it themselves, in the spirit of one of the film’s gentle reveals. The verbality of Little Tornadoes starkly contrasts with Wilson’s previous directorial effort: the pretty and near-wordless 2013 drama Canopy, about an Australian fighter pilot navigating a Singaporean jungle during the second world war. Wilson inserts other verbal flourishes into his new feature, including the voice of another woman who is implied to be a memory bouncing around Leo’s head, and a soft, slow cover of Beautiful Dreamer. This wistful song is overused, but here it is applied thoughtfully, resonating as a comment on the small town/big city divide. It’s not uncommon for Australian films to contemplate small town life through characters who must face up to things they’ve left behind, often unresolved familial conflict (see Simon Stone’s The Daughter; Alena Lodkina’s Strange Colours; Ray Argall’s Return Home; and Richard Franklin’s Hotel Sorrento). In Little Tornadoes, Leo is the person left behind. Winter’s thousand-yard stare and taciturnity counters the script’s wordiness elsewhere; his exceptional performance – with its hangdog demeanour and defeated stoop – painfully aligns body and soul. Winter internalises a great deal but lets emotions drip out of him, vividly detailing a man who not only spends a lot of time thinking, but thinking about the worst kinds of things that can tear people apart. The more time we spend in the company of Leo’s father, Jim (Robert Menzies), an ex-prisoner of war with PTSD, the more it becomes clear that his inability to process pain has been passed down to his son. Such sadness and vulnerability can be hereditary to some extent, but it also belongs to a much wider culture of stoicism in Australia. Wilson builds an intensely thoughtful space to contemplate mental health among Australian men, particularly those living in rural communities where there are higher rates of anxiety, depression and suicide. This is achieved with subtlety, through character and story. While Little Tornadoes is far from light viewing, there’s an elegance in its construction that makes it accessible, even pleasurable, to watch. The aforementioned narration is part of the reason the film feels like it’s having a conversation with the audience as well as itself – in particular its melancholic protagonist Leo, who will stay with you. Little Tornadoes is in Australian cinemas from 12 May.",Arts/Film,Little Tornadoes review – an elegant portrait of life in country Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/little-tornadoes-review-an-elegant-portrait-of-life-in-country-australia
5/12/2022,"Ella Elliott was “outraged” when she heard the prime minister, Scott Morrison claim there are currently “record levels of Medicare bulk billing”, with the government saying GP bulk-billing rates at 88%. “Where I live in northern Tasmania, it is almost impossible to get bulk billed for a doctor’s appointment, even with a healthcare card,” Elliott said. “If you find a doctor in Launceston who bulk bills, please let me know. There are many, many people, including working people in this area, going without basic health care because they cannot afford the high co-payments.” The 88% statistic refers to the number of services provided by a GP that are bulk-billed, and not the number of patients that are bulk-billed. In one appointment, some patients may have some of their services bulk-billed while they are charged for others. Certain patients are more likely to be bulk-billed, such as concession card holders. The latest annual Health of the Nation report from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), published in October, said the median percentage of patients who had all of their general practice services bulk billed in 2018–19 was 64%. “Patients who receive many services each year – such as older patients with chronic diseases – are more likely to hold concession cards and to have those services bulk billed,” the report said. “This inflates the levels of bulk billing each year. One in five (22%) GPs works at a practice that bulk bills all their patients, and 64% of GPs reported bulk billing the majority of their patients.” Some experts have questioned the accuracy of the bulk billing data, saying incorrect billing is artificially inflating the data. The RACGP has long predicted growth in bulk billing of GP services will halt or reverse. “While overall bulk-billing of GP services has increased by 1.3%, when new Medicare Benefit Schedule items for Covid vaccinations and telehealth are removed (just over 42m services) the remaining 129m services were bulk billed at lower rates than seen since 2016-17,” the health of the nation report said. The latest Australian Health Consumer Sentiment survey, published by the Consumers Health Forum [CHF] in March, found 14% of Australians with chronic conditions could not pay for healthcare or medicine because of the cost. CHF president, Leanne Wells, wants Medicare rebates for general practice consultations to substantially increase. “Closing the gap between what a patient pays for a GP service and the rebate they receive will help tackle this problem,” she said. Despite increasing out-of-pocket health costs affecting 86-year-old Susan Randall and her peers – “my friends and I all talk about it,” she said – Randall can not think of anything politicians have said during the election campaign that gives her confidence the issue will be addressed. “I’ve heard nothing about affordable health care,” she said, though she added the more important election issues for her are “more affordable housing for young people and action on climate change”. Neither Labor nor the Coalition has announced plans to increase GP Medicare rebates. Like Elliott, Randall lives in Launceston, and said she pays roughly $300 each year out-of-pocket to see her GP. “It’s an awful lot of money, but I don’t want to change my GP because I have been seeing them for 25 years, they know my history and they are excellent,” Randall says. “Getting to the doctor is also a consideration when you’re older, and even if I were to look for a bulk-billing doctor, I wouldn’t be able to find one. So I try to keep the gap between doctor visits as long as possible, I try to stretch it out.” GP bulk-billing rates also vary between regions, from 32.9% of patients in the Australian Capital Territory electorate of Canberra and 36.9% in the WA electorate of Curtin, to more than 96% of patients in the New South Wales electorates of Chifley and Fowler. In Canberra, Emma Connell lives with three chronic health conditions – anxiety, depression and a degenerative back problem – and sees a GP multiple times every year. “None of my visits are bulk billed,” she said. “Unsurprisingly, none of my specialist visits are bulk billed either. The only completely bulk billing GP service that I am aware of in the entire Territory is the after hours service.” “There are only three people in my circle who have bulk-billed GP appointments – my mother, aged 80, my partner, aged 65, and my terminally ill daughter who has a health care card.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Martin Taylor lives in Manly West in Brisbane, and said after living in the US he is grateful for the health system in Australia, but when it comes to GP visits, “I tend to ration visits because of cost”. “I am a retired senior with less than $26,000 regular income [each year],” he said.  “I usually pay $35 a visit after Medicare rebate. But I also had to pay $300 for a PET scan for cancer recently as it is not covered by Medicare. “I would prefer to move to the bulk-billing clinic up the road, but it’s hard to have a regular GP there as they turn over so much.” In 2011, Taylor spent $248 on out-of-pocket health costs after Medicare rebates. This rose to $3,277 last year. “Costs have increased both because fees have gone up, but also because I am getting older and more things are breaking down,” he said. Sarah Bonnor is close to retirement and says in Perth, Western Australia, “bulk-billing is a rarity”. She is worried about the cost of GP appointments and dental care. “I Googled bulk-billing doctors in Perth metro and so few came up,” she said. “This means I have to travel to attend a bulk-billing GP. I refuse to pay the $85 out-of-pocket expense which is standard in Perth when attending a non bulk-billing GP. If bulk-billing were not available to me, it would be a struggle especially with rising costs of living expenses, fuel prices, local government rates, and utility bills.” Bonner has a chronic illness which requires reasonably regular GP visits. Unable to wait in the hope that one day dental treatment might be included in Medicare, she has opted for tooth extractions, rather than pay for the cost of implants. “This means my chewing is compromised and I have to steer clear of some foods,” she said. “I have lived and worked previously in the UK through dual citizenship, and there I received all my dental care for minuscule amounts. I pay my taxes and feel strongly about such unnecessary, out-of-pocket expenses in Australia.” *All names have been changed to protect medical records and privacy",News/Australia news,‘Almost impossible to get bulk billed’: patients avoid seeing doctors due to out-of-pocket costs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/almost-impossible-to-get-bulk-billed-patients-avoid-seeing-doctors-due-to-out-of-pocket-costs
5/12/2022,"In the world of Chinese-speaking media, “Sydney Daddy” is an Australian YouTube phenomenon: a kind of Alan Jones for Mandarin-speakers, who has found unexpected success, not just in Australia but throughout the diaspora. From his home in Sydney Edgar Lu, 41, does a talk-back style program two or three times a week, interviewing politicians and local community figures or ranting on issues he cares about. “I think by Australian standards, I’m centre-right,” he says. He says he’s not “anti-CCP, but at the same time, I don’t particularly care what they think”. YouTube offers a platform that is free from the censorship that applies to the popular China-based WeChat, allowing Lu to build his rightwing profile and earning him a sizeable audience. But some are less than enamoured of Lu and his pro-Trump views, accusing him of confecting a rightwing stance in order to attract eyeballs. On Twitter, the Chinese-Australian dissident artist and political cartoonist Badiucao has engaged in vigorous criticism of Lu, despite both parties being less than enamoured of the Chinese Communist party. Recently it has boiled over into threats of legal action by Badiucao over Lu using his artwork on his channel. Lu’s topics are an eclectic mix. During the election he has aired a commentary video about Gladys Liu, stating that although Liu had been accused of being “a CCP spy” (something she denies) he would suggest voting for her in comparison to Labor’s Carina Garland who “allegedly supported Black Lives Matter”. He has done an interview with former Chinese diplomat Han Yang, who is a Labor supporter. As they discussed why Yang was supporting Labor, Sydney Daddy made it clear he was a Liberal supporter. More controversially on Twitter, he has resurrected allegations made by a former member of Young Labor, Kathy Sherriff, about an alleged historical rape by former leader Bill Shorten at a camp when she was 16. The allegations were strenuously denied by Shorten and have been investigated, but not pursued by the Victorian police due to inadequate evidence. Lu has accused “the leftist media” of failing to take up this issue with sufficient vigour. In the past, Lu regularly commentated on Donald Trump (he’s a supporter of his policies on the economy, immigration and foreign policy, though not of the January 6 Capitol Hill riot). Domestically the topics that are hot within the community include the influence of the CCP, racism, Covid lockdowns and security issues. He has interviewed the veteran Liberal senator Eric Abetz about his questions to Chinese-Australian witnesses in a parliamentary committee in October 2020. During the inquiry, which was investigating issues affecting diaspora communities in Australia, Abetz demanded the witnesses unconditionally condemn “the Chinese Communist party dictatorship”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While Abetz was lashed by the English-speaking media for the comments, which condemned by some as racist and McCarthyist, Lu supported Abetz’s position. In the interview, Abetz explained that he had been told by Chinese community members about the CCP influence and that he thought it was important leaders should condemn the CCP to prove that they were not acting in the CCP’s interests. Lu also interviewed One Nation’s Stuart Bonds, who is running for the Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon’s former seat of Hunter, explaining that Lu was fascinated by the party and their views. The interview was surprisingly well received by his audience, he says. Opinionated, chatty and, at times, probing and provocative are the words that best sum up Lu. YouTube does not censor most topics, meaning Lu’s audience are getting a very different take on the Ukraine war or Australia-China relations to those relying on the China-based WeChat platform. “I have been covering Covid from the very rumour about it in China. I think the Chinese government’s cover-up and reluctance to cooperate in the inquiry of its origin is despicable, and the main cause of any discrimination towards the Asian community worldwide,” he told the Guardian. “The #stopasianhate campaign, which suppresses criticism of this elephant in the room in the name of anti-racism, is hijacked and something I strongly disagree [with] and campaign against.” Why “Sydney Daddy”? Because that’s what he is. Lu took on parenting responsibilities full-time after his wife returned to her career, and decided to start his own YouTube channel in 2019. “Back then, I didn’t think I could make this a full-time job, but right now, with 170,000 subscribers, yes, you can definitely have a middle class life with that,” he says. Lu has a background in the media. Before he had kids, he worked as a translator for the Discovery Channel and migrated to Australia in 2014. About 20% of his viewers are in Australia, about 17% in the US, 15% in Canada, and more in Japan, Taiwan and Europe. In Australia he seems to be popular with middle-aged Chinese-speaking men, who are increasingly getting their news from YouTube rather than WeChat. Lu says he doesn’t know that much about his Australian audience but he believes his program resonates with Chinese-Australians who have concerns about national security as well as with people in business. Sydney Daddy says his main competitors for eyeballs are overseas YouTubers, as there are few in Australia. “My dream was, like, having a lot of people who get talking, so we can do public debates on our platforms,” he says. “YouTubers, they are more down to Earth. I think the government should be should do more to actually encourage these kinds of content rather than invest a lot of money into ABC and SBS.” In the next few weeks Lu says he will be turning to the Australian election. He’s done an interview with Gladys Liu which will run soon and he’s been asking his audience what they would like to hear about. “Well, basically, to be honest, all the topics about Australian politics have average or low views, low amounts of views,” he says. What do seem to do well are reports about controversial topics, such as the rare appearance of the deputy head of China’s embassy in Australia, Wang Xining, on the ABC’s Q+A program in 2020, in which he went toe-to-toe with China experts about the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Lu ran a translation of the exchange. “That one did 1.5m views,” Lu said. Being a Mandarin-speaking shock-jock has its risks, however. Recently he received a concerns notice – the first step in a defamation action – from someone in the community in Australia. It has clearly rattled him. Lu says he tries to limit his interaction with his audience to online exchanges because of security issues. “Two days ago, some guy in a 7-11, he’d recognised me, asked me if I’m Sydney Daddy, and I was like, running away from him as quickly as I can, because I don’t want people to recognise where I live.” “When I go out anywhere I wear a mask even before this pandemic,” he adds. “Behind my fear is the actual fear. To be honest, it’s quite hard to actually define what’s going to happen to me but this fear – I think everyone from China mainland [feels it]. Whether you just voice your opposition or voice your political view they all have this concern – they will get to you sooner or later.” Lu says he’s worried about retaliation from the CCP. While he has received no direct messages from official Chinese government sources, he said people who have experience with the Chinese government have warned him not to go back to China. But it’s not just the Chinese government he fears; it’s “anyone who is pro-Chinese government who would like to make me an example”, he says. “If someone wants to get a promotion, they will get you.”",News/Australia news,‘Sydney Daddy’: why the Chinese-language YouTube shock jock wears a mask in public,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/sydney-daddy-why-the-chinese-language-youtube-shock-jock-wears-a-mask-in-public
5/12/2022,"On Tuesday, Anthony Albanese committed a major gaffe of the election campaign when he told reporters he believed the minimum wage should rise to keep pace with inflation. This horrendous error will surely be the … wait … what??? It is a true sign of just how so many political and economics journalists are captured by business lobby groups that this is even a story. Albanese, when asked if his belief that workers on the minimum wage should not go backwards meant that he supported “a wage hike of at least 5.1% to keep up with inflation”, responded by saying: “Absolutely.” Is this a shock? Do you think the real wages of the lowest paid in Australia should go backwards? Do you believe that the solution to rising inflation is that the standard of living of the poorest workers in the country should decline? Because that is what Albanese would have been advocating were he to have disagreed with the question. But you see, this is the issue with wages growth. Journalists these past weeks have been asking Albanese how he would get wages to rise – one journalist absurdly wanted him to guarantee he would raise wages. And yet as soon as he does the bare minimum thing of advocating for the minimum wage to rise in line with inflation, journalists flee to the business groups seeking a quote and start shouting about a return to the 1970s. Spare me. The reaction was as you would expect – the AFR ran “Employers warn Labor’s 5pc pay rise will crush business”, and Scott Morrison was reported as quickly siding with business groups, saying that Albanese’s “thoughtlessness on this would actually make inflation worse”. Seriously. Aren’t journalists meant to have some critical capacity? Every year in May, business groups warn wage rises need to be restrained, because every year in May the Fair Work Commission is deciding the next minimum wage increase. And every year business groups advocate a rise lower than inflation. This is not news. But wages should rise faster than inflation, because we want living standards to rise as well. And wages rising faster than inflation is not inflationary. I know I have said this before, but it bears repeating – if wages grow in line with increases in inflation and productivity, they are not inflationary. Don’t take my word for it – listen to the man appointed by Scott Morrison as the head of the Department of the Treasury. Steven Kennedy said the same in February when testifying before the Senate economics estimates committee: “If we can achieve productivity growth of 1.5%, then [assuming 2.5% inflation] nominal wages can grow at 4% and put no pressure on inflation.” It’s pretty easy: wages growth = inflation + productivity growth. Or to make it even easier: real-wages growth = productivity growth. So how have we been doing on this score? No one is suggesting this equation must hold every month – because productivity and inflation can get erratic. So let’s look at a rolling three year-average to remove the noise: Graph not displaying? Click here Aside from a period during the GFC and just before the pandemic when productivity hit pitiful lows, real wages have consistently grown by less than productivity. As I noted in my work for the Centre for Future Work thinktank, from June 2019 to the end of last year inflation grew 5.7% and productivity has grown by 4.5%. Now, 5.7+4.5 = 10.2. But instead, wages have increased by just 4.8%. Back in 2013 then ACTU economist Matt Cowgill constructed another measure of labour earnings using the compensation of employees in the GDP figures and the hours worked by employees in the labour force figures. He found that in the 1970s real wages had outpaced productivity, but since the turn of this century? Nope: Graph not displaying? Click here Now, I hear you saying that’s all well and good, but what about minimum wages? Won’t a 5.1% increase push up inflation given the current inflation rise is supposed to be temporary? Won’t that lock in more inflation? Nope. Currently the Reserve Bank of Australia is predicting inflation growing by 5.9% in the 12 months to December and then down to 4.3% by June next year. That means a 5.1% increase would have seen inflation growing faster than or equal to the minimum wage for two years: Graph not displaying? Click here And here’s the thing about the minimum wages – yes, they get a boost in July, but they then decline in real terms because prices don’t just rise once a year. You could buy more with $20.33 (the hourly rate) last July than you can now. This happens every year, and so the annual increases are a chance to make up for this decline. But because inflation has grown by so much in the past year, even a 5.1% increase won’t make up for the rise in prices. What about business groups’ suggestions? Well, the Australian Industry Group in its infinite generosity has increased its initial proposal of a 2% increase to 2.5%. And yet given the predictions of inflation over the next year that would take the real value of the minimum wage back to 2015 levels: Graph not displaying? Click here As it is, even a 5.1% increase would see the real minimum wage by next June at a level last seen in 2017. So much for a return to the 1970s. So much for destroying businesses. So much for wages driving inflation. Wages should grow faster than inflation and if you don’t believe so at least be honest and say you believe living standards should fall – and in this case for the poorest paid workers.",News/Business,It shouldn’t be such a shock that Anthony Albanese believes the minimum wage should rise with inflation | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/may/12/it-shouldnt-be-such-a-shock-that-anthony-albanese-believes-the-minimum-wage-should-rise-with-inflation
5/12/2022,"Thirty years after the landmark Mabo decision relegated terra nullius to legal fiction, a number of Indigenous Queenslanders say the resulting native title laws can be used to “box tick” approvals for the destruction of sacred sites. The concerns relate to how developers, miners and government departments seek to obtain the approval of traditional owners for construction and extraction projects on their lands, with criticisms that the current system is too reliant on native title claims. They were contained in submissions to a state government review into the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act and are not yet public, but three have been seen by Guardian Australia. They include submissions by parties who currently dispute the cultural authority of some native title applicants. The act directs those who would construct highways, dig mines or build housing estates to consult an “Aboriginal party” and, under certain circumstances, enter into a Cultural Heritage Management Plan (CHMP). In defining an Aboriginal party, the act turns to native title which, as of last July, is recognised over nearly 30% of Queensland territory. Where a project is proposed for an area with no officially recognised group of native title holders, the developer must seek out the registered native title claimant for that land. About 25% of the state’s landmass is subject to native title claims. The managing director for the Yumbangku Aboriginal Culture Heritage and Tourism Development Aboriginal Corporation, Suzanne Thompson, argued in a submission that the definition of “Aboriginal party” in the act should be changed. She said traditional owners “with knowledge and authority” about cultural heritage should be actively engaged “regardless of whether there is already a native title party recognised for that area”. “Currently, proponents are able to simply tick a box by entering into a CHMP with the Aboriginal party, regardless of whether they are the right people to speak for the area being impacted,” the Indigenous woman from Barcaldine said in her submission. A lawyer with 25 years’ experience advising and representing Aboriginal groups in native title negotiations, James Fitzgerald, told Guardian Australia that the debate over identifying the correct authority on cultural heritage was playing out across the country. Fitzgerald said native title was never designed to be an “all-purpose panacea to colonialism” and the high court justices who issued its ruling recognised native title would be of “limited use” in areas of south-east Australia where the effects of colonialism were greatest. “Native title wasn’t designed as a cultural heritage reference point and it is not fit for purpose in determining who speaks for cultural heritage,” he said. “It’s just been linked up that way by white bureaucrats.” Wangan and Jagalingou man Adrian Burragubba told the Guardian that native title law had divided Indigenous families and often excluded “the correct cultural people” – those with cultural knowledge and authority – from protecting their cultural heritage. “Native title is a mechanism that is set up to actually just to get the clearances done,” Burragubba said. Another submission came from an Indigenous group who say they were excluded from development agreements made upon their lands. Diane Djaki Widjung has Indigenous ancestry and was adopted into the Sovereign Native Tribes of the Kabi First Nation and given a “lifelong obligation” by elders to protect the Djaki Kundu site near Gympie. Djaki Widjung said that an Aboriginal person or group who made a native claim to an area were “straight away regarded as the go-to people to engage in contractual agreements” was a “major problem”. “There are no checks and balances to make sure that the right people are making decisions,” she said. Another theme of the three submissions was their authors’ desire to have their arguments made public. “A lot of the reason that legislation is ineffective is because so many things are done behind closed doors,” Djaki Widjung said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Cultural Heritage Act review began in May 2019 and the submissions above were made as part of an options paper meant to finalise the review. A Department of Seniors, Disability Services and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander spokesperson said the options paper received more than 400 submissions and survey responses online, over the phone, via email and in hard copy while consultation was open between December 2021 and 31 March. “The department is in the process of analysing submissions and responses,” the spokesperson said. “Decisions about publication will be made in due course.”",News/Australia news,"Sacred sites being put at risk due to native title law, Queensland review told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/sacred-sites-being-put-at-risk-due-to-native-title-law-queensland-review-told
5/12/2022,"At the end of last year, many signs pointed to Australia’s economy reaching a post-Covid sweet spot right about now, in the middle of the election campaign. Even Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe was confident 2022 would be rate-rise free. But that was before most central banks – including Australia’s – underestimated the strength of demand coming out of the pandemic and resulting plunge in joblessness, Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine and energy and food prices soaring. So what will be the leading economic challenges facing a new or returned government after 21 May? And could financial markets turmoil add a last-minute campaign twist? “A strong expansion in the Australian economy is under way and inflation will increase further,” was how the RBA summarised part of the outlook section in its quarterly statement on monetary policy last Friday. The economy grew 4.2% in 2021 and the central bank is expecting a similar pace – 4.5% averaged over the year – for 2022. RBA in its statement on monetary policy was expecting GDP growth for 2022 of 5.5% just three months ago. That's now been trimmed to 4.5%, and easing back to 2% by the end of 2023. CPI, of course, is sharply higher than forecast back in February (in Australia and beyond.) pic.twitter.com/djxY4wV8V6 Looks pretty steady, right? Well, getting there won’t be a given. “Compared to even just a few months ago, the headwinds are definitely much stronger than they have been,” Cherelle Murphy, EY’s chief Oceania economist, says. “And much of that has been because of international factors, which we know well, like the war in Ukraine, and the China [Covid] lockdowns as well, which are obviously a concern to us, given our reliance on that economy as our biggest trading partner.” More costly fuel and price increases for newly built dwellings – linked to the war and China supply issues, respectively – accounted for almost half the March quarter’s headline consumer price inflation spurt to 5.1%. Cue last week’s RBA rate rise. Both RBA and treasury predict GDP growth to slow back to the 2% range by 2023. The 1.1 million or so Australian property owners who had taken out mortgages since November 2010 when the RBA last raised its cash rate wouldn’t have welcomed the increase. However, the novelty came after 18 consecutive cuts to a record low 0.1%, so some rise was inevitable. That didn’t make it any easier for the Morrison government to explain the extra costs about to be loaded on to borrowers. The next treasurer, though, better block out some time on the first Tuesday of most months to come if investors are any guide. Markets predict the RBA will rapidly raise the cash rate to almost 3% by the end of 2022 - a much faster rise than economists and the central bank itself forecast. pic.twitter.com/8Nzz3IjNeC Economists aren’t so bullish but most pick at least four more hikes in 2022 alone. The RBA, for its part, is predicting the cash rate to peak at 2.5% by the December quarter of 2023. Independent economist Saul Eslake says the central bank has some reason to be confident that it can contain the inflation spike that will prompt those rate hikes. Each rate rise sucks some of demand out of the economy, easing on the margin part of the inflationary pressure. And – short of some other unexpected supply shock – some of the major sources of inflationary pressures “are actually receding”, Eslake said. “The spike in global inflation we’re seeing at the moment, that began around this time last year in the US with big increases in the price of consumer durable goods,” he said. The imbalance in supply and demand, as shown by falling prices for many products such as semiconductors or sinking costs of shipping, appears to be easing. “If the impact of a conflict in Ukraine on energy prices has passed by, say, September or October, then probably inflation will be clearly on the decline,” Eslake says. The next treasurer will have to decide whether to extend the halving of the fuel excise beyond September when the $3bn, six-month measure is due to end. The 22.5 cent per litre saving for motorists also trimmed headline inflation by a quarter of a percentage point in the June quarter alone, the federal budget estimated. But it’s not just liquid fuels increasing in price and feeding higher costs more generally. Wholesale power prices rose two-thirds in the March quarter to $87 per megawatt hour, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) reported last month. Accounting for roughly one-third of retail bills, the jump in generation costs is already showing up in utility charges with some New South Wales consumers hit with 30% tariff increases. Many households will be receiving higher retail electricity prices in the months to come, to account for the hike in wholesale prices. Here’s one sent my way, revealing a 23% later this month. What are others seeing? pic.twitter.com/SUaC5tPNUl Big electricity users in NSW and Queensland can expect 20% increases or more, says Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre. Critical will be how the federal government works on supporting states in their decarbonisation efforts. “The states have the bit between the teeth, and the commonwealth has rejected the most effective intervention it could have presented – pricing emissions,” Mountain says. With a carbon market ruled out, one supporting storage may be the next best thing. “[The] focus should be squarely on storage policy and ensuring the growth of the industry, in a similar way that its renewable electricity policy has been effective in growing the renewable generation sector,” he said. As the CPI heads towards 6%, calls from unions and others are mounting about the need for higher wages – a challenge for the next treasurer and all of the state ones. NSW, for instance, has a public sector wage cap of 2.5% a year that next month’s state budget will likely increase. The Fair Work Commission, too, will have to rule on how much to lift the minimum wage. Last year’s 2.5% increase to $20.33 must be lifted by 5.5%, the Australian Council of Trade Unions argued this week as it upped its earlier claim for a 5% gain after the 5.1% March CPI spike. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said workers on average lost $800 in 2021 alone in real terms as salary increases failed to keep pace with inflation. The retreat in the first half of 2022 alone would be a further $2,000. “Working people are facing a cost-of-living crisis driven by nearly a decade of low wage growth capped by real wage cuts under this government,” she said. “These are the cleaners, aged care staff and millions of other frontline workers who carried us through the pandemic.” Business groups, such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, are arguing for a 3% increase in the minimum wage, saying that lifting wages without productivity gains will only stoke inflation and result in RBA rate hikes. “The Reserve Bank is still targeting an inflation rate of between 2-3%,” ACCI chairman’s Andrew McKellar says. “So we’ve got to get inflation back to a level that’s sustainable.” Other measures that boost productivity, such as cheaper childcare and more vocational training, should be a high priority for the next government. “At the moment, we’re still seeing pretty weak signs in terms of what’s happening on productivity,” he said. Could Australia’s election campaign overlap with the start of a financial meltdown, adding to the task list of the new or re-elected government. Fears of a combination of slowing growth, even recession, and rising inflation – or stagflation – have lately riled investors, sending the price of many assets tumbling. The board S&P 500 of major US shares are now posting their second-worst start to any year, with about US$9tn (AU$13tn) of stock value erased, Bloomberg says. The awful start to the year for US #stocks has been amplified by the lack of “safe assets” as government #bonds decline and cash is pressured by high inflation—aka the ongoing unwind of the everything rally made possible by prolonged and excessive central bank market intervention https://t.co/tyaOS1NEar Past treasurers have had to cope with volatile markets but usually had time to get their feet under the desk first. The 1987 stock market crash in October 1987, for instance, landed about three months after the Hawke government’s re-election, Peter Costello had a couple of years to hone his tools before the Asian financial crisis in 1998, while Wayne Swan was a couple of months into the treasurer’s job before the global financial crisis. Eslake – who counts his advice as an ANZ economist that the 1987 crash would have little economic impact as among his career’s best assessments – says Australia’s economy has momentum that should enable it to ride over a few more road bumps yet. Households, for instance, have some $275bn in bank deposits garnered since Covid began to assist with rising costs of living and higher debt repayments. “Both the Reserve Bank and the Treasury are forecasting that real consumer spending will rise by more than 5% this year,” he says. “That’s the highest since 1984.” The Australian dollar’s drop below 70 US cents to the lowest in almost two years won’t cause too much grief to a new treasurer or to the RBA “provided it doesn’t fall too fast”. Australian exports will benefit including hard-hit tourism and student sectors. “If the [US Federal Reserve] eventually raises rates to levels that cause recessions in the US or perhaps more likely in other parts of the world, or currency crises in other parts of the world, that’s probably more likely the avenue [of hurting Australia’s economy] than something happening in the stock market,” Eslake said.",News/Australia news,Markets turmoil and interest rate rises: the economic challenges facing Australia after the election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/markets-turmoil-and-interest-rate-rises-the-economic-challenges-facing-australia-after-the-election
5/12/2022,"Driving down Beach Road, it quickly becomes apparent the race in Goldstein – one of the Liberal party’s safest Melbourne seats for more than 120 years – is tight. Attached to the beachfront mansions, there are dozens of signs spruiking the economic credentials of the incumbent, Tim Wilson – some recently cleaned of vandalism – and just as many of Zoe Daniel, the former ABC journalist running as an independent. Ormond resident Shai Diner says it’s an exciting time for many in the electorate who traditionally don’t vote Liberal and have felt their vote “doesn’t matter”. “There seems to be a growing sentiment that we can make something happen here and I hope that’s the case,” he says. “It’s a progressive electorate. We’re in inner-city Melbourne, people care about climate change, people care about integrity in politics, people care about human rights, but economically they’re not pro-welfare and all of that, so that’s why Liberals have always [held the seat].” Goldstein is among the country’s wealthier electorates, with a median household weekly income of $2,018, according to the 2016 census, almost double the Australian average of $1,124. The majority of residents were born in Australia, own their home and are well educated. And, like property prices, support for the Liberals is highest closest to the beach, in the suburbs of Brighton, Hampton, Sandringham, Black Rock and Beaumaris. Further inland in Bentleigh, Ormond and McKinnon and parts of Cheltenham, Highett and Elsternwick, where there are strong Jewish, Greek, Chinese and Indian communities, Labor outpolled the Liberals at most booths. Wilson holds the seat with what would normally seem a comfortable 7.8% margin. Diner, usually a Labor voter, is backing Daniel at this election. He doesn’t hold back in his criticism of Scott Morrison, whom he describes as “one of the worst prime ministers we’ve had”. “It took me many years to realise Scott Morrison wasn’t a lazy prime minister, which I always believed he was, and I couldn’t comprehend why he didn’t do things in the bushfires, the pandemic. I feel stupid now, but realise it’s ideology,” he says. “He just doesn’t believe that governments should do stuff, and to me that’s like, why would you be in government? What’s the point?” About a five-minute drive from Ormond is the shopping strip on Centre Road in Bentleigh, where Ashleigh Moore has spent the morning scouring the local op shops. She makes a similar appraisal of the prime minister: “We’ve had zero leadership. He’s had no accountability. When we’ve really needed him, he hasn’t been there.” Moore is considering voting for Daniel, having ruled out both major parties due to their lack of support for the events industry, in which she is employed, during the pandemic. She is also concerned about climate change, housing affordability and the rental crisis, though she suspects these issues may not resonate for others in the electorate. “We live in a very privileged demographic here and a lot of the issues I think that broader Australia would face we just don’t see in Bentleigh,” she says. “I come from absolutely nothing so I have been first-hand in the rental crisis and I have been first-hand relying on Centrelink payments, so I know what that feels like, and I think there’s not a lot of people in this suburb or this area that have lived through that.” David Jane, director at Century 21 Bentleigh, has worked as a real estate agent in the area for more than 50 years and has seen housing prices skyrocket. He bought his first home in Bentleigh for $12,000. It would probably be worth $1.8m today, he says. “I honestly don’t know how they afford it,” Jane says of the young, aspirational families moving into the area. A lifelong Liberal supporter, he likes Morrison and says he’s done a good job despite the challenges of the pandemic. “He hasn’t been perfect, but no one is,” Jane says. Of Anthony Albanese, he says: “I don’t know whether he’s the right man for out the front. I think his heart’s in it but I just don’t know whether he’s coming across properly.” Several Goldstein voters describe Albanese as a “nice guy”, but question his ability to lead the nation. They include retiree Jenny King. “I do feel a bit sorry for him, I don’t think he’s up to the job,” she says as she enjoys a coffee with her sister on Station Street in Sandringham. “He’s a very nice person, he’s a lovely person … But I just don’t think he’s leadership material.” King will continue to vote Liberal, describing Morrison as a “strong leader”. “You need the adult politicians in charge at the moment because of the state of the world, with the war [in Ukraine]. I find there’s a lot of people there for the wrong reason in politics and they’re just on the smaller issues,” she says. King describes Wilson as “laid back” and the Daniel campaign as “intimidating”. “I am just overwhelmed by the amount of propaganda,” King says. At a neighbouring table sits Stuart Douglas, who says his main concern about a Daniel win is the possibility of a hung parliament. “A hung parliament could lead to better debate potentially but it could also … make our decision-making process considerably slower,” he says. He says whoever wins will need to do more to counter Chinese influence in the Pacific. “It would be a good thing if we could put a stop to it with America’s aid,” he says. Despite his interest in politics, the New Zealander, who has lived in Australia for 35 years, jokes that he “can’t be bothered” becoming a citizen, so he won’t be able to vote. Sandringham resident Nicole Walsh has lived in the electorate for 35 years and says until recently she wasn’t interested in politics, because she felt her vote – for Labor in the lower house and the Greens in the Senate – “wasn’t going anywhere”. At this election she will vote for Daniel, having donated to her campaign. “For once I feel like the issues that are important to me will be represented by someone in parliament – because she’s going to get in,” Walsh says, citing climate change, integrity, gender equality and health as her main concerns. She dismisses criticism of Albanese as “too nice”. “What’s wrong with somebody whose nice and genuine?” Walsh says. Labor’s candidate for Goldstein is 25-year-old Martyn Abbott. While corflutes for Wilson and Daniel pepper the electorate, Abbott’s candidacy is all but invisible. Despite initially agreeing to an interview, Abbott stopped responding to requests. In Brighton, Jackson Catalano and Charlie Moore are preparing to vote in their first election. “I’m not a big fan of Scomo to be honest. He’s been there for too long, it’s time for him to go I reckon,” Catalano says. “I don’t think he’s very good for the sort of young Australians, I don’t like his climate policies.” He’ll be voting Labor but is “not a huge fan” of Albanese either. “He’s the better one of the two but I don’t think he’d be much of a prime minister,” Catalano says. “I guess in recent times, Scomo going away during the fires probably wasn’t the greatest look for him,” Moore says. “I will probably have to do a bit more research but I can’t see myself voting for Scomo.” Highett resident Chloe Babic will have her eight-month-old daughter, Teddy, in mind when she votes. “Jobs, interest rates, childcare, housing affordability. All the things we now have to think about with babies, their future, which we probably selfishly didn’t think about before,” she says. Babic is not sure who she’s voting for yet, but says the Liberals would have more of a chance without Morrison as leader. “He’s fairly unlikeable in my opinion. I find him smarmy and smug and insincere and dismissive – any other really bad words? I don’t like him. He irks me,” she says. The overwhelming sentiment in the electorate is a dislike for Morrison, rather than Wilson, who many know only from his signs. Bill Raper is a retired research scientist who worked at the CSIRO. He says the major parties are light on policy and are “demeaning themselves … pretending to be tradies or scientists”. “In my particular case I was infuriated by that idiot [Morrison] trying to pretend that he knew how to do microbiological testing and the next thing he pretended to do some welding and they had to finish it for him,” he says. “It’s very shallow,” his wife, Jenny, says.

An image of Bill leafletting with their poodle, Polly, clad in a custom-made teal jacket was shared by Daniel on social media. “I am very hopeful. I will give up my optimism if she doesn’t win, she must win,” Bill says. “We’ve lived here 62 years. We’ve never really had a true representative, it’s true blue Liberal so they’ve always been either ministers or men on the rise into the ministry and so honestly, they’re absent,” Jenny says. Daniel says many in the electorate have come to realise their vote was being taken for granted by the Liberal party. “They were an automatic tick in the yes column for the Coalition, being thrown a car park here and there but not really being genuinely considered in terms of what the broader priorities and principles of the people who live in the electorate might be,” she says. But Wilson describes Daniel’s campaign as “not born of the community”, citing a more than $400,000 donation she received from Climate 200, as well as support from activist groups such as GetUp and Extinction Rebellion. His home and signs have been repeatedly targeted by vandals. “It’s all very clear. It’s all designed to change our community and I think frankly, residents are sick of it and tired of becoming a target when they’re a smart community, they’re quite capable making up their own decision and it’s not going to come from vandalism,” Wilson says. Daniel says GetUp didn’t consult her campaign but that the group is free to do what it chooses in the electorate, while her signs have also been subject to vandalism. She says the Liberal party has shifted to the right and she is filling the gap. “People who might have described themselves as small-l liberals, who sit closer to the centre of the political spectrum, are in the wilderness. They feel that the Liberal party doesn’t represent them but they’re probably not going to be able to bring themselves to vote Labor. “Now they’ve got me.”",News/Australia news,A new dynamic in Goldstein: teal turbulence sweeps wealthy Melbourne seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/a-new-dynamic-in-goldstein-teal-turbulence-sweeps-wealthy-melbourne-seat
5/12/2022,"Police Citizens Youth Clubs NSW has asked the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, to stop using election flyers featuring its Hornsby president, claiming an endorsement quoted by the Coalition MP was used without the permission of the charity or the local president. Another Liberal MP, Julian Simmonds, has separately come under fire for using months-old endorsements from a local charity and church group in his own political material. A PCYC NSW spokesperson told Guardian Australia it was “concerned the PCYC name has been used without permission for political purposes” on the Fletcher flyers distributed in Sydney’s north. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), the national charity regulator, says charities can engage in “advocacy and campaigning” if those activities further their charitable purpose but forbids charities from engaging in advocacy and campaigning if it promotes or opposes “a political party or a candidate for political office”. Scrutiny on these rules has increased through this election after the chief executive of Guide Dogs Victoria was stood down, pending an independent investigation, for endorsing Josh Frydenberg, and the Liberal MP Trevor Evans used charity testimonials without consent. Fletcher, the member for Bradfield, distributed political pamphlets bearing endorsements of “what locals say about Paul Fletcher”. Alongside a local Hornsby shire councillor and the co-founder of a women’s shelter, the flier quotes Peter Kirkwood in his capacity as president of the PCYC Hornsby Ku-Ring-Gai branch saying Fletcher “engages with the local community in a friendly and professional manner and makes himself available wherever possible”. But PCYC NSW told Guardian Australia that neither the organisation nor Kirkwood himself authorised the use of his name and photo, or the mention of the PCYC Hornsby branch, in Fletcher’s election material. The charity said it was “disappointed” to see the flyer, stressing its obligation under ACNC rules to “remain politically neutral and not endorse political candidates”. “Mr Kirkwood has assured us that he did not authorise the use of his PCYC NSW title or his photo on the flyer,” a spokesperson said.

We would like to assure our members and supporters that PCYC NSW is politically independent and does not advocate for any political party or members.” PCYC NSW said it had asked Fletcher’s office to remove it and Kirkwood from the material. A spokesman for Fletcher defended the use of Kirkwood’s quote, but said it wouldn’t happen again. “Paul Fletcher has strong relationships with a range of community organisations and community leaders in Bradfield,” Fletcher’s spokesman said in a statement. “Mr Kirkwood offered a personal reflection on his association with Paul, not a political endorsement. However, in consideration of concerns raised by the PCYC, his testimonial will not appear on any further campaign materials.” Separately, residents in the Brisbane seat of Ryan have reported receiving testimonials for Simmonds, a first-term Coalition MP, in the mail. Quotes in support of Simmonds have been attributed to the Pink Elephants Support Network and priest Mark Franklin, despite the Brisbane Archdiocese revealing the latter testimonial was not intended for use in the election campaign. The material is authorised by Simmonds, but was distributed with letterheads from the charity and church. The testimonial from Franklin, from Our Lady of the Rosary Parish Kenmore and Moggill, is dated 8 February and praises Simmonds for being “respectful, engaging and friendly”. A resident of Moggill, who asked to remain anonymous, said they were “very concerned about the potential misuse of the letter”. “So I contacted the parish who confirmed the letter was written more as a character reference and they were not aware it was being distributed in this manner. “I found it completely inappropriate to receive this letter. It makes no attempt to even appear to be campaign material … The use of the church’s letterhead is completely inappropriate.” In a statement, the Archdiocese of Brisbane said the Kenmore parish had provided the letter “following a request from [Simmonds] electorate office”. “This letter was not intended for the purpose of inclusion in any election campaign material.” The second testimonial, from the miscarriage and early pregnancy loss charity Pink Elephants, praises Simmonds for helping legislate bereavement leave through its Leave for Loss campaign. “I will be forever grateful to Julian and his team for stepping up and helping us to make monumental change for our community,” the charity’s chief executive Samantha Payne wrote. Payne told Guardian Australia the testimonial was given “a while ago”, and referred further questions to the organisation. A Pink Elephants spokesperson said the charity was “aware of our obligations as a registered charity and we do not promote, endorse, or oppose any political candidates or parties”. “The views expressed are in direct relation to the Leave for Loss Pregnancy campaign for bereavement leave for early pregnancy loss, and not intended for political purposes.” Guardian Australia has contacted the Liberal party for comment.",News/Australia news,"Paul Fletcher used PCYC’s endorsement ‘without permission’ on election flyers, youth charity claims",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/paul-fletcher-used-pcycs-endorsement-without-permission-on-election-flyers-youth-charity-claims
5/12/2022,"The Australian Electoral Commission is scrambling to secure more voting locations in flood-ravaged Lismore after residents raised concerns that just one prepolling site, which has accessibility issues, is open. Residents also called for better communication from the AEC to tell people that their usual polling place may have been “washed away” in the floods, and to help them find a new location to vote at in the 21 May election. Lismore resident Clare Kearney, who watched her beloved city go underwater in February and March, said residents needed to have their say and that the AEC needed to be doing everything it could to make that as easy as possible. The only early voting in Lismore this week.

Everything is so hard for people here right now. You have to jump through so many hoops to do anything.” Kearney lives near Southern Cross University – where the only polling booth in operation is located – and said it was hard to find. It would be near impossible to access “if you had any sort of [physical] disability”, Kearney said, noting many people had lost their cars and transport was an issue. Another local, Rose Harvey, understood that people making decisions from Sydney might not understand how challenging life still is for people in Lismore. But she said there should be more help for residents who are “feeling powerless” to exercise their democratic right to vote. “People are going to turn up to where [the polling booth] used to be and it will have washed away,” she said. “This has shocked people to their core and that means that they aren’t thinking straight. “It’s been a real letdown … the AEC has had months [to prepare] and they haven’t done enough.” In response to answers posed to them on Twitter, the AEC said it was doing what it could but they have been limited when “plan after plan gets interrupted”, referring to the two major flooding events this year and the impact of the pandemic. “If we could have had more prepolls, and more accessible options, we would have,” the AEC said on Twitter. “[The] local team have worked really hard to stand up services we could.” The AEC’s media director, Evan Ekin-Smyth, said the university booth had taken about 1,000 votes in the first two days since opening. A second prepolling venue at Carrington Street, which will open at the weekend, has “better accessibility”. “We’d encourage anyone who needs particular accessibility requirements to visit that venue if they need to prepoll,” Ekin-Smyth said. He said venues for election day were still being finalised, with hopes to lock in seven to match the city’s 2019 offering. “With regard to voting venues generally, they are not our premises and there are not suitable premises just sitting around for us to occupy,” he said. “Venues we had planned [to use] could no longer be used and we had to change. We also had alternative venues become unavailable as well forcing very late change.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He urged people unable to vote in person to use postal voting, for which about 10,000 people in the electorate of Page have applied. “People can access a postal vote if they can’t make it in person and this can be delivered to a nominated address rather than an enrolled one,” he said. “For instance, if people are temporarily displaced then a postal vote can come to a hotel or caravan park.”",News/Australia news,‘Washed away’: residents angry as one polling booth opens in flood-hit Lismore,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/washed-away-residents-angry-as-one-polling-booth-opens-in-flood-hit-lismore
5/12/2022,"My body knew the accident was coming a few minutes before it did. I’d just picked up my friend from the centre of a regional town and pulled back on to the highway when I felt a tension across my thighs like a shot of cortisol. Moments later, waiting at the last set of lights before the open road, another car slammed into the back of my Subaru Forester and – almost a decade after getting my first car – my thoughts turned to insurance for the first time. Immediately I sensed my car was a write-off – it was a hefty whack, although my body absorbed the impact OK. The other driver was suitably apologetic, which made things a lot easier; they accepted full liability, and we swapped licence details and got out of there before the lights had gone red again. I’d taken some quick photos at the accident site, then pulled over shortly afterwards to inspect the damage more closely and get more photos. By the next morning, my diligent opposite number had already lodged a claim with his insurer, which suited me. Jane Foley, the acting director of casework at the Financial Rights Legal Centre, advises that it’s always better to use the other party’s insurance if they have it. “You don’t have to pay the excess,” she says. “And then you’re not bound by the terms of your own policy.” You might, for example, have an agreed value as part of your car insurance policy, and you’d still be limited to that despite considerations like the car market inflating due to supply chain issues. According to Foley, I got the next step wrong, although I got away with it. “My first advice is do not let the other insurer inspect your car,” she says. “The only reason they want to inspect your car is to then devalue it.” In my case, I’d already confirmed my intuition of a write-off with a friendly mechanic who declined to do the paperwork but pointed me round the corner to the insurer’s nominated repairer, who immediately deemed my Forester a “total loss”. However, they also filed a bunch of their own photos with the insurer, which were then the basis for endless references to “sun damage to the paint job” as grounds for reducing the valuation. “I always tell people: do not give your power to the assessor,” Foley says. I was happy to green light the write-off, but if you feel more attached to your car and believe it should be repaired, there are time limits you should be aware of. “The insurer has 10 days to assess it and get back to you,” says Uta Mihm, an insurance specialist at consumer advocate Choice. “And if you don’t want to write it off, you only have seven days to dispute that.” For me, it was time to play hardball. I knew everything I said on the phone would be recorded, so I made sure I had my ducks in a row before taking the call from the claims assessor. The most important thing to clarify was the likely market rate for my vehicle. Redbook, Glass Guide and The Drive Guide are industry price guides and by looking under the hood of my car and finding the VIN code, I was then able to use an online tool to confirm the make, model and year of my vehicle. To stack up the case, I borrowed a tip from the journalist Royce Kurmelovs, who wrote Just Money after his own experience after a car accident. Kurmelovs suggests making a table with the make, model and year in one column and the prices similar vehicles are selling for in another, which you can find by scanning resale sites like CarSales, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace. It turns out that lots of people are trying to off-load mid-2000s Subaru Foresters, so I had a plethora of references. While Foley advises presenting a formal letter of demand to the other party to resolve the claim, I opted to email their insurer with a clear and compelling outline of factors bearing on my expected valuation, with links to citations such as the price comparison table I had made. One thing that wasn’t priced into the equation is personal injury. Although my passenger woke up three days later unable to lift his arm above his shoulder, it turns out he’d just slept on it badly. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As Mihm notes, compulsory third party insurance, which is paid during vehicle registration, covers these costs – provided you are not at fault for the accident. “You’re covered for pain and suffering, loss of wages, claims management expenses, care and support such as medical treatment and rehabilitation,” she says. The insurer rang around some wreckers but couldn’t find anyone who’d pay them for my damaged car, so I got to keep it too. In the end, I was able to score more for my Forester on the second-hand private market than selling it for salvage to a wrecker. I coaxed it up the coast in the dead of night (wearing four layers with all the windows down, to combat exhaust fumes pouring in through the boot) and sold it on Gumtree. By now, the insurer had come back to me with an offer that was more than 50% up on their initial proposal, passing the threshold I originally set myself. All that remained was to insist the insurance pay for a hire car, and we had a deal I was happy to settle.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Crash course: how to deal haggle with insurers after a car accident,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/12/crash-course-how-to-haggle-with-insurers-after-a-car-accident
5/12/2022,"Dozens of prominent Australian writers have joined forces to push voters to prioritise climate action in the federal election. Writers for Climate Action, headed by award-winning Sydney author Kate Grenville, has garnered support from more than 60 popular Australian writers, including Helen Garner, Tony Birch, Di Morrisey, John Coetzee and Matthew Reilly. Without backing a particular party or candidate, the group is urging Australians to prioritise candidate’s proposed action on the climate crisis when they head to the polls on 21 May. “Like so many others, writers feel helpless to make a difference,” Grenville said. “Using our influence in this way, we might. “I’m hoping people find their favourite author on that list and think ‘oh wow, if they think we should put climate change first ahead of all the other competing issues, then maybe I should’.” Other signees included Anna Funder, Alice Pung, Anita Heiss, Sofie Laguna, Toni Jordan, Omar bin Musa, Charlotte Wood, Clare Wright, Jock Serong and children’s authors Mem Fox and Alison Lester. Grenville said the group encouraged Australians to research which of their local candidates offered the best hope of meaningful action on climate. “Writers will vote for different people, I wanted to transcend that,” said the author of the Secret River and A Room Made of Leaves, who is also a 71-year-old grandmother. “We’re all being bombarded with stuff, I wanted to step out of that polarised world … here’s an issue that ought to be above politics, let’s make it agnostic.” The idea for the group started when Grenville ran into an acquaintance who told her she wasn’t sure about the need for climate action. “In the same conversation she was wildly enthusiastic about a particular writer’s work,” Grenville said. “I thought, if that writer was on record as supporting climate action, it might shift my acquaintance’s view.” Grenville, who has published 15 books spanning fiction and nonfiction, initially sent an email to half a dozen writers in her network to gauge the interest for a list encouraging voters to place climate first as an electoral priority. She said the response she received was overwhelming. “The email has been running hot with people saying ‘yes, please, thanks for doing it and count me in’,” Grenville said. “Clearly there’s a huge appetite among writers to get out of the helplessness we feel.” A growing number of writers are directly responding to the climate crisis in their work. But Grenville said those that didn’t, grappled with how to make a tangible difference. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We’re all caught up in the muddle of immediate life,” Grenville said. “What writers do at the quietness of their desk is find some kind of coherence to make meaning out of what seems chaotic … that’s perhaps why people look to writers to make meaning.” Novelist and lawyer James Bradley said collective action among writers mattered, particularly coming into the election. “In the noise of an election campaign it’s quite difficult to get messages across, both the major parties for different reasons are keen not to talk about climate change,” he said. “It’s something that touches every aspect of cultural and social and economic life … even writers who you might say it’s not something they’re writing about, I’m sure it’s something they’re thinking about and trying to work out how to respond to in their practice.” Bradley said it was “utterly bizarre” two months after devastating floods global heating had been largely sidelined as a major issue. “The notion it’s not a central issue in our election campaign seems criminal,” he said. “It horrifies me, horrifies a lot of people.” Clare Wright, a Stella prize winner said she joined the group because as a nonfiction writer and academic historian she was “wedded to the notion of evidence”. “Embellishment, exaggeration, fantasy and wishful thinking make for great stories, but you wouldn’t want your gynaecologist or oncologist to embroider the truth,” she said. “All the scientific evidence tells us that our planet is suffering irrevocably from the effects of anthropomorphic climate change. “Writers are largely overlooked in this country as either authority figures or cultural heroes, but collectively, perhaps, we can use our words and our ways of knowing to push the government towards evidence-based climate action, now.”",News/Australia news,Top Australian writers call for climate action to be at the centre of election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/top-australian-writers-call-for-climate-action-to-be-at-the-centre-of-election
5/12/2022,"In football, the dogs bark, and the caravan moves on. There’s always next week. There’s always a new hero, a new villain, a new outrage. For years, Collingwood hoped, or assumed, that Héritier Lumumba would simply go away. He was living on the other side of the world. Most of the major players in the controversy were no longer at the club. Collingwood had positioned itself as a more progressive organisation. Indeed, for years, every time Lumumba would air his grievances, my flinch reaction was always the same: Heritier, you need to let this go. This has been going on for nearly a decade now. Collingwood did all it could. Buckley is a decent man. There’s nothing to be gained from any of this. Even when he wrote articles for Guardian Australia, or published lengthy Twitter threads, I couldn’t shake a certain scepticism. He sounded like a disgruntled former employee. I could never pinpoint exactly what he actually wanted from Collingwood. That changed in late 2020, when the ABC published an in-depth interview, the results of months of research. It wasn’t your typical football profile. We met a fierce man determined to maintain his connection to his ancestors, a man who at first tried to assimilate, who was then put in the too-hard basket, and who was finally actively briefed against by his former club. It hammered home how this sport, and this country, is still unable to properly talk about things with real weight, particularly race and class. And it showed how censorious the footy media is, and how quickly they’ll turn on you. One headline read: “Too Precious. Too Sensitive. Too much hard work.” If I was being honest, it really wasn’t too far removed from my own perception of him. Good journalism challenges you to confront your biases and prejudices, and I hopefully logged off a little more enlightened, if not a bit embarrassed. In this country, and in football, we pride ourselves on our self-deprecation. The footage of Lumumba speaking at the 2014 Best and Fairest is instructive in this regard. He spoke of the importance of community, of the Great Depression, of identity, of standing on the right side of history. The president regularly touched on these themes on breakfast radio, and no one batted an eyelid. But when Lumumba went there, you could sense the room raising a collective eyebrow. You could almost hear them snickering into their napkins: turn it up Harry, or whatever it is you call yourself now, this is the Copeland Trophy, not the United Nations. There was a very Australian sentiment that was consistent throughout the Adam Goodes controversy – mate, you’re not as special as you think you are. The club is bigger than the individual. Your mates come first. Side by side we stand. Lumumba refused to toe the line. He didn’t play by our rules. He reclaimed his name. He made everyone uncomfortable. He was one of the few people in football, and surely the only one at Collingwood, to stand up to Eddie McGuire. It came at considerable cost. A lot of the criticism came with a sneering tone. His mental health was questioned. He was estranged from the club. As Greg Baum wrote in The Age yesterday, “in Lumumba’s voice, there is the remnant of real affection. In Buckley’s, there is heaviness. In both, there is a sense of something lost”. In many ways – and it’s an indictment on the rest of the country – football has led the way on this issue. Read Australia’s ‘most-read columnist’, the cartoons of the newspaper that bears our country’s name, or wade through social media for five minutes and tell me this is just a football problem. But the industry has a tendency to marvel at its own magnificence. In football, we love to celebrate a “great story” – the Aboriginal footballer recently released from prison, the powerhouse from the Tiwi Islands, the cheeky little bugger snapping goals from insane angles. Too often, it’s about making ourselves feel good. We celebrate what ‘they’ bring to ‘our’ game. We pat ourselves on the back when we call out online abuse, or when spectators who throw bananas are ejected. But that stuff is easy. It’s easy to cancel the memberships of some knucklehead. It’s harder and more complicated when we’re dealing with the most powerful president and most prominent media figure in the game. It’s harder and more complicated when we’re dealing with a beloved former club captain. And it’s harder and more complicated when we’re dealing with casual racism; with entrenched attitudes, with an accumulation of indignities and sleights. As far as Collingwood, Lumumba and Buckley go, this entire issue seems unresolvable. But there are other stories emerging, and other voices making themselves heard. One of the most beloved Hawthorn footballers told his story last month. There’s a generation of young sportspeople who are no longer swimming in their lane, who are no longer willing to do all the heavy lifting on race. As a white Australian, it can be bewildering. It can be confronting. We listen to stories about ripped jeans and low-level joshing and we ask: “is that racism”? We’ll never really know what it’s like. But we can listen. We can learn. And maybe, however tortuously, things will change.",Sport/Sport,"Héritier Lumumba made us feel uncomfortable, and from that we have much to learn",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/12/heritier-lumumba-made-us-feel-uncomfortable-and-from-that-we-have-much-to-learn
5/12/2022,"Victoria’s opposition will push for patients to have the right to opt-in to a proposed scheme that will centralise all medical records across the state’s public health system. The centralised database will be accessible by all clinicians in public hospitals and services and is intended to improve patient safety, while aligning with similar systems in place in New South Wales and Queensland. The government proposes that patient participation be compulsory. The creation of the database was recommended in an independent report on a cluster of baby deaths at Bacchus Marsh hospital in 2015. It will include information such as a patient’s medical conditions, mental health issues, allergies and medication, which has led to privacy concerns from civil liberties groups. Guardian Australia understands the state’s opposition will not block the health legislation amendment (information sharing) bill – expected to be introduced in the upper house Thursday – but will move three amendments, including creating the right for patients to leave the system. The opposition’s health spokesperson, Georgie Crozier, accused the Andrews government of rushing through important legislation. “The Liberals and Nationals are extremely concerned about the lack of consultation with important stakeholders, such as the Law Institute of Victoria,” Crozier said. The opposition will also move an amendment to refer the bill to the Legal and Social Issues Committee, which it says would allow stakeholders to “provide proper feedback” on the legislation. The Law Institute of Victoria and civil liberty groups have raised privacy concerns about the bill and called for more stakeholder engagement, saying it gives patients no ability to control the medical information that is recorded. But health bodies say the database will be vital in improving patient safety. The Australian Medical Association’s Victorian president, Dr Roderick McRae, said it was essential doctors could easily access patient’s medical information, particularly in an emergency situation when they were unconscious and not accompanied by someone who could relay their medical history. “It’s ultimately just an ability to have ready information and is in the patient’s interests so that they don’t suffer complications,” he said. “Something as simple as a penicillin allergy can be deadly.” McRae said it would increase efficiency, particularly when the health system was already experiencing unprecedented demand, with emergency departments becoming overcrowded and increased ambulance ramping. “A doctor can just log into a system and find the information, which is miles ahead than trying to leave a message with a GP and get information to come back via fax,” he said. “It’s almost at the stage of smoke signals and carrier pigeons when we have the digital age.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Liberal Democrats upper house MP Tim Quilty will move an amendment to create an opt-in option for the database. “The amendment would also mean every time a medical record is created a person would have to give consent before it is put online,” he said. Liberty Victoria president Michael Stanton said an opt-in model should be created. He warned patients may be discouraged from disclosing sensitive medical information, such as mental health issues and illicit drug use, and lead to poor treatment outcomes, if they were concerned sufficient privacy safeguards were not in place. The database is designed to compliment My Health Record – a nationwide system that contains basic summary information for GPs, hospitals and pharmacies. It was introduced in 2018, as an opt-out system. A Victorian government spokesperson said giving clinicians access to patient information such as allergies, medications and blood test results would improve patient safety, “When a sick patient comes to hospital, the last thing they want to do is re-tell their medical story and take unnecessary tests,” they said. The government will establish a Health Information Sharing Review Board and a clinical advisory committee to oversee system risks and undertake regular audits. Only clinicians involved in a patient’s care can access the medical information and only for the purpose of providing care under the proposal, with penalties of up to two years’ imprisonment for unauthorised access.",News/Australia news,Bid to compulsorily harvest medical records to meet opposition in Victoria’s parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/bid-to-compulsorily-harvest-medical-records-to-meet-opposition-in-victorias-parliament
5/12/2022,"As the last of the sun’s rays curl away from the coast in Australia’s remote north-west, Josie Alec opens her arms and sings in traditional language to a mass of ochre-coloured rocks along Hearson’s Cove. But her voice competes with the low rumble of a gas production plant less than a kilometre away, its flared emissions lightly hazing the sky above the beach. This is the duality of what First Nations people refer to as Murujuga country, home to one of the world’s largest and oldest collections of rock carvings as well as one of the largest new fossil fuel developments in Australia in a decade. Taking in the Burrup peninsula and the nearby Dampier archipelago, the culturally rich area has an estimated 1m ancient petroglyphs. Some of the images, including illustrations of long-extinct species such as the thylacine and flat-tailed kangaroo, are believed to date back nearly 50,000 years. Traditional custodians such as Alec and fellow Kuruma Marthudunera woman Raelene Cooper come to Hearson’s Cove to connect with nature, and the thousands of generations of their people who lived in the country before them, through song. “You feel them in your heart and your soul, our ancestors in the rocks,” Alec says. “We have to wake them up, sing them we’re here, sing them we’re still protecting them. Then you hear the wisdom that they have for the past and the future. And it’s time for listening.” But just who is listening – and who is being listened to – is a live question in Murujuga. While the historical and cultural significance of the art is uncontested, and the subject of a Unesco world heritage bid, it sits uneasily alongside the industrial city of Karratha, a settlement of about 23,000 that is about to double down on fossil fuel extraction. Production in the region is expected to expand significantly after Woodside Energy, an Australian petroleum company, announced in November that it would proceed with a US$12bn liquified natural gas (LNG) development. The scale of Woodside’s proposal is vast. It would open an untapped gas field nearly 250 miles (400km) off the Australian coast and connect it to the mainland via a pipeline through an area rich in marine biodiversity, while expanding its existing Pluto LNG processing plant near Karratha to more than double its current capacity. Opponents say the Scarborough-to-Pluto project could lock in new polluting infrastructure expected to run beyond 2050. Researchers at Climate Analytics estimate it could lead to 1.37bn tonnes of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere across its lifetime – roughly three times the total annual emissions of Australia or the UK. Woodside and the conservative Australian government claim the Scarborough development would be good for the country and the planet. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, told business leaders that when he heard Woodside had made a final decision to invest in Scarborough he celebrated with “a bit of a jig”. “I could not be more thrilled about that,” he said. This is broadly a bipartisan view. The Labor opposition, narrowly favoured to win a national election on 21 May, also supports gas industry expansion. The Western Australian Labor state government declared it would change the law to ensure Scarborough could proceed if a legal challenge by conservationists was successful. Australia has done little to cut greenhouse gas emissions since the government was elected in 2013. Its 2030 reduction target is less than half that set by the UK and EU, and it has committed about A$1bn in public funding to a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid crisis. Under pressure, Morrison set a net zero emissions goal shortly before the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in November – but his plan requires no emissions reductions and Australia was widely condemned by international leaders as a laggard in addressing the climate crisis. Opposition to the Scarborough project has come from environmental groups and a small but determined section of the local Indigenous community. They argue it is a “carbon bomb” that would be disastrous for the climate, that construction would destroy unique local marine life and acidic pollution from the production facility would damage the irreplaceable rock art. “Across the board, Scarborough is just a terrible project,” says Maggie Wood, the acting executive director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia. “But I would say the likelihood of it going ahead is high. The state and federal governments argue continual expansion of fossil fuels is a job creator, but we know that is fundamentally untrue – it doesn’t bring in much money from taxes and royalties, it doesn’t create that many jobs and the gas is mostly going to be exported. The reality is that fossil fuel companies have a hold over Australian politics.” Part of the problem, Wood and others argue, is that the cumulative impact of the Scarborough development had not been properly assessed before it was approved by national and state authorities. Instead it was broken up and submitted piecemeal for approval. The project is a continuation of the dramatic expansion of the Australian gas export industry across the continent’s north over the past decade. LNG exports have quadrupled in volume over that time to reach about 80m tonnes, with sales forecast to top US$50bn this year, twice that of the thermal coal industry. Australia now runs neck-and-neck with Qatar in the race to be the world’s biggest gas exporter. Scarborough is the most advanced of several proposals to expand that further. All are at odds with a warning last year from the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, that no new gas or oilfields should be opened if the slim prospect of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was to survive. The impact of gas expansion is clearly visible in Karratha. The city is saturated in fossil fuel money that helps pay for upmarket coffee shops and wine bars, large modern homes for gas and iron ore mining families and well-kept four-lane highways to production facilities. Many Indigenous families who have lived in the region for generations largely reside in older, comparatively rundown satellite towns such as Roebourne, a half-hour drive from Karratha’s air-conditioned shopping malls. Most residents in the region, including a significant proportion of the Indigenous community, strongly support continued expansion of the fossil fuel sector that keeps the area afloat. But the gas industry is also having an impact on the region’s cultural heritage. In some places, rocks have been disturbed to make way for infrastructure, and a recent peer-reviewed study found evidence that industrial pollution was “actively degrading” Murujuga rock art. Carmen Lawrence, a former Labor state premier and ex-chair of the Australian Heritage Council, said it was clear that gas processing was having a significant effect on petroglyphs and further expansion would only increase the duration and severity of the impact. She likened the management of the risk to the mistakes that two years ago resulted in the miner Rio Tinto’s catastrophic destruction of an Aboriginal heritage site in an explosion at nearby Juukan Gorge. Cooper, a former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, describes the rocks at Hearson’s Cove as “our church, our parliament house”. She says damage is already visible, and believes world heritage status for the region is the best hope for protection. “There is no price you can put on this place,” she says. “People see the rock as just a rock with some artwork on it but, to us, they speak. They tell a story. They are alive.” Woodside disputes suggestions its expansion on the Burrup poses a risk to the petroglyphs. A spokesperson said research had not demonstrated that its operations had any impact, and it was supporting a “world-best-practice programme to monitor and protect the rock art” that was co-managed by the local Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and government officials. “It is Woodside’s view that traditional custodians must be central to the management of their heritage,” the spokesperson said, adding the company had consulted with them and responded to requests for environmental monitoring, archaeological and ethnographic surveys and access to independent expert advice. In response to the claim the project would not create many jobs, the spokesperson said Scarborough would create 3,200 positions during construction and 300 ongoing jobs in Western Australia, including an expected 70 in Karratha. The company hopes Scarborough will be the start of a new wave of fossil fuel development in the country’s north-west. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Woodside’s chief executive, Meg O’Neill, said she hoped the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would allow it to kickstart consideration of two other gas mega-projects that had stalled during the pandemic – the Sunrise gas reservoir in the Timor Sea and the Browse development off Western Australia. The latter had been written off by many analysts and campaigners as commercially unviable and would be significantly more carbon-intensive than Scarborough. Woodside’s fossil fuel footprint is expected to expand even more dramatically next month if its shareholders rubber-stamp a deal in which it would merge its petroleum assets with those of the global miner BHP. It would allow BHP to shed a massive decommissioning liability for its oil assets and overnight make Woodside a global top 10 oil and gas company with investments in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Algeria and Australia. The company argues this is consistent with climate commitments that it says are aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement. It has a target of cutting its scope 1 and 2 emissions – those on site and from the electricity it uses – by 30% by 2030, and an “aspiration” to reach net zero emissions “by 2050 or sooner”. It says avoiding and reducing emissions is its “first priority” but the use of carbon offsets – cuts in emissions elsewhere to allow it to pollute – and the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is not yet used at any scale, will be important. It aims to help reduce its scope 3 emissions – those released by its customers when they eventually burn the gas – by investing in “new energy products” such as hydrogen, ammonia and CCS. It has set a US$5bn investment target in these plans by 2030, less than half the expected cost of the Scarborough development. Analysts argue that Woodside’s claims on emissions are full of holes. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics and a recent appointee to the UN secretary general’s expert group looking at the best way for non-state actors to reach net zero emissions, says Woodside “does not have a scientific leg to stand on” on emissions reduction. “I don’t really like the term greenwashing but there’s no other word for it. Woodside is engaged in extreme greenwashing,” he says. “It has no real net zero plan. It is all about using offsets to make it look like it is acting when it is not.” Hare says the annual emissions from Scarborough gas would be globally significant, with a conservative analysis suggesting they would be enough to, in effect, wipe out the emissions reduction from all the rooftop solar panels installed in Australia twice over. Roughly one in three Australian homes have solar systems. On the BHP deal, Hare says Woodside may come to regret the scale of the gargantuan rehabilitation costs the company will inherit for relatively short-term gain. “I really don’t see this is working out very well.” Woodside is unlikely to hear the same messages from the Australian political system. Its board includes former cabinet ministers from the Liberal and Labor parties, and it has successfully lobbied governments. For example, it was part of a campaign that persuaded the state government to shelve a proposal that would have required new large fossil fuel developments to offset all emissions. Scarborough still faces a legal challenge over whether the carbon dioxide emitted during production should be considered a pollutant, but even if successful it would probably lead only to a change in the conditions under which it could be developed. It leaves little reason for hope for the traditional custodians of Hearson’s Cove – but still they are here. As dusk wears on, Alec and Cooper are joined by Robyn Churnside, a Ngarluma elder who has been fighting fossil fuel and mining developments since the 1970s. She says her family is used to being minority voices of dissent and will persist. “It’s about time the world listened to First Nations people, because we’ve been here long, long time,” she says. “Our spirit in this land will never rest. It needs protection.”",News/Environment, ‘Our ancestors are in the rocks’: Australian gas project threatens ancient carvings – and emissions blowout,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/australia-gas-project-petroglyphs-woodside-climate-culture-carbon-bomb
5/12/2022,"My friend and colleague Richard H King, who has died aged 80 of a long-standing lung complaint, was an intellectual historian and emeritus professor in American studies at the University of Nottingham. Erudite across disciplines, he was generous and modest, always encouraging to younger colleagues. An outstanding scholar and teacher in his field, he was the author of The Party of Eros: Radical Social Thought and the Realm of Freedom (1972), A Southern Renaissance: the Cultural Awakening of the American South, 1930-1955 (1980), Civil Rights and the Idea of Freedom (1992), Race, Culture and the Intellectuals, 1940-1970 (2004), and Arendt and America (2015). The depth of Richard’s writing enriched the study of ideas in America. He was a cultured man with an interest in art and music. One colleague commented that he “was almost always the smartest guy in the room and the kindest”. Richard was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, but spent most of his childhood in Chattanooga, where his parents, Dorothy (nee Howell) and Dawson King, ran a landscape nursery. He retained his gentle southern accent throughout his life, but was no traditionalist and had no time for nostalgia for the Old South. Rather, it was a concern for racial understanding and justice that drove much of his work. He went to Brainerd junior high school in Chattanooga, then Chattanooga city high school, and studied history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from 1959 to 1963. After a Fulbright year in Germany at the University of Göttingen in 1963-64, he took an MA in American studies at Yale, then a PhD in history at the University of Virginia (1967-71). Putting his principles into practice, Richard taught at Federal City College, later the University of the District of Columbia, from 1968 to 1983, a college that specifically targeted Washington’s majority black population. But a turning point came with his 1977-78 Fulbright year at Nottingham and his permanent appointment there in 1983. He remained in the UK for the rest of his career – becoming reader then professor, in 1993, at Nottingham – with temporary returns to the US, as visiting professor of Southern studies at the University of Mississippi (1989-90), fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC (1997-98), and Vaughn fellow in the Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities at Vanderbilt University (2001-03). He retired from Nottingham in 2008. Though never a committee man by choice, Richard served as chair of the British Association for American Studies from 1992 to 1995, and was made one of the association’s first honorary fellows in 2009. Richard married Nancy Landreth in 1967. The marriage ended in divorce in 1978. He married Charlotte Fallenius in 1988, and they made an ideal partnership, their interests shared, their home open to all their friends. He is survived by Charlotte, her sons Christopher and Tim, grandchildren David and Anna, and his sister Lynn.",News/From the Guardian,Richard King obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/may/11/richard-king-obituary
5/12/2022,"The author of a government review into medical data sharing personally opted out of the aborted plan to share GP health data, a parliamentary committee has heard. Prof Ben Goldacre, a former Guardian columnist and the author of the Goldacre Review, exercised his right to opt out of the Government’s General Practice Data for Planning and Research scheme, he told the Commons Science and Technology committee, because he was concerned about the risks of deanonymisation. “I did withdraw my consent,” Goldacre said, “because I know so much about how this data is used, and how people can be deanonymised. And also because, in the past, I’ve been in the public eye from doing public engagement work, and I have friends who have had their data illegally accessed through national datasets, although not health datasets. And I suppose, because I work in this field, the risks are very salient to me.” The government should even consider prison sentences for those who do misuse sensitive data, Goldacre suggested, citing the discovery that more than 30 Metropolitan police staff were caught accessing case notes for the murder of Sarah Everard. He said: “That’s over 30 people, working in very trusted roles, illegally accessing data outside of the purposes of their work, even in an environment where most or all of them must have known that they were subject to audit. “You need to block people misusing data, you need to ensure that you detect it when they do, and you need to make sure that the penalties are so high that people are afraid to do it.” Goldacre criticised the idea that “data is the new oil”, arguing that it was more like nuclear material. “When you first access small bits of it, it’s not actually very useful. It needs to be refined and processed. But after it’s been refined and processed, two things happen. Firstly, it becomes tremendously powerful. “But secondly, it also becomes rather dangerous. Once it’s leaked, it can’t be unleaked, and you have to work very carefully with it in order to do good with it, whilst minimising harms.” Women are particularly at risk of deanonymisation, the committee heard as “childbirth is something that appears in your medical record, and it’s also something which is typically known by colleagues or people at the school gates or so on”. Goldacre said: “The classic example that appears in security engineering textbooks, for example, is that you could re-identify Tony Blair in health data, because you know, the approximate dates in which he had an abnormal heart rhythm reset while he was prime minister. And knowing the week in which that happens, the kind of procedure he had on two dates, and his approximate age and his approximate location, you could probably find only one person with those characteristics. Having found a unique identifier for that person, you can then see everything else in their record. “And women are particularly at risk, in my view.” He added: “As a result, future efforts to share NHS data with private industry should take place in ‘Trusted Research Environments’.” These would allow data to be made accessible to legitimate users without the risk of it leaking. “I’m confident that by doing that, not only can you mitigate risks, but you can also begin to earn public trust.”",News/Society,Author of review into aborted GP data sharing in England opted out of scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/author-of-review-into-aborted-gp-data-sharing-in-england-opted-out-of-scheme
