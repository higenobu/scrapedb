4/21/2022,"Former US president Donald Trump appeared to storm out of an interview with Piers Morgan after he was questioned about losing the 2020 election. A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”. During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”. The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.” The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.” He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020. Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago. The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”. The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise. Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions. Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia. Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.” It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Saturday. Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.",News/US news,Donald Trump appears to storm out of Piers Morgan TV interview in advert,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/donald-trump-appears-to-storm-out-of-piers-morgan-tv-interview-in-advert
4/21/2022,"Donald Trump’s campaign has been ordered to pay his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman more than $1.3m in legal fees, closing a case over her alleged violation of a non-disclosure agreement. Celebrating the ruling, Manigault Newman compared herself to David and the former president to Goliath. John M Phillips, an attorney for Manigault Newman, tweeted pictures of the ruling by a court arbitrator, Andrew Brown. The total due to be paid by the Trump campaign was $1,310,873.48. Phillips wrote: “$1.3m attorney fee and cost order against the Trump campaign issued! (Highest known prevailing party attorney fee assessment against a president or presidential campaign). Huge thanks to Omarosa for believing in us during this three-year ordeal of weaponised litigation.” Phillips also tweeted a picture with Manigault Newman, both smiling and pointing to copies of the ruling. $1.3 Million Attorney Fee and Cost Order Against the Trump Campaign Issued! (Highest known prevailing party attorney fee assessment against a President or Presidential Campaign). Huge thanks to @OMAROSA for believing in us during this three year ordeal of weaponized litigation. pic.twitter.com/iQ4j6Amfxa Manigault Newman rose to fame as a contestant on The Apprentice, Trump’s NBC reality TV series, before becoming his political aide and working in the White House. Fired from that role, in 2018 she published a tell-all memoir, Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House. The book contained explosive claims including that the then president was a “racist” who used the N-word repeatedly. In its review, the Guardian said that though the book was “light on policy”, it had “all the ingredients of a great novel; power, sex, race and money”. Manigault Newman also released audio recordings of Trump officials. Trump sued her for violating a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. He lost the case in September 2021. The New York Times said Phillips provided it a copy of the ruling in which the arbitrator, Brown, wrote that Manigault Newman “was defending herself in a claim which was extensively litigated for more than three years, against an opponent who undoubtedly commanded far greater resources”. Trump did not immediately comment. Manigault Newman tweeted: “First year law student vs [the 45th president’s] entire legal team. (David vs Goliath) … Now pardon me as I get back to studying for my contract law final exam.” Trump faces extensive legal woes elsewhere, including investigations of his business affairs and of his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat by Joe Biden. He has lost other cases over NDAs, including one involving a former campaign worker who said Trump forcibly kissed her. Also on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in 2016, filed a motion seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit in which Trump accuses her of a racketeering conspiracy in connection with that election. Calling the suit “a fundraising tool, a press release or a list of political grievances”, a lawyer for Clinton, David Kendall, said it should be “dismissed with prejudice”.",News/US news,Trump campaign ordered to pay Omarosa Manigault Newman over $1.3m,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/donald-trump-omarosa-manigault-newman-ruling-legal-fees
4/21/2022,"Boris Johnson has cast doubt on the prospects for a negotiated peace in Ukraine, comparing it to holding talks with a “crocodile”, as he flies to India to discuss the conflict with prime minister Narendra Modi. Speaking on a plane en route to India, where he will seek to deepen trade ties, as well as discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the prime minister suggested it would now be impossible for Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government to trust Russia in any talks. “I think it’s very hard to see how the Ukrainians can negotiate with [Russian president Vladimir] Putin now, given his manifest lack of good faith, and his strategy, which is evident, which is to try to engulf and capture as much of Ukraine as he can and then perhaps to have some kind of negotiation from a position of strength, or even to launch another assault on Kyiv,” he said. “I really don’t see how the Ukrainians can easily sit down and come to some kind of accommodation,” he added. “How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it’s got your leg in its jaws?” Instead, Johnson said Nato would “keep going with the strategy” of supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself. He suggested president Zelenskiy had what he called a “pretty maximalist position” of wanting to see Russian troops expelled from their current positions in Donetsk and Luhansk, adding, “on Crimea they’re not so maximalist”. Johnson played down the prospects that he could persuade Modi to toughen India’s stance on Ukraine – though he said he would press the importance of ditching what he called “Putin’s hydrocarbons”. India, which buys military equipment from Russia, abstained on a UN motion condemning Putin’s actions in Ukraine in early March. “I’ve already talked to Narendra Modi about Ukraine and actually the Indians have condemned what happened in Bucha, they have been quite forceful in what they have said,” the prime minister said. “But the UK in particular has to recognise that there is a historic relationship that India has with Russia, I think we have to be alive to that.” As he embarked on a trip that will take in Gujarat and New Delhi, Downing Street announced £1bn of bilateral investments, claiming these would create up to 11,000 jobs in the UK. However, the investment includes a string of small-scale projects, the smallest of which, from Qure AI Technologies, will create just 15 jobs. The largest, from electric bus firm Switch Mobility, will create 4,000 jobs “across the UK and India”. Number 10 also highlighted an agreement that will allow OneWeb, the taxpayer-backed space company, to launch its satellites from India. He said: “As I arrive in India today, I see vast possibilities for what our two great nations can achieve together. From next-generation 5G telecoms and AI to new partnerships in health research and renewable energy – the UK and India are leading the world.” The government laid out plans for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” in the UK’s foreign policy in its strategic defence review last year; but the approach has been questioned since Russia launched its devastating invasion in Europe. But Johnson insisted: “I’m completely clear about this: it’s a good thing for us to be doing. India is our great partner,.” Speaking before the trip, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “We see our role in India as not to seek to lecture and point fingers from the sidelines, but to engage with them constructively as we have done in recent years – to talk to them about potential possible alternatives, on things like energy, on things like security and defence, so we can broaden the coalition of partners who are moving away from any remaining dependence on Russia.” Amid the continuing Partygate scandal, Number 10 is keen to demonstrate that the prime minister is focused on bread and butter issues, including advancing the UK’s economic and security interests abroad. He will visit business and cultural sites during the two-day tour, as well as holding bilateral talks with Modi. The two nations are aiming to agree a free trade agreement by the end of 2022, with two rounds of talks already having taken place and another happening next week. In the past, hopes of a trade deal have foundered on India’s desire for a more liberal visa regime to allow its citizens to enter the UK. Johnson’s spokesperson said immigration is not included in trade negotiations as standard – but did not rule out the UK reaching some agreement on the issue. “Negotiators may explore business mobility provisions as part of ongoing talks, but any agreement would need to be consistent with the points-based immigration system and would be obviously subject to approval by cabinet,” he said. Theresa May’s visit to India in 2016 was widely regarded as a diplomatic flop, after she snubbed calls for more immigration from India to the UK. Johnson is under pressure to secure post-Brexit free trade agreements, after hopes of a swift deal with the US evaporated, with Joe Biden’s focus elsewhere. OneWeb, which was rescued by the UK taxpayer with the enthusiastic backing of Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings, had turned to Elon Musk’s SpaceX for help, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ruled out its previous launch site in Kazakhstan. The UK government took a £400m stake in OneWeb in July 2020, investing to save the business from bankruptcy.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson casts doubt on possibility of negotiated peace in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/boris-johnson-casts-doubt-on-possibility-of-negotiated-peace-in-ukraine
4/21/2022,"Wisden has suggested that the senior executives of the England and Wales Cricket Board who are due to share a £2.1m bonus pot should return or refuse to accept the money after an “annus horribilis” for English cricket. Cricket’s annually published reference book says in its latest edition that the “ethics of the bonus scandal were as bad as the optics” amid job losses and a variety of sporting and administrative failures. Elsewhere the English domestic game is labelled “tone-deaf” on racism, the nation’s attempt to win the Ashes is described as “hapless”, the players involved were “knackered”, and public optimism about the team’s prospects was “completely delusional”. But the 159th edition of the Almanack, published on Thursday, will not be miserable reading for everyone involved in English cricket. There is some praise for the inaugural Hundred, said to have “changed the face of women’s cricket in England”, while despite the failures of the men’s Test team one of their players is named the leading cricketer in the world for the third successive year, with Joe Root following Ben Stokes, who received the accolade in both 2020 and 2021. The Almanack’s 1,536 pages will be difficult reading for many at the ECB and beyond. “Can there ever have been a bigger gap between what English cricket hoped to be and what it was – between reality and fantasy?” Lawrence Booth, the Wisden editor, writes. “Early in 2022, a long-planned assault on the Ashes ended with all-out surrender. Before that, a racism scandal brought to light by the courage of Azeem Rafiq made the game look unwelcoming, and worse. There was little to cherish.” The most savage criticism, however, is reserved for Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief, and the other executives whose £2.1m bonus pot was exclusively revealed by the Guardian last year. “As the annus horribilis took shape, this felt more and more wrong,” Booth writes. “Harrison, remember, had presided over 62 job losses; he had used procedural excuses to defend his failure to intervene [in the racism scandal] at Yorkshire; and, the Ashes up in smoke, he had blamed the domestic structure on the (usefully anonymous) Professional Game Group, and the international calendar on administrators in faraway lands. Of his own shortcomings, he had less to say. “The ethics of the bonus scandal were as bad as the optics. But there was an exit strategy, if only Harrison would recognise it: the bonus should either be returned, allowing the ECB to re-employ some of the staff whose work still had to be done, or used to broaden the game’s diversity. If, by now, he has resigned or refused the money, we applaud. If not, there is still time to undo at least part of the damage.” Ollie Robinson, the English bowler who only nine Tests and 10 months into his international career is named among Wisden’s five cricketers of the year, is also mentioned in the editorial on the racism crisis after his Test debut last June was marked by a tearful apology for historical tweets. “For the ECB, scrambling to be on the right side of history, the timing was horrific,” Booth writes. “As Yorkshire’s mishandling of the Rafiq affair went from bad to abysmal, the scale of the crisis became clear not through solecisms from the past, but clumsy attempts to navigate the present. “Middlesex chairman Mike O’Farrell told the DCMS committee in January that diversification of the dressing-room had been hampered by an Anglo-Caribbean love of football, and Anglo-Asian preference for education. The effect of all these comments was insidious, and the message to those on the game’s margins unambiguous: cricket’s mainstream remained tone-deaf. And if they weren’t paying attention on a subject as important as this, what else had they missed?” Devon Conway, the New Zealand batter who made his Test debut alongside Robinson at Lord’s last June and scored a double century in his first innings, is named among the five cricketers of the year, alongside India’s Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma and Dane van Niekerk, the South African who led the Oval Invincibles to victory in the first women’s Hundred. Van Niekerk’s compatriot Lizelle Lee, who scored 632 runs at an average of 90 across 11 one-day internationals in 2021, is named the leading female cricketer in the world.",Sport/Sport,Wisden calls on ECB to return £2.1m bonus pot after ‘annus horribilis’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/wisden-calls-on-ecb-to-return-21m-bonus-pot-after-annus-horribilis
4/21/2022,"Manchester City are leaders again, wresting the top berth back from Liverpool, who enjoyed 24 hours at the top before Pep Guardiola’s men showed the relentlessness required in what is now a six-match shoot-out for the title. City diced with entering squeaky posterior time by not scoring until the 53rd minute. Then, Riyad Mahrez bundled home and the champions could relax. Before nerves had begun to jangle, supporters counting each failed attack against a clock that was ticking ever closer to two dropped points, at least. Not now. And if City beat Watford here on Saturday Liverpool will have to stew overnight on a four-point deficit before their Merseyside derby with Everton at Anfield. A Mahrez shot featured as City settled quickly into their percussive pass-and-move rhythms. Solly March felled a flying João Cancelo and Kevin De Bruyne floated the free-kick on to Nathan Aké’s head at the far post but Brighton escaped. After being an unused substitute in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final loss to Liverpool, the big plus for City was De Bruyne’s inclusion against visitors who arrived in fine form after consecutive wins over Arsenal and Spurs. Graham Potter could be proud of these results: they took his side 15 points clear of the drop zone and made his team all but mathematically safe. He was less enamoured with how Marc Cucurella hoofed the ball straight out at one point, but the manager still offered encouragement to the left of his three centre-backs. He would feel only chagrin, however, when a Robert Sánchez chip went across the No 1’s goal straight to a lurking Mahrez as City pressed in numbers. The Algerian drew his foot back to shoot but a Moisés Caicedo slide tackle expertly took the ball and not the man in a situation in which it would have been easy to give away a penalty. City were warming up: Sánchez next flung himself high to punch away a curving De Bruyne parabolas laced with menace. Brighton, as so many do, hoped to hit City on the break. And they did when Solly March killed a high delivery, tussled with Cancelo and found Pascal Gross in an inside left channel. When the latter crossed, City were in disarray for a moment. But John Stones recovered and his team engineered its own counter, one that, though it foundered when De Bruyne tapped to Mahrez in the area, was a warning to Brighton of how lethal City are from any position. This was emphasised when Bernardo Silva this time received from the peerless De Bruyne and the Portuguese’s clever lob was tipped away by Sánchez. City were cruising along in third gear but had no opener to show for their ascendancy on entering the first half’s closing phase. Balls punted into Brighton’s area by Silva and Cancelo were overhit and Guardiola might have started to think about an interval chat focusing on the need for ruthlessness. De Bruyne had run the match thus far and a simple stab of the ball from him into Brighton’s area allowed Ilkay Gündogan to hit the ball goalwards, Lewis Dunk’s block saving his team. This was as close as City got and so as the second half began Liverpool remained leaders. The longer Brighton’s resistance continued the more City might tense up. The crowd sensed the same, which wouldn’t help. Three corners came and went, one of them volleyed wide by Rodri and another returned to De Bruyne who booted the ball straight out. But suddenly, a surge of relief. De Bruyne – who else? – made a swashbuckling run that drove those in yellow back. The ball came to Mahrez, he finished with the help of a deflection, and City celebrated. Guardiola had replaced Aké with forRúben Dias at half-time: an intriguing move considering the Portuguese’s seven-week layoff and the high stakes of the game. The manager was now in arm-waving mode, semaphoring Silva and Foden to pull wide and hectoring Aymeric Laporte. Soon he could give his customary post-goal lecture. It was directed to Mahrez after Foden’s speculative hit bounced off Enock Mwepu and past Sánchez. Who knows what Guardiola told the Algerian but the bottom line was his men could now relax. From here this was an exercise in control for City, and it came with a sweet third. The De Bruyne flick that created Silva’s third was sublime, the finish emphatic. The home team had refused to blink. Which of City and Liverpool do first will be defining.",Sport/Football,Mahrez breaks tension as Manchester City beat Brighton and return to summit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/manchester-city-brighton-premier-league-match-report
