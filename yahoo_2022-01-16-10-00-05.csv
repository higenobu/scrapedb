1/16/2022,"Virginia’s newly sworn-in Attorney General Jason Miyares announced investigations into the Virginia Parole Board and Loudoun County Public Schools within hours of taking office. In a statement released on Saturday just hours after Miyares and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin were sworn in, Miyares explained why he has launched an investigation into the commonwealth’s parole board as well as Loudoun County Public Schools. VIRGINIA GOV. YOUNGKIN'S DAY-ONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS INCLUDE INVESTIGATING LOUDON COUNTY OFFICIALS, CRT BAN ""One of the reasons Virginians get so fed up with government is the lack of transparency - and that’s a big issue here,"" Miyares wrote. ""The Virginia Parole Board broke the law when they let out murders, rapists, and cop killers early on their sentences without notifying the victims. Loudoun Country Public Schools covered up a sexual assault on school grounds for political gain, leading to an additional assault of a young girl."" Loudoun County became a focal point in Youngkin’s gubernatorial race against former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe following the arrest of a 14-year-old male high school student, who identifies as nonbinary, who has been found guilty of raping a female student in a school bathroom. That student was transferred to another school where he allegedly raped another student and the district has been accused of covering up the crime which resulted in one of the alleged victim's parents being arrested at a school board meeting. The offending student has been placed on the sex offenders registry for life as part of his sentence. REPUBLICAN GLENN YOUNGKIN SWORN IN AS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA In addition to the investigations, Miyares notified about 30 staff members that they will no longer be employed by the office of the attorney general. Virginia State Senator Louise Lucas tweeted that Miyares fired the ""entire"" civil rights division, which Miyares's office tells Fox News is not accurate. ""This is incorrect information,"" Miyares spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita said. ""There are 12 individuals who work in the Office of Civil Rights - only two personnel changes were made."" ""During the campaign, it was made clear that now Attorney General-elect Miyares and Attorney General Herring have very different visions for the office,"" LaCivita told Richmond.com. ""We are restructuring the office, as every incoming AG has done in the past.""",U.S./Fox News,Virginia's new AG Jason Miyares announces major investigations within hours of taking office,https://news.yahoo.com/virginia-apos-ag-jason-miyares-221131262.html
1/16/2022,"Cracker Barrel was ordered to pay $9.4 million to a man who was accidentally served toxic chemicals. The settlement was reached years after the man first alleged that he had suffered severe injuries. But due to Tennessee laws, he will likely not receive the full amount, per a local news outlet. Cracker Barrel was ordered to pay $9.4 million to a Tennessee man who sued the restaurant chain after he was served a chemical cleaning agent instead of water. Despite the settlement, the claimant, William Cronnon, may not receive the total amount due to laws related to damages in the state. The legal case had been ongoing for many years after the incident, which occurred in April 2014 at a branch in Marion County. A settlement was finally reached this month, according to Bailey and Greer, the law firm that represented Cronnon. He had been eating lunch at the Cracker Barrel branch when a waitress refilled his glass with what she thought was water. After taking a sip, he felt a ""burning sensation in his mouth and esophagus,"" the lawsuit stated. It was later discovered that the contents Cronnon were served were in fact a mixture of water and Eco-San, a chemical solution Cracker Barrel uses to clean its kitchen area. Cronnon suffered ""severe permanent injuries,"" including ""regular cramping, bloating diarrhea, and reflux pain after meals,"" his lawyer stated in a press release. He also ""lost wages and future earning capacity,"" according to the lawsuit. In response to the verdict, Cracker Barrel said in a statement to Insider: ""While we have great respect for the legal process, we are obviously disappointed by and strongly disagree with the jury's award in this case, which involved an unfortunate and isolated incident that occurred at one of our stores eight years ago."" It added: ""Although we are considering our options with respect to this verdict, we are glad this matter is behind us so we can better focus on caring for our guests and employees around the country."" Cronnon's lawyer, Thomas Greer, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. On January 6, Cronnon reached an agreement with the restaurant for the $9.4 million settlement. According to local news station WTVC News Channel 9, however, it is likely he will not receive the full amount due to a statutory cap that Tennessee asserts on noneconomic damages. Under Tennessee law, only up to $750,000 in noneconomic damages can be recovered. ""This is an unfair law,"" Attorney Thomas Greer told the station. ""He will not receive anything close to what he is entitled to."" Cronnon could not be reached by Insider for comment. Other retailers, including Walmart and a Florida-based nail salon, have also recently been ordered to make large payouts to injured customers. In December, the grocery giant was ordered to pay $10 million to a woman who said she stepped on a rusty nail while shopping and lost part of her leg. In the same month, Tammy's Nails 2 in Tampa paid $1.75 million to a woman whose leg was amputated after a pedicure led to a severe infection.
