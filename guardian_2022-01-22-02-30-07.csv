1/22/2022,"It may be a little early to be thinking about spring, but the publication of the first-class cricket fixtures hints that it is not too far away. They have been more eagerly awaited than usual this year because the implosion of the England men’s team in the Ashes suggested there was something rotten in the state of the domestic game. Publication was delayed while different interest groups argued over what structure the sport should have. Do we like our cricket in two-and-a-half-hour, made-for-TV dollops, or played out slowly over four or five days? Naturally, that question was not resolved. The result, when the fixtures were finally announced this week, was the usual dog’s dinner. In deference to the new orthodoxy that long-form cricket has been marginalised, two four-day championship matches have shifted to June and July, but half the games will be played in April and May when conditions tend to favour the sort of county “trundler” who is unlikely to turn an Ashes match on its head on an easy-paced pitch in Melbourne. Neil Snowball, of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), said further rebalancing was possible in 2023 if all “stakeholders” could agree. No jokes please about the chances of Mr Snowball making that happen.  The ECB is trying to shoehorn four men’s competitions into a packed summer: the championship; a 50-over cup; the 20-over Blast; and its new invention, the Hundred, designed for fans who find 20-over cricket unduly labyrinthine. The Hundred will occupy most of August and means no championship cricket will be played in what used to be considered high summer. It is also played by franchises, with unlovely names such as Northern Superchargers and Trent Rockets, rather than the traditional counties, and the conundrum few seem willing to address is that counties and franchises just can’t coexist in the long term. In the wake of the Ashes debacle, BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew argued that franchises should call the shots, but imagined the counties carrying on in some lesser form, without saying who would finance this lower-grade cricket or bother to watch. Even the would-be revolutionaries balk at killing off the counties. Will the men’s game in the end have to follow the women’s, now essentially franchise-based and committed to short-form cricket? While the Hundred has been largely destructive for men’s cricket, forcing eyes to be taken off the red ball, it has been beneficial for the women’s game, giving it previously undreamt of amounts of TV time. Let’s hope the women prove more competitive than the men in the current Ashes series. The ECB has to stop pretending that the championship and the Hundred, counties and franchises, traditional and modern can be reconciled. The brutal truth is that one of the models has to go for the men’s game to have any coherence. A new cricketing structure is struggling to be born, and Gramsci (admittedly not a noted cricket fan) was right that, in the gap between the death of the old and the birth of the new, “morbid symptoms” appear. You couldn’t, after all, get any more morbid than that England collapse on the third evening of the Hobart Test.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on cricket’s dilemma: the long and short of it | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-crickets-dilemma-the-long-and-short-of-it
1/22/2022,"Conservative ministers and whips began spreading rumours about Christian Wakeford’s personal life minutes after the MP defecting to Labour, it has been alleged amid growing concerns over dirty tactics in politics. The Guardian has been told that the rumours were spread in parliament by senior members of the government after the MP for Bury South crossed the floor on Wednesday.  It comes after the senior Tory MP William Wragg urged MPs to report government ministers, whips and advisers to the Speaker – and even the Metropolitan police – for what he claimed was attempted blackmail of some colleagues suspected of opposing Boris Johnson. Johnson said he had “seen no evidence” of such threats. A Labour source said Wakeford had been prepared by the party before his defection about the possibility of the Tories or hostile media trying to dig around in his private life. Asked about the allegation that there was an attempt to smear Wakeford, a government source said: “It would be unacceptable. The chief whip [Mark Spencer] wouldn’t condone that behaviour at all. It’s not a practice that would be employed at all. It’s true there was shock and disappointment at a defection but that doesn’t ever cross into smearing other people.” Since defecting, Wakeford has also alleged that party whips told him he would lose funding for a new high school in his constituency if he did not vote with the government. There were also reports on Thursday that rebel Tory MPs were considering releasing details of text messages and a recording of their dealings with the party’s whips. Following the spotlight on the tactics of the whips, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said allegations of blackmail by government whips against Tory rebels need to be investigated – but are unlikely to be true. Speaking to Sky News, Kwarteng said: “Any form of blackmail and intimidation of that kind simply has no place in British politics.” He added: “We need to get to the bottom of the matter. I’d find it very unlikely that these allegations are true.” But one Tory MP said: “Blackmail is not just about money for constituencies, it’s tittle tattle, personal things, affairs or who’s been to a lockdown party. At the far end it’s corruption and misconduct in a public office – on the other it’s a breach of the ministerial code. Either way it’s a resignation issue. “The culture comes from the top – it’s learned, bullying behaviour. Unless you stand up to bullies, they carry on.” Another MP from the 2019 intake also stepped forward anonymously to say they felt they had been threatened and bullied when they rebelled in a vote last spring. They said that threats about ministerial careers were perfectly normal but that they were told “it would be a shame” if their constituency didn’t get the towns’ funding it had asked for. “I complained to another MP, they said that’s outrageous – the whips have no such powers, it’s just one of their tactics.” The MP said they “don’t think we can blame Boris” and that it was not widely known about, but a tactic employed by some individual whips, adding: “They’re empty threats, but it is unacceptable – it’s a form of bullying.”",News/Politics,Tory whips allegedly tried to smear Christian Wakeford after defection,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/tory-whips-allegedly-tried-to-smear-christian-wakeford-after-defection
1/22/2022,"“Not too many,” Paul Townend said with a broad smile here on Friday when asked if he had spotted any weaknesses in Shishkin ahead of his long-awaited first meeting with Energumene in Saturday’s Clarence House Chase at Ascot. “I just see all the 1s alongside his name, so I’ll do a bit of homework tonight, ride the race another 20 times and hopefully we’re still finishing in front.” Nico de Boinville, Shishkin’s rider, had earlier used words like “fantastic” and “electric” to describe Energumene. If the race was a title fight in Vegas – and there are certainly some similarities – the promoter would be tearing his hair out at the lack of trash talk to shift the last few tickets.  Not, of course, that there is any need for that here, as Saturday’s race is the most compelling head-to-head over jumps since Altior squared off against Cyrname, also at Ascot, in November 2019. Four runners are due to go to post for the Grade One contest, including First Flow, who won it 12 months ago, but for practical purposes, it is a match race between two potential superstars of the sport and perhaps the start of one of the great rivalries too. Some match races have a champion-and-contender dynamic, as a battle-hardened veteran tries to keep the ageing process at bay. Victory for the younger runner tends to hasten the runner-up towards retirement. But not this one: Shiskin and Energumene were foaled just over two months apart, in April and June 2014 respectively, and arrive at Ascot with near-identical profiles. Neither horse has tasted defeat over fences, both are in their second season as chasers and both are proven winners at Grade One level. All being well, this will be the first meeting of several, starting with a rematch at Cheltenham in March. “We were not probably expecting to have this dust-up quite so early in the year, but so be it, there we go,” Nicky Henderson, Shishkin’s trainer, said on Friday. “If there is anything less than five lengths in it, you are going to take each other on again at Cheltenham, as there is nothing else to do.” On the face of it, Saturday’s race is also another chapter in the Britain-versus-Ireland narrative over jumps, following Irish racing’s unprecedented shellacking of their British counterparts at Cheltenham last March. In the late absence of Energumene, Shishkin was one of just five British-trained winners in 28 races at the 2021 Festival, and he is currently one of just two British-trained favourites for a non-handicap at this year’s meeting. But it is more nuanced than that, as Shishkin is owned by Joe Donnelly, an Irish ex-bookie turned property speculator based in Paris, while Energumene runs in the colours of Tony Bloom, who also owns his home-town football team, Brighton & Hove Albion. And he could, perhaps should, have been in the other camp, as Energumene won his sole point-to-point at Larkhill in Wiltshire, before being sold to race from Willie Mullins’s stable in County Carlow. “This is as exciting a race as there has been for a long time and like everyone, we can’t wait to find out,” Patrick Mullins, the trainer’s son and assistant, said on Friday. “Shishkin deserves to be favourite, he’s achieved more, he’s won a Supreme Novice and an Arkle. Our fella has to go and beat him, he has to step up, but he’s very unexposed and I don’t think anyone can have excuses. It should be lovely ground, it’s a very fair track and they’ve both had a run. May the best horse win.” Energumene’s odds for his showdown with Shishkin in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot have tightened a little since the start of the week, but 13-8 is still a big price for Willie Mullins’s runner since all the available evidence suggests there will be very little to choose between the market leaders on Saturday. Energumene (3.35) is rated just 1lb behind Shishkin by Timeform and his Grade One-winning form in Ireland last season is a match for Shishkin’s performances at Cheltenham and Aintree, both in terms of his dominance and on the clock. Few contests have been so eagerly anticipated in recent years and either horse could produce a career-best performance and still finish second. At the current odds, however, there is only one to back. Haydock 1.25 Probably a race to swerve for betting purposes as Jonbon will be long odds-on to defy a penalty and extend his unbeaten sequence under Rules to four races. He has scarcely come off the bridle to date but this is the best field Jonbon has faced by some way and Might I for one could certainly force the favourite to dig a little deeper. Ascot 1.45 Several lightly raced and progressive handicappers in opposition here with Stellar Magic making most appeal at around 5-1 on just the fifth start of his career. He looked well ahead of his mark on his handicap debut at Haydock in December, when he finished within two lengths of the winner in a race run in a strong time. Haydock 2.00 Tommy’s Oscar has been the standard-bearer for Ann and Ian Hamilton’s remarkable six-horse stable this season and will be a popular choice to continue his rapid progress through the handicapping ranks as he steps into Grade Two company for the first time. Ascot 2.20 The tough and versatile Western Victory is the interesting one here on her debut for Emma Lavelle. The nine-year-old has several bits of form which puts her alongside or in front of Molly Ollys Wishes and My Sister Sarah, her main market rivals, and she may well get quite an easy time of it on the lead. Haydock 2.35 Royale Pagaille took this race apart 12 months ago and has his ideal conditions again but he has another half-stone on his back and looks short enough in the market at around 5-2. Kalooki, by contrast, can be backed at around 12-1 to follow up a career-best at Doncaster last month from a 5lb higher mark. He could easily find that and more in first-time cheekpieces and over a longer trip that promises to suit.

1/22/2022,"Ralf Rangnick: should he stay in the Manchester United hot seat next season or should he go? This is the question the club will grapple with if the interim manager secures a top-four finish, claims (or just misses out on) FA Cup glory and shows well in the Champions League; basically, if he performs as an impressive mid-season Mr Fixit who deserves a chance to have a No 1’s contract drawn up. The German is open to the full-time job, so might United’s incoming CEO, Richard Arnold, be minded to keep him by mid-May? After the best part of two months and nine matches a picture is forming of Rangnick and his managerial smarts. Wednesday, at Brentford, was particularly instructive because, with United 2-0 up, the 63-year-old made Cristiano Ronaldo his fall guy and a 3-1 victory was the reward. It took the team to 35 points and maintained their status as back-runners hoping to overtake on the curve in the chase for a Champions League berth.  So, rewind to the moment in west London when Rangnick assesses United’s 2-0 lead, Mason Greenwood’s strike having been initiated by Ronaldo’s clever chest-down pass, and decides the 36-year-old should be sacrificed for a back three to shut the shop in the way he failed to do at Aston Villa, when United slipped from 2-0 up to a careless 2-2 draw. Ronaldo, as is his modus operandi, is not happy at being hooked on 71 minutes and, as a man on £490,000 a week who is a five-times Ballon d’Or winner with 801 career goals, demands a reason. “Why me?” he asks. Moments after Marcus Rashford – brought on for Greenwood (who does not demand an explanation) – scores the third, Rangnick, in the heat of battle when he should be focusing on the field, decides to explain. Later he tells the media what he told Ronaldo: that “it was for the good of the team”. From here, zoom out to view the wider picture. The vignette at Brentford is a subplot, a two-man scene in the wider narrative of Rangnick, his style and what might become of him at the season end. For the moment, Rangnick is slated to move into a two-year, quasi-director of football role, as a “consultant”, to use United’s terminology. The thinking was that hiring Rangnick would allow United, led by Arnold, time to pursue the glitzier Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, who has been to a Champions League final with Tottenham. Or maybe Erik ten Hag, of the Dutch champions, Ajax. Or Brendan Rodgers, who took Liverpool close to the 2013-14 title, made Leicester Cup holders and whose team allowed two 90-plus-minute Spurs strikes to lose 3-2 the same evening United beat Brentford. But how about the “godfather of pressing” as a candidate to be United’s fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired? The man whose handling of Ronaldo suggests a spine for the job, as does a penchant for dropping casual media-conference bombs, such as the claim Anthony Martial refused to travel to Villa (the player denies this), or that the £73m signing Jadon Sancho is struggling “psychologically” to deal with playing for the world’s biggest club™. Or that Paul Pogba may be motivated to perform solely to attract suitors as his contract winds down. On the field, too, there are signs Rangnick is patching up the mess he walked into. His league record stands at five victories, three draws and one defeat; United are alive in two cups – the Champions League last-16 clash with Atlético Madrid starts next month, and Middlesbrough are fourth-round Cup visitors next Friday; and, before that, the tilt at Champions League qualification continues at Old Trafford on Saturday against West Ham. Moyes’s fourth-placed side are the first of 17 Premier League opponents United need to take enough points from to force Rangnick’s paymasters to consider ending the search beyond the club for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s full-time successor. If the Hammers are beaten, Rangnick’s side leapfrog them and go six points behind Thomas Tuchel’s flatlining Chelsea with a game in hand. It is not so simple, of course. Beyond having to win these matches – will the consistently inconsistent United ever be consistent? – there are Tottenham and Arsenal, too. They are ahead of United having played fewer games. These ifs, buts and maybes make the situation enticing. If Manchester City appear a shoo-in to retain the title, at least two Champions League places are in up-for-grabs-now territory. United, under Rangnick, may be stirring when required, with previously underwhelming footballers now awakening. Greenwood’s sustained-performance graph is still to surge up – as a lethal wide-man can he be United’s Mo Salah? – and the lesser-gifted Rashford has been lukewarm, but at Brentford each scored, as did Bruno Fernandes (twice) at Villa. Their form and that of other disappointments, who include Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Sancho and Pogba, will be vital for determining where United’s campaign ends and whether next season’s Rangnick is to be United’s upstairs or still-downstairs man.",Sport/Football,Rangnick shows signs of shaping longer-term Manchester United future,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/ralf-rangnick-signs-shaping-longer-term-manchester-united-future
1/22/2022,"Five of Britain’s leading business groups have demanded urgent and decisive government help to tackle the UK’s energy crisis, warning failure to act will result in lower investment, an increase in poverty and the risk of an inflationary spiral. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, the heads of the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors, Make UK and the Federation of Small Businesses said “rocketing” domestic and business bills would put the brake on economic recovery.  “As a collection of business groups, we are writing to ask you to act urgently and decisively to support consumers with spiralling bills and help business manage inflated costs over the medium term,” the letter said. Sunak and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, have been working on possible measures to soften the impact of an expected increase in energy bills of nearly 50% – amounting to £600 a year for the average household – when the price cap is lifted in April. Ofgem, the energy regulator, will announce the new price cap early next month, and Kwarteng said Sunak would use his spring statement on 23 March to outline a support package. In a reflection of the growing concern felt by companies of all sizes, the five business groups stressed the likely damage to household budgets if the government failed to act. They noted a rise in the average household energy bill to £2,000 a year would alone add 1-2 percentage points to the annual inflation rate – already at a 30-year-high of 5.4% – and force a further 2 million people into fuel poverty. “It will hurt low-income households most acutely, but these cost increases will have knock on impacts throughout the economy,” the letter said. “We therefore urge [the] government to take action to mitigate rising domestic bills and support the most vulnerable.” The letter said businesses had also been affected by steep rises in their energy bills, with further increases looming as fixed tariff contracts came to an end. “The scale of the crisis has left companies with little protection while they face dealing with soaring wage, shipping and tax costs. Small and medium-sized businesses are the most at risk. Many companies will be left with little other choice than to pass costs on to their customers, adding further inflationary pressure,” the groups said. Along with other countries, Britain has been affected by an increase in the global wholesale price of gas, in part triggered by higher demand as countries have emerged from the pandemic. The business groups said, however, the UK was facing a medium-term crisis rather than a short-term seasonal one. “To strengthen the UK energy system for the future, businesses support a regulatory approach that builds resilience in the domestic supplier base, drives competitiveness of UK industry and incentivises investment in the green economy,” they said. “Reducing energy demand with an ambitious programme for residential and business energy efficiency must be a core part of this strategy.” A government spokesperson said: “We understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living and are providing support worth around £12bn over two years to help families. “Support is being targeted towards the lowest paid, and we are specifically helping households with their energy bills. In addition, the energy price cap is currently insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices and we’ll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy.”",News/Business,Energy bills crisis: UK business leaders demand urgent action,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/uk-energy-bills-crisis-cbi-bcc-iod-make-uk-fsb-covid
1/22/2022,"Reporting by the Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr on the “covert relationship” between the multimillionaire Brexit backer Arron Banks and the Russian government was of the greatest public interest imaginable, her lawyer has told the high court. Banks, who donated a record £8m to the Leave.EU campaign group, is suing Cadwalladr for defamation over two instances – one in a Ted Talk and one in a related tweet – in which she said the businessman was lying about his relationship with the Russian state.  In closing written submissions on Friday, Gavin Millar QC, for Cadwalladr, told the high court in London that Banks and his close associate Andy Wigmore, director of communications for Leave.EU, had given “contradictory and misleading accounts about his [Banks’s] meetings with Russian officials and the extent of his relationship with the Russian state” as well as who had initiated the contact with the Russian government and the reason for it. Millar said Cadwalladr’s reporting about weaknesses in rules governing campaign expenditure, and the lack of accountability in respect of social media targeting and advertising, raised issues that “threaten the integrity of our democratic processes”. He added: “The Ted Talk was unquestionably speech which addressed matters of the greatest possible importance to the organisation of the political life of the country. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of matters in which the public interest in their being published and the subject of debate would be greater.” He said the action was based on “what amounts to one sentence in a talk”. At a preliminary hearing, the meaning of Cadwalladr’s words, which are the subject of the lawsuit, was determined by a judge to be that Banks lied about a secret relationship with the Russian government “in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding”. Cadwalladr has said she did not intend to imply that Banks had received Russian money, nor lied about receiving Russian money, only about the extent of his contacts with Russia. Millar said: “The fact that the court determined a different meaning which the words complained of may bear for the hypothetical ordinary reasonable reader/viewer does not render the defendant’s belief unreasonable.” As well as relying on a public interest defence, Millar argued that Banks could not show “serious harm” as required by law because he had “a generally bad reputation in respect of the sector of his life with which this claim is concerned, namely his role as a funder/leader of Leave.EU”. In his written submissions, William McCormick QC, for Banks, told the court that the threshold of serious harm had been met in terms of damage to his client’s reputation, stressing that the Ted Talk had been viewed by a “new audience who were not likely (or less likely) to have heard about the allegations against C (the claimant)”. McCormick accused Cadwalladr of having “failed to exercise proper journalistic standards”. He said for her to suggest she had never intended to suggest Banks had received Russian money to fund the Brexit campaign was “unreal” and described references to a covert relationship as “ridiculous”. McCormick said: “What this action complains of is not D’s (the defendant’s) investigative work, but the fact that what she said in 2019 (and continues to say in 2022) makes a seriously defamatory allegation for which her investigation provides no proper basis.” He told the court that although Cadwalladr had accepted the court’s interpretation of the meaning of the words in the Ted Talk, she had failed to take steps to have the offending words removed or the video footnoted. “In this situation, there’s nothing else my client can do but seek the court’s assistance to have the situation remedied,” he said.

1/22/2022,"A second residential skyscraper is going back to the drawing board after the Guardian exposed safety fears over plans to provide only one fire escape staircase. Plans for a 35-storey block with a single staircase, 400 metres from Grenfell Tower in west London, are being rethought after the design was called “madness” by a fire safety expert and attacked as “shocking” by Grenfell United, which represents the survivors and bereaved of the 14 June 2017 fire that killed 72 people.  Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW), the £46bn global shopping centre specialist behind the plan to build the tower next to its Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd’s Bush, said on Friday the “designs will be adapted where needed to reflect feedback and any requirements which may have changed since the original application was submitted”. URW’s move comes after the London fire brigade (LFB) told planners at the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham: “We do not believe that sufficient justification has been provided for the tall single-stair approach.” The LFB also complained the design provided “insufficient facilities … to support disabled occupants safely evacuating the building”. The plan to rethink the fire strategy comes amid growing pressure on the government to tighten building regulations to make sure high-rise residents have more than one staircase to escape from in the event of a fire. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is reviewing building regulations guidance on fire escape routes. Some fire experts want to bring the UK into line with dozens of other countries where two or more escape stairs are required on tall buildings. But under current regulations guidance tall residential buildings are allowed to have single staircases as long as the strategy in the event of a fire is for residents to “stay put” – on the understanding the rest of the building is designed, built and maintained to stop fire spreading from flat to flat. Numerous towers in planning, under construction and recently completed are likely to feature single staircases, albeit alongside other fire safety measures including smoke ventilation, fire-fighting lifts and sprinklers. But some experts warn single stairs remain too risky because flaws in buildings, however inadvertent, may in practice allow fires to spread and making evacuation essential. This happened at Grenfell, where compartmentation failed and residents and firefighters had to use the same smoke-logged stairs, hampering escape. The rethink by URW is the second by a major developer this month. Last week Ballymore withdrew its application for a 51-storey tower close to Canary Wharf from a planning hearing, amid alarm that it featured only one staircase. The London fire brigade also intervened. In a statement about the Westfield tower a spokesperson for the LFB said: “While we are not a statutory consultee on such planning applications, we would always look to provide a response around the fire strategy in high-rise buildings, as we have in this case. We understand that there are revised plans for the development following our submission and we look forward to reviewing those.” A spokesperson for Grenfell United said: “We’re pleased to hear the plans are being revised, but without regulation, there are no rules for what those revisions should look like. The reality is, we’re in the same position as we were before; current regulations mean these dangerous buildings are still legal. Had we not found the plans for this development, it would have gone ahead putting more lives at risk.” URW said building safety is “a key priority for any of our developments and we engage a fire engineer to ensure that designs satisfy the London Plan guidelines and meet all required building safety protocols”. Andy Slaughter, the local MP, said: “It is good that individual developers are rethinking their plans but there is a gold rush of tall buildings with inadequate fire safety measures going through planning now … We need to put a stop on this until we have a proper review of fire safety measures that goes beyond cladding.”",News/Society,Skyscraper near Grenfell site goes back to drawing board over fire safety fears,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/skyscraper-near-grenfell-site-goes-back-to-drawing-board-over-fire-safety-fears
1/22/2022,"New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed that unvaccinated adults infected with Covid-19 who are 65 and older are 49 times more likely to need hospitalization compared to those who have received booster doses.  The CDC also found that in December, unvaccinated adults in that same age group experienced a rate of Covid-related hospitalization 17 times higher than those who are fully vaccinated. For unvaccinated adults between 50 and 64, they are 44 times more likely to require hospitalization compared with those who are immunized. In that same age group, unvaccinated adults were also 17 times more likely to experience Covid-related hospitalization. According to the CDC, adults who are 65 and older and have received both doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine showed a 94% reduced risk of Covid-related hospitalizations. Unvaccinated adults aged 18 to 49 are 12 times more likely to be hospitalized, whereas unvaccinated adolescents who are 12 to 17 are nine times more likely to be hospitalized compared with their fully immunized counterparts. “Getting very sick means that older adults with Covid-19 might need hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they might even die. The risk increases for people in their 50s and increases in 60s, 70s, and 80s. People 85 and older are the most likely to get very sick,” the CDC said on its website. “Get vaccinated as soon as possible,” the agency added. Last Friday, international regulators at the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities published a report that reaffirmed the importance of obtaining a booster dose. “Reviewing data on the impact of Omicron, the participants concluded that current vaccines offer less protection against infection and mild disease caused by this variant. However, vaccination continues to offer considerable protection from hospitalisation and severe Covid-19 with Omicron, especially after a booster dose,” the regulators said. “It is becoming increasingly clear that a booster dose is needed to extend vaccine protection,” they added. Nevertheless, the regulators also acknowledged that “the administration of multiple booster doses at short intervals is not a sustainable approach in the longer term,” adding: “There is a need to develop a long-term strategy on the types of vaccines needed to manage Covid in the future.” According to Johns Hopkins data, the US has recorded more than 69m cases as well as over 860,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Approximately 63% of Americans have been fully vaccinated. Earlier this week, the US’s top medical adviser Anthony Fauci said that there were five stages of the pandemic and that the world is still currently in the first phase, “where the whole world is really very negatively impacted as we are right now”. The following four phases are deceleration, control, elimination and eradication. “If you look at the history of infectious diseases, we’ve only eradicated one infectious disease in man, and that’s smallpox.

Corbel, who planted the devices in rented rooms such as hotels and Airbnbs, posed as an airline pilot booking photoshoots and targeted unsuspecting models and escorts. Police discovered files involving 51 women on Corbel’s hard drive, with some videos up to four hours long. The former counter-terrorism officer pleaded guilty to 19 counts of voyeurism. One victim, who told the trial how her life had been affected, said: “I have pulled so much of my hair out with stress I have bald spots and have had to turn down work.” She showed the courtroom her scalp. Some victims drew parallels between Corbel and Wayne Couzens, who as a serving Met police officer kidnapped, raped and murdered 33-year-old Sarah Everard while she walked home and sparked a national reckoning on violence against women. Corbel’s sentencing at Isleworth crown court in London comes after a slate of incidents involving serving officers some say have driven a wedge between the police and the public. After Couzens’ sentencing in September, last month two Met police officers were jailed for taking and sharing pictures of two Black murder victims. Concerns over mistrust in the police were echoed by the judge in Corbel’s case, Martin Edmunds QC. One of the 19 victims who gave statements against Corbel said: “The fact that he is policeman is a huge deal. These people are meant to protect us. Following the murder of Sarah Everard this feels like a very frightening time to be a woman.” Sentencing Corbel to three years in prison, Edmunds said there was no evidence Corbel used his role as an officer to locate or intimidate the women. “However, it is clear that the revelation to your victims that you were a serving police officer has for many of them seriously undermined their trust in the police, something that for those individuals, given their various lines of work, is a particularly serious matter, just as the revelation of your offending must impact on public trust.” Corbel, who was formerly attached to the Met’s continuous policing improvement command and whose police career spanned 13 years, was caught after a model became suspicious of a digital clock. An internet search of the brand name revealed the device was a spy camera that could be smartphone-operated. “You used a range of deceptions to induce women to take off their clothes in your presence so you could record videos for your sexual gratification,” Edmunds said. “It is clear that you derived satisfaction from breaching [personal] boundaries by committing these offences rather than seeking out persons who might have offered the opportunity to video them without deception.” The offences took place in cities such as London, Manchester and Brighton, with Corbel sometimes planting up to nine cameras.",News/UK news,Met detective jailed for three years after spying on naked women,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/met-detective-jailed-for-three-years-after-spying-on-naked-women
1/22/2022,"Just because Boris Johnson approaches every issue thinking only of Boris Johnson does not mean we have to do the same. Even the crisis that now engulfs the prime minister, and sees his fate hang on Tory MPs’ reaction to a Sue Gray report that could come next week, is not only about him. It’s tempting to see it that way – to look for the roots of the partygate scandal in Johnson’s arrogance, entitlement and narcissism – but it’s a double mistake. As a matter of politics, it’s unwise because it would allow the Conservatives to ditch Johnson, pick a successor and claim to be a new government exorcised of its demon, with no need for the electorate to turn to Labour. But it’s also wrong.  For Johnson may be a loner, but he did not act alone. That’s narrowly true, in the sense that there were plenty of others who knew about or attended those rule-breaking parties and plenty more who are covering for him now. Every Conservative MP who defends Johnson, every activist or donor who does not demand his resignation, makes themselves complicit in the damage his actions have caused. But it’s true in a deeper sense, too, in that the shaming events in Downing Street are a function of a Conservative party that is now something else. Despite the name, that organisation is no longer conservative in the way that was previously understood and in which it once took great pride. Consider the two parties that Johnson himself did not attend, the ones that rocked the basement and saw a suitcase full of booze wheeled into No 10 the night before the Queen buried her husband. Forget Covid and the restrictions that were broken. There was a time, not so long ago, when no Conservative would have dreamed of partying in a government building on the eve of a royal funeral, even if there was no pandemic. They would have been affronted by the very idea of it. Or take the actions of two of Johnson’s most loyal cabinet ministers as they moved to save their boss. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, announced the end of the licence fee, essentially passing a death sentence on the BBC as we know it. Admittedly, Tory ministers have always enjoyed bashing the BBC, threatening to take it down a peg, but they have not called for its effective destruction. Yet now a minister who calls herself a Conservative can look at a world-class, century-old institution that all but defines Britishness, and think her mission is not to preserve and protect that institution but to smash it into pieces. Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who likes to cosplay as an Edwardian high Tory, sought to defend Johnson by attacking the elected leader of the Scottish Conservative party as “a lightweight”, thereby belittling the Scottish Tories who had chosen him. Once upon a time, a member of the Conservative and Unionist party would have understood that the fate of the union is imperilled if Scottish voters believe Westminster regards them with contempt. But Rees-Mogg couldn’t care less. The origin of all this – a Conservative party happily trampling on the union, the monarchy and the cultural organisation that binds these islands together like no other – is not hard to fathom, though it has become impolite to mention it. It’s Brexit that transformed the Conservative party. Where once Tories revered tradition, Brexit filled them with revolutionary zeal. Suddenly, and in a reversal of the teaching of the conservative theorist Michael Oakeshott, they preferred the unknown to the familiar, the untried to the tried, the possible to the actual, utopian bliss to present laughter. Brexit saw the Tories succumb to the lure of abstract nouns – Freedom! Sovereignty! – and supposedly creative destruction. One minister can’t shake the image of Dominic Cummings, minutes after the referendum result came through, leaping on a table at Vote Leave headquarters, giving a speech and then punching a hole in the ceiling: “Destructive fervour in his moment of triumph.” Vandalism became a Brexit habit – hardly surprising for a project dedicated to uprooting a tangle of connections with our continental neighbours that had grown dense and thick over half a century – and this is the Brexit government. Like all revolutionary endeavours, it believes that the end justifies all means, no matter the damage to those things conservatives once cherished. This, remember, was the movement that promised to restore parliamentary sovereignty – only to suspend parliament illegally to get its way. So we should not be too surprised that the Vote Leave Downing Street behaved the way it did. Of course it had contempt for the rules, even those it wrote itself. This was the government that boasted on the floor of the House of Commons of its willingness to break international law, if that’s what its purist Brexit required. And naturally it bridled at restrictions of any kind, even those essential to keeping our fellow citizens alive. A crude libertarianism always ran through Brexit, with Brussels seen as the source of pettifogging rules imposing a nannying health-and-safety culture on John Bull. No wonder Johnson, Cummings and the others thought they were above such things. Freedom was always their rallying cry, and they were going to damn well have it, even as they were denying it to everyone else. Besides, they saw themselves as granted a special licence that put them beyond the reach of the usual constraints. The Brexiters believed the referendum result had given them a super-mandate that trumped any conventions or norms: it made them anointed instruments of the will of the people, who could brook no challenge. The landslide victory of 2019 reinforced that conviction. It was a toxic combination: part Marie Antoinette drinking and laughing while outside the walled garden the obedient public were dying lonely deaths, part revolutionary politburo convinced that whatever satisfied its personal interests served the cause of the people. We need have no illusions about the Conservative party of old. We know its record. We know that Margaret Thatcher had her own kind of revolutionary zeal, just as we know the destructive impact of David Cameron’s austerity. But there were lines it dared not cross, monarchy and the union among them. This is a different animal. Brexit transformed it from a conservative party into a national-populist party. Its instincts now are those of Viktor Orbán, funnelling public money and jobs to ideological allies, ready to burn down even the most valued institutions that stand in its way. Of course, it has contempt for the people, as all populists ultimately do. It even had contempt for the Queen on the night of her greatest grief. So let’s not pretend these faults were Johnson’s alone. Brexit is the virus. Boris Johnson was only ever its most visible carrier.

1/22/2022,"The UK government faces a £150m bill after a court confirmed tens of thousands of severely disabled people were discriminated against as a result of being left financially worse off after being moved on to universal credit. A scathing judgment handed down on Friday marks the fourth victory in a six-year fight for justice against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) brought by two disabled men who had their disability benefit payments cut by £180 a month after they moved house more than five years ago.  The men, known as TP and AR, began their legal challenge in 2016 and 2017, arguing the deduction was discriminatory and had caused them serious hardship. Despite rulings in the pair’s favour by both the high court and the court of appeal, the DWP still refused to compensate their full monthly loss, offering instead just £120. Friday’s judgment found the DWP had once again discriminated against the men. The judge, Mr Justice Holgate, said the secretary of state for work and pensions had been unable to show “an objective and reasonable justification” for her differential treatment of people in TP and AR’s position. The judgment also found in favour of a disabled mother and child, known as claimants AB and F, who had lost disability payments in child tax credit when they moved on to universal credit without transitional relief. They had suffered discrimination “manifestly without reasonable foundation”, the judge found. According to evidence provided by the DWP to the court during the claim, Friday’s ruling will affect up to 50,000 claimants, while the cost of providing transitional relief will involve sums of £20m to £30m a year over a six-year period. Responding to the ruling, TP said: “I am relieved that the judge agrees that the DWP treated us differently than other severely disabled benefits claimants and that it was wrong to do so. The past six years have been immensely stressful as I have struggled to get by on a lower income. I just hope that the DWP will put all of this right as soon as possible so that those of us who have been badly affected by this unfair policy can get on with our lives.” AR said: “The policy has caused me and others serious hardship and I am glad that the court has seen the sense in our argument. Hopefully we will be ‘fourth time lucky’ and finally have reached the end of the road fighting this unfair policy.” Tessa Gregory, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, which represented the pair, said she did not understand why the DWP kept fighting the case. “Following the three previous findings of unlawful discrimination the DWP should have ensured our clients were not losing out on severe and enhanced disability payments following their move from legacy benefits to universal credit. “Instead after each judgment the DWP has made further attempts to short-change this group of highly vulnerable claimants who faced a cliff-edge loss of income when none of their disability needs has changed.” Before moving on to universal credit, both men had been in receipt of the severe disability premium (SDP) and the enhanced disability premium (EDP) benefits, which were designed to meet the additional care needs of severely disabled people living alone with no carer. Despite being advised by DWP officials that they would receive transitional relief – meaning in effect their income would not change – when they moved on to universal credit and their EDP and SDP payments stopped, each had £178 a month deducted, leaving them unable to meet key care needs. TP moved house on clinical advice after he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Castleman disease. AR, who had mental illness, moved after the bedroom tax forced him to find a cheaper home. Both were moved on to universal credit automatically.

1/22/2022,"Late-night hosts tore into the Senate’s failure to pass voting rights protections this week, and in particular two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who supported the measure but refused to end the filibuster that allowed Republicans to block it.  To recap, “Senate Republicans representing a minority of Americans filibustered voting rights legislation favored by a majority of Americans, which would’ve passed if not for the filibuster,” Seth Meyers explained on Thursday’s Late Night. “So Senate Democrats, who represent a majority of Americans, then tried to change the filibuster, but they couldn’t because two Democrats who voted for the voting rights bill also voted to keep the filibuster, which prevents them from passing the voting rights bill they support. “And let me be clear: that is a sentence that makes no fucking sense whatsoever,” he continued. “I hope at the very least this is a moment when we can step back to fully digest just how ass-backwards our system is.” Meyers noted that the opposition from all 50 Republican senators was “sad but predictable”, but the refusal by Manchin and Sinema to end the filibuster, the procedural rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation to a final vote, in the name of bipartisanship was “especially infuriating”. “When it comes to voting, there’s only one side,” he said. “Republicans are the ones waging war on democracy. You can’t compromise with the side that’s doing the damage. When you’re putting out a fire, you don’t call the fire department and the arsonist and see what they can work out together.” Did the Democrats’ voting rights bill pass? No.But did Joe Manchin actually have solid reasoning for shooting it down? Also no. pic.twitter.com/zBeIaE27Zu On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah mocked Manchin’s speech on the Senate floor defending the filibuster as playing an “important role in protecting our democracy from the transitory passions of the majority and respecting the input of the minority in the Senate”. “Joe Manchin is right, everything in the Senate should be as difficult as possible,” Noah deadpanned. “If Democrats want to pass a bill, Chuck Schumer should have to carry it through a stage of American Ninja Warrior first.” Though both Sinema and Manchin have said they support the voting rights bill, “they just don’t support making sure that they pass”, Noah noted. “Which, when you think about it, is actually so inspiring, you know? Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema believe so strongly in the power of voting that they use their vote to block voting rights for the entire country. They were unvoting voting by voting.” “What Joe Manchin is saying is: I want to help you out of the water. I’m not going to throw you a rope, but I want to throw you the rope,” Noah concluded. “And any drowning man would agree, it’s the thought that counts.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert observed the first anniversary of Joe Biden’s term in office. “It seems like just yesterday our democracy was being held hostage by a cabal of obstructionists who didn’t want every vote counted. Oh wait, that’s yesterday,” he joked. The anniversary was not a good day for the former president, as the supreme court voted 8-1 to reject Donald Trump’s request to keep the National Archives from releasing documents to the House select committee on 6 January. “He’s losing so much, he’s going to get tired of losing,” Colbert joked. Among the material Trump wanted to keep hidden are proposed talking points for the then press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, a draft text of Trump’s speech for the “Save America” rally preceding the attack, and a handwritten note concerning January 6. The note’s author is unknown, Colbert noted. “All we know is that it was written on a burger wrapper.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel blasted Senate Republicans for uniformly rejecting new legislation for voting rights which would ensure more Americans are able to vote. “Republicans want to add restrictions to voting because they are worried about voter fraud, even though it’s almost completely non-existent,” he explained. “Hey, you know what, you guys believe climate change is non-existent, right? How about coming up with some restrictions for that? Let’s compromise on this,” he added. After the vote, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, “poked his little old head out of his shell to accidentally say what he really means” about his reasons for blocking the measure. Asked by a reporter how he would respond to people of color worried about their right to vote, McConnell answered: “The concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans.” “He means ‘regular’ Americans – the pink ones, like him,” Kimmel noted.",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on failed voting rights bill: ‘Republicans are waging war on democracy’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/21/seth-meyers-late-night-voting-rights
