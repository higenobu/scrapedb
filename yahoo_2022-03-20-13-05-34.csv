3/20/2022,"Warren Buffett is right to be devouring shares of oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY), says one long-time oil markets strategist. The billionaire investor's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) scooped up another 18.1 million shares of Occidental for close to $1 billion this week. The latest purchases come hot on the heels of Berkshire spending $6 billion or so in the prior two weeks to buy up Occidental shares. Berkshire now owns nearly 14.6% of Occidental Petroleum through his roughly 140 million shares. Energy expert and portfolio manager Rob Thummel of Tortoise Capital says there is more behind Buffett's buying binge than a play on elevated oil prices. ""Occidental is benefiting from the higher oil prices. The other factor a lot of energy companies are doing that is changing the game for energy companies and how investors perceive them, is that Occidental has actually embraced the energy transition and participating in it,"" Thummel said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""You'll hear them talk a lot of about carbon capture. When you combine the energy security that Occidental can provide, plus the energy transition that they are participating in, that has become a more compelling story for energy investors going forward."" Thummel says he doesn't own any shares of Occidental. Occidental's stock price has responded as one would expect when a whale like Buffett gets involved. Shares have skyrocketed 43% in the past month compared to the relatively unchanged S&P 500, per Yahoo Finance Plus data. During that same span, shares of oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron are up 1% and 19%, respectively. Occidental will hold a key investor day on March 22. To be sure, Buffett will likely be listening very closely. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It took one of the biggest stock-market routs in Chinese history, but President Xi Jinping may finally be heeding the concerns of international investors. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Ukraine Update: Russia Again Shells Western Areas Around Lviv Putin Vows to Rid Russia of ‘Traitors’ While Waging Ukraine War A sweeping set of promises this week from Xi’s government to make regulation more transparent and predictable -- as well as a commitment to overseas markets including Hong Kong -- suggests authorities are appealing to investors abroad. The ruling Communist Party is seeking to regain the trust of international funds and the global business community after the country was lumped in with Russia as an “uninvestable” destination. China has more overtly distanced itself from Russia over the past week, saying it wants to avoid being impacted by U.S. sanctions and promising to “never attack” Ukraine. Xi is set to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday morning in Washington for the first time since Russia’s invasion. Xi’s shift contrasts with the unbending strategy of his friend President Vladimir Putin, despite global sanctions decimating Russia’s economy. While China still needs to follow through with this week’s pledges, the rhetoric has helped reduce turmoil in the nation’s financial markets. A gauge of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong rebounded at the fastest pace since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. “The market was in freefall -- a clear signal was needed from a senior level to clear the air,” said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California San Diego who researches elite Chinese politics. “I think unclear and even deleterious policy conditions were beginning to create an all-out panic.” In the latest potential shift, Xi pledged at a Politburo meeting to limit the economic impact of the country’s Covid-Zero policy, the first time he has done so during the pandemic. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam on Thursday promised a review of Covid-fighting measures that have spurred a growing exodus from the business community. That came a month after Xi told local officials bringing the omicron outbreak under control was “a mission that overrides everything.” Among other notable developments this week, China’s securities watchdog is considering giving U.S. regulators access to company audits as soon as this year, people familiar with the matter said. This would be Beijing’s biggest concession since Chinese firms first listed in the U.S. more than two decades ago, and may help ease concern about forced delistings. The State Council said a crackdown on internet platform companies would be completed “as soon as possible.” Increased regulation helped wipe as much as $661 billion off Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s shares alone since their 2020 peak. The Finance Ministry said it won’t expand a property tax trial this year -- a plan that had been floated in October. China’s cabinet said it would resolve risks around property developers. A liquidity crisis for builders such as China Evergrande Group has weighed on the nation’s property, stock and credit markets for months. Previously, officials described the collapsing value of such firms as a market event which wouldn’t necessitate government intervention. Xi’s government had until now displayed little concern for the rout in Chinese markets. State-directed campaigns like “common prosperity” limited private sector-growth and dragged the MSCI China Index of stocks down 22% last year -- the biggest underperformance versus global shares since 1998. Investors in Chinese junk dollar bonds suffered their worst relative returns in more than a decade. But with Xi set to seek a third term as president in a twice-decade leadership reshuffle later this year, the Communist Party is prioritizing stability above all else. The need for the government to act had been growing more urgent. Global confidence in Chinese financial markets was by some metrics the weakest since the financial crisis in 2008, with stocks cratering, credit plunging and record outflows from government bonds undermining the currency’s strength. Hong Kong’s reputation as an international finance hub has been called into question, after two years of closed borders spurred at least tens of thousands of residents to abandon the city. China’s worst Covid outbreak since Wuhan and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine pose new and unpredictable threats to China’s already slowing economy. Authorities risk a downward spiral in their bursting of a property-market bubble, with the largest developers suffering a 43% year-on-year decline in home sales in the first two months. There’s still plenty that can go wrong for investors. China’s closeness with Russia puts it at the center of increasingly fraught geopolitical tensions. A potential overhaul of Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s payments business and Didi Global Inc.’s delayed Hong Kong listing shows regulators are unlikely to go soft on Big Tech. The central bank’s decision this week to refrain from cutting interest rates served as a reminder that monetary policy will remain prudent. Bulls got burned so many times in the past year that few are convinced the worst is finally over. Markets remain volatile, with the Hang Seng China gauge falling as much as 3.6% on Friday before recovering. Xi’s government has faced collapsing investor confidence before. Heavy-handed intervention in the domestic stock market in 2015 after a bubble burst drew criticism from global funds, who said officials were turning their backs on free-market reforms. A messy devaluation of the yuan the same year spurred capital outflows and raised questions over the competence of China’s oversight of financial markets. In 2018, the CSI 300 Index lost about a quarter of its value in a rout triggered by the Sino-U.S. trade war. Yet each time Xi’s government pushed ahead with plans to further open up China’s capital markets and attract foreign funds. The country’s domestic shares were added to MSCI indexes in 2018, and bonds included in global benchmarks from the following year. Soon, foreign investors couldn’t get enough. Between the start of 2019 and the end of 2021, overseas holdings of local stocks increased by more than 242% to 3.9 trillion yuan ($614 billion). Inflows into the nation’s bond market rose by 129% to 4.1 trillion yuan. Western capital and technology are essential to China, despite recent efforts to make the country more self-sufficient. Foreign direct investment topped 1 trillion yuan last year, with about a third going into high-tech sectors, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said this month. The need to ensure global investors are on China’s side is unlikely to end any time soon. “China can not develop in isolation of the world and nor can the world develop without China,” Vice President Wang Qishan said in a speech at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in November. “China will keep its arms wide open, provide more market investment and growth opportunities to the world.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Global Exodus From Chinese Markets Prompts Xi to Change Tack,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-exodus-chinese-markets-prompts-074623911.html

3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- California is so awash with money that Wall Street is advising it to buy out some of its debt investors. Most Read from Bloomberg Biden Warned Xi of ‘Consequences’ for Backing Russia in War Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Putin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks Are Russia’s ‘Only Chance’ Russia Default Fears Ease as Key Debt Payments Reach Investors Morgan Stanley and Loop Capital Markets suggested to Treasurer Fiona Ma that her office consider paying off some bonds early, public records obtained by Bloomberg News show. The pitches underscore the financial strength of California given that the state’s proposed $213 billion budget is bolstered by a $45.7 billion surplus. The state’s progressive tax system rakes in more revenue when the income of its highest earners rises. In fact, the state can generate so much revenue, it may trigger a constitutional limit on spending. Paying off some debt early can help the state get around that requirement, creating a “budget buffer” to preserve its flexibility, Loop said. Since debt service isn’t considered an expenditure under the requirement, California could pay off some general-obligation or lease revenue bonds early, the firm suggested. “Given current budget performance and cash position, the state can also evaluate opportunities to defease bonds with cash,” Morgan Stanley said in its presentation that also listed examples of general-obligation debt that could be paid off early. The documents from both banks included more standard recommendations such as selling new debt to refund higher-cost securities. “Select municipal issuers have begun considering using excess cash to defease outstanding bonds, aided by the influx of cash from the federal government and budget performance,” Morgan Stanley said. It did not give examples. The underwriter declined to comment further. Meanwhile, Loop pointed to New Jersey as an example of an issuer defeasing debt. Last month, the state said it finished paying off $2.25 billion of debt early, saving $607 million over 10 years. Loop spokesperson Jorian Seay-Saunders didn’t respond to requests for comment. “In theory, it’s great to use excess money you have to lower your recurring expenditures,” said Lisa Washburn, a managing director at research firm Municipal Market Analytics. “Since it’s one-time money, you want to make one-time investments.” Currently, there are no plans to defease debt with cash, said California Deputy Treasurer Tim Schaefer by email. Of course, doing so would give California even more capacity to sell new bonds. And Governor Gavin Newsom already has proposed a way to avoid incurring new debt by paying $500 million to complete four capital projects instead of selling taxable municipal bonds. That would save the state $350 million in financing costs. Nevertheless, underwriters are girding for opportunities to help California take on new debt. Ma’s office has received pitches to create bond-funded programs from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC Capital Markets for home down-payment assistance and student loans, the public records show. Goldman declined to comment, and RBC didn’t provide one. Schaefer and H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for Newsom’s finance department, declined to comment on the underwriters’ recommendations. “It is the nature of our business -- and that of the underwriters -- that a healthy exchange of ideas and creativity is important to a better understanding of the market,” Schaefer said. “Our office encourages this exchange of information and the learning that occurs as a result.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs For Sale: Trudeau’s Oil Pipeline.
