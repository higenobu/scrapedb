3/23/2022,"Ukrainian forces are capturing Russian military equipment and using it against Russian troops. On Sunday, Ukraine seized intact Russian missiles and fired them back, an official told CNN. President Zelenskyy last week joked that captured gear made Russia a top arms supplier to Ukraine. Ukrainian forces captured a batch of intact Russian missiles and fired them back at Russian troops, CNN reported on Monday. Russian troops trying to invade Kyiv from the northwestern city of Hostomel on Sunday were attacked with their own weapons, Yuri Golodov, the deputy commander of one of Ukraine's territorial forces, told CNN. ""Last night we sent the Ukrainian armed forces 24 Uragan missiles that were on their way here to fly over our cities,"" Golodov told CNN on Monday. ""We captured them intact, gave them to the armed forces of Ukraine at night, and now the Ukrainian army has fired missiles back at them,"" he added. Golodov leads a team working to repair and repaint Russian military equipment that has been captured or abandoned, CNN reported. The team works on different types of military vehicles at a junkyard in Kyiv, fixing broken parts, removing communications systems, and painting over any Russian military symbols, the report said. ""It looks like old weaponry, but actually if you use it correctly it will serve us for a long time,"" Golodov said, adding, ""Everything that we take away from the Russian army, we transfer to the armed forces of Ukraine."" Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joked that Russia had become a major arms supplier to Ukraine because so much of its equipment had been captured by Ukrainian forces. ""We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address. ""Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army."" Ukraine's armed forces said on Monday that Russian troops had lost 498 tanks, 121 helicopters, and 1,535 armored personnel carriers since the start of the conflict on February 24. The figures have not been verified.

3/23/2022,"Scientists have figured out a way to decipher the pictures people see in their mind when they imagine something. Working with patients with epilepsy who already had electrodes fitted in the brains, researchers from Osaka University in Japan used electrocorticogram technology to capture participant’s brain waves while they were thinking about an image. Participants were instructed to look at an image while mentally picturing a completely separate image from various categories, such as a “landscape” or “human face”. The electrocorticogram technique allowed the researchers to detect patterns of electrical activity in the brain in real-time during the experiment, which they then used to determine what the person was imagining rather than what they were looking at. “Attention is known to modulate neural representations of perceived images,” said Ryohei Fukuma, who led the research. “However, we didn’t know whether imagining a different image could also change these representations.” In testing this hypothesis, the scientists were able to generate a clear distinction between the imagined image and the viewed image with remarkable accuracy. “The results clarified the relationship between brain activities when people look at images versus when they imagine them,” explained Takufumi Yanagisawa, a professor at the Institute of Advanced Co-Creation and neurosurgeon in the department of neurosurgery at Osaka University. “The electrocorticogram readouts of the imagined images were distinct from those provoked by the actual images viewed by the patients. They could also be modified to be even more distinct when the patients received real-time feedback.” The technology could potentially be used to develop a communication device for severely paralysed patients, the researchers said, such as sufferers of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS patients currently use devices that rely on some form of motor control to communicate, meaning their ability to use it deteriorates over time. The research was published in the journal Communications Biology.",Science/The Independent,Scientists read brain waves to see what people picture in their mind’s eye,https://news.yahoo.com/scientists-read-brain-waves-see-141123454.html
