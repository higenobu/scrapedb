5/7/2022,"Energy stocks are some of the top performers in the market. But according to JPMorgan, more gains are on the horizon. “Energy is the only sector that is seeing quality, growth and momentum scores improve simultaneously while maintaining an attractive value and income profile,” JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas writes. Strong commodity prices have fueled the sector’s rally. Lakos-Bujas believes that trend will continue because of elevated demand and constrained supply. “While investor interest and sentiment has clearly inflected from record lows over the past year, energy stocks are far from pricing in strong and sustainable outlooks for fundamentals and shareholder returns.” Of course, not all energy stocks are the same. Here’s a quick look at three names in the sector that JPMorgan finds particularly attractive.

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that liquified natural gas producer Cheniere Energy is firing on all cylinders. In Q1, revenue shot up 142% year over year to $7.5 billion. Management also lifted the company’s full-year consolidated adjusted EBITDA outlook by 17% and distributable cash flow projection by 26% at the midpoint. As a leading player in the field, Cheniere is well-positioned for the commodities boom. The shares have already climbed 40% in 2022 to over $140 apiece. Last Friday, JPMorgan analyst Jeremy Tonet reiterated an ‘overweight’ rating on Cheniere while raising his price target from $169 to $183 — implying potential upside of 30%. With oil prices rising above $100 a barrel, oil producers have served as a safe haven in an otherwise gloomy stock market. British oil and gas giant BP, for instance, has seen its shares climb 15% in 2022. And there could be plenty of more room to run. Last month, JPMorgan analyst Christyan Malek maintained an ‘overweight’ rating on the shares and raised his price target. The new target implies potential upside of about 20%. BP shares trade on the London Stock Exchange. But its American depository receipt — commonly known as ADR — allows investors to buy BP like any other US-traded stock. In Q1, the oil and gas supermajor brought in $51.2 billion of revenue, up 40% from a year ago. On the negative side, BP’s decision to exit Russia in light of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine led to a pre-tax charge of $25.5 billion for the quarter. Oil producers aren’t the only companies in the energy sector worth following. For instance, Nextier Oilfield Solutions — an oilfield service company — has also delivered extraordinary returns to investors in recent months. Year to date, the shares have skyrocketed by more than 170%. Nextier’s business is booming. In Q1, revenue increased 25% sequentially to $635 million, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of 25%-plus top-line growth. The company’s two operating segments — completion services and well construction/intervention services — delivered strong improvements. For Q2, management expects sequential revenue growth of greater than 20% and substantial adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram has an ‘overweight’ rating on Nextier and recently raised his price target to $13 — roughly 19% above where the stock sits today.

5/7/2022,"Current Twitter employees have shared concerns over potential culture changes at the company after Elon Musk moved to take it over. But by some metrics, job interest in the company has skyrocketed since the Tesla billionaire submitted his winning bid. It’s still unclear what employees can expect from the company’s new owner, who said this week that he would take on the role as interim CEO. But Musk himself weighed in on Friday with more details of his hiring vision, sharing Fortune's previous reporting. “If Twitter acquisition completes, company will be super focused on hardcore software engineering, design, infosec & server hardware,” he tweeted Friday morning. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1522595770288906242 ""I strongly believe that all managers in a technical area must be technically excellent. Managers in software must write great software or it’s like being a cavalry captain who can’t ride a horse!"" Musk added in a follow-up tweet. Fortune was not able to immediately reach Musk for further comment. Fortune reported on Thursday that a senior economist for Glassdoor, a job insights platform, shared that interest in job openings at Twitter were up 263% between April 24 and April 30. In a statement to Fortune, Zhao said that interest was defined by the average daily clicks on Twitter job postings, comparing the same number of clicks to a March baseline, before Musk made a bid for the company. “Say what you will about Elon, he does have a large fanbase of ppl excited to work for him,” Zhao tweeted on Thursday. “He's much more likely to capitalize on that attraction as CEO than owner.” In Monday SEC filing, Twitter itself worried about how the company would retain its current employees and recruit new ones, specifically highlighting how the uncertainty around the Musk buy could lead to staffing issues. A consequence of the takeover could be Twitter’s “inability to attract and retain key personnel and recruit prospective employees, and the possibility that our current employees could be distracted, and their productivity decline as a result,” the company wrote in the filing.
