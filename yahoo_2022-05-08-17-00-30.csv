5/8/2022,"In Q1 2022, Meta’s (FB) metaverse business — known as Reality Labs — operated at a loss of nearly $3 billion, causing skepticism in the market about whether the metaverse truly has a place in the digital future. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that costs in the present are “laying the groundwork” for this technology to hit the mainstream. In spite of the skepticism, Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon agrees that the best has yet to come for metaverse adoption and investment. “It's real, it's going to be a very big opportunity,” Amon told Yahoo Finance Live. “We started investing in fundamental technologies that allow the merger of physical and digital spaces over a decade ago. It's no secret that because of those early investments, for the over 40 virtual reality and augmented reality devices that exist in the world, [they are] all powered by Qualcomm.” Amon joined Yahoo Finance Live from the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Garfinkle. Amon discussed the company’s presence in the auto industry, partnerships, competition, and the metaverse. And while Meta’s $3 billion bill for Reality Labs in the first quarter of 2022 may seem hefty, the business lost more than $10 billion throughout 2021. Horizon Worlds, Meta’s flagship VR social app, piloted creator monetization features late in the quarter and is expected to launch a web version to extend access to those who do not own an Oculus Quest 2 or similar headset. The platform reached a milestone of 300,000 users earlier this year. According to Amon, Qualcomm continues to maintain existing and secure new partnerships with industry giants like Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) to provide hardware and software for their extended reality (XR) businesses. “One of our biggest partnerships is with Meta,” he said. “We have had a very successful partnership with them for VR with the Quest and the Quest 2. We announced at CES that we're now doing a custom chip for augmented reality with Microsoft as the Microsoft HoloLens gets ready to scale, and we announced a partnership, for example, [a partnership] with ByteDance for VR for Tiktok.” The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.50% on Wednesday in an effort to pump the brakes on surging inflation. In light of the Fed’s hawkish interest rate hike campaign, uncertainty remains in regard to metaverse investment as investors begin to favor value over growth stocks. The issuance of exchange-traded funds like the ProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) demonstrates that some investors, both institutional and retail, recognize the opportunity in metaverse. However, the fund and similar ETFs like it have been hammered by macroeconomic conditions. In any case, Amon maintains optimism for the future of metaverse and XR technology. “We have a number of different developments to eventually be able to create companion to your smartphone with fully immersive augmented reality glasses that actually is going to look like [normal glasses],” he said. “And I think that's a big opportunity. It could be as big as phones.” Thomas Hum is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

5/8/2022,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12. The New York State Assembly recently approved legislation that would hinder economic opportunity and innovation across the state at a time when job and economic growth are crucial for the state’s economy. Assembly bill A.7389C sets a moratorium on approving new applications or permits for digital asset mining operations, also known as proof-of-work mining, that use electric power generated by carbon-based fuels, such as coal. But this shortsighted proposal will accomplish little for the environment and bring real harm to areas of New York that are working to attract new, innovative businesses. Teana Baker-Taylor is the chief policy officer for the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a leading trade association for the digital asset and blockchain industries. Proof-of-work authentication verifies blockchain transactions for Bitcoin, and like all industrial activity, it uses energy. It’s a misconception, however, that proof-of-work mining uses more energy than other industries. New York policymakers have set aggressive goals to mitigate climate change. In 2019, the state implemented the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, requiring that statewide greenhouse gas emissions be reduced 85% by 2050, and that the state have net zero emissions in all sectors of the economy by that time. In 2020, it was estimated that proof-of-work used 247 terawatts of power, which is about 0.16% of global energy consumption. Eliminating proof-of-work mining would not put a meaningful dent in carbon emissions and will slow progress in transitioning this country to more renewable energy production and usage. Read More: New York State Assembly Passes Bill Blocking New Crypto Mines That Use Non-Renewable Power Transitioning to greener energy sources requires significant investments in new energy technology from industries that are committed to working with policymakers and the energy industry. Proof-of-work miners serve as reliable base customers who provide consistent demand – and revenue – for utilities to build out clean energy infrastructure. An added benefit: They can power down to redeploy critical use of power elsewhere, almost instantly, something other high-demand industries simply cannot do. For example, on occasions when customer demand spikes during the height of summer in Manhattan, or dead of winter in Buffalo, digital asset miners can work cooperatively with utilities to curtail their demand. The power being used by proof-of-work miners flows back to the grid giving retail consumers extra capacity in mere minutes with no adverse effects. No other industry that uses similar levels of energy, including data centers, cloud service providers and manufacturing facilities, has the ability to do this. It’s also important to note that even as digital asset mining has increased in its adoption over the past few years, the Bitcoin Mining Council estimates that the global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix is 58.5% and growing. The percentage for members of the Chamber of Digital Commerce Mining Initiative with infrastructure in New York is estimated to be even higher, closer to 80%. Few industries can boast such an environmentally friendly profile. This sustainability impact will only continue to grow over time as digital asset miners form partnerships with energy providers, utilities, communities and other groups to develop new energy capacity in New York by providing new and valuable economic incentives for energy companies to build green infrastructure and sources of power. Evolving proof-of-work operations will increasingly shift to more efficient ways to power operations, while paying dividends to local communities, including jobs, particularly union jobs with groups such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and increased local and state tax revenue. Read More: What a Mining Moratorium Could Really Mean for New York’s Crypto Industry Many states want to encourage digital asset mining operations and are poised to attract New York-based companies seeking a more welcoming environment. Georgia and Illinois have proposed tax incentives to attract digital asset mining companies to build facilities in their state. In Texas, stakeholders have noted that proof-of-work mining has helped stimulate the economy, create jobs, promote the development of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, and improve their tax base. Digital assets technologies are an emerging, global financial industry. By some estimates, more than 100 million individuals worldwide have adopted Bitcoin. Proof-of-work mining is the foundation of this ecosystem. Digital assets are creating an opportunity for millions of people in less fortunate economic circumstances to access the financial system by storing their savings in a medium that is independent of rapidly increasing inflation, banks fees and long-standing inequities in our banking system. It’s crucial that New York remains a leader in global financial services, rather than hindering an industry that is important to its future. Working together, the digital asset mining industry and New York can set the standard for expanding sustainable, ethical, business growth. The state Senate should vote down this proposal when it comes up for a vote in the coming days.

The famous ETF is now down more than 50% in 2022 thanks to the rate-spurred rout in speculative growth equities, taking its drop from the peak last year to 71%. Only a fraction of the $9.4 billion ARKK is in the Dreyfus fund -- about $4 million, according to Bloomberg data. Still, Wood’s fans appear to be sticking with her. The latest data show almost $600 million poured into ARKK in the three days through Wednesday. “Unlike index based ETFs, active ones often hold at least a small portion of assets in cash as they manage flows,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research for ETF Trends. “Cash equivalents do not go up or down in value and in a weak stock market such instruments can provide support for actively managed ETFs.” Wood and her firm ARK Investment Management have been among the highest-profile victims of a stock selloff that has swept Wall Street as inflation takes off and the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs. ARKK tumbled 8.9% on Thursday, the most since the height of the Covid crash, and was 3.1% lower as of 11:03 a.m. in New York on Friday.

5/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- First it was a rout in the stay-at-home names that surged in the pandemic. Then speculative software makers with barely any earnings went south. Now the giant technology names whose sway on benchmarks has been decried by bears for years are dragging the market down. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk’s Fixer Is Quietly Tending the World’s Biggest Fortune Russia Can’t Shake Default Risk After Last-Minute Bond Payment To Save Democracy and Defeat Putin, Give Up ‘the West’ Heirs of Hitler’s Billionaires Need to Reckon With the Past Brutal Stock Selloff Is a Multitude of Bear Cases Coming True Dizzying as the downdraft has been, you can’t say you weren’t warned. It’s axiomatic in markets: you never see it coming. But this selloff is an argument that sometimes you do. People have been saying for months that inflation would surge, forcing the Federal Reserve into action. Wall Street veterans like Charlie Munger spent 18 months lambasting the Robinhood crowd for its infatuation with speculative flotsam. Warnings the market would bend under its trillion-dollar tech monopolies have never been hard to find. While the timing was often wrong, it’s hard to say those views aren’t playing out now, with the S&P 500 falling for five straight weeks, its longest retreat in a decade. The index has slumped 14% from a record on the year’s first trading day, wiping about $6 trillion from its value. “The normal signs of excess have been out there for a while, whether it be in valuation, whether it be in all the speculative overshooting of some of these stock that have great stories but not a real solid business underneath them,” said Michael Ball, managing director of Denver-based Weatherstone Capital Management. What starts as a trickle “turns into a bigger outfall as everybody starts to say ‘I need to take off risk’ and nobody wants to take the other side.” Saying the market is acting in a predictable way sounds crazy after the week that just ended. Hawkish pronouncements by the Fed on Wednesday were occasion for a 3.4% surge in the Nasdaq 100, before the whole gain was unwound a day later. Treasury yields buckled and jumped, making Thursday only the fourth time in 20 years that the main stock and bond ETFs both lost 2% at the same time. Through a broader lens, the results look a little less disorderly. For the Nasdaq 100, which traded at almost 6 times sales as recently as November, the bull market is over, its five-month loss exceeding 23%. More speculative companies as proxied by funds like Ark Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) are nursing losses of twice that. Faddy groups like special purpose acquisition companies have suffered similar dents, while losses in the older-school industries repped by the Dow Jones Industrial Average are lower by a relatively tame 10%. “In a lot of ways, it’s following a typical playbook,” said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer and president of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California. “Market leadership is the losing leadership. That’s when the panic sets in.” Of course, just because it makes sense doesn’t mean everyone was ready for it. Dip-buyers were in evidence through the start of this month, with bounces like Wednesday’s giving bulls hopes. Until April, investors had kept funneling money into equity funds, sticking to their dip-buying strategy. “Investors tend to say, ‘this time is different,’” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “Investors get tired and say, ‘I’m not going to fight the tape, because even with higher multiples, the market just wants to keep going up.’” That’s not what’s happening now. The five tech giants, Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., at one point accounted for a quarter of the S&P 500, boasting an influence that’s greater than any comparable group of stocks since at least 1980. Now that the group, known as the Faangs, has seen their total value shaved by 23% from the December peak, a drag that the market has no chance of shaking off. The S&P 500 is mired in its second-longest correction since the global financial crisis. Meme stocks, such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp., also crashed. A Bloomberg basket of these shares tumbled more than 60% from its 2021 peak to this year’s trough. Day traders, who rose to prominence during the pandemic, managed to lose more than $1 billion from November 2019 to June 2021 dabbling in options on stocks mentioned on Reddit’s WallStreetBets trading forum, according to a recent study. And signs are building that the retail crowd is retreating from the market. “When we look at the selloff that we’ve seen not just in the past week but the last couple of weeks, it’s starting to make a lot of sense,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “We’re finally getting to that point where everything is for sale, regardless of the quality of earnings. And that typically is what happens toward the end of a selloff, not the beginning.” To Sylvia Jablonski, co-founder of Defiance ETFs, all the bearishness means now is time to go bottom fishing. “When you see this type of broad-based selling across every single sector, asset class, crypto, the future of technology, the quality darlings, that tells me that we are likely closer to a bottom than we are to an additional major correction,” she said. “Multiples have come in, the froth is certainly off of the market, and that leads to investment opportunities.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Formula One Finally Found a Way to Get Americans to Care U.S. Steel Bets on a New Technology—and the South—to Survive Putting an End to Heart Attacks by Editing Human DNA Stock Market Bottom-Fishers Are Trawling Risky Waters Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Brutal Stock Selloff Is a Multitude of Bear Cases Coming True,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brutal-stock-selloff-multitude-bear-201835168.html

That triggered fears of stagflation, or high inflation and slow economic growth, among investors. The BOE's grim outlook was the opposite of the U.S. Federal Reserve's upbeat tone on Wednesday, which temporarily assured investors that U.S. economic conditions could withstand higher rates. Overall, the shift from accommodative monetary policy to more restrictive measures has led to an unwind of speculative activity among global investors. That could be headwind for stocks and cryptos this year. Over the short term, price action remains neutral, and some altcoins have benefited from brief price spikes. ●Bitcoin (BTC): $35,928, −0.71% ●Ether (ETH): $2,683, −1.28% ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,123, −0.57% ●Gold: $1,883 per troy ounce, +0.47% ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.12%

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices. The chart below shows the ratio of buy volume versus sell volume in the bitcoin perpetual futures market. Readings below one indicate bearish sentiment among traders, similar to what occurred during previous downturns in price. BTC's latest price range between $35,000 and $46,000 occurred alongside a persistent downtrend in the buy/sell volume ratio. That suggests some buyers have remained on the sideline despite short-term stabilization in price. Ether (ETH) is down by 4% over the past week, compared with a 6% decline in BTC. Typically, ETH underperforms BTC during down markets. This time, however, choppy trading conditions have capped the ETH/BTC ratio in a tight range over the past year. A decisive breakout or breakdown from the current range could confirm a risk-on or risk-off environment. Bitcoin's dominance ratio, or BTC's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, ticked lower over the past few days. That suggests altcoins have experienced less selling pressure relative to bitcoin, which means traders are still comfortable with additional risk. Altcoins decline less than bitcoin during rising markets because of their higher risk profile. Still, similar to the BTC/ETH price ratio, a breakout or breakdown in the dominance ratio would confirm the next phase for crypto markets. DeFi tokens underperform: April fared relatively well for memecoins, such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB), but marked big losses for decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, including aave (AAVE) and thorchain (RUNE), research by crypto exchange Kraken noted this week.

5/8/2022,"This year marks 10 years since Keona Tranby graduated from college. A major milestone, to be sure. But after a decade of slowly chipping away at her student loans, Tranby's still paying for her education, and progress is painfully slow. Although the 32-year-old has paid off roughly $28,800 over the past 10 years, her total balance owed has increased to around $62,000. Tranby, who works as a marketing director for a Minneapolis-based nonprofit, is hopeful she may get some relief in the coming months, thanks to recent reports that President Joe Biden is seriously considering wiping out $10,000 of federal student loan debt for qualifying Americans. “Debt forgiveness is an emotional thing, to be honest with you,” Tranby says, adding that she'd still be left with a balance even with $10,000 in forgiveness. Cutting down her payment by a couple hundred dollars a month wouldn't be fundamentally life-changing, she says, but it would alleviate some of the constant worry and stress she carries from her student loan debt. “It's like a more psychological burden would be lifted,” Tranby says. “And it would allow us to have more goals and do more things.” More than 60% of student loan borrowers say their debt has negatively affected their mental health, according to a CNBC survey fielded in January. And roughly 7% of borrowers have contemplated suicide at some point due to student loan debt. For Tranby, some debt forgiveness would provide her the opportunity to spend that money on other things like saving for retirement. During the pandemic, she's taken advantage of the federal student loan pause to start investing in her 401(k) for the first time. “​​I'm only at $3,000, but it's better than what I was at before—which was nothing,” she says. “I'm fully aware that I am not in the worst position possible—there are people out there who struggle more than I do. I'm not trying to complain or say: ‘Oh, woe is me,’” Tranby says. “But I want people to understand that we're working hard, we're doing everything we can do—and it's still a challenge. That’s why we need to reevaluate student loans and the structure of paying for education.” Tranby, who was raised by a young, single mother, always knew paying for college would be difficult. But thanks to her grades, she was able to secure scholarship money that paid for about 75% of her tuition. Her original plan was to work and take out a small amount of student loans—about $25,000 over the course of four years—to cover the remaining costs. Tranby worked full-time as a server on nights and weekends, which paid for her non-tuition expenses. The plan went out the window when the Minnesota-based University of St. Thomas substantially increased tuition right before the start of Tranby's junior year, she says. She was left scrambling to find the money to cover the higher costs since transferring at that point would have meant delaying her graduation. She applied for more scholarships and even entered a business idea competition—and won, but it wasn’t enough to cover her increased expenses. Ultimately, her mother had to take out a $35,000 Parent Plus loan, which Tranby promised to pay. The increased cost of tuition doubled her debt load at the end of her four years, she says. Tranby's story is not unique—about 46 million Americans have outstanding student loan debt, with borrowers between the ages of 30 and 39 carrying the highest balances. Most borrowers have between $25,000 and $50,000 in student loans, making Tranby’s debt load slightly higher than average. The additional debt changed her career trajectory. “I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I went to college for it, but it was too scary. You can't take those risks when you're starting off in so much debt already.” Instead, after graduation she moved to San Francisco and took a job in marketing for two years. But once her $500-a-month student loan payments kicked in, she couldn’t make the budget work long-term. So she ended up moving back to Minnesota. Student loan debt may have put her dream career on hold, but unlike many millennials, it didn’t stop Tranby from buying a home. And then another and another. After a bumpy childhood—Tranby says she moved more than 10 times and never had stable housing—her ultimate goal was to buy her own home. She did that at just 21 and still in college. Her first townhouse cost her nearly $75,000, but it was a smart investment. While she was in California, she was able to rent out the property to cover the mortgage payments. And after making some renovations, she sold it four years later for about $101,500, netting a profit of roughly $25,000. After the success with the townhouse, she was hooked, and she bought her second property for about $234,900 at age 28. Again, Tranby fixed it up, adding a bathroom and legal bedroom—eventually selling it for a $44,100 profit last year. That sale, coupled with the student loan payment pause, gave her breathing room to pay off the roughly $20,000 in credit card debt that Tranby racked up in her 20s because of medical bills and homeownership costs. She was also able to use a portion of those profits for a down payment on another home she and her fiancé purchased in late 2021. Some might argue that she would have been smarter paying off her loans rather than buying homes. But Tranby disagrees: Investing in a place to live made more sense to her. “I was still paying my student loans—and I didn't see a value in putting extra toward them because they didn't provide me anything. I needed a home, I needed a place to live,” Tranby says, adding that a mortgage was actually more cost-effective than paying rent in her area. “I purchased a home so I had a place to live. Then I just happened to put in sweat equity and made a little bit of profit to be able to buy new homes.” Secure in their new home, Tranby and her fiancé are taking their finances one step at a time these days. And that includes monitoring what will happen when the student loan payments restart and whether forgiveness will really materialize. As of April, U.S. student loan borrowers collectively owe about $1.75 trillion in outstanding federal and private student loans. If the Biden administration forgives $10,000 per borrower, about 11.8 million of the roughly 46 million total current borrowers would have their entire balance wiped out, according to a recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Yet a lot of the details of this potential forgiveness program—like who qualifies—are still up in the air. The New York Fed found that limiting forgiveness to those making less than $75,000 created a targeted approach that was much more likely to benefit borrowers who are struggling with repayment. Opponents of forgiveness are concerned about the price tag. The NY Fed estimates that knocking out $10,000 in student loan debt for every current borrower would cost about $321 billion. Implementing an income cap between $125,000 and $150,000 for individuals would reduce the overall cost, but that type of policy move would still cost at least $230 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The latest reports have Biden considering extending $10,000 in forgiveness to individuals earning up to $125,000. Since Tranby makes less than six figures, she isn’t concerned that an income cap would cut her out of the plan, but she is worried Parent Plus loans may not be covered. If student loan forgiveness does happen though, Tranby says there’s no denying it would be helpful in lowering her monthly expenses—which could help a lot considering inflation has reached a 40-year high. And it might also allow her to stretch her budget enough that she and her fiancé could afford to have a kid. “We do fine together but again, that's because we don't have kids,” she says. “I hear all my friends and coworkers talking about how it's $1,200 a month for day care. I don't have an extra $1,200 in my budget. I don't know how people do it.” But even if forgiveness doesn’t become a reality, Tranby says there are other reforms policymakers can enact that would also help, such as dropping all student loan interest rates to 0% permanently. She doesn't think the conversation shouldn’t stop at forgiveness. “If this isn't realistic to forgive it completely, then why don't we propose adjusting interest or eliminating interest?” Tranby asks. Since the pause was put in place, borrowers are saving $1.5 billion per month not paying interest, according to a recent calculation. While loan forgiveness might offer more immediate relief to the millions of borrowers like Tranby who have seen their debt load balloon despite years of steady repayment, at least with a 0% interest rate her entire monthly payment would be going toward her principal. Perhaps, she'd even be able to pay off the balance once and for all before her 20th college reunion.

5/8/2022,"By Blake Brittain (Reuters) - A Delaware jury on Friday ordered Illumina Inc to pay more than $333 million to a U.S. unit of Chinese genomics company BGI Group after finding that Illumina's DNA-sequencing systems infringed two patents. The jury also said Illumina infringed the patents willfully, and that three patents it had accused BGI's Complete Genomics unit of infringing were invalid. BGI and Illumina are both major providers of genome-analysis technology used to detect genetic diseases. The companies have been embroiled in a global legal battle over their respective sequencing technologies, with court cases in countries including Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and Turkey. Illumina's stock was down more than 14% Friday following the verdict. Illumina previously won $8 million from BGI in a jury verdict in San Francisco and a ban on U.S. sales of some BGI products. In the Delaware case, San Jose, California-based Complete Genomics Inc, a BGI subsidiary, had challenged Illumina's ""two-channel"" sequencing systems and kits to prepare DNA fragments for sequencing of violating its patent rights. An Illumina spokesperson said the company plans to appeal and that the verdict should not affect its ability to supply its customers. An attorney for Complete Genomics said the company was pleased with the award, which the judge could multiply based the jury's finding of willful infringement. Illumina also said Friday in a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission that it may have to pay interest and an ongoing royalty until the patents expire in 2029 if it loses on appeal.

5/8/2022,"The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners in OPEC+ led by Russia decided this week they would not increase their target production figure for next month. Effectively, OPEC+ slapped the EU in the face, as this decision means no additional oil is coming to Europe to replace sanctioned Russian barrels. The European Commission earlier this week proposed an oil embargo on Russian crude oil and refined products as part of the sixth sanction package being discussed by the EU. The crude oil embargo, EC President Ursual von der Leyen said, would come into effect after six months and the refined product embargo would come into effect at the end of this year. The European Union imports some 3.5 million barrels of crude oil and refined products from Russia. That’s about half of Russia’s total oil and product exports and about a quarter of the EU’s oil imports. The six-month period is supposed to help EU members find alternative suppliers. However, these are few and far between, and they have no plans to boost production to help the EU. According to a Reuters report on Thursday’s OPEC meeting citing two sources, the delegates “completely avoided any discussion about sanctions on Russia, wrapping up talks in near record time of just under 15 minutes”. The report went on to quote the head of commodities at Investec, Callum Macpherson, as saying that ""OPEC+ continues to view this as a problem of the West’s own making and not a fundamental supply issue that it should respond to."" Related: Oil Product Tankers Outperform Crude Tankers
 In March, OPEC’s secretary-general, Mohammed Barkindo, warned that there is no spare capacity in the world to compensate for a hypothetical full embargo on Russian oil exports, which amount to some 7 million bpd in crude and refined products. “This is about how we survive this crisis. There is no capacity in the world in the moment that can replace 7 million barrels of exports,” Barkindo said at CERAWeek in March and this week repeated his remarks ahead of the OPEC+ meeting. There is, however, enough capacity to replace Russia’s exports to the European Union, within OPEC itself. According to Rystad Energy estimates cited by Reuters, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Iraq together have spare production capacity of some 4 million bpd. ""Most of these countries have vast onshore storage capabilities that can be tapped, meaning that a few million barrels could be nominated for exports in weeks, if not days,"" said Louise Dickson, an analyst with the Norwegian energy consultancy. This is good news for the European Union, as far as supply goes. As far as prices go, it will be an entirely different matter. Because the EU must be aware that it’s not about securing alternative supplies but about doing it at relatively affordable prices. Yet in this situation, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE have no motivation to make discounts. On the contrary, they have motivation to do what they are doing – sticking to modest increases in production and enjoying the climb of oil prices as market movements defy, for the moment, the saying that the cure for high oil prices is high oil prices. While they might refuse to discuss it, the EU sanction drive against Russia has proved to be a boon for OPEC producers. It has done wonders for oil—and gas—prices, especially with many OPEC producers technically unable to boost their production, providing additional support to benchmarks and boosting producers’ profits. The likelihood of things changing over the next six months—assuming the EU votes for the embargo—is doubtful, based on OPEC’s reactions to pleas from the UK and the U.S. for more oil from before the war in the Ukraine. Speaking of the U.S., its ability to fill the oil gap in Europe is also doubtful. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil output in the country this year will only grow by 800,000 bpd. Perhaps the U.S. could reach into its reserves to send some crude to its European allies but it already announced the release of 180 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve in order to reduce local retail fuel prices. Reports that oil from last year’s release from the SPR have won the federal government zero favors with voters, so it might be more careful this time. In fact, it is being careful—the White House said it planned to buy back 60 million barrels to replenish the SPR over the next few years. The EU wants to give itself six months to find alternative suppliers of crude oil before halting the intake of Russian barrels. That these are also six months Russia can use to redirect more of its oil east is not something Brussels likes to talk about, but that’s beside the point. Without OPEC on its side, the EU might have to give its citizens the bad news that petrol, diesel and everything that gets transported with internal combustion engine vehicles is going to remain expensive for longer than one might have hoped.

5/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Big Oil is raking in historic amounts of cash, but the windfall isn’t being invested in new production to help displace Russian oil and gas. Instead, executives are rewarding shareholders -- setting the world up for an even tighter energy market in the years ahead. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk’s Fixer Is Quietly Tending the World’s Biggest Fortune Russia Can’t Shake Default Risk After Last-Minute Bond Payment To Save Democracy and Defeat Putin, Give Up ‘the West’ Heirs of Hitler’s Billionaires Need to Reckon With the Past Brutal Stock Selloff Is a Multitude of Bear Cases Coming True The West’s five biggest oil companies together earned $36.6 billion over and above their spending in the first quarter, or about $400 million in spare cash a day. It was the second-highest quarterly free cash flow on record and enough to relegate billions of dollars of Russia-related writedowns to mere footnotes in their recent earnings reports. Oil booms typically spark a chase for higher production -- but not this time. All five supermajors have kept their capital expenditure budgets firmly in check and pledged that this discipline will hold in future years -- even as oil prices have closed above $100 a barrel on all but five days since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. With wells naturally declining in production every year and large projects taking half a decade or more to come online, any expansion lag happening now will push the possibility of new production even further into the future. “In prior cycles of high oil prices, the majors would be investing heavily in long-cycle deepwater projects that wouldn’t see production for many years,” said Noah Barrett, lead energy analyst at Janus Henderson, which manages $361 billion. “Those type of projects are just off the table right now.” In short, if consumers are looking for Big Oil to replace Russian production with any urgency, they better look elsewhere. The last time crude was consistently over $100 a barrel in 2013, Big Oil’s combined capital expenditure was $158.7 billion, almost double what the companies are currently spending, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The group includes Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE, BP Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. “Discipline is the order of the day,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told analysts Tuesday. The London-based major isn’t budging on its $14 billion to $15 billion spending plans for the year, with its mid-term guidance creeping up to a maximum of $16 billion despite 10% cost inflation in some parts of its business. Shell, which posted record profits that exceeded even the highest analyst estimate, was equally clear. In her first set of results as chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman repeated time and time again that Shell would keep within its $23 billion to $27 billion range. “Nothing has changed in terms of our capital allocation framework,” she said. Instead of spending on new projects, companies are opting to reward shareholders after years of poor returns. Exxon, BP and TotalEnergies increased share buybacks while Chevron is already repurchasing record amounts of stock. There are clear reasons why Big Oil is choosing not to spend more. Chief among them are climate concerns and uncertainty over the future direction of oil demand. Years of pressure from investors, politicians and climate activists came to a head in the past two years, when all the oil majors pledged some form of net zero target by mid-century. BP and Shell actively positioned themselves to move away from oil and gas over the long-term. All are under added pressure to improve returns that dwindled over the past decade due to cost blowouts and low prices. “Any decision to increase, support or add-in new fossil projects today could see returns risk within a few years,” said Banco Santander SA analyst Jason Kenney. Climate change, technology developments like electric cars and rapidly evolving government policy on emissions are major risks today when deciding whether to invest billions in a new project, he said. Against that backdrop, investment in the upstream oil and gas sector slumped 30% in 2020, while last year’s spend of $341 billion was 23% below pre-pandemic levels, the International Energy Forum wrote in a report. “Two years in a row of large and abrupt underinvestment in oil and gas development is a recipe for higher prices and volatility later this decade,” warned Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the IEF. That message has not gone down well with consumers around the globe. From Pakistan to Paris, billions of people are suffering a cost-of-living crisis fueled in large part by high energy costs. In the U.S., President Joe Biden has implored oil companies to reinvest profits from surging oil prices into more production to help ease the shortages caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine. Some U.S. and European politicians have called for a windfall tax on companies’ profits to help ease the burden on consumers. To be fair, that doesn’t mean companies aren’t investing in growth at all. But they will “focus only on low risk, high return assets” such as shale or expanding offshore fields near existing operations, according to Kenney. Exxon and Chevron, for instance, are spending aggressively to grow production in the U.S.’s Permian Basin, the world largest shale oil region, with planned growth rates of 25% and 15%, respectively. BP is boosting investment in U.S. shale, but the company won’t be able to ramp up Permian production until it finishes building two large gathering systems at the end of the year. However, most Permian growth will largely offset declines from elsewhere in the U.S. supermajors’ global portfolio, rather than adding to total barrels. Exxon’s first quarter production of 3.7 million barrels per day was the lowest since its merger with Mobil in the late 1990s. Together Exxon and Chevron plan to spend more on buybacks and dividends this year than they do on production. “For so long the industry has been told by investors and politicians we need less oil and executives remember that,” said Barrett of Janus Henderson. “If the world needs an extra million barrels a day to ease prices, I’m not sure where it will come from.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Formula One Finally Found a Way to Get Americans to Care U.S. Steel Bets on a New Technology—and the South—to Survive Putting an End to Heart Attacks by Editing Human DNA Stock Market Bottom-Fishers Are Trawling Risky Waters Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•yesterday,"Big Oil Spends on Investors, Not Output, Prolonging Crude Crunch",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-spends-investors-not-073000711.html
5/8/2022,"News of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk acquiring social media platform Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) has been one of the biggest topics of the investing world in 2022. Musk offered to buy Twitter shares for $54.20 each, yet shares have been trading around the $49 level. Benzinga spoke recently with Julian Klymochko, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Accelerate, a company offering ETFs and alternative investments. Klymochko has a history of analyzing mergers and often invests in the arbitrage opportunity of deals, or the amount that can be made if the deal closes. Klymochko recently estimated that he has invested in/analyzed over 2,500 mergers over the last 15 years. Twitter Premium: Musk offered to buy Twitter shares for $54.20 and shares are trading below the price. Here’s what Klymochko had to say of the difference. “Musk’s $44 billion leveraged buyout of Twitter is the largest LBO of all time (by a longshot). The financing package includes an exceptional amount of leverage, including $25.5 billion debt and margin loan commitments,” Klymochko told Benzinga. Klymochko said the market is pricing in around 70% odds of success of the deal closing. Klymochko points to the risks of the deal being credit markets falling or the price of Tesla shares dropping, with the margin loan reliant on the share value of Tesla. “Musk agreed to put up a $21 billion equity check. This is an astronomical amount of cash, even for the world’s wealthiest person. He has been divesting TSLA stock in addition to seeking partners to help fund this commitment.” Musk recently announced a filing with new investors in the buyout that included Larry Ellison, Binance, a16z and others. Related Link: Why Is Twitter's Share Price So Far From Musk's Takeover Price Can Elon Musk Walk From Deal?: One popular topic put forth on social media is if Musk can decide to walk away from the planned acquisition. “Musk signed a definitive agreement, which is a legally binding agreement, to acquire Twitter for $54.20 per share. He cannot walk away from the deal,” Klymochko said. If Musk backs out from the deal, Klymochko said Twitter could sue and push for a court decision to force him to close the deal. If Musk is unable to obtain the proper financing, he would have to pay a $1 billion reverse break fee. A judge could award monetary damages in excess of the $1 billion break fee, depending on several scenarios, Klymochko added. “Other things that could cause the merger agreement to terminate include shareholders voting against it (unlikely) and regulators blocking it (also unlikely).” Twitter Deal Summary: The previous record for a leveraged buyout was KKR & Co (NYSE: KKR) and TPG Inc (NASDAQ: TPG) acquiring energy company TXU for $12 billion. TXU went bankrupt after the leveraged buyout. The deal terms of the Twitter acquisition provide some risk with the financing methods and tie-in of Tesla shares. Klymochko estimated that if the deal to acquire Twitter falls through, shares of the social media platform could fall to the mid-$30s.

5/8/2022,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks' tumble this year is putting an increased focus on equity valuations, as investors assess whether recently discounted shares are worth buying in the face of a hawkish Federal Reserve and widespread geopolitical uncertainty. With the benchmark S&P 500 index down 13.5% year-to-date, valuations stand at their lowest levels in two years, putting the index's forward price-to-earnings ratio at 17.9 times from 21.7 at the end of 2021, according to the latest data from Refinitiv Datastream. Although many investors tended to brush off elevated valuations during the market's dynamic surge from its post-COVID-19 lows, they have been quick to punish companies viewed as overvalued this year, as the Fed rolls back easy money policies that had kept bond yields low and buoyed equities. While recently discounted valuations may boost stocks' appeal to some bargain hunters, other investors believe equities may not be cheap enough, as the Fed signals it is ready to aggressively tighten monetary policy to fight inflation, bond yields surge, and geopolitical risks such as the war in Ukraine continue roiling markets. ""Stocks are getting close to fair valuation ... but they're not quite there yet,"" said J. Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. ""If you take into account bond yields, inflation, what is going on with GDP and the broader economy, they're not quite there yet."" Wild swings shook markets in the past week after the Fed delivered a widely expected 50 basis point rate increase and signaled similar moves for the meetings ahead as it tries to quell the highest annual inflation rates in 40 years. The index has declined for five straight weeks, its longest losing streak since mid-2011. More volatility could be in store if next week's monthly consumer price index reading exceeds expectations, potentially bolstering the case for even more aggressive monetary policy tightening from the Fed. ""There has ... been a healthy reset in valuations and sentiment,"" wrote Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, in a recent note to clients. ""For stocks to move higher on a sustainable basis, investors will likely need to have greater confidence in the Fed's ability to tame inflation without unduly hurting the economy."" Though valuations have come down, S&P 500's forward P/E stands above its long-term average of 15.5 times earnings estimates. Graphic- U.S. stock market valuations: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/znpnemgxyvl/chart.png Potentially burnishing stocks' appeal, S&P 500 companies are expected to increase earnings by about 9% this year, according to Refinitiv data, as they wrap up a better-than-expected first-quarter reporting season. One likely factor is whether Treasuries extend a sell-off that has lifted the benchmark 10-year note yield, which moves inversely to prices, to its highest since late 2018. Higher yields in particular dull the allure of technology and other high-growth sectors, as their cash flows are often more weighted in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates. The forward P/E for the S&P 500 technology sector has declined from 28.5 times to 21.4 so far this year, according to Refinitiv Datastream data as of Friday morning. ""In terms of growth valuations, they have been hit the hardest and likely the most oversold,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. But the sector continues to trade at a nearly 20% premium to the overall S&P 500, above the 15% premium it has averaged over the broader index over the past five years. If the 10-year yield hovers between 3% to 3.5%, after being a ""fraction"" of that level for a long period, ""that is going to continue to be a weight on the P/E and therefore the discounting mechanism for the growth and technology space,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, which favors value over growth shares. ""To a large extent, (the pressure from higher yields) has been baked in,"" Lynch said. ""But I don't think it is going to go away. I think it is going to persist.""

5/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The relentless bear market in U.S. Treasury debt is on the cusp of a new phase, with yields across much of the maturity spectrum on course to crack above their 2018 highs and several major potential catalysts to help such a move. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk’s Fixer Is Quietly Tending the World’s Biggest Fortune Russia Can’t Shake Default Risk After Last-Minute Bond Payment To Save Democracy and Defeat Putin, Give Up ‘the West’ Heirs of Hitler’s Billionaires Need to Reckon With the Past Brutal Stock Selloff Is a Multitude of Bear Cases Coming True Center stage will be April consumer price inflation on Wednesday, forecast to ebb from March rates that were the highest since 1982. Federal Reserve officials, who raised rates by a half point this week and set a June 1 date to begin reducing holdings of Treasuries, will be out in force discussing their approach to inflation. Meanwhile, the Treasury’s biggest month of debt sales for the May-to-July financing quarter kicks off with auctions of 3-, 10- and 30-year debt. Even if none of those provides a logical impetus for higher yields, liquidity has deteriorated, making the Treasury market more susceptible to big shifts. Bloomberg’s US Government Securities Liquidity Index, which measures the average yield error for notes and bonds maturing in at least a year, approached its highest level of the year Friday. The two-year yield’s range exceeded 25 basis points for the third time this year on the day of the Fed meeting. “This is a once-in-decade moment in capital markets,” said James Camp, director of fixed-income at Eagle Asset Management. Correlations are rising and “cross-asset volatility is incredible. We have nowhere to hide.” A weekly survey of Treasury investors by JPMorgan Chase & Co. this week found a historically high level of risk-avoidance; neutral positioning was at its highest level since March 2020. The surge in yields was led by real, or inflation-protected, notes and bonds, an indication that tightening financial conditions rather than inflation expectations were the primary driver. It accompanied steep declines for U.S. equities that sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the lowest level in nearly a year. For shorter-maturity Treasuries like two- and five-year notes, exceeding the 2018 highs would mean returning to levels last seen before the 2008 financial crisis. For the benchmark 10-year, its 2018 peak of 3.25% was the highest level since 2011. The two-year yield this week peaked at 2.85%, within 26 basis points of its 2018 high. The five-year reached 3.08%, two basis points from 2018 levels. The 10-year yield’s 19-basis-point increase to 3.13% was overshadowed, though, by the 27-basis-point increase in the 10-year inflation-protected yield, from just below 0% a week earlier. The real yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities have climbed as the Fed’s posture has bolstered confidence that rates in consumer price growth have peaked. Five-year TIPS yields rose more than 150 basis points in 40 trading days through May 3, the fastest pace since 2008. The April CPI report is expected to show an overall decline in the annual pace of inflation to 8.1% from 8.5% in March. For core prices, which exclude food and energy, a drop to 6% from 6.5% is forecast. Fed policy makers, in their statement announcing this week’s rate move -- the first half-point increase since 2000 -- said they were “highly attentive to inflation risks.” And while short-term interest-rate markets are priced for the policy rate to rise to 3.25% next year from the current range of 0.75% to 1%, it’s not clear how their course may be influenced by the lagged effects of tightening on the economy. Already, U.S. fixed 30-year mortgage rates have climbed to 5.27%, their highest point since 2009. The latest phase of the selloff steepened the Treasury yield curve as long-dated rates rose the most -- the two-year to 10-year spread widened by more than 17 basis points and reached the steepest level since early March. The increase in term premium -- compensation for the risk of bad outcomes over longer period of time -- reflects deep uncertainty about the path of inflation and the Fed’s policy response, Roberto Perli and Benson Durham at Piper Sandler said. Next week’s auctions may prolong the trend, as the market tends to seek high coupon rates for new auctions. Both the 10-year and the 30-year are poised to garner at least 3% coupons, the first ones since 2019. The rise in long-dated Treasury yields above 3% “makes them look attractive, but they can look a lot more attractive from here,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Investors want to be compensated for owning long-dated bonds in a world where the Fed can’t really address the inflation problem with their blunt policy tools.” What to Watch Economic calendar: May 9: Wholesale inventories May 10: NFIB small business optimism May 11: CPI, MBA mortgage applications May 12: PPI, Weekly jobless claims May 13: Import and export price index, U. of Mich sentiment Fed calendar: May 10: New York Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic May 11: Bostic May 12: San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly May 13: Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Mester Auction calendar: May 9: 13- and 26-week bills May 10: 3-year notes May 11: 10-year notes May 10: 4-and 8-week bills, 30-year bonds Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Formula One Finally Found a Way to Get Americans to Care U.S. Steel Bets on a New Technology—and the South—to Survive Putting an End to Heart Attacks by Editing Human DNA Stock Market Bottom-Fishers Are Trawling Risky Waters Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•12 hours ago,Plenty of Catalysts to Help Push Treasury Rates Above 2018 Highs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plenty-catalysts-help-push-treasury-200000775.html

5/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investment-grade issuers may sell bonds at a faster pace next week after market volatility had pushed many borrowers to the sidelines over the past month. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk’s Fixer Is Quietly Tending the World’s Biggest Fortune Russia Can’t Shake Default Risk After Last-Minute Bond Payment To Save Democracy and Defeat Putin, Give Up ‘the West’ Heirs of Hitler’s Billionaires Need to Reckon With the Past Brutal Stock Selloff Is a Multitude of Bear Cases Coming True Estimates for next week’s U.S. high-grade bond sales call for $25 billion to $40 billion. That’s well ahead of this week’s sales, which fell shy of consensus for the second week in a row because of wild swings in risk-asset prices. Considering the pent-up supply after issuers stood down, and the fact that most syndicate desks were anticipating $125 billion to $150 billion of fresh debt in May, it’s likely many will try to come back to market in the next possible window. Borrowing costs are expected to keep rising, giving companies incentive to knock out funding plans while they can. Fear is mounting in credit markets, as worries about slowing economic growth and faster inflation send risk measures to levels not seen since the coronavirus pandemic first roiled investors. Barclays Plc revised its investment-grade spread forecast wider to 145 to 150 basis points by the end of the year, compared with its previous forecast of 95 to 100 basis points, due to the growing worries. Corporate bond yields are just a few percentage points away from pandemic peak highs, and could even reach those next week. In the near term, the market will continue to react to big swings in stocks and U.S. Treasuries. The April consumer product index report, due May 11, may be another catalyst for markets. Junk Under Pressure Some borrowers in the U.S. leveraged-loan market started to feel the heat from the volatility upending other markets Thursday and Friday after demand in the primary loan market started to fizzle following the Federal Reserve’s biggest rate increase in two decades. Still, issuers see an opportunity to take out the debt as demand in the primary market has remained steady throughout April, though subdued compared to last year, and loan prices stood far more resilient compared to fixed-rate corporate bonds. Those prices dipped only slightly after the Fed’s rate hike, supported still from their floating-rate structure that offers investors more protection when rates rise. There are eight deals in syndication due next week, including a $1.6 billion debt deal for the acquisition of cybersecurity company Barracuda Networks by KKR & Co. from Thoma Bravo LLC. U.S. junk bonds were headed for the fifth straight week of losses as yields rise to a two-year high of 7.14% after credit risk jumped the most in two years. Supply has shrunk to the lowest in more than a decade, with year-to-date bond sales at just $54.1 billion, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The U.S. junk bond index posted losses of 0.36% on Thursday and the month-to-date losses stood at 0.54%. There are no deals in the pipeline for next week. But for savvy secondary-market junk investors, there are still some deals that can be found and investors may start looking to come back. With yields now above 7%, the market is becoming more attractive and it’s time “to deploy some capital in high yield,” Bank of America Corp. said in a report Friday. Investors should, however, be aware that more widening is likely to still come, strategist Oleg Melentyev said in the note. In distressed debt, TPC Group Inc., which began talks about pre-packaged bankruptcy and failed to pay interest on secured notes earlier this year, reports earnings next week.

5/8/2022,"(Adds details on move) By Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund said on Friday that it plans to vote for Kohl's board directors, backing management in a hotly contested corporate battle with hedge fund Macellum Advisors. Norges Bank Investment Management detailed its intentions in a table on its website. It plans to vote for the 13 nominees presented by the retailer and does not intend to vote for any of the 10 director candidates nominated by activist investment firm Macellum Advisor. Investors will be able to vote at the May 11 meeting. Norges owned 1.49 million shares or 1.16% of the company at the end of December, according to Refinitiv data. Norway's announcement comes on the heels of a similar announcement last month when T. Rowe Price Associates, one of the biggest investors in Kohl's Corp, said it plans to back all of the department store's directors. Macellum, led by Jonathan Duskin, has accused Kohl's of not doing enough to improve its business. The fund called for the company to put itself up for sale, which it is now doing by reviewing potential bidders. The battle for control of Kohl's boardroom has become one of this year's most contentious proxy battles and occurs as the company is reviewing bids from potential buyers.
