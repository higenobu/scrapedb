5/6/2022,"Cuba’s leaders arrived on the spectacular beach at Varadero this week in an effort to restart a tourism industry whose pandemic-induced devastation was all too apparent in the swaths of empty loungers on the miles of perfect sand. So crucial is tourism to Cuba’s economy – and therefore its stability – that President Miguel Díaz-Canel, the prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, and at least seven further ministers attended the launch of FITCuba, its annual tourism fair. Marrero Cruz highlighted the island’s safety and its success in combating Covid, before praising an aggressive, if controversial, hotel building programme. He quoted Fidel Castro as saying: “Each hotel that is opened is a factory that produces an income for the country.” Yet Cuba’s recovery faces tough obstacles, and there are signs it is not keeping up with its competitors. “Europe is booming,” said one hotelier who asked not to be named. “And the word is that the Dominican Republic and Mexico are both doing well.” Last year, with its main market Canada closed, Cuba pinned its hopes on Russians, who made up 40% of all visitors in 2021. Then came the war in Ukraine. Flights stopped almost overnight and 8,000 Russian holidaymakers (and several hundred Ukrainians) desperately tried to get home. Juan Carlos García Granda, the minister of tourism, also blamed “the other pandemic, the one that has lasted over six decades … the cruel US blockade”. While this is a common government complaint, there is evidence to support his contention that it had “recently been stepped up”. Expatriate WhatsApp groups have lit up over the last two weeks with complaints that travellers flying from Havana to American cities are suddenly having their ESTAs permanently rescinded, the visa waiver that allows citizens of almost 40 prosperous countries to enter the US easily. The US embassy would not confirm a new policy and referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which failed to return calls, but airline staff with American Airlines and JetBlue say it is now a regular occurrence. Cuba’s communist-led government remains wedded to its all-inclusive beach hotels as means of channeling a visitor’s entire spending through state coffers, despite preceding the fair with a conference on sustainable tourism. They own the properties and foreign management companies run the businesses. On Wednesday, Blue Diamond, the Canadian owners of the Royalton and Memories brands, announced a vast project to take over the management of the whole of a southern island, Cayo Largo, a total of four hotels and eight “villages” totalling 1,348 rooms. They will also manage the beach restaurants and even the shops. Cayo Largo used to be a tourist destination, but the airport fell into disrepair. Now it has been renovated to allow airliners direct access from Canada, Italy and Germany. “That’s the only way of guaranteeing occupation,” said Miguel García Núñez, Blue Diamond’s promotion manager. New hotels have also gone up in the cities. According to senior managers at Iberostar, the Spanish hotel chain, there is an increasing interest in holidays that take in both the beach and Cuba’s iconic cities such as Havana, Trinidad and Santiago. “The old clients came to Cuba from Canada for sun and beach, but the millennials want to explore Cuba,” said Alexei Torres Velázquez, Iberostar’s head of marketing. Yet only 2% of all the official hotel rooms on the island are not on the beach or in the cities, and many of Cuba’s greatest assets – including the extraordinary interior of the 777-mile-long island – remain unexploited. Trips outside the all-inclusive bubbles also have a new danger. Cuba is struggling with soaring inflation that has seen a currency black market establish itself, with private restaurants charging at the equivalent of 100 pesos to the dollar, compared with an official government rate of 24 to one. “We arrived with just £100 in cash,” said British visitor Max Radford, who visited in January to celebrate his engagement to girlfriend Ali. “When we went to an ATM we realised our trip was impossible at the government exchange rate. A small bottle of beer [in a private restaurant] cost the equivalent of £10 and a 20-minute taxi ride £150.” Tourists who bring cash now have to exchange with hustlers on the street to get good rates. In his speech opening the fair, tourism minister García Granda talked about reducing the reliance on cash, and creating a card with which tourists can pay for services. For the government, the stakes could not be higher. One of the final countries in the world wedded to central planning, it buys the food, oil and other essentials that need to be imported. To pay it needs foreign currency and at its height tourism made up 40% of the Cuban economy. Foreign businesses now regularly complain that their bills are not being paid. Still, there was optimism at the well-attended fair. Johnny Considine, owner of Cuba Private Travel, believes changes are under way. “I have noticed people getting import licences a lot faster, so that they can get access to good food and drinks. And yesterday they announced that a Venezuelan airline will do flights from Havana to Santiago [Cuba’s second city and a 12-hour drive]. So things are happening. “It’s just quite slow.”",News/World news,Can Cuba’s tourism adapt to survive after Covid devastated the industry?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/cuba-tourism-recovery-pandemic
5/6/2022,"Morrisons has put forward a last-minute rescue deal for the McColl’s convenience store chain that could protect 16,000 jobs. The supermarket chain is understood to have offered to take on the ailing business as a going concern, assuming its debts, which amount to about £100m, and taking responsibility for its pension scheme. The deal was put forward late last night after McColl’s, which has more than 1,100 small shops around the UK, including about 250 Morrisons Daily outlets and a number of Martin’s, warned it was “increasingly likely” to call in administrators. McColl’s has been in talks with its lenders, the Morrisons supermarket group and other parties, thought to include the Issa Brothers who own Asda and the EG petrol station group, since November, after being hit by supply difficulties and poor sales. McColl’s traces its roots back to 1901 when a Scottish footballer, Robert Smyth McColl, opened the first RS McColl in Glasgow. The modern business began in 1973 as a vending machine operator and went on to buy several convenience store chains before focusing solely on retail in 2000.",News/Business,"Morrisons in last-minute attempt to rescue McColl’s and 16,000 jobs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/morrisons-in-last-minute-attempt-to-rescue-mccolls-and-16000-jobs
5/6/2022,"The Greens have hailed what the party has described as “phenomenal” local election results across England, with 28 gains made in early counts in areas including South Tyneside, Cumberland, Oxford and Worcester. Following the pattern of recent local elections, in which the party has both won more seats and extended the geographical spread of its representation, by Friday morning the party had secured 39 wins, 11 holds and 28 gains. Illustrating again how they are competing in areas that would not have been seen as strongholds only a few years ago, the Greens made three gains on South Tyneside council, taking two seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives. The party now has six seats, making it the second-largest on the council, albeit well behind still-dominant Labour. In Oxford, the Greens’ four victories included three gains, one of which unseated a long-standing and senior Labour councillor, Colin Cook, who was formerly lord mayor of the city. In Worcester, a Green gain helped push the council from being Conservative-run into no overall control, a result the Tory leader, Marc Bayliss, said was a “bad night” for his party, something he argued was caused in part by voter concern at lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street. The Greens also gained their first councillor in Plymouth, and took two seats in the elections for the newly created Cumberland council. These early results on Friday were for England, with Wales and Scotland – in the latter, the Greens are a separate organisation – yet to be declared. Adrian Ramsay, the Greens’ co-leader, who took over the role with Carla Denyer in October last year, said the expectation was that further gains would come. He said: “The phenomenal results for the Green party so far demonstrate that people up and down the country are looking for a credible alternative to the establishment parties, and finding it in us. “Whether that’s former Conservative voters put off by poor handling of the Covid pandemic or the constant leadership lies, or former Labour voters who just see weak opposition at a national and local level. “Greens are putting forward the practical solutions to the cost of living crisis and the climate emergency that will make a difference to people’s lives, from insulating homes to bringing down energy bills and creating jobs, to providing additional financial support for those on the lowest incomes.” In last year’s local elections, the Greens made a net gain of 88 seats, while in 2019 – no local elections took place in 2020 due to Covid – the net gain was 198.",News/Politics,Greens celebrate ‘phenomenal’ gains in local elections across England,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/greens-local-election-results-2022-gains
5/6/2022,"In the period following the explosion begun by Marvel Comics in the 1960s and accelerated by the campy Batman TV series in the middle of the decade, Neal Adams, who has died aged 80 of complications from sepsis, was one of the greatest, and probably most influential, artists in comics. Adams was central to the rethinking of characters including Marvel’s X-Men and, for their rival DC Comics, the Spectre, Deadman and, most crucially, the Batman. He also brought about changes to business practices, most notably winning artists the right to their original artwork, and getting long-delayed credit and compensation in the 1980s for the Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. “He reinvented the look of comic pages and characters,” said the writer Neil Gaiman. “He was the reason I drew Batman in every school exercise book.” Adams combined the powerful dynamism and expressionist movement of early Marvel’s two masters, Jack Kirby (Fantastic Four, Captain America) and Steve Ditko (Spider Man, Doctor Strange). But his work, influenced by the limitations of four-panel daily comics and glossy ad work, also displayed the more romantic attractiveness usually offered by less dramatic artists. His characters could be as muscular as Frank Frazetta’s barbarians and as appealing as Alex Raymond’s daily strips, but they soared through the panels, every movement telling the story – he was always cinematically aware of the viewer’s place outside the page. Adams knew early he wanted to draw comics. He was born on Governors Island, New York, where his father, Frank, was stationed with the US army. He grew up on bases, including in Germany, but his father was not heavily involved in his upbringing. His mother, Liliane, worked in a shoe factory and for the national phone company, and ran a boarding house. When his father left, Neal worked on the Coney Island boardwalk, near their home, to help support his mother. He went to the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan, leaving in 1959, and then sent his work to DC, who rejected it. When he took it to Archie Comics, the editor Joe Simon (co-creator of Captain America) told him not to ruin his life in the business. Nevertheless, Adams drew sample pages for Archie’s nascent superhero, the Fly, and some of the work was used. He was hired, but to draw comic fillers for Archie’s Joke Book. After this, he assisted Howard Nostrand, mostly drawing backgrounds on his daily newspaper strip, Bat Masterson, then worked in advertising before getting his own strip in 1962: Ben Casey – like Masterson based on a successful TV series. It ran until 1966. Though daily strips tended to soap opera, Casey, about a hospital surgeon, touched on contemporary issues. In 1967 he began drawing stories for Creepy and Eerie, black-and-white magazines emulating the 1950s EC horror comics. When DC’s Joe Kubert began drawing the Tales of the Green Beret daily strip, Adams was hired to replace him on DC’s war comics, yet soon found himself working on Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope comics. But his spectacular cover for The Brave and the Bold featuring Batman and the Spectre led to more work on superheroes, including a remarkable sequence on Deadman. Deadman had been co-created by Carmine Infantino, who was now DC’s publisher. He called Adams his “sparkplug”. This may explain why Adams was one of the few people to freelance for DC and Marvel simultaneously. In 1969 he and the Marvel writer Roy Thomas tried to revive the failing X-Men book. Their run lasted only nine issues before cancellation, but they brought back Professor X, and when the series was revived in 1975 theirs was the template it followed. Adams, Thomas and the inker Tom Palmer brought The Avengers to new heights with the Kree-Skrull War series (1971-72). But his key partnership occurred back at DC, with the writer Dennis O’Neil, with whom he had also worked at Marvel. They “recaptured” the Batman from the TV series’ camp “Pow! Wham!” characterisation, creating more realism and more menace, and helping bring the DC line back to relevance. Their new characters, especially the Fu Manchu-like villain Ra’s Al Ghul, who first appeared in 1971, and his femme fatale daughter Talia, and their recreation of the Joker in 1973 as a psychopathic killer, set the bar for future reinterpretations. They also redid the awkward pairing of Green Lantern and Green Arrow with a story arc including the discovery that the Arrow’s sidekick, Speedy, had become a junkie. Besides having contemporary resonance, it was arguably the first comic storyline to examine the now-familiar paradox of the inability of superheroes to actually change the world. Dissatisfied with both the artistic and economic strictures of comic books, Adams and the DC artist and editor Dick Giordano formed their own studio, Continuity Associates, in 1978. His final story for DC was one of his favourites, Superman Vs Muhammad Ali (1978), with its famous cover containing dozens of celebrities (and colleagues) at ringside. His company moved in new directions, primarily providing storyboards for movies, but also into animation, game design, computer graphics and advertising. Adams could be a hard teacher, but he was also a supportive resource, whose wide respect in the field opened doors for newcomers. The artists gathered around Continuity Associates also packaged comics for the big companies; they were known as Crusty Bunkers. One of the most famous Bunkers, Denys Cowan, called Adams his “second dad”. Adams himself illustrated books and worked for some new independent publishers. For years he battled the big companies to establish copyright for artists; in 1987 he won a court decision that denied copyright but compelled the return of original art. Along with the golden age artist Jerry Robinson and the lawyer Ed Priess, he won Siegel, Shuster and their families recognition and royalties from DC just as the Superman franchise was becoming huge. In 2005, he returned to comics, later writing and drawing the miniseries Batman: Odyssey (2010) for DC and The First X-Men (2013) for Marvel. In 2008, Adams worked with the David S Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, Washington, lobbying the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum to return Dina Babbitt’s original artwork, drawn to illustrate Dr Josef Mengele’s racial theories in order to save herself and her daughter from the gas chambers. He illustrated, with Kubert, a six-page story about Babbitt, with a foreword by Stan Lee; two years later he illustrated and narrated a Disney series, They Spoke Out: American Voices Against the Holocaust. Adams is survived by his second wife, Marilyn, whom he married in 1987, and their son, Josh, and by his daughters, Kris and Zeea, and sons, Joel and Jason, from his first marriage, to Cory Adams, a comics colourist, which ended in divorce.

5/6/2022,"In cities across Russia on Monday morning, tanks and missile trucks will growl their way along the main streets. Soldiers will march across central squares. Fighter jets will roar overhead. Victory Day, when Russians celebrate the 1945 endpoint of what they still call the “great patriotic war”, has gradually become the centrepiece of Vladimir Putin’s concept of Russian identity over his two decades in charge. This year, as the Russian army’s gruesome assault on Ukraine grinds on, the day has particular resonance, with some expecting a dramatic announcement from Putin, either declaring victory in Ukraine or raising the stakes further. Across Russia, some families will quietly remember the ancestors who gave their lives in the fight against Nazism, or toast the few veterans still alive. Others will take a more bombastic approach in line with the official messaging, perhaps adding a papier maché turret to their child’s pushchair to make it look like a tank, or daubing “To Berlin” on their cars. A more sinister slogan that has gained popularity on Victory Day in recent years is “We can do it again”. According to Russian state messaging, this is exactly what Russia has been doing in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion on 24 February. Since the start, the Kremlin has used the language and imagery of the second world war to describe the attack on its neighbour. Putin, when launching the invasion, described one of its main goals as the “denazification” of the country. In mid-March, when he addressed a flag-waving crowd at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, banners promised a “world without fascism”. His soldiers often wear the orange-black St George’s ribbon, which has become the symbol both of the second world war victory and of the war in Ukraine. Many see this talk of “denazification” as pure propaganda. For sure, there have been other convincing explanations offered for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: a fear of Nato expansion, a post-imperial disdain for Ukrainian language and culture, and an isolated leader who spent the Covid pandemic in a bunker pondering his legacy. But the rhetoric of victory and of fighting Nazis, which has become gradually more twisted over the past two decades, also plays a role. Of course, it takes a particular mindset to look at Russia’s expansionist war, with the executions, targeting of civilians, filtration camps and harassment of dissidents at home, and come to the conclusion that it is the Ukrainians who are the Nazis. But already for some years, the victory cult has been referred to by critics as pobedobesie, a derogatory play on the Russian words for victory and obscurantism – “victorymania” is an approximate English translation. As this pobedobesie metastasised year on year, the phenomenon took on forms that were ever more grotesque: schools put on performances in which the children dressed up as Soviet soldiers; people posing as captured Nazis were paraded through the streets. Ever more opponents of modern Russia were branded as Nazis, neo-Nazis or Nazi accomplices. These days, almost any interview with a Russian official about current events will contain references to the second world war. The foreign ministry tweets about the conflict almost daily. Putin’s influential, hawkish confidant Nikolai Patrushev recently blamed the west for the rise of Hitler, and suggested today’s western world (and their Ukrainian “puppets”) are the true heirs to the Nazis. “You should not be fooled by Anglo-Saxon respectability. Even a sharply tailored suit cannot hide hatred, anger and inhumanity,” he raged. In modern Russian accounts of the Soviet war effort, inconvenient elements, such as the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1939 and subsequent carving-up of Europe, or the internal deportation of whole ethnic groups by Stalin’s regime during the war, are quietly ignored. The image of “Nazis” has also become increasingly blurred. Russian history textbooks talk little about Hitler’s politics, his rise to power, his antisemitism or the Holocaust. Instead, the main characteristic of “Nazis” is that they attacked the Soviet Union. By this logic, all those who threaten modern Russia are also Nazis. This process has evolved gradually during Putin’s long years in charge. In 2000, Victory Day came just two days after Putin’s inauguration as president for the first time. Addressing a group of veterans, Russia’s new leader explained the importance of the historical victory: “Through you, we got used to being winners. This entered our blood. It was not just responsible for military victories, but will also help our generation in peaceful times, help us to build a strong and flourishing country.” There was barely a family in Russia that did not have relatives who fought in the war, and the tremendous losses the Soviet Union suffered in the victory over Germany dwarf the losses of the other allies combined. But the legacy of the war victory and Putin’s talk of being “winners” was also a rare historical bright spot for a population that was traumatised by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the economic chaos of the 1990s. Of course, Russia is not the only country trapped in its narratives about the second world war. Britain has a prime minister currently making a transparent and largely unsuccessful effort to channel the spirit of Winston Churchill; the Polish government is working furiously to minimise instances of Polish complicity in the Holocaust. German reluctance to provide Ukraine with weapons has been widely credited to a sense of historical guilt over the country’s Nazi past, and in parts of Ukraine, many people have indeed been unwilling to examine the complicity of Ukrainian nationalists in crimes during the war years. But both the level of distortion and the pervasiveness of the discourse in Russia are unmatched anywhere else in modern Europe. Gradually, Victory Day has become less about remembering the past and more about projecting the might of Putin’s new Russia. In 2008, the Victory Day parade featured heavy weaponry for the first time since the Soviet collapse. Three months later, Russia invaded Georgia. The process was turbo-charged in 2014 when the Russia propaganda machine began to claim it was fighting actual Nazis in Ukraine, focusing on a minority of fighters who did have far-right views. The tragic deaths of 48 people, mainly pro-Russians, in a fire in Odesa in May 2014 was elevated by Russian television from a crime into a premeditated fascist massacre. When Sergei Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed puppet leader of Crimea, appeared on stage at a rally in Red Square just after the annexation of the peninsula, he wore the orange-black St George’s ribbon on his lapel, rather than the Russian tricolour. He spoke of saving the peninsula from massacres by hypothetical hordes of Ukrainian fascists. In the absence of other firm ideological underpinnings to the Putin regime, the victory in 1945 and its twin in 2014 became the regime’s raison d’être, with both events marked by the orange-black ribbons. Victory became Russia’s new religion. In a 2015 interview, the then culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, who is now head of the Russian delegation to the stalled peace negotiations with Ukraine, blasted historians who tried to use archival evidence to prove that certain Soviet war myths were embellished or invented. “We should view them in the same way as saints in the church,” he said. This concept came to life with the consecration of a vast Cathedral of the Armed Forces outside Moscow two years ago. The cathedral’s interior, at once stunning and sinister, combines military and religious motifs in a series of grand mosaics. Part of the exterior is made from the melted-down metal of captured Nazi tanks. Guides encourage visitors to feel they are trampling fascists underfoot when they enter the building. “Only Russians are capable of sacrificing themselves to save humanity, just like Jesus did,” said an altar server during a tour of the cathedral in 2020. Next to the cathedral is a brand new second world war museum. A guide named Viktoria moved swiftly through the rooms, talking about Soviet feats and sacrifices. Immersive graphic displays and loud booms created an impressive effect, but the feeling was more akin to being inside a computer game than to an educational experience. There was an almost total lack of context about both the unsavoury elements of the Stalinist political system, and about the Nazis. The Holocaust was barely mentioned, and when it was, it was lumped in with the general Soviet war effort. “Hitler wanted to destroy two-thirds of all the Slavs using concentration camps, and the most famous of these was at Auschwitz,” said Viktoria. Asked why there was no specific mention of the Holocaust, she said: “We decided to put it all together, because you shouldn’t separate victims by ethnicity.” By this point, the concept of “Nazis” in the Russian discourse had been stripped of all context except for the 1941 attack on the Soviet Union. And with Russian television peddling an endless diet of scare stories about western designs on Russia, it is not a huge leap of the imagination for many to transpose the same narrative on to today’s events. Ivan Fyodorov, the mayor of the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, said when Russian soldiers kidnapped him in March, some weeks after occupying the city, one of the reasons they gave was that second world war veterans in the city were disrespected and beaten up. Fyorodov said he tried to explain to his captors that there were currently 34 living veterans in Melitopol, that he knew them all personally, and gathered with them to commemorate both victory and the liberation of Melitopol on 23 October. “I couldn’t get through to them. They just kept repeating their mantras, they were like zombies,” he said. If Russia holds a victory parade in the charred ruins of Mariupol on Monday, many watching at home on television may indeed buy into the idea that the city has been “liberated” by Russia from Ukrainian “Nazis” and their American backers. But few outside the country will agree, even among those who were sympathetic to Kremlin messaging before February. For their part, the Ukrainians have responded to Russia’s cries of “Nazis” by holding up a mirror. Zelenskiy, rather than denying the significance or importance of the Soviet victory, has sought to wrest control of its symbols and legends from the Russians, calling today’s Kremlin “the ideological heirs of the Nazis”. Through his aggression, Putin has helped create a unified national pride in Ukraine, a country that for three decades had many competing ideas of national identity and history. Now, Ukrainians have rallied around their flag just as many Soviet citizens fought to the death to defend their country even if they had previously had their doubts about their leaders. Russian soldiers are now widely referred to in Ukraine as Rashisty (a mix of “Russians” and “fascists”). Collaborators who agree to work for the Russians are termed “Gauleiters”, the term for top Nazi officials in occupied areas during the second world war. And Kyiv is filled with posters comparing 1941 and 2022, two years in which the city was attacked by a malevolent external force. Zelenskiy has bestowed the title of “hero city”, a Soviet custom, on places that have offered the most stirring resistance to the Russian assault. A US aid programme has been named “lend-lease”, after the wartime assistance programme to the Soviet Union. In short, the Russians have become the Nazis in their own narrative. The claims Russia makes about how it is fighting Nazis in Ukraine become more illogical by the week, as evidenced by this week’s claim by the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Adolf Hitler had Jewish roots, when asked how Ukraine could be a Nazi state when its president is Jewish. The foreign ministry then doubled down by releasing a statement detailing “tragic examples of cooperation between Jews and Nazis”, in the process infuriating Israel, which up to this point has been largely neutral in the conflict. Several days later Putin apologised to the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. “I have no words … The Russian leadership has forgotten all the lessons of the second world war,” said Zelenskiy, commenting on Lavrov’s words in his nightly video message. “Or perhaps they never learned them.”",News/World news,How Victory Day became central to Putin’s idea of Russian identity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/how-victory-day-became-central-to-putin-idea-of-russian-identity

The promiseThere are a multitude of (often-pricey) lash-lifting methods available – including perming, LVL and hi-tech mascaras – but this one promises to shape lashes with just a teaspoon and a bit of heat. The testMy lashes are long but they’re also super straight, and if I don’t use an eyelash curler, the difference is visible. I take a teaspoon and pop it into a mug of warm water. If it’s at a drinkable temperature, it’s fine – any hotter and you risk burning the delicate skin around the eyes. I dry it off and press the curved side over my lashes holding them upwards for 10 seconds and release. This is actual sorcery; they are indeed lifted. I use my usual eyelash curler (I like Suqqu) on the other eye for comparison, and while the curlers lift the lashes more, by the end of the day my teaspoon lashes have held slightly better. The verdictBack in the noughties I regularly used a heated lash curler (or heated up my regular one with a Zippo lighter, which is definitely not advised), and it gave me killer lash lift, but the repetitive heat also made them brittle. The teaspoon hack works – but if you try it, keep the heat down and use it only occasionally, for an extra lash boost.

5/6/2022,"Every team begins its season hoping to win the championship, but that goal may appear inconsequential in this year’s WNBA when one of the league’s leading players, Brittney Griner, continues to languish in a Russian jail. WNBA players are attempting to remain focused on the court, while worrying about Griner’s condition and any news of a potential release after she was detained over allegations she brought cannabis into Russia. Courtney Vandersloot, a guard for the Chicago Sky, was Griner’s teammate in Russia at UMMC Ekaterinburg and learned about her detainment during a team meeting before the country invaded Ukraine in February. “We had a team meeting with our GM, he told us that she had been picked up at the airport,” Vandersloot said at the Sky’s media day on this week. “I can’t put into words that moment learning that. How we felt for Brittney and how scared we were for Brittney. We are hoping that she’s OK mentally and physically. Hoping that she’s being taken care of. We have the same agent so I’ve been able to stay a little bit in the know. She has the right people working for her. They’re doing everything they can to get her home.” Griner, a double-Olympic champion, faces 10 years in jail if she is convicted by a Russian court. But hopeful news emerged this week when the Biden administration determined that Griner is “being wrongfully detained”. US officials have now shifted Griner’s case to the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs which will focus on negotiating her release. The White House’s ruling came one week after the highly-publicized release of Trevor Reed, a US citizen who had been detained in Russia since 2019. “It’s great news that the US government has reclassified her Russian detainment,” says Alexis Mrachek, policy analyst for Russia and Eurasia at The Heritage Foundation. “The fact that she is now officially ‘wrongfully detained’ means that the executive branch will be working that much harder behind the scenes to bring her home. However, it could also mean that the Russian government will push back harder against the US seeking her release. We’ve seen how strict Moscow was in the past few years with Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, who both were wrongfully detained, so we can expect to see the same regarding Brittney Griner.” Allie Quigley, Chicago Sky guard and also a teammate of Griner’s in Russia, shared her reaction to US officials reclassifying Griner as “wrongfully detained.” “I saw [the news] this morning,” Quigley said at the Sky’s media day. “I was so happy to know that we don’t have to wait for the trial date. Hopefully, they can try to figure something out, some kind of swap or do what they do, whatever it takes to get her home. I’m sure that was really good news for her family as well. I’ve been thinking about her for the last two months. I just hope this is a step in the right direction.” On the court, Griner’s Phoenix Mercury teammates are preparing to enter the season, which starts on Friday night, without their fearless center. In 2021, Griner led the team by averaging 20.5 points per game, and 9.5 rebounds per contest. After a successful run in the playoffs, the Mercury fell to the Sky in last season’s WNBA finals. Mercury’s new head coach Vanessa Nygaard has the task of keeping her team competitive while also paying close attention to her players’ emotions during a trying time. “We all are concerned every day,” Nygaard said last month. “It’s in our minds. We do get occasional updates and we are kept as informed as we can be. It’s a part of who we are this season. We’re just keeping all of our thoughts and prayers with BG and praying for her safe return.” As the competition gets underway on the court, the Mercury and WNBA will seek to bring more awareness to Griner’s predicament. This week, the league announced that each team’s home arena will feature a floor decal with Griner’s initials and her jersey number (42). Beyond the initial support given to Griner by the league, some are hoping that her case leads to a watershed moment for the WNBA, where its players no longer need to travel overseas to supplement their incomes. In 2020, the WNBA introduced a new collective bargaining agreement that increased player salaries, travel accommodations, and maternity leave. But even with those changes, the WNBA still lags behind the EuroLeague Women in many ways. Griner’s base salary in the WNBA is $227,900, whereas she earned $1m per year in Russia. The WNBA may also begin to undercut players who choose to join teams overseas. “The WNBA has a provision in the CBA called the ‘prioritization clause’ which starts to take effect in 2023,” says Tamryn Spruill, author of the forthcoming book about the WNBA, Court Queens. “The clause allows teams to implement punishments on players who return late to training camps and preseason games after playing overseas. Players like Brittney Griner and Breanna Stewart have played on teams that made deep runs in the EuroLeague causing them to miss time with their WNBA teams. Players who miss time can face suspension.” Griner’s ordeal – and the questions it has raised about how and where players make their living – will most likely force the WNBA to consider improvements to the CBA that are needed for the future of its league. For now though, the WNBA’s players, coaches, and staff will seek to continue entertaining fans – ratings for last season’s finals were up 51% on the previous year – with a high level of basketball. They’ll do all this while also hoping for the best possible outcome for Griner and her eventual return to the US. “As WNBA players, we’ve always put our voice first on what we want to advocate for and what we care for,” said Tina Charles during the Mercury’s media day. “And we’ve always been able to see the results of that. But right now, we’re just trusting the process of those higher above us and who’ve been in those seats and been in the positions and dealt with situations like this. Just to have the best result with her coming home. But for us, we know that she knows that she’s in our thoughts and that she’s in our prayers. And she also knows what the situation is and the stance that those above [us] are taking, and we’re just following suit.” ",Sport/Sport,Brittney Griner’s detainment in Russia weighs heavy on WNBA as new season starts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/brittney-griners-detainment-in-russia-weighs-heavy-on-wnba-as-new-season-starts
5/6/2022,"The NHS cannot cope with the growing need for care, long delays for treatment are now routine and the staffing crisis is so acute that retired doctors are now being asked to come back and work in hospitals. Here, a senior nurse describes how the NHS 111 telephone advice service – an important source of urgent medical advice and way of taking the pressure off A&E – is increasingly unable to help those who ring seeking help and voices her fears that patients with serious conditions may be suffering avoidable harm as a result. I’ve worked in NHS 111 for more than 10 years. But in all that time, I’ve never seen it in the state it’s in now. It’s shocking. In my experience, everybody in 111 is on their knees at the moment. We just can’t deal with the sheer number of calls and requests for help that we are getting. 111 is a very important service, so it needs to be working properly. It’s basically where people can ring to get advice about a whole range of medical problems when GP surgeries are shut. They ring, tell us what the problem is and then they get a call back, depending on how urgent their symptoms are, and then they get help – or at least that’s how it’s supposed to work anyway. We can advise someone to go to see their GP, or send an electronic prescription to their local pharmacy or in some cases request an ambulance to take them to A&E. Callers ring with all sorts of problems. It might be someone with a respiratory infection or urinary infection, or a child who is vomiting and has diarrhoea, or someone with mental health issues or abdominal pain. So it includes things that may be signs of a serious illness. People think they can ring 111 and get advice quickly. However, increasingly that doesn’t happen as we are in a state of constant, massive overload. We just can’t cope with the number of people who ring us seeking our help. The end result is that people can wait a long time before anyone calls them back or some people end up getting no care or help at all, which really worries me. I work nightshifts, usually at the weekend, as my main job is as a nurse in a hospital. When I’m at work I’m the sole clinician with responsibility for the care of an area with a population of 350,000. The clinician is the health professional – usually a doctor or nurse, but sometimes a paramedic – who uses their expertise to decide how urgent cases are and what we should recommend the patient does next. Every caller undergoes triage; I do what’s called “advanced triage”. Before Covid, when I started my shift there would be 20-30 people waiting on the list to be called back. Now it’s always about 60, so it’s gone up a lot in a short space of time. Bank holiday weekends are the worst; that’s when 111 falls over. When I arrived for my shift on Good Friday last month there were 290 people waiting for a call back. I’d never seen so many before. Since Christmas things have got worse and worse in terms of demand for our help. Every shift is worse than the previous shift. I don’t know if the public realise it or not but many of the doctors, nurses and other clinicians working for 111 have other jobs and only work part-time. 111 is very understaffed. We get text messages every day saying “please come and work in 111”. They’re basically begging us to spare a few hours to help triage people. I sometimes get five or six messages like that a day. When that happens, it’s because it’s desperate. But it’s not just desperate in my county. It’s the same all over England. The crisis in NHS ambulance services has made things worse recently in 111. In most places these days if you’ve had a heart attack or stroke or been involved in a car crash you might be waiting two hours plus for an ambulance to arrive. If someone has had a stroke – where you have a “golden hour” to get them to hospital and start treatment – delay can make the difference between them recovering or ending up disabled or even dead. So NHS overload and delays do put patients at risk. Sometimes you ring someone whose symptoms are very worrying and find that they’ve already been waiting for 100 minutes. That’s very frustrating. It could be that a delay in assessing someone means that a skin infection gets missed and escalates into sepsis or that their stroke has gone untreated. It’s impossible to know how much avoidable harm this all leads to, but it does happen. The pressure on ambulance services doesn’t just mean that patients can’t get an ambulance quickly enough. It can also mean that myself and colleagues have to stay with that person in their own home, trying to keep them alive while waiting for the ambulance. But the long waits for ambulances also mean that the 999 service are offloading patients on to us to look after who they know they’re not going to be able to get to for six to eight hours. That hasn’t happened because the patient doesn’t need 999 help – they do – there just isn’t an ambulance available to go to them. Ambulance services offload patients on to us because they – as with 111, GP surgeries, community services, A&E units and every other part of the NHS – are so overloaded. Everything is under completely unsustainable pressure. Staff working in all these services carry such an emotional burden because they’re having to make decisions that you wouldn’t want to have to make – about who gets treatment soon and who has to wait, when they all need to be seen – because there isn’t enough resource to respond properly to the huge need for care. When people are triaged, they’re prioritised as needing a call back within two, six, 12 or 24 hours. But the days are gone when we could get through everyone on the waiting list. Often we only manage to get to all those given a two-hour callback time – the most worrying cases. The others have to just visit their GP when the surgery is next open or see a pharmacist. It’s emotionally distressing, and also professionally distressing, that some people who are sick end up not getting any help at all from 111. But that’s what happens. I understand why people who were told they were going to get a call back, or who have gone to bed before it comes, get annoyed. People who have called 111, or their relatives, get anxious when no one calls them back. 111 is a great system. For the NHS to work, it needs to work. But I’m at my wits’ end worrying about it because it cannot deal with the pressure it’s under just now. As told to Denis Campbell",News/Society,‘It’s shocking’: senior nurse tells of acute pressure on NHS 111,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/06/its-shocking-senior-nurse-tells-of-acute-pressure-on-nhs-111
5/6/2022,"The image of Elsie, the 77-year-old pensioner whom Good Morning Britain’s Susanna Reid used as an example when interviewing Boris Johnson about the cost of living crisis on Tuesday, was shocking. Having to eat just one meal a day and riding on buses to avoid putting on the heating on at home: it’s morally – and politically – indefensible. Just imagine the extreme measures people will be taking come autumn, when temperatures drop and energy bills rise yet again. According to Reid, Elsie’s energy bills have risen from £17 a month to £85 a month. Meanwhile, the energy company BP just announced underlying quarterly profits of nearly £5bn; Shell’s profits are likely to be similarly huge. Asked whether he would countenance taking some of the profits from oil giants like BP and Shell to help people such as Elsie, Johnson said: “If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see.” The energy lobby claims that the industry will invest £20bn on UK projects to extract oil and gas between now and 2026 to generate UK energy security. Leaving aside for one moment the irrefutable climate imperative to keep new oil and gas in the ground, will the British public really get a secure supply of affordable energy from this “investment”, as Johnson seems to believe? In short: no. According to research by Uplift, the campaign organisation I direct, three-quarters of this planned “investment” – 72% – is in North Sea oil (as opposed to gas) fields, and the majority of this oil – 80% – will probably be shipped abroad. Investing in these oilfields will reap huge profits for the energy companies that hold the licences to these areas, but will do little to secure energy supplies for UK households. Just look at BP’s huge Clair oilfield, off the coast of Shetland (near the site of Shell’s Cambo field). BP wants to invest in extending this field – by seeking approval for its Clair South project – but the oil it contains is unlikely to end up in Britain: as noted, the UK exports most of its oil. Last week, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, was full of praise for BP’s plans to extend another, smaller field, Murlach, tweeting: “I’d much rather we source more of our gas domestically.” But we have calculated that the majority – 80% – of Murlach’s small reserves are, again, oil, most probably for export, with a relatively small amount of gas. Most of what’s left in the North Sea is oil. These developments aren’t about providing UK energy security, they’re simply business for oil and gas companies. But what of the investment these companies are making in the UK’s renewable energy supply, which – unlike oil and gas supplies – actually would lead to lower energy bills? Harbour Energy, the biggest operator in the North Sea, has explicitly ruled out investment in renewables in the near future, citing instead its net-zero strategy and involvement in UK carbon capture and storage projects, a technology that has so far failed to work at scale in other parts of the world. Of the 49 current oil and gas producers in the North Sea, only 11 companies also generate renewable energy in the UK. Even this doesn’t mean that the power they produce reaches UK households, though: some produce electricity solely for powering oil and gas infrastructure. The UK public gain nothing from this. Is this the kind of investment the prime minister wants to see more of? Precious little or no renewable energy production, and lots of drilling for oil for export by companies that have paid the UK zero corporation tax in their North Sea operation in recent years? Last year, the government produced a plan – the North Sea Transition Deal – that failed to include any binding targets on the industry to either reduce its emissions or invest in renewable energy. Last month’s energy security strategy was another gift to the industry. It doubled down on new oil and gas drilling, announcing a new round of oil and gas licences and a process to speed up the approval of new projects, such as Cambo, Clair South and Shell’s Jackdaw gas field. According to Friends of the Earth Scotland, if approved, Jackdaw would provide only about 1% to 2% of UK gas demand over its lifetime but the same amount of pollution as half of Scotland’s annual emissions. The government’s energy strategy came just three days after the IPCC issued its starkest warning yet that existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will push us past the limits for a livable climate. New domestic oil and gas production will have, at best, a marginal effect on UK energy bills. It won’t provide a secure and, crucially, affordable supply of energy. What it will do is ensure that the fossil fuel industry can keep cashing in on oil and gas from the North Sea, while millions of households struggle to pay spiralling bills. If ever there was a moment for the government to side with the public over a handful of wealthy oil and gas companies, it’s now.

5/6/2022,"British Airways’ owner has said that a recovery in business travel and trips by wealthy passengers will drive a return to profitability from the second quarter onwards this year. International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, said that while Omicron had a short-term impact on bookings in January and February, the overall easing of coronavirus-related travel restrictions has improved travel demand in the first quarter, particularly in the UK. “Demand is recovering strongly in line with our previous expectations,” said Luis Gallego, the chief executive of IAG. “We expect to be profitable from the second quarter onwards and for the full year. Premium leisure continues to be the strongest performing segment and business travel is at its highest level since the start of the pandemic.” The company, which reported an operating loss of €731m (£625m) in the first quarter compared with more than €1bn in the same period last year, added that there had been “no noticeable impact” on the business from the war in Ukraine. Analysts’ consensus on IAG, which made a €3.5bn loss in 2021, was for an operating loss of about €510m in the first three months of the year. Shares fell 8% on Friday morning, making IAG the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Gallego said that by the third quarter, demand across the all-important UK-US travel corridor would almost be back to pre-pandemic levels. “As a result of the increasing demand, forward bookings remain encouraging,” he said. “We expect to achieve 80% of 2019 capacity in the second quarter and 85% in the third quarter. North Atlantic capacity will be close to fully restored in the third quarter.” The resurgence in demand is also taking place in the hotel sector, with the revenues of InterContinental Hotels Group, the owner of chains including Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn, up 61% year on year in the first quarter and the average daily room rate back to pre-pandemic levels as the recovery fuels “increased pricing power”. “We’ve seen very positive trading conditions in the first quarter, with travel demand continuing to increase in almost all of our key markets around the world,” said Keith Barr, the chief executive of IHG. “The high level of demand we have seen for leisure travel continues to drive increased rates and occupancy. We also continue to see a return of business and group travel.” IAG’s Gallego warned that the strong recovery, which has resulted in long delays at understaffed airports and airlines cancelling hundreds of flights, has led to the biggest scaling-up operation in airline history. “Globally, the travel industry is facing challenges as a result of the biggest scaling up in operations in history and British Airways is no exception,” he said. “The airline’s focus at the moment is on improving operations and customer experience and enhancing operational resilience.”",News/Business,BA owner says recovery of business travel will drive return to profit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/ba-owner-says-recovery-of-business-travel-will-drive-return-to-profit-iag
5/6/2022,"Some have walked the path for the challenge or the adventure while others tackled it in search of beautiful vistas and amazing history. Those who have completed the whole route slip off their walking boots or training shoes and speak of feeling refreshed, inspired, consoled. The Wales Coast Path is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week and is being heralded by walkers, nature lovers, thrill-seekers and politicians as a triumph. “It’s a wonderful trail,” said keen walker Deiniol Tegid, the author of 20 new itineraries created to mark the birthday of the 870-mile path. “For me, it’s a combination of things. You are alone with nature, there are stunning views and so much heritage. “At the abbey at St Dogmaels in Pembrokeshire you can imagine what it was like to be a monk going about your daily chores. A little further along you are on clifftops with amazing wildflowers and eye to eye with birds or prey. There are castles, standing stones, lighthouses.” Above all, for Tegid a Welsh phrase sums it up – Lle i enaid gael llonydd – a place for the soul to find peace. The path, which opened in May 2012, is one of the few in the world to take in a country’s whole coast. Completing the route, between Chepstow in the south to near Chester in the north, in one go is not for the faint-hearted, involving a rise and fall nearly three times the height of Everest. It takes on average three months. But many dip in and out and some sections are suitable for cyclists, families with pushchairs, people with limited mobility and horse riders. Back in 2012, Arry Cain was the first to complete the route, running the coast path – and for good measure also did the 176-mile Offa’s Dyke Path, which tracks along the Welsh-English border. It took her just 41 days. “I feel so nostalgic this week,” she said. “I met so many kind and supportive people, many of whom were local to the path who were had a real sense of pride about it. I’m glad a woman was the first person to complete the path. I’d like to think it’s inspired others” Currently walking the path is Sarah Williams, the host of the Tough Girl podcast and a veteran of routes such as the Appalachian Trail in the US and the Marathon des Sables in the Sahara. She is planning to complete the path in 50 days. Speaking from the Llŷn Peninsula in north Wales, Williams said: “It’s beautiful today but I’ve also had an 11-hour stretch of non-stop torrential rain. That’s the reality but it’s a brilliant experience.” For some it has led to careers. Lucy O’Donnell walked the path after being made redundant. “It helped me clarify my thoughts, shape my future and gave me the confidence to tackle anything. Since completing the path I have worked as a tour manager in Spain, qualified to be a professional tourist guide in Wales and set up a guided walks business.” Will Renwick walked it when he was 22 and went on to edit the online magazine Outdoors Magic. “I’m back on the path regularly and I love the memories each visit conjures up. Revisiting it with friends or family I’m regularly blurting out things like: ‘Oh, I remember when I camped behind that bush there,’ or ‘the landlord of this place gave me a pint on the house.” The Welsh government gives Natural Resources Wales an annual budget to maintain, improve and promote the path, in close partnership with local coastal authorities. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, said the path was “one of the crowning glories of Wales” – and a proud achievements of devolution. “If I had to choose just one stretch, then the portion between Pendine and Amroth would be a candidate: starting in my home county of Carmarthenshire, and ending in Pembrokeshire. “It offers huge variety: challenging climbs, outstanding variety of flowers, secret coves, historical interest – there’s even said to be a naturist section for those who believe that an exposed coast should mean more than the sun, the wind and the sea.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Wales Coast Path walkers celebrate 10 years of inspiration and challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/06/wales-coast-path-10-year-anniversary-walkers
5/6/2022,"Two weeks out from Australia’s 21 May election, cost of living pressures and the rising prominence of independent pro-climate action candidates have made the future of the country’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, increasingly uncertain. Just past the halfway stage of the election campaign, multiple newspapers have released polls pointing to a slight advantage for Anthony Albanese’s Labor opposition over the conservative Coalition comprising the Liberal party under Morrison and the rural-based National party. However, the polls failed to predict Morrison’s narrow win in 2019, and support for both major parties is in decline, leaving several outcomes open, including the prospect of a hung parliament. Morrison’s task is to retain the 76 seats the Coalition currently holds – the minimum required to form government in a parliament of 151 – which would extend Labor’s run of losing elections to four, stretching back to 2013. He has hopes of picking up some Labor marginals, particularly in New South Wales, but also faces threats from a well organised group of independents in generally wealthy inner-city seats who are demanding more urgent action on climate. So far, the campaign has been rocky for both leaders. The campaign began shortly after revelations that members of Morrison’s government, including the deputy prime minister and National party leader, Barnaby Joyce, had called him a liar, both publicly and privately. Morrison has since endured sustained criticism from Labor over Australia’s disintegrating relationship with the Solomon Islands after the Pacific nation signed a security pact with Beijing that blindsided the Australian government. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate for the first time since 2010, prompting the country’s four largest banks to immediately raise their interest rates, after alarming figures released the previous week showed inflation rising at double the pace of wages. Having campaigned for weeks on cost-of-living issues, hoping to reinforce the traditional strength of the Coalition on economic management, Morrison was quick to dissociate the bank’s decision from his policies, blaming overseas events beyond his control. Labor seized on the rate rise, as it unveiled a policy to help lower income Australians break into the investor-driven housing market, whereby the government would take a 40% stake in a house to ease mortgage sizes. Albanese, coming out of a week of Covid isolation at his home in Sydney, travelled to Western Australia to officially launch his party’s campaign, and later to Queensland, in a week where he was joined by the premiers of Labor-led states whose popularity surged as a result of tight domestic border controls during the pandemic. Albanese, who has made much of his upbringing as the child of a single mother in Sydney public housing, is a party stalwart from Labor’s left faction, although far from a radical firebrand. A near-fatal car crash near his home last year made him refocus his life, he says, and he has since made a point of his healthier diet and lifestyle, while acceding to superficial image changes. But he has struggled to inject inspiration into Labor’s campaign, which has kept its policy offering to a minimum after the ambitious program of his predecessor, Bill Shorten, was effectively torn down by Morrison at the 2019 election. But the Coalition is fighting on more than one front, thanks to the so-called “teal independents” – candidates running in traditionally safe Liberal party seats on a strong climate action platform, some backed by substantial funds from the Climate 200 organisation.Many have adopted the colours pioneered by former winter Olympian Zali Steggall, who ousted the former prime minister Tony Abbott from his Sydney seat of Warringah at the last election, the teal nodding both to the traditional Liberal blue and their green credentials. Several seats in affluent areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Perth appear vulnerable to independents, according to polling, threatening the political career of prominent moderate Liberal MPs, including the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in the traditionally rock-solid Liberal seat of Kooyong, in Melbourne. Rather than shift policy to appeal to moderate Liberals concerned about climate, Morrison has focused on voters in outer metropolitan, regional and mining seats, some former Labor strongholds, others held by the Nationals. Morrison went on the attack this week, criticising the other pillar of the teal independent platform – calls for a robust federal anti-corruption watchdog – as potentially leading to a “public autocracy”. Morrison has also resisted calls to disendorse Katherine Deves, the candidate he hand-picked to challenge the independent Steggall. Deves has been revealed to have made controversial comments about transgender women playing sport, using Holocaust comparisons to make her point. Morrison’s stance again seems likely to further alienate voters in some of the seats being challenged by independents. Morrison has warned voters that electing these candidates could result in a hung parliament, and that a future minority government would be hampered in its ability to pass legislation without ceding to the independents’ demands. On Friday, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted as Liberal leader in 2018 and ultimately replaced by Morrison, said voting for the teal independents could thwart the “capture” of the Liberal party by its conservative wing. Elsewhere, leaders have stumbled over seemingly more straightforward blocks. Albanese was unable to name the unemployment and interest rates on the first day of the campaign, and then struggled to explain Labor’s disability policy when pressed by journalists. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, won some kudos for telling a journalist who asked what the obscure wage price index was, to “Google it, mate”. Most bizarre of all was Morrison, who posted an image to his Facebook page on Sunday night of curries he had prepared for his family – a well-worn tactic he has used to promote his brand as a regular suburban dad spending time with his family. “Strong curry. Strong economy. Stronger future,” the caption read. The image showed an extremely pale looking chicken korma, with an alarmingly pinkish chunk of meat, triggering an onslaught of negative comments. Morrison defending his cooking skills, telling one radio station the photograph was misleading: “People went back for seconds. It was just the way the light bounced off the skin of the chicken.”",News/Australia news,Australia election: climate and cost of living in focus as leaders stumble,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/australia-election-climate-and-cost-of-living-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese
5/6/2022,"The phrase “I’ve been Maggied” came into being in the world of breast cancer clinical research to describe the effect that my friend Maggie Wilcox had on helping scientists and clinicians to see the light and listen to patients. Maggie, who has died aged 79, was a founding member and first president of Independent Cancer Patients Voice (ICPV), a patient-led organisation that tries to bring the views of cancer patients, their families and carers to the forefront of cancer research. A skilled communicator, she was instrumental in setting up ICPV Voice, a training course that introduced patient advocates to the science behind breast cancer. She was also a respected board member of the UK Breast Cancer Coalition, and as a member of UK Breast InterGroup worked closely with the Warwick Clinical Trials Unit to ensure meaningful patient and public involvement in many of its trials. Maggie was born in Liverpool to Thomas Jones, a foreman at a metal works, and his wife, Edith (nee Swain), a secretary. After attending Merchant Taylors’ girls’ school in Crosby she worked as a paediatric nursing aide until she was old enough to enter nurse training at the Royal Liverpool Infirmary. Working as a staff nurse there, she eventually moved to London to study midwifery at Queen Charlotte’s hospital with the aim of becoming a health visitor. But after a spell working in the accident and emergency department at the West London hospital, and the death of her two-year-old daughter, Helen, of Reyes syndrome in 1982, she ended up spending the rest of her professional career as a clinical nurse specialist in palliative care, working for various hospitals. Maggie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997, but made a good recovery after surgery, radiotherapy, and 10 years of endocrine therapy. That personal experience of diagnosis and treatment equipped her with a powerful ability to advocate the importance of patient insight and involvement, to help develop kinder treatments and improve outcomes for people living with the disease. Maggie worked tirelessly to encourage a greater involvement from lay people in cancer research. Her approach was one of collaboration, networking and partnership; focusing all parties – whether patients, clinicians or healthcare professionals – to work together to improve treatments. She was a warm, compassionate woman with great generosity of spirit, someone who brought levity as well as wisdom into discussion of even the most serious of topics. Maggie’s husband, Colin, predeceased her.

The Spaniard’s deal runs to the end of the 2024-25 season and Eidevall’s until a year earlier. Arteta, who described himself as “excited, grateful and really, really happy”, said: “We want to take the club to the next level and to compete really with the top teams. In order to do that, we have to be playing in the Champions League. We have to be able to evolve the team, improve our players, improve all departments, generate even more connection with our fans, improve the atmosphere at the Emirates, be able to recruit top, top talent and the best people for this club to drive this project to that level.” Eidevall, who is in his first season at the club and goes into the final day of the Women’s Super League season with a chance of winning the title, said: “It’s great. It allows me to continue to work for a club that I love so much and be around people that I really, really like, and to be able to achieve things together, so I’m really looking forward to that.” Arteta succeeded Unai Emery in December 2019 and his team are well placed to secure a Champions League place, sitting fourth with four matches to play. They are at home to Leeds on Sunday before going to Tottenham for a potentially decisive game four days later.

5/6/2022,"The planned split of AGL Energy that billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is trying to foil will cost $260m upfront and $35m in extra costs per year for the demerged entities, documents from the energy giant show. In separate releases to the ASX on Friday afternoon, AGL laid out its details of the demerger ahead of a 15 June vote by shareholders. As the biggest shareholder following his purchase of a 11.3% holding, Cannon-Brookes can block the move with the support of another 13.7% of share owners. The company aims to list the two separate entities by 22 June. Accel Energy would hold AGL’s electricity generation capacity, including three coal-fired power plants, while AGL Australia would contain the retailing arm and its 4.5 million energy and telecommunication customers. The scheme booklet lists advantages of the split such as the increased potential for a “change of control” through a takeover, a clearer identification of the individual value of the separate entities and a faster decarbonisation of operations. Disadvantages include a one-off transaction cost of $260m and extra corporate and operation costs of $35m a year, while “net tax inefficiencies” will add another $125m. The loss of “operational synergies” from breaking up AGL are another risk as is the potential that court and other necessary approvals won’t be secured. Grok Ventures, Cannon-Brookes’s family-owned company, revealed the share raid on Monday, with the Atlassian cofounder later saying he had received positive responses to his blocking move.“Fellow AGL shareholders only need to see that the risks and disadvantages section of the demerger booklet run as long as, and in our view, far outweigh any advantages put forward by company,” a Grok spokeswoman said.“The booklet does nothing to change our view that the demerger plan promotes a terrible outcome for shareholders, communities and the climate.”Cannon-Brookes wants to halt the demerger in order to quicken the closure of the Bayswater and Loy Yang A power plants in New South Wales and Victoria, respectively, while the third plant, NSW’s Liddell, is already scheduled to shut by next April. The bid is his second tilt at AGL in three months after the company’s board rejected a full takeover offer with Canadian asset manager Brookfield in March. For its part, AGL’s chief executive, Graeme Hunt, said the company believed the demerger was the best way to create shareholder value, noting it was also the board’s unanimous recommendation. It was also supported by Grant Samuel’s independent experts’ report. “This is a plan backed by real investment and a pipeline of real projects to lead Australia’s energy transition,” Hunt said, adding that both new entities would carry investment-grade credit ratings. “We have invested $4.8bn in renewable and firming generation in the past two decades – the largest by any ASX-listed company – and that is why today we operate the largest portfolio of renewable generation and battery assets of any ASX-listed company,” he said. However, activist groups, Greenpeace Australia and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the scheme booklets showed neither AGL Australia nor Accel Energy would operate within Paris climate targets. AGL is Australia’s biggest single polluter. Accel Energy may also be unable to access capital or insurance due to environmental, social and governance issues, Glenn Walker, a Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner, said. “AGL’s claim that the demerged AGL Australia will have ‘leading ESG credentials’ is the very definition of greenwashing, given neither AGL Australia nor Accel Energy will align with Paris climate targets,” Walker said. “This demerger is a turd rolled in glitter, but the marketing sparkle is fooling no one,” Walker said. “Shareholders and customers can smell the stench of climate and financial failure from here.” ACCR’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said AGL had ignored the majority of its shareholders by failing to set Paris-aligned targets for Accel Energy. “In the absence of further detail on AGL Australia’s scope 3 emissions, particularly its electricity off-take arrangements and upstream gas emissions, it is difficult to determine whether its targets are Paris-aligned,” he said. “Alignment with the Paris agreement across both demerged entities was a fundamental demand of a majority of AGL’s shareholders less than a year ago,” Gocher added. “We don’t expect AGL’s largest shareholders will take well to being ignored.” The company’s shares fell 0.8% on Friday to $8.35, a smaller drop than the 2.2% decline of the average of the ASX’s top 200 stocks.",News/Australia news,AGL reveals demerger would cost $260m as Mike Cannon-Brookes tries to block plan,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/agl-reveals-demerger-would-cost-260m-as-mike-cannon-brooks-tries-to-block-plan

The first on the list is from 1966, when he was cast in Road to Saint Tropez, directed by Mike Sarne; he then played Baron Von Frankenstein in 1973’s Flesh for Frankenstein for Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol; and, in the years since, he’s done everything from Fassbinder projects to Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. The 77-year-old actor is now starring in drama Swan Song with Linda “Krystle Carrington from Dynasty” Evans, Michael “Ugly Betty” Urie and Jennifer “Stifler’s mom” Coolidge, in which he plays a former hairdresser who takes a long walk across town after being tasked to style his former client’s hair for her funeral.

5/6/2022,"“I think the first thing is about being aware,” says Dr Dan O’Hare, the vice-chair of the British Psychological Society’s division of education and child psychology. “Are they more irritable than usual? If they play Fortnite, have they suddenly lost interest in it or are they playing way more than they should be? Have they gone off their food, are they complaining of physical symptoms, like headaches and stomach aches more regularly than they might do?” “Remind your child that it’s perfectly normal to feel worried or stressed about their exams,” says Cecilia Corbetta, the parenting lead at the Place2Be mental health charity. “Talk openly about how you cope with your own stressful situations, so your child has a positive role model for managing their emotions and time.” O’Hare stresses the importance of the basics – food, exercise, friends and downtime. Then help them create a plan to prepare for their exams. “When are those exams? How do we create a sustainable revision timetable? I think sometimes young people get generic advice – ‘do some revision’. Does that mean six hours at the same textbook, or does it actually mean 30 minutes, a five-minute break, then we go out for a walk? Helping them plan and create that structure for those small wins, I think is really key.” O’Hare says a lot of motivation around exams is fear-based – warnings that if you don’t do well, you won’t be able to go to university. “That sort of narrative is really stressful for children,” he says, and should be avoided. “Be reassuring, positive, and help put things into perspective,” says Corbetta. “Remind them that there is more to life than their grades, and their results don’t define who they are.” “Sometimes your child may not want to talk, and it’s important we don’t force them to have a conversation they don’t want to have. Make yourself available but don’t pressure them to talk,” says Corbetta. Listen to their needs, says O’Hare. “Parents and carers might want to get the young person out of the house for all the best reasons. But if it becomes so rigid that it starts contributing to the stress, rather than alleviating it, as adults we need to be flexible.” Help them to relax so they don’t dwell on things they could have done better. Place2Be suggests watching a film or enjoying a favourite meal together, before starting revision for the next test. If you are concerned about your child or they won’t talk to you, encourage them to talk to someone at school or a charity such as ChildLine, says Place2Be. O’Hare says worried parents can also approach their child’s school via their form tutor, head of year or pastoral lead. “These are people in the school system who are really aware of how to support children who are going through these things.” If you’re worried about a child who may be having panic attacks, for example, contact your GP.",News/Education,Exam stress: how to help children cope with GCSEs and A-levels,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/06/exam-stress-how-help-children-cope-gcses-a-levels
5/6/2022,"Teachers in England have observed high levels of anxiety among pupils in the run-up to GCSEs and A-levels, with reports of panic attacks, angry outbursts, self-harm and disengagement among students who will be the first to sit examinations in three years due to the pandemic. With the main summer exam period due to begin next week, headteachers say they have seen a rise in requests from GPs and mental health teams, asking for individual pupils to be allowed to sit their exams in a separate or smaller room, away from the main exam hall, because of stress and anxiety. Numbers have more than doubled in one school, creating space and invigilation challenges. A-level candidates have also reported fewer university offers from the most sought-after institutions – fuelling their anxiety – partly as a result of a rise in the number of students who deferred places last year following record A-level results, but also because there are more 18-year-olds in the population competing for places. GCSEs and A-levels in England have been cancelled for the past two years because of Covid and replaced with teacher-assessed grades, meaning this summer’s cohort of A-level students have not yet experienced public exams. They have also been told there will be fewer top grades as the government begins to rein in grade inflation. “We’ve got more young people who are anxious than we would normally have,” said Glyn Potts, the headteacher of Newman Roman Catholic college in Oldham, Greater Manchester. “We have got some students who are desperate to do very, very well. They fear they are not going to get the grades they should be getting because of the disruption, and because the government needs to sort out the [grade] inflation over the last two years. “We’ve also seen a huge number of doctor or CAMHS [child mental health services]-related feedback to parents … requesting children should have a room of their own for the exams.” Requests have more than doubled to 23 GCSE candidates this summer, he said. A Place2Be mental health practitioner working in a secondary school in the north of England, who asked to remain anonymous, said some pupils were suffering panic attacks. One girl was unable to make it into the hall to do her mocks. “Even thinking about exams would bring on panic. It’s affected sleeping and eating – particularly for females. There’s a lot of self-harm. Lots of low mood and anxiety. “The boys tend to get more angry. One particular boy got very angry at the thought or mention of exams and was punching walls. He didn’t want to hear anything about exams, because it felt too painful, too stressful to think about.” One London teacher, who did not want to be named, said: “In one class I’ve had one male year 13 student crying and shouting at me. Some other kids’ response is to just shrug their shoulders and downplay the significance of the exams.” Robin Bevan, the headteacher of Southend high school for boys in Essex, said – as with many schools – he had seen a noticeable increase in pupils seeking additional mental health support or counselling. “Until a few years ago we would have made the occasional referral to external services, we now have a fully booked full-time on-site counselling service and the benefits of an NHS-funded mental health support team. It is hard to tell whether this is a real increase or suppressed demand now coming in to the open.” Sean Maher, the headteacher of Richard Challoner School in New Malden, Surrey, said: “We have certainly seen an increase in anxiety and less resilience in our young people but my feeling is that they aren’t any more stressed about the upcoming examinations than they have been in previous years.” Ben Davis, the head of St Ambrose Barlow RC high school in Swinton, Manchester, said: “There’s an awful lot of anxiety, fear, and worry, and disengagement among some of them. Overall, I’ve been really impressed at how the year 11s have coped. But there’s a group of them for whom it’s suddenly got very real very quickly. They don’t quite know how to handle it.” Elena Blair, 18, who is about to sit her A-levels at Harrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, said: “Not having GCSEs has thrown us all a bit, particularly when it comes to revision. It’s been quite difficult. It does probably add a layer of stress. It does not really feel real.” “It’s quite scary,” said one 16-year-old student from Manchester who will sit 26 exams in 10 different GCSE subjects over the next few weeks. “You do see a lot more people getting upset during school. It’s hitting everyone, now that the exams are coming. Sometimes people are in tears. Everyone feeds off everyone else’s anxieties.”",News/Education,"Pupils in England showing high anxiety in run-up to GCSEs and A-levels, teachers say",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/06/pupils-showing-high-anxiety-run-up-gcses-a-levels-teachers-say
