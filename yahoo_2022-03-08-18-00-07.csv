It's been an incredible past 48 hours."" After providing the update to their fundraising efforts, Kunis introduced Ryan Petersen, the creator of Flexport, and Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, to speak further about where the donated funds are being channeled. Kutcher added that more than 30,000 people have already donated to the cause. ""We're halfway there. We're at $15 million, and we're heading to $30. We're going to make this happen,"" he said.

3/8/2022,"Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says he had a ""heated"" debate with Jared Kushner over COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Bourla told Kushner that the US would have to wait its turn to get an additional 100 million doses. Kushner disagreed, telling Bourla he represented the US government, which could ""take measures"" to enforce its will. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla revealed in a new op-ed published on Forbes that he and Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, once had a ""heated"" debate over whether the US should receive its vaccine doses first. In the op-ed, Bourla said he and Kushner disagreed over the supply time for an additional 100 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 jab that the Trump administration ordered. Bourla wrote that the conflict arose because the US was topping up on its original order of 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, but that other countries had already signed contracts with Pfizer to secure their vaccine doses. During the early days of the pandemic, Kushner was the head of a COVID-19 shadow task force that a documentary later revealed consisted of young volunteers buying PPE with personal email accounts. ""Jared was asking for a very aggressive delivery plan to the US for the additional 100 million doses. He wanted it all in the second quarter of 2021,"" wrote Bourla. ""To do that, we would have had to take supplies from Canada, Japan, and Latin American countries, all of which had placed their orders earlier than the US and were expecting the vaccine in the second quarter."" Bourla said that the ""debate"" between himself and Kushner became ""heated"" when he refused. The Pfizer CEO said he ""reminded Jared"" it was made clear to Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of the Trump team's COVID-19 vaccine plan Operation Warp Speed, that Pfizer would not take doses from other countries to give them to the US. However, Bourla wrote that ""Jared didn't budge."" ""In his mind, America was coming first no matter what. In my mind, fairness had to come first,"" Bourla wrote. ""He reminded me that he represented the government, and they could 'take measures' to enforce their will."" Bourla wrote that he responded to Kushner: ""Be my guest, Jared. I prefer to have Japan's prime minister complaining to you about the cancellation of the Olympics rather than to me."" The CEO said that the disagreement ended when Pfizer's manufacturing team managed to pull through and deliver extra doses to the US without cutting the supply of other countries. ""Jared called me two days later from Mar-a-Lago to thank me for the collaboration, and we closed the loop on a happy note,"" Bourla wrote. The $1.95 billion deal for the additional 100 million Pfizer vaccine doses — enough to fully inoculate 50 million Americans — was finally struck in December 2021.

3/8/2022,"South Korean YouTuber Ken Rhee says he is in Ukraine to fight, despite Korea's travel ban there. Koreans who enter Ukraine without authorization may be subject to a jail sentence or a fine. ""If I return alive, then I will take responsibility for everything,"" Rhee said on Instagram. Popular South Korean YouTuber and former Korean Navy Seal Ken Rhee said he has landed in Ukraine to fight as a volunteer soldier — despite his government's travel ban to the country. On Instagram, the 37-year-old said in a post early Monday morning that he and his travel mates had initially considered departing for the country ""through official procedures."" ""But we felt strong opposition from the Korean government, and there was some friction,"" noting that he was ""threatened"" with ""being treated as a criminal"" if he ignored Korea's travel ban to Ukraine. ""But punishment cannot stand still in this situation without helping Ukraine with the skills, knowledge, and expertise we have,"" he continued in the post, which was shared alongside a picture of the backs of three men. ""If I return alive, then I will take responsibility for everything and receive the punishment I'm given."" It is unclear who Rhee has left the country with. He did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that it was aware that ""Koreans including Ken Rhee"" have departed the country to join the Ukrainian volunteer army. ""To protect the lives and safety of citizens, as of Feb. 13, the government has issued a Level 4 travel warning throughout Ukraine and has banned Korean citizens from traveling to Ukraine,"" it said. It added that anyone who enters Ukraine without authorization may be subject to a year in prison or a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,150). They would also be required to return their Korean passports and could face challenges applying for a replacement, it said. But Rhee did not seem too concerned by the prospect. In another Instagram post addressed to the Foreign Ministry, he wrote: ""My team has arrived safely in Ukraine. Rather than waste time seeking to invalidate our passports, think about how you can support."" Later, Rhee shared several more posts on the platform, including a picture of a military tent, and one of himself in army gear sitting next to a dog. ""During the Korean War, the world helped Korea,"" he said. ""Now, we will help Ukraine. We cannot just stand by and watch innocent people get hurt and die."" To date, Rhee's YouTube channel has amassed more than 774,000 subscribers, and his videos have gained more than 100 million views. Rhee shot to fame in 2020 after appearing in the YouTube series ""Fake Men,"" where he trained celebrity contestants to complete a brutal regimen designed for the navy's elite forces, per the Korea Herald. As a former Navy Seal himself, he has also shared his expertise as a guest on variety shows in South Korea, the outlet said. In 2020, he was embroiled in controversy when it came to light that he was convicted of sexual assault in 2019. Rhee claims he was wrongfully convicted, per the Korea Herald.

3/8/2022,"By Catherine Belton LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has told Ukraine it is ready to halt military operations ""in a moment"" if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, the Kremlin spokesman said on Monday. Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was demanding that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. It was the most explicit Russian statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt what it calls its ""special military operation"", now in its 12th day. Peskov told Reuters in a telephone interview that Ukraine was aware of the conditions. ""And they were told that all this can be stopped in a moment."" There was no immediate reaction from the Ukrainian side. Russia has attacked Ukraine from the north, east and south, pounding cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and the port of Mariupol. The invasion launched on Feb. 24, has caused the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two, provoked outrage across the world, and led to heavy sanctions on Moscow. But the Kremlin spokesman insisted Russia was not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine and said it was ""not true"" that it was demanding Kyiv be handed over. ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. On the issue of neutrality, Peskov said: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc."" He added: ""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" NEW TALKS The outlining of Russia's demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. It began soon after Putin recognised two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, as independent - an action denounced as illegal by the West. ""This is not us seizing Lugansk and Donetsk from Ukraine. Donetsk and Lugansk don’t want to be part of Ukraine. But it doesn’t mean they should be destroyed as a result,"" Peskov said. ""For the rest. Ukraine is an independent state that will live as it wants, but under conditions of neutrality."" He said all the demands have been formulated and handed over during the first two rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place last week. ""We hope that all this will go OK and they will react in a suitable way,"" Peskov said. Russia had been forced into taking decisive actions to force the demilitarisation of Ukraine, he said, rather than just recognising the independence of the breakaway regions. This was in order to protect the 3 million Russian-speaking population in these republics, who he said were being threatened by 100,000 Ukrainian troops. ""We couldn’t just recognise them. What were we going to do with the 100,000 army that was standing at the border of Donetsk and Lugansk that could attack at any moment. They were being brought U.S. and British weapons all the time,"" he said. In the run-up to the Russian invasion, Ukraine repeatedly and emphatically denied Moscow's assertions that it was about to mount an offensive to take back the separatist regions by force. Peskov said the situation in Ukraine had posed a much greater threat to Russia’s security than it had in 2014, when Russia had also amassed 150,000 troops at its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of a Russian invasion, but had limited its action to the annexation of Crimea. ""Since then the situation has worsened for us. In 2014, they began supplying weapons to Ukraine and preparing the army for NATO, bringing it in line with NATO standards,"" he said. ""In the end what tipped the balance was the lives of these 3 million people in Donbass. We understood they would be attacked."" Peskov said Russia had also had to act in the face of the threat it perceived from NATO, saying it was ""only a matter of time"" before the alliance placed missiles in Ukraine as it had in Poland and Romania. ""We just understood we could not put up with this any more. We had to act,"" he said.

3/8/2022,"A father and daughter visiting Yellowstone National Park for the first time on Saturday enjoyed an exceedingly rare encounter with a wolverine in what their guide described as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. “For the rest of the tour, the 9-year-old daughter couldn’t stop saying, every 15 minutes or so, ‘Wow… we saw a wolverine today!’” MacNeil Lyons, owner of Yellowstone Insight, recalled to For The Win Outdoors. “She told me it was the most amazing day ever in her life.” Lyons captured several images of the elusive critter, which he shared via Facebook. In a Saturday post that included a photo showing the wolverine facing the group from the road, Lyons commented on the rarity of the encounter and added: “It was only 2-3 minutes, but it was as if time stood still. There was for sure a true and focused connection between two sentient beings.” On Sunday, Lyons detailed how he captured the images and said he and his Southern California clients “felt beyond elated at this chance encounter,” considering that the number of wolverines residing inside park boundaries might be a few as seven. (See Facebook post below.) Lyons did not disclose the location of the sighting, but explained that it occurred at 11:38 a.m. as he was rounding a corner. The wolverine, in the oncoming lane, was visible as a “low to-the-ground, dark animal loping away from us.” RELATED: Rare footage shows elusive Yellowstone National Park cougar One of his guests asked if it was a small bear, but Lyons quickly realized that what they were observing “was, indeed, a wolverine!” Perhaps the last time a documented wolverine sighting in Yellowstone National Park generated headlines was January 2021. The park shared video footage captured a month earlier by a motion-sensor trail camera and stated: “Last month, park biologists were excited to find one of Yellowstone’s rarest mammals triggered a remote trail camera outside the Mammoth Hot Springs area!” It was the first video footage of a wolverine captured by a trail camera inside the park. Wolverines, members of the weasel family, reside mostly in high-altitude alpine and forest habitat and can weigh as much as 30 pounds. They prey largely on small mammals and birds, and also eat vegetation. But wolverines can be ferocious and are capable of killing animals many times their size. Wolverines are mostly solitary except during breeding season.

3/8/2022,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Back in August, New Zealand's government put the entire nation on lockdown after a single community case of the coronavirus was detected. On Tuesday, when new daily cases hit a record of nearly 24,000, officials told hospital workers they could help out on understaffed COVID-19 wards even if they were mildly sick themselves. It was the latest sign of just how radically New Zealand's approach to the virus has shifted, moving from elimination to suppression and now to something approaching acceptance as the omicron variant has taken hold. Experts say New Zealand's sometimes counterintuitive actions have likely saved thousands of lives by allowing the nation to mostly avoid earlier, more deadly variants and buying time to get people vaccinated. The nation of 5 million has reported just 65 virus deaths since the pandemic began. But virus hospitalizations have been rapidly rising, hitting a record of more than 750 on Tuesday and putting strain on the system. Across the country, the explosion in cases has left people stunned. Just a month ago, case numbers were around 200 per day. Now, the outbreak is affecting everyone from frontline workers to lawmakers. Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon became the highest profile politician yet to announce he was infected on Monday, saying he felt fine and would continue working from home. One factor that hastened the outbreak was the return of thousands of university students to campuses around the country last month. Ralph Zambrano, the student president at Victoria University of Wellington, said the virus had spread rapidly through hundreds of students in residence halls, taking a toll on their mental health and well-being. “The campus would usually be buzzing at this time of year but it has a very eerie feeling to it,” he said, adding that most students were opting to learn remotely. “There's lots of anxiety and tension.” He said the outbreak had strained the food supply system in the halls, with some students being offered only a protein drink for breakfast or a piece of cold meat and some peas for dinner. The university said case numbers in the halls were now reducing as students recovered. Professor Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, said the variant had proved as ferociously infectious in New Zealand as it had in other countries. He said cases appeared to be plateauing or even starting to dip in the largest city of Auckland, while still rising elsewhere. While much of the world was breathing a sigh of relief  after two years of terrible problems, Baker said, New Zealand was at its worst point yet in the pandemic and was coming to terms with the fact the virus would remain in the country permanently. He said he was concerned health authorities had lost the ability to properly track the outbreak, as they struggled to shift from a system where they carefully monitored a few cases to dealing with thousands of self-reported results from rapid antigen tests. Dr. Caroline McElnay, the director of public health at the Ministry of Health, told reporters the number of hospitalizations would grow, but that patients with omicron generally had less severe illnesses than previous patients had experienced with the delta variant. She said the rising number of both patients and infected health workers had prompted the relaxation in the rules around when health workers could return to hospitals. She said infected workers would only be allowed to work with patients who already had the virus, and if there were no other options. “It's an extra tool that enables our health system to keep running,” she said.",Health/Associated Press,"As virus cases go from 1 to 24,000, New Zealand changes tack",https://news.yahoo.com/virus-cases-1-24-000-054150801.html
3/8/2022,"Japanese scientists have started investigating the mysterious “mermaid mummy” that has long been an object of worship at a temple in Okayama Prefecture.

A team of researchers from the Kurashiki University of Science and the Arts are conducting scientific analyses of the mummified remains of the mysterious icon to determine what they are actually composed of.

The “mermaid mummy,” which measures around 1 foot, has earned its name for having an upper body that appears to be human and a lower body that looks like a fish tail.

The 300-year-old mummy, which has retained its nails, teeth and hair over the years, has also maintained the eerie expression of a screaming child.

Kozen Kuida, the chief priest at Enjuin temple in the city of Asakuchi, took out the artifact from the wooden box where it has been stored inside the school’s veterinary hospital for an examination on Feb. 2.

“We have worshiped it, hoping that it would help alleviate the coronavirus pandemic even if only slightly,” the head priest was quoted by Asahi Shimbun as saying. “I hope the research project can leave (scientific) records for future generations.”

According to Kuida, the mummy had been put on display for public viewing about 40 years ago, but it was recently stored in a fireproof safe so it won’t deteriorate.

A note inside the box claims that the mysterious creature was caught in a fishing net on the coast of Tosa Province (now Kochi Prefecture) between 1736 and 1741. The mummy was passed on to other owners after the turn of the Meiji Era (1868-1912) and ended up being acquired by the Enjuin temple.

The remains are to be studied from a variety of academic perspectives. Hiroshi Kinoshita, a 54-year-old board member of the Okayama Folklore Society, will study the mummy from the viewpoint of folklore studies, while Takafumi Kato, a 54-year-old paleontology professor, will conduct morphology analysis on the upper body of the artifact. Meanwhile, an associate professor that specializes in ichthyology will study the fish-like lower body, and an associate professor with expertise in molecular biology will do the DNA analysis.

The researchers are set to release their findings in fall of this year.

3/8/2022,"A Russian oligarch told the captain of his yacht to sail from France to Turkey ASAP, per the WSJ. Igor Sechin's yacht was docked in France when he was sanctioned after Russia invaded Ukraine. French authorities tied the yacht down so it couldn't leave, a customs officer told The Journal. Igor Sechin, a Russian billionaire and oligarch, told the captain of his now-seized superyacht to leave a French port and sail to Turkey as fast as possible after he was hit with sanctions, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. The US and the European Union put Sechin, who is said to be a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on their sanctions lists shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Sechin is also known as Russia's ""Darth Vader."" The report on Sechin's orders offers a glimpse into how the wealthiest Russians who were targeted by sanctions sought to move their yachts and private jets across the world after the invasion of Ukraine in order to protect their assets. Eric Salles, a lead officer on the seizure operation, said in an interview with The Journal that French customs officers found out last week that the yacht was preparing to leave the French town of La Ciotat despite having repair work scheduled. Customs officers also heard the yacht was owned by Sechin, CEO of Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft, Salles added. The customs officers went to the yacht and questioned the captain, Salles said in the interview. The captain told officers that he had orders to leave the French port and ""sail to Turkey as quickly as possible,"" Salles told The Journal. After hearing this information, French authorities tied the yacht to the quay with steel-rope slings so it couldn't leave, Salles told The Journal. Officers proceeded to check documents, further question the captain and crew, and surveil the vessel 24/7, Salles added. Sechin's yacht was officially seized by the authorities on Wednesday night, according to a press release tweeted by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire. The yacht's captain — still on board the vessel with other crew members — wasn't arrested, Salles told The Journal. Sechin is among several high-profile Russian business executives who have been sanctioned by the EU, US, UK, and others because of their ties to Putin. Gennady Timchenko, a Putin confidant, and Alexei Mordashov, reportedly the wealthiest man in Russia, had their superyachts seized by officials in Italy, The Associated Press reported on Friday.

3/8/2022,"(Updates lede with more information about Michael Ferkol's former role in U.S. Army.) By Andrew R.C. Marshall LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Michael Ferkol, who who once served as a supply specialist with engineer battalions in the U.S. Army, had been in Rome studying archaeology when he heard the Ukrainian president's appeal for foreign fighters. Within days, Ferkol said, he presented himself at a military recruiting office in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, hoping to be taken on as a frontline paramedic. ""I told them I wanted to triage patients,"" said the 29-year- old, who has no combat experience. ""There was a Finnish guy there too, and he was like, 'I just want to kill Russians.'"" Ukraine has established an ""international"" legion for people from abroad and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has publicly urged foreigners to ""fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals"" to show support for his country. Last week, Zelenskiy said that more than 16,000 foreigners had volunteered, without specifying how many had arrived. Some foreign fighters arriving in Ukraine say they are attracted by the cause: to halt what they view as an unprovoked attack in a once-in-a-generation showdown between the forces of democracy and dictatorship. For others, many of them veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Ukraine war also offers a chance to use fighting skills they felt their own governments no longer appreciated. Reuters interviewed 20 foreign fighters or others involved in the effort, and some said that Ukraine is struggling to vet, equip and deploy them. And alongside battle-hardened veterans of war, people are arriving with little or no combat experience, offering limited value in a war zone under constant, terrifying shelling by the Russian military. One man who identified himself as British military veteran referred to these recruits as ""bullet-catchers."" A senior Ukrainian official in Lviv involved in processing newly-arrived foreign volunteers, Roman Shepelyak, said the system to receive, train and deploy foreign fighters was still in its infancy, and that the process would get smoother in the coming days. Ukraine's defence ministry declined to comment. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and capture dangerous nationalists. Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered by Russia's but have mounted significant resistance. Among those who have arrived to fight for Ukraine are dozens of former soldiers from the British Army's elite Parachute Regiment, according to an ex-soldier from the regiment. Hundreds more would soon follow, he said. Reuters was unable to corroborate those numbers. Often referred to as the Paras, the regiment has in recent years served in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""They're all highly, highly trained, and have seen active service on numerous occasions,"" the ex-soldier from the regiment said. The Ukraine crisis will give them purpose, camaraderie and ""a chance to do what they're good at: fight."" Michael Ferkol said there were many people with Ukrainian ancestry in his hometown, Chicago. He wanted to go to Kyiv, the capital, ""and help out."" ""I'm a little nervous, to be honest,"" he said, making his way through crowds of refugees at Lviv train station on Saturday, hoping to board a train to the frontline. ""But at the same time, it's not about me. It's about the people that are suffering."" 'HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL' For some, travelling to Ukraine, even from far-away countries, was the easy part. Those who hadn't brought body armour, helmets and other equipment with them were struggling to source them in Ukraine, according to several fighters Reuters spoke to. Some veterans were sharing information on equipment and logistics through invite-only Facebook or WhatsApp groups with names like ""Have Gun Will Travel."" These groups contain appeals for equipment, such as body armour and night-vision goggles, or for foreign veterans who are snipers or who can train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use sophisticated weapons that Western countries are sending. With a vast mobilisation of Ukrainian men underway, the country has plenty of volunteer fighters. But there is a shortage of specialists who know how to use Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missiles, which professional soldiers train for months to use properly. Even those with combat experience might struggle in Ukraine's war zones, warned a former British soldier, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Kruger. He said he had served in Afghanistan and trained other soldiers. ""If you're out here as a war tourist, this is not the place for you,"" he said. ""The realities of war, if you head out to the front, are going to be pretty overwhelming."" Many of those arriving in Lviv end up at the semi-fortified offices of the Lviv regional administration, where their paperwork is checked by Shepelyak. He heads the region's department for international technical assistance and cooperation. He acknowledged the system for processing those offering to fight was still in its infancy. On Friday, when Reuters visited, six foreigners appeared at Shepelyak's office, including a Polish military veteran called Michal, and a giant, heavily-tattooed Dutchman called Bert. Both men declined to give their full names. More foreigners were arriving every day, Shepelyak told Reuters. ""If they have such a desire and persuasion to serve a foreign country, it matters. They are important."" Shepelyak said he vetted their paperwork, but not their combat experience, which was evaluated at a military base outside Lviv where they were sent next. He added that those recruited into the Ukrainian army would be paid in line with other soldiers. Other foreign fighters told Reuters they were bypassing the formal processes and heading straight for the eastern front, hoping to get weapons and orders from the Ukrainian military upon their arrival. DELAYED DEPARTURES The logistical issues have prompted some fighters to delay their arrival. Anthony Capone, a wealthy healthcare entrepreneur in New York City, said he is providing funding for hundreds of ex-soldiers and paramedics who want to go to Ukraine. But he said he had delayed their departure ""to give the Ukrainian army another week to improve their enlistment process for those entering the volunteer corps."" So far, according to Capone, only a ""small number"" had arrived in neighbouring Poland. Capone had posted on LinkedIn his message offering funding, thinking that 10 or 15 people would reply. ""Right now, I'm at about 1,000,"" he said. Capone added he was only funding ex-soldiers whose military credentials he could verify, or paramedics who currently worked in an emergency trauma setting. About 60% of those who had been in touch were American and 30% European, with the remainder hailing from at least 25 countries as far-flung as Colombia, Japan and Jamaica, Capone said. Most were ex-soldiers; the rest were emergency medics or critical care nurses. They're willing to ""defend a country they've never visited,"" said Capone, a specialist in computational learning theory. The U.S. government has discouraged citizens from travelling to Ukraine to combat Russian forces. Some countries have issued stronger warnings, including Britain. Others, such as Canada or Germany, have cleared the way for their citizens to get involved. A CONNECTION IN KYIV In central Lviv on Thursday, a burly, Russian-speaking Canadian, who identified himself only as Sig, heaved bags of equipment into the back of a minivan he had bought in Poland and driven to Lviv. He wore a flak jacket bristling with medical tools, and said he usually worked as a civilian paramedic. Another of Sig's four-strong team was an American who said he was born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and had fought Russians ""for generations."" In Sig's bags were hundreds of kilograms of equipment, including medical supplies and military rations known as MREs, or meals ready to eat. Sig said his team planned to help train Ukrainian volunteers in Lviv for a day, before heading straight for the front. ""I have a connection in Kyiv who will help us out,"" he said. Standing outside the ticket hall of Lviv station on Sunday were a group of British men in military uniform, waiting for a train to Kyiv. They were in high spirits, often exchanging fist-bumps and handshakes with Ukrainian refugees who thanked them for fighting for their country. They were led by Ben Grant, a strapping Englishman from Essex, who said he had served in Britain's Royal Marines and had just completed a stint as a security advisor in Iraq. He was unclear whether his men would be deployed independently or as part of a Ukrainian unit. Of the Ukrainian soldiers, Grant added: ""They seem strong - really strong. I'm more than happy to fight next to them."" (Reporting by Andrew R. C.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Blood type doesn’t affect much in our daily lives. In fact, most people don’t even know whether they’re Type A, B, AB, or O. But the seemingly-banal detail might be a factor in who comes under the thumb of 2020’s world-wide tyrant—that is, coronavirus. A new study in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid-19. Researchers in China first shared this idea back in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people (by far the biggest study population yet) who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, those with type O were more protected. Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely. ""It's pretty clear that Type O is protective to some degree. I don't think that having Type A or Type B is the problem—it's just that they don't have Type O,"" says Mark Udden, MD, professor of hematology and oncology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So people with Type A may be more likely to catch the virus, but whether they also get it worse is still unclear: the NEJM study reports that people with Type A blood were also more likely to have respiratory failure. However, the research out of Columbia University found there wasn’t really any difference among intubations or death and different blood types. And a 2020 study in the Annals of Hematology looked specifically at the link between blood types and the need for intubation or death in confirmed COVID-19 patients. They found no link between blood type and the severity of the illness. The new research in Blood Advances, mentioned above, had similar findings. Although true to the unending questions around the disease, another, smaller study, also in Blood Advances, suggested that blood types A or AB had higher risk of certain intense interventions and longer ICU stays, but the researchers themselves considered the link to be so far “unresolved.” We don’t know why people with Type O might possibly be more protected—but there are a lot of theories. The most basic idea is that blood type might influence a person’s ability to fight the virus, says David Aronoff, M.D., director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. It may affect your immune system’s strength or your inflammatory response to the infection. Either way, that would color how likely you are to not only get the virus but also how strong your symptoms are, he explains. The NEJM paper, however, highlights the antibodies we produce depending on blood type. “If you’re type O, you naturally make antibodies against Type A and Type B,” Dr. Udden says. These Type A antibodies might make it more difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to attach to its receptor in Type O blood and multiply in the body, he explains. But there’s another interesting layer to a potential protective element in Type O blood: something called von Willebrand factor, which is a glycoprotein in charge of repairing damage to blood vessels by prompting your blood to clot. We know the COVID-19 virus damages the lining of your blood vessels. Your body then releases von Willebrand factor, or VWF, into your blood so it can fix the damage to the vessel walls. But VWF also encourages clotting. “In COVID-19 patients who die, we're seeing unusually high clotting issues, like strokes, kidney failure, and pulmonary embolisms—so we know there is a clotting problem that stems from the virus,” Dr. Udden says. A 2020 analysis in The Lancet found that compared to COVID-19 patients who weren’t in intensive care, those who were critically ill in the ICU and died had higher VWF antigens in their blood. And guess what: People with Type A blood have higher levels of VWF naturally than people with type O blood, Dr. Udden points out. In addition, people who are Black, who are dying at a disproportionately high rate from COVID-19, tend to have higher levels of VWF, too. Just because you’re Type O doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. All studies so far have only looked at blood type in connection to symptomatic cases of coronavirus, Dr. Aronoff points out. We don’t know about asymptomatic carriers—that is, Type O could still pass along the virus to other people unknowingly just as much as Type A could. ""There are two possibilities: You're Type O so you might not contract the virus because it has no landing strip—there's nothing to attach to,"" Dr. Udden explains. ""Or by being Type O, the virus gets in but the A antibody prevents it from docking with enough cells to cause disease. But the virus is still in your system and you can still pass it to someone else."" No. Blood type is actually a pretty weak player, Dr. Udden says. Socio-economic status is a big vulnerability—likely to need to work outside the home, in crowded buildings, and living in tighter quarters with more family members. Age and health are next in line for susceptibility. If you’re older or have an underlying disease like cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, you’re more likely to develop a severe case of coronavirus, Dr. Udden adds. Blood type is after all of these. People with Type O blood might be slightly more protected from the virus, and people with Type A slightly more vulnerable. But, as far as we know, everyone is still at risk of getting the virus, and definitely at risk of being an asymptomatic carrier—and therefore of spreading it to others. The discovery of Type O’s protective effect is crucial to building an understanding of how the virus works—especially considering there aren’t many other patterns it follows, Dr. Udden points out. But both docs agree it shouldn’t actually change anyone’s behavior. “I’m Type O, and I’m not going to go hang out in bars just because of this slight protective effect,” Dr. Udden says. “These findings shouldn’t change your behavior. Anyone can still get ill with SARS-CoV-2 and/or participate in the chain of transmission,” Dr. Aronoff adds. The bottom line is clear: The safest and most effective way to prevent from getting coronavirus or unknowingly spreading it to others is to keep wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and socially distancing from people—regardless of your blood type.

3/8/2022,"No-nonsense White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday used “facts” to shoot down hectoring questions on mounting gasoline prices from Fox News reporter Peter Doocy. “I know that can be inconvenient,” she noted sarcastically. Doocy pressed her on fuel prices as he dismissed the widely held position that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the recent leap in costs — and instead blamed Biden administration policies. “There’s no question” the price hikes are a “direct result of the invasion of Ukraine,” Psaki responded. “Federal policies are not limiting the supplies of oil and gas,” she added. When Doocy interrupted her, Psaki fired back: “Peter, let me give you the facts here. I know that can be inconvenient, but I think they’re important in this moment.” Biden administration officials have been “clear” about the need for the U.S. oil supply to meet demand while also pushing for a shift to renewable energy sources, she said. Psaki pointed out that the U.S. is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and gas, noting that oil production in the nation is at “record numbers.” Meanwhile, there are “9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used, so the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate,” Psaki added. “I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more.” Check out the Doocy exchange in the video clip up top.

3/8/2022,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan hit out on Sunday at Islamabad-based Western envoys who last week urged Pakistan to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, asking them if they thought Pakistan was their ""slave"". The heads of 22 diplomatic missions, including those of European Union member states, released a joint letter on March 1 urging Pakistan to support a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The move to release the letter publicly was rare. ""What do you think of us? Are we your slaves ... that whatever you say, we will do?"" Khan said while addressing a political rally. In the event, Pakistan, a traditional ally of the West, abstained from voting as the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly reprimanded Russia for invading Ukraine. ""I want to ask the European Union ambassadors: Did you write such a letter to India?"" Khan said, noting that Pakistan's arch-rival had also abstained. Khan also said European countries had not censured India for its actions in Kashmir, a mountainous region over which Pakistan and India have fought two wars. He said Pakistan had suffered because it had supported the Western NATO alliance in Afghanistan, and instead of gratitude faced criticism. Khan and his government found themselves in the spotlight after he went ahead with a visit to Moscow in late February as fears of an invasion were growing, and met Vladimir Putin a few hours after the Russian president had ordered his troops into Ukraine.

3/8/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine — With hands still dirty from the battlefield, a dozen Russian prisoners of war sat, stony-faced, in a conference room of a Ukrainian news agency Saturday and described being captured after their armored columns were ambushed. Lt. Dmitry Kovalensky, who had fought in a Russian tank unit and spoke at the behest of his Ukrainian captors, said he recently came under fire from an armed drone and shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles on a road near Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. “The whole column burned,” he said. Around the same time and a few miles away, at a makeshift Ukrainian military base in an abandoned building on the western edge of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers prepared for the same sort of ambushes that took out Kovalensky’s unit. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Lt. Yevgeny Yarantsev of Ukraine said his country’s soldiers fight differently than the Russians. The troops under his command organize in small, nimble units that can sneak up on and ambush the lumbering columns of Russian tanks. “They have a lot of tanks, we have a lot of anti-tank weapons,” said Yarantsev, who previously fought with a volunteer group against Russia in eastern Ukraine. “In the open field, it will be even. It’s easier to fight in the city.” The two young officers — the same rank, but each representing a different country — gave some of the few firsthand accounts of the fighting that have emerged in the 10-day war. The Russian was a prisoner of war speaking under the watchful eye of heavily armed Ukrainian security officials. The Ukrainian spoke as he displayed newly obtained, sophisticated weapons from the United States. The accounts of soldiers from both sides give a small glimpse of how the war is being fought around Kyiv in the north. There, relying largely on ambush tactics, Ukrainian forces have slowed the Russian campaign to encircle and capture the capital, even as Russian troops barrel across the south. Kovalensky and the other Russian prisoners were presented at a news conference intended to support Ukraine’s claim that it had captured a significant number of Russian soldiers. In their statements, the prisoners blended woodenly phrased condemnations of their own country’s leadership with genuine-sounding details of the conflict’s early firefights. According to the rules governing treatment of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions, governments are supposed to protect a prisoner of war from being made into a “public curiosity,” a concept that is sometimes interpreted as not presenting them in any public setting. The Russian soldiers looked exhausted but showed no outward signs of having been mistreated. The prisoners’ comments and the fact of their capture supported descriptions by Western military analysts and governments of a Russian offensive that has suffered grave setbacks. The Russian army’s superior numbers and equipment, however, could well reverse that trend. “Near the end of the day’s movement on Feb. 27, our column was attacked,” Pvt. Dmitry Gagarin of the Russian army told reporters. “My commander burned and died. I ran into the forest and later surrendered to local people.” Kovalensky said he learned Russia would invade Ukraine only the evening before the tank columns began moving, and that soldiers at the rank of sergeant and lower were not told where they were driving until after crossing the border. All the prisoners described being captured after their armored columns were ambushed on roads, accounts that supported Ukraine’s assertions that its military had made good use of Western-supplied anti-tank weaponry, such as the U.S.-made Javelin missile. But independent analysts have also described more mundane problems for the Russian army, including logistical snarls and a lack of fuel. Yarantsev commands what he described as a mobile group of about 500 soldiers who are skirmishing with the Russians on the western approach to Kyiv. He said the group's prospects were bolstered three days ago when they received Barrett 50-caliber sniper rifles in a shipment from the United States. Sleek and black, with barrels so long they look almost like spears, the rifles were being unpacked and inspected. One sniper, who declined to offer his name, said he had fired one in combat on the outskirts of Kyiv. Yarantsev said the troops were more comfortable being able to garrison in buildings than in fields or forests. “I’ve noticed something about war,” he said. “Soldiers want to be somewhere where cellphones work and where there is internet.” The building where the soldiers were garrisoned, in a leafy residential area of the city, was cluttered with ammunition boxes. Two hand grenades sat on the floor beside a sofa. The soldiers had an electric kettle and offered coffee. In a hallway, a soldier oiled his Kalashnikov rifle. The fighting has been inching closer to the capital. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in a statement Saturday that the Russian forces’ primary objective is to encircle Kyiv, following the tactic they have pursued with smaller cities such as Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, which is now surrounded with its heat and electricity cut off. The fighting around Kyiv is mostly in Irpin and Bucha, two outlying towns to the northwest, where conditions are grim. A central street in Bucha is clogged with the burned husks of Russian armored personnel carriers, destroyed in an ambush. Stanislav Bobrytsky, a computer programmer reached by phone in Irpin, said he had not left his apartment since Tuesday. “All the windows are shaking” from blasts, he said. “It’s very scary.” In the center of Kyiv, at the news conference with captured Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian security officials present refused to speak. A moderator passed around a microphone, offering reporters an opportunity to question the prisoners. Kovalensky said he was appealing to the Russian people to rise up and overthrow President Vladimir Putin because the Russian leadership had deceived the army’s officers about the aims of the war and had used the guise of a military exercise to prepare for an invasion. The prisoners said they did not know what would happen to them after the news conference. While they said they were treated well, days after their capture it was unclear if they had showered or been offered clean clothes. © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,Russian Prisoners and Ukrainian Soldiers Describe Two Sides of the Conflict,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-prisoners-ukrainian-soldiers-describe-152726500.html

3/8/2022,"A former foreign minister in the Kremlin has said Vladimir Putin isn't insane and will not intentionally use nuclear weapons against the West. Andrei Kozyrev, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1996, said Putin is ""rational"" and is acting on misguided information from his own military, rather than being hellbent on destroying the West. He tweeted that the view among some in the West that Putin is being ""irrational"" in his decision to invade Ukraine is not accurate. He said: ""I disagree. It’s horrific, but not irrational."" Instead, Kozyrev argues, Putin has been convinced by his own advisers and propaganda machine that Ukraine is being run by Nazis, and that the West has been behind Kyiv wanting to grow further away from the influence of the Kremlin. Read more: Russia 'drops cluster bombs on civilian houses and Ukrainian zoo' He has also believed the mistruths fed to him by corrupt Russian military officials, Kozyrev added. ""The Kremlin spent the last 20 years trying to modernise its military,"" he said, ""Much of that budget was stolen and spent on mega-yachts in Cyprus. But as a military advisor you cannot report that to the President. So they reported lies to him instead."" The way the West had dealt with Russia in the past led to Putin's belief they were ""toothless"", and wouldn't fight back, he said. Instead, Moscow has had to contend with swingeing sanctions imposed by the UK, US, Canada and the EU, including sweeping sanctions against Putin himself, his ministers, oligarchs, individuals close to the Kremlin, banks, and key businesses. Russia’s economy has also come under immense pressure from the international sanctions, with the rouble dropping to its lowest-ever value, weakening to 133.5 to the dollar -s a 40% drop in value compared to before the invasion. ""He miscalculated on all three, but that doesn’t make him insane. Simply wrong and immoral,"" Kozyrev said. Read more: Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions It is widely believed that Russia's invasion has not gone to plan, with Putin left angry and frustrated by the slow progress made by his forces in the opening days of the conflict. Russia has since stoked fears of a nuclear conflict with the West, with Putin putting Moscow's nuclear forces on ""high alert"", and conducting submarine drills in the Black Sea. Moscow's current foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, further fanned the flames further last week, saying a world war sparked by the current crisis ""will become nuclear"". Despite this, Kozyrev has insisted Putin is simply using the nuclear threat as his ""last remaining card in the deck"" to extract concessions from Ukraine and the West.

""In my opinion, he is rational. Given that he is rational, I strongly believe he will not intentionally use nuclear weapons against the West. I say intentionally because indiscriminate shelling near a nuclear power plant can cause an unintentional nuclear disaster in Ukraine."" The invasion of Ukraine has shown no signs of stopping, with Putin facing accusations of war crimes and of indiscriminately bombing civilian men, women and children. Even after agreeing a ceasefire so civilians could be evacuated, so-called safe routes were shelled by Russian forces in Irpin on Sunday, killing civilians who were trying to flee to safety.  Putin's invasion has triggered the worst refugee crisis since World War Two, displacing around 1.5 million people.

On Saturday, Kellogg said that ""Putin does not bluff"" while speaking on the Fox News show ""Lawrence Jones Cross Country"" about the Russian leader's potential use of heavy artillery bombardment and cluster bombs on Ukraine. ""Putin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back then. We didn't. We waited,"" he said.

This is not an easy topic to talk about, but it's so important. People should not die from embarrassment, and I think people are dying because they don’t want to go to their doctor and talk about the symptoms. It took me a long time to go in and say something is not right. I have always been a human who has lived more on the constipated side, so irregular bowel movements have been kind of my jam for forever. In 2016, I noticed mucuosy substances in my stool. It was different, but not concerning. Then I started having intermittent bleeding with my bowel movements. That, in conjunction with my constipation, equaled hemorrhoids in my brain. I had no stomach issues, no weight loss, no fatigue and all of my labs looked fine. There was nothing that would indicate that I had a tumor growing in my rectum, other than the constipation and the bright red blood in my stool. I hadn’t given much thought to colorectal cancer. Why would I? I was in my early 40s, I’m active, I exercise, I eat well, I don’t smoke. There were absolutely no risk factors and no family history that would make me think, ""Oh, you probably have cancer."" That’s why it took me way too long to go to the doctor. It took getting to the point where I was bleeding every time I had a bowel movement for me to just be tired of it. I remember mentioning it to my OB, who said to get it checked out. Video: Black Health nonprofit encourages screenings for colorectal cancer A group called Black Health is working to educate people about the risks of colorectal cancer and urging people to get screened at any early age. Their focus on colorectal cancer came after the death of Chadwick Boseman at the age of 43, and also after a study came through that there was an increase of cases in the Black community. TODAY’s Craig Melvin reports and spreads awareness on colorectal cancer. That was in May 2016, but I didn’t go to the doctor until January 2017. She did a rectal exam and didn’t feel any hemorrhoids, but gave me a suppository substance see if that would help. It slowed the bleeding down, but it did not stop it. I was then scheduled for a colonoscopy. I remember waking up from that and hearing the doctors say, “We found something very low in your rectum. It’s pretty ugly tissue.” My dad died of esophageal cancer, so when someone says ugly tissue, I know what that looks like. There were photos along with the colonoscopy report and it was certainly not the bright pink, healthy, happy tissue that you imagine that your insides look like. The doctor called the next day, which happened to be my child’s 15th birthday, and told me the tissue was cancerous. The tumor was significant, blocking 80 to 85% of my rectum. I was immediately sent to oncology at Lawrence Memorial Hospital. Scans revealed it was stage 4 colorectal cancer — it had spread beyond my rectum to both my lungs. I was in chemo treatments within two weeks of learning my diagnosis. Ultimately, the chemo took care of almost all of the cancer in my lungs and it shrunk the tumor. I had a rectal resection in August 2017. But there was a spot in my right lung that didn’t get smaller, it just stayed. A subsequent scan showed that it grew just a tiny bit. I had stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on that spot in February of 2018 — five sessions over five days. You don’t move during this therapy — they make a mold of your body so you lay in a very specific position every single time. I have two boys so I liked to think about “Star Wars” while the machine was doing its thing — like “pew pew” lasers zapping my cancer spot. In January of 2020, I had a scan that revealed another spot in that right lung, so I went through another round of SBRT. Today, I am just celebrating the fact that I am still alive. It’s pretty miraculous that someone with stage 4 colorectal cancer can say that at five years. I am still having clear scans right now. Cancer had already impacted our family and when that happens, there is a shift because life is precious and you don’t really recognize that until you have a life-altering diagnosis. When I was first diagnosed, I thought, ""You have to see your oldest kid graduate from high school."" So I’ve been just checking these boxes. My next checkbox is in May — my younger son is graduating from high school, so that’s what I’m going for. I’ll keep adding checkboxes to my list, like college graduations. I’m just making lots of memories and raising awareness. People don’t want to go to the doctor and say, “I’ve got mucus in my poop. What’s that about?” But people should not die from embarrassment. If I can talk about my experience and that gets one person to the doctor before I went to the doctor, I have done my job.

3/8/2022,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — A top Iranian official said Monday that his country is seeking “creative ways” to restore its nuclear deal with world powers after Russia's foreign minister linked sanctions on Moscow over its war on Ukraine to the ongoing negotiations. The tweet by Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's powerful Supreme National Security Council, offers the first high-level acknowledgment of the demands of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “Vienna participants act & react based on interests and it’s understandable,” Shamkhani wrote. “Our interactions ... are also solely driven by our people’s interests. Thus, we’re assessing new elements that bear on the negotiations and will accordingly seek creative ways to expedite a solution.” Shamkhani later tweeted criticism of the United States; earlier, he avoided directly mentioning Russia. In recent days, negotiators on all sides in Vienna had signaled that a potential deal was close as the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agreed to a timetable with Iran for it to answer the watchdog's long-standing questions about Tehran's program. But Lavrov on Saturday said he wanted “guarantees at least at the level of the secretary of state” that the U.S. sanctions would not affect Moscow’s relationship with Tehran. That threw into question the months of negotiations held so far on restoring the 2015 deal, which saw Iran agree to drastically limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Lavrov's demand “irrelevant” as the nuclear deal and sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine war were “totally different.” The United States under then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018, setting off years of tensions and attacks across the Mideast. “Getting out of the deal was one of the worst mistakes that’s been made in recent years. It let the entire Iranian nuclear program that we put in a box out of the box,” Blinken told CBS' “Face the Nation"" talk show. “And so if there’s a way of getting back to reimplementing that deal effectively, it’s in our interest to do it and we’re working on that as we speak. It’s also in Russia’s interest.” Speaking on Monday in Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said that “peaceful nuclear cooperation” between China, Iran and Russia shouldn't be limited by sanctions. China and Russia are part of the deal, which also includes Germany, Britain and France. The U.S. has sat out of the talks since its withdrawal. “So far Russia had shown a constructive approach for reaching a collective agreement in Vienna and we interpret what they say in this framework,” he said. ""We will wait for them to give us more details in Vienna.” He added Iran and the U.S. continued to negotiate on a possible prisoner swap, like one that accompanied the earlier nuclear deal. “The remaining differences are less than fingers of a hand — if no one adds a new issue,"" Khatibzadeh said. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian also weighed in, vowing that Tehran “will not allow any foreign factor to affect the national interests of the country in the Vienna talks,” according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Amirabdollahian and Lavrov spoke by phone later Monday about the nuclear deal negotiations. Meanwhile, the state-owned, English-language Tehran Times newspaper on Monday published an article suggesting the draft nuclear deal in Vienna would allow Iran to “keep its advanced centrifuges and nuclear materials inside the country.” It’s “a form of inherent guarantee to make sure that its nuclear program is fully reversible if the U.S. reneged on its commitments again,” the newspaper said, without providing a source for the information. The 2015 nuclear deal saw Iran put advanced centrifuges into storage under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency, while keeping its enrichment at 3.67% purity and its stockpile at only 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of uranium. As of Feb. 19, the IAEA says Iran’s stockpile of all enriched uranium was nearly 3200 kilograms (7,055 pounds). Some has been enriched up to 60% purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Speaking from Vienna, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said any possible renewed nuclear deal would be a “very complex agreement” with a number of steps and sequences. He also acknowledged his inspectors faced a challenging task filling in the gaps left by Iran holding IAEA surveillance tapes and limiting access amid the tensions. Inspector have to make sure everything “is perfectly accounted for to the gram,” Grossi said. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",World/Associated Press,Iran seeks 'creative ways' to nuke deal after Russian demand,https://news.yahoo.com/iran-seeks-creative-ways-nuke-073444199.html

3/8/2022,"Former child star Ricky Schroder, last seen harassing Costco workers who asked him to wear a mask in the store, had another public meltdown over rules intended to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This time, Schroeder flipped out on security guards who asked him to wear a mask before entering the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum in Abilene, Kansas, calling them Nazis and telling them they should only enforce “God’s law.” The video, shared on Instagram by Schroder and on Twitter by Patriot Takes, which monitors right-wing media, showed Schroder berating the guards. “Evil federal government, right?” he asked the guards. “That’s your opinion,” one of the guards replied. “That is my opinion,” Schroder said. “God’s laws are higher than the federal government’s, but you’re going to enforce man’s laws?” After a brief exchange, he told the security guards they “don’t know God,” called them Nazis and stormed out: Patriot Takes also posted other videos of Schroder. “We’re not gonna live as slaves,” he declared in one clip. Schroder made his name as a child actor in the 1980s sitcom “Silver Spoons.” As an adult, he is best known for his three seasons on “NYPD Blue.” But it’s Schroder’s right-wing politics that caused his name to trend on Twitter on Sunday: “I have just one purpose … and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right-wing wants a fight, they are going to get it … either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won’t be with them anymore.”

3/8/2022,"Russia has issued a list of demands for Ukraine to follow if its invasion is to come to an end. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave Moscow's most explicit statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt its ""special military operation"", which is now in its 12th day. Pesko said Ukraine must: Cease military action Change its constitution to enshrine neutrality Acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory Recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent territories. The outlining of Russia’s demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks. Peskov said that, if those conditions are met, Russia's military action will halt ""in a moment"". He added: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc. This is possible only by making changes to the constitution."" He also insisted Russia was not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine. Peskov said the Ukraine was aware of the conditions, adding that they were told ""that all this can be stopped in a moment."" ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. ""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognize that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" It is not yet clear how receptive the Ukrainian government will be to the demands. By changing its constitution to enshrine neutrality, Ukraine would be unable to join Nato - a key move the Kremlin is keen to ensure. Ukraine has been keen to join the EU, with leaders from the bloc meeting this week to discuss Zelenskyy's bid to join this week. The chairman of EU summits Charles Michel tweeted on Monday: ""The EU's solidarity, friendship and unprecedented assistance for Ukraine are unwavering. We will discuss Ukraine's membership application in coming days."" Watch: Zelenskyy calls for harsher Russian sanctions Vladimir Putin reportedly thought his invasion would take a matter of days, but was met with a strong resistance from Ukrainian Armed Forces and civilians. Boris Johnson said on Monday that Russia's invasion breaches Ukrainian sovereignty. The prime minister said Putin's recognition of the independence of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine is ""a repudiation of the Minsk process and the Minsk agreements."" Speaking at Downing Street, Johnson said the UK ""will continue to do everything we can to stand by the people of Ukraine with a very robust package of sanctions."" ""They will be triggered with the first toecap of a Russian incursion or Russian invasion. But plainly what has happened is extremely bad news. ""We will be urgently talking to our friends and allies around the world, all of whom are jointly signed up with us in this package of sanctions."" On Wednesday, Russia admitted for the first time admitted it had suffered heavy losses, saying in a statement 498 of its troops had died. The UK has the death toll will be “considerably higher” than figures released by the Kremlin. The United Nations has opposed any Russian claim to Donetsk and Lugansk and it has also condemned the annexation of Crime by Moscow in 2014. Russia has increasingly been seen by the international community as a ""global pariah"" following the invasion on 24 February. Read more: Russia to open humanitarian corridors in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities An emergency UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly for a resolution deploring Russia's invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces, with longstanding allies Cuba and Venezuela joining China in abstaining. The only countries to vote no in support of Moscow were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. The outlining of Russia's demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. It began soon after Putin recognized two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, as independent - an action denounced as illegal by the West. Putin's invasion has triggered the worst refugee crisis since World War Two, displacing around 1.5 million people. Ukrainian cities have come under almost constant bombardments, with Ukrainian officials estimating that over 2,000 civilians - including children - have been killed in the violence. Russia agreed to a ceasefire over the weekend so people could be evacuated from their homes. Attempts at an evacuation in Mariupol were stopped on Sunday after men, women, and children were targeted with shells as they tried to flee. International attention has focused on Irpin, a Kyiv suburb where residents have been scrambling across a river to flee Russian bombardment. Eight people were killed - including two children from the same family - Ukrainian authorities said, after Russian shells hit a damaged bridge they were attempting to cross.",News/Yahoo News UK,Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-says-military-action-will-stop-immediately-if-ukraine-agrees-to-four-conditions-121826715.html
