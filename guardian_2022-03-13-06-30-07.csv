3/13/2022,"So it wasn’t one of the great victories. But it may just go down as one of the great defeats. The game should have been as good as over before it had even really started, cut short by a red card after Charlie Ewels’ reckless tackle on James Ryan. The crowd didn’t like it, and booed long and loudly after Mathieu Raynal made the decision. But of course the referee was right. The fans’ frustration overwhelmed everything they’ve learned in the last few years about the long-term consequences of those kinds of collisions. But really, all that knowledge about the risks meant there was no room for forgiveness. Ewels had every opportunity to go lower. It was a dangerous mistake. As the remaining England players pulled themselves into a huddle, the pressing question for them was what the hell they were going to do now, a man down and the whole game stretching ahead of them. Some of it England had already planned for in training. Courtney Lawes moved up to lock and Jack Nowell, who Eddie Jones has always said (and only half joking) is capable of playing flanker, really did pack down there during the scrums. But the issue was bigger than which patterns they were going to switch to, who was going to play where, and how they were going to plug the gaps. The match had just become a test of their character, cohesion and leadership. Which are issues Jones has been worrying over, and working on, for the last year and more, ever since the 2019 World Cup final against South Africa, when, thrown off by the early loss of Kyle Sinckler with a head injury, England crumbled under pressure from a side who were not just better than them, but who seemed to have a stronger sense of purpose and a greater strength of character, too. Jones has spent a lot of time and effort trying to develop the leadership group in this team since that, he’s promoted Lawes, Tom Curry, Ellis Genge, and Henry Slade, and even sent Maro Itoje for acting lessons so he can work on his communication skills. All that for moments such as this, when things are starting to fall apart. England were all but bound to lose, weren’t they? What mattered now was how. It was clear that the match could turn into a rout. Ireland immediately stretched England’s defence by working the ball wide for their first try. It got worse when 10 minutes later Curry went off injured and was replaced by Alex Dombrandt, only just out of self isolation after he tested positive for Covid. And then Caelan Doris scored in the corner. Or he looked to have done. The TMO disallowed it because of a knock-on in the buildup. But still. It was a moment that made you want to check the record books to look for Ireland’s record-win over England (43-13 at Croke Park in 2007), and England’s record-loss at Twickenham (6-42 to South Africa a year later). With everything against them, and any real chance of winning this crucial game gone already, what were England playing for? What was there, deep in the guts of this team, that was going to get them through this? What were they going to draw on that would make them run farther, tackle harder, and get up off the floor that much quicker? The answer was the same as it has always been in this game. The team, and their love for each other. Jones has talked about how he wants to develop their cohesion. He even sent them tenpin bowling in the week to help along their bonding. Well they needed every last bit of it now, Jones’s old England and his new England needed to come together, at last, and fast. Would you believe it? They did. They looked into themselves and there, deep down, they found the reserves of urgency and desperation they needed. Doris’s disallowed try was a turning point, as if England felt like they had finally got a break from the fates. After it, they dragged themselves back into the match, yard by yard, tackle by tackle, scrum by scrum, they fought so hard that for the middle 40 minutes you would never have known they were a man down. They dominated the scrum, fought furiously at the breakdown, even cracked Ireland open with a couple of scything breaks out wide. Marcus Smith picked off his penalties, and somehow, with 20 minutes left to play, the scores were level at 15-15. The balance then shifted. England, exhausted, finally broke open as the Irish ran in the late tries that put them out of sight. But a week, a month, a year from now, long after the final scoreline has been forgotten, this may well be a game they look back on as a turning point in their development. Jones called it a “foundation game”, an example of “the spirit, the determination, the ability to work through problems” they need. They will need a lot more of the same if they’re going to get through next week’s Test in Paris, when they will be underdogs again. But then, on the evidence of this match, that’s just how they like it. Jones has spoken about the emotional energy South Africa brought to the World Cup final. I asked him last year if he understood yet what he could use to motivate his England players in a similar sort of way. “I wish I did,” he told me, “but we’re still looking for it.” I wonder if he found out a little more about it this Saturday, when they played some of their very best rugby when everything was stacked against them. There’s a reason why he’s always talking up the opposition.",Sport/Sport,Honourable defeat could be turning point in Jones’s search for leadership | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/12/honourable-defeat-turning-point-eddie-jones-england-ireland
3/13/2022,"Cristiano Ronaldo has been a problematic signing for Manchester United. Particularly in the last few weeks he has – finally, at 37 – begun to look his age. He would create tactical problems for any coach, especially one as devoted to gegenpressing as Ralf Rangnick. He is not the player he was. But though much was taken, much abides. That this was only his second hat-trick for Manchester United is testament to how he has changed as a player. As he moved past Pepi Bican in Fifa’s charts as the leading goalscorer of all time, it’s easy to forget that when he left Manchester United in 2009, he was not yet the goalscorer he would become but rather a wide forward who would occasionally be deployed through the centre. It was only at Real Madrid that the goals came by the bucketload. His three goals against Tottenham demonstrated the range of abilities he still has. His first, lashed into the top corner from 25 yards as Eric Dier mysteriously sat off him, was a strike reminiscent of his goal against Porto in the Champions League quarter-final in 2009. The second was a predator’s effort, anticipating the threat, timing his run and staying onside to stroke Jadon Sancho’s cross low past Hugo Lloris. And the third was a classic goal of late-period Ronaldo as he powered in a header from a corner, all thrusting neck muscles like some tribute to Tommy Lawton. Without question, this was his best performance of the season. He was focused and committed. He had eight shots in the game, four times more than the entire United team put together. Five of his shots were on target; every other player on the pitch managed four between them. He won three aerial duels, more than anybody other than Dier. In that sense it was a perfect centre‑forward’s display. As a riposte to the doubts and rumours of last week it was magnificent. And yet, as so often with Ronaldo, there are other issues at play. There is no reason not to believe he was suffering from strained hip flexors last week, but the furore around his withdrawal from the derby were indicative of a wider problem. Ronaldo has become so big that any club for which he plays becomes FC Ronaldo. At times, as on Saturday, when everything clicks and the opposition defending is acquiescent, that is fine. But there have been plenty of days this season when it has not clicked, and when that happens the nature of Ronaldo, his ineffable vastness, becomes problematic. Saturday is a case in point. Ronaldo, quite rightly, will take the headlines for a superb hat-trick. To take a record that has stood for 80 years is, clearly, an extraordinary achievement. Perhaps his 12 goals in 21 league starts, plus assorted key contributions in the Champions League, are enough that his return to United can be parsed as a (very expensive) success. But modern football is about more than individuals, particularly for managers with Rangnick’s philosophical outlook. And he will be aware that, beyond Ronaldo’s brilliance, United, yet again, did not play particularly well. As repeatedly under Solskjær they got away with it because of errors from the opposition – ruthlessly punished – and individual excellence. Rangnick is a coach who prioritises the process but it was Tottenham’s processes that, for much of the game, looked better. Long spells of the second half were ragged and lacking in quality. The front three that started for Spurs had attempted 26% more pressures per game than United’s front three. The consequence of that absence of pressing is that United have little choice but to pursue the reactive approach imposed by José Mourinho and that underlay their best results under Solskjær. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that, particularly not against better opponents, but United too often slip from reactivity into passivity. And that has surely been a contributory factor in the increasingly luckless Harry Maguire’s collapse in confidence and form. Twice United let Tottenham back into the game; other teams will not be so forgiving as Spurs were. And that is the problem Ronaldo poses. He is capable of performances like this, when the years fall away and he looks again a magnificent striker, but even when he does the tendency is to cover up mistakes. In part that is to do with the patchwork nature of this United squad, and the fact that Rangnick, undermined by his interim status, seems so at odds with its general disposition. But it is also because the Ronaldo way of playing, the focus on one individual, the compensation for his lack of pressing (tackles: 0; interceptions: 1), are so at odds with most modern thinking. Ronaldo is a conundrum. History is unlikely to deem his return to Old Trafford a success. But on days like this, he is undeniably spectacular. He remains strong of will; some work of noble note may yet be done.",Sport/Football,Ronaldo continues to be a problem and a magnificent solution for United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/12/ronaldo-continues-to-be-a-problem-and-a-magnificent-solution-for-united
