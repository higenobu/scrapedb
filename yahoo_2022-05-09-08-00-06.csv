5/9/2022,"More human remains have been found at Lake Mead less than a week after authorities discovered the remains of a man in a barrel amid a drought that has dropped the reservoir's water level to historic lows. A witness saw human skeletal remains in the Calville Bay area of Lake Mead around 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, the National Parks Service said. The Clark County Medical Examiner has not yet identified the cause of death. Authorities said the investigation is ongoing. Police warned last week that more bodies could turn up in the country's largest reservoir — located on the border of Arizona and Nevada — after human remains were found in a barrel last Sunday. National Park Service rangers found the barrel with skeletal remains in an area near Hemenway Harbor on May 1 after boaters spotted it. LAS VEGAS AUTHORITIES: Man found in barrel in Lake Mead amid drought was shot; more bodies likely to turn up 'EACH ERUPTION HAS ITS OWN FINGERPRINT': Oldest remains of modern humans are much older than thought, researchers say The man was found shot and had likely been killed sometime between the mid-1970s and early 1980s based on the type of shoes the victim was found wearing, said homicide Lt. Ray Spencer, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The bodies have become uncovered as Lake Mead's water level dropped to 1,055 feet, the lowest since 1937, a year after Hoover Dam created the reservoir. Lake Mead and Lake Powell are the largest human-made reservoirs in the United States, diverting water from the Colorado River to 40 million people in seven states, tribal nations, and Mexico. Both lakes were full in 2000, but they now are roughly 30% full.

5/9/2022,"Kateryna Tyshchenko – Sunday, 8 May 2022, 21:59 Denys Prokopenko, Commander of the Azov Regiment, believes that Ukrainian forces should have more actively attempted to stop Russian troops as they advanced from the Russian-occupied Crimea near Henichesk [a port city on the Sea of Azov in the Kherson Oblast]. According to Prokopenko, this would have changed the trajectory of the fight for Mariupol. Source: Denys Prokopenko, interview with Ukrainska Pravda Quote from Prokopenko: ""If the forces located there [at the Crimea-Ukraine border] held the defence firmer, did everything they could to resist the enemy’s advance, didn’t just let the enemy troops enter the [Ukrainian] cities, everything would have been different now. The thing is, the enemy should have been destroyed at the neck of land connecting Crimea with the rest of Ukraine, near Henichesk. The enemy’s manoeuvring capacity would have been limited there and would only have had one way to advance. Given the terrain, the enemy would have been bottlenecked. From the tactical point of view, that was the location that would have been the most conducive to inflicting damage on the enemy troops, in order to hinder their advance and destroy them. The enemy troops should have been destroyed there, during their advance from Crimea. And for some reason, this just wasn’t done."" Details: Prokopenko believes that the siege of Mariupol could have been avoided. Quote from Prokopenko: ""If Henichesk, Melitopol, and Berdiansk, and other cities [on the Russians’ route from Crimea to Mariupol] held their defence and fought the enemy as steadfastly [as Mariupol’s defenders], it would have taken the enemy much longer than 4 days to get from Crimea to Mariupol. Since this is not how it happened, we found ourselves surrounded. Because in reality the enemy covered quite a substantial distance without meeting much resistance. Russian troops marched from Crimea without any significant fights on their way and found themselves on the western outskirts of Mariupol."" More details: The Azov Regiment Commander also said that the actions of the 36th Marine Brigade ""are difficult to make sense of."" ""First, 1 battalion surrendered, as early as 4 April. As a result, we lost the only connection we had between Azov and the 36th Brigade. Then unexpectedly the commander of the 36th Brigade decided, without warning anyone, to just break through in a direction that wasn’t agreed ahead of time, and that’s how he lost lots of his people. Likewise, many people were just left to their own devices and ended up as Russian prisoners…These uncoordinated actions suddenly undertaken by the 36th Brigade had catastrophic consequences, which we can no longer reverse,"" Prokopenko noted. Prokopenko added that nearly 1,000 Marines ended up as Russian prisoners of war. Earlier: On 8 May, Illia Samoilenko, an intelligence officer, said that Volodymyr Baraniuk, commander of the 36th Marine Brigade, decided to flee the besieged Mariupol with his personnel, tanks, and ammunition. Russian media have already shared footage of Baraniuk in captivity.",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,Azov Regiment believes Russian troops should have been stopped on Crimeas border,https://news.yahoo.com/azov-regiment-believes-russian-troops-185949791.html
5/9/2022,"Harvey Lee Baker was a decorated Vietnam War veteran credited with saving the lives of two fellow Marines. ""He was a war hero, and he was murdered,"" Baker's daughter, Nicole Folger, told The Capital-Journal. Baker, 74, was found deceased Thursday at a North Topeka mobile home park. Vicki Lee Shelton, 61, was being held on a $1 million bond in connection with intentional and premeditated first-degree murder Sunday morning at the Shawnee County Jail. No formal charges have been filed. Baker received a Silver Star for valor displayed on Feb. 26, 1969, while serving in Vietnam, Folger told The Capital-Journal on Saturday in a phone call from her home in Burlington, Okla. Baker, who was a private first class in the Marines, was taking part at the time in a search and destroy operation in a dense jungle area, according to his citation. Heavy small arms fire and anti-personnel mines detonated by a North Vietnamese Army unit, which was occupying a well-concealed position, mortally wounded two of the Marines who were with Baker while seriously injuring two others, it said. ""Reacting instantly, Private First Class Baker boldly moved between the enemy and his fallen comrades and, taking advantage of the terrain, commenced delivering fire which enabled the remainder of his company to deploy into effective fighting positions,"" the citation said. ""When a hostile soldier attacked one of the wounded Marines, Private First Class Baker fearlessly charged forward from his position and intercepted the attacker and killed the man in hand-to-hand combat."" Baker then returned to his covered location and continued firing at the North Vietnamese soldiers, who soon began a disorganized withdrawal, the citation said. ""His heroic and timely actions inspired all who observed him and saved the lives of two Marines,"" it said. ""By his courage, bold initiative and selfless devotion to duty in the face of grave personal danger, Private First Class Baker was instrumental in the defeat of the enemy and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service."" Baker grew up in Alabama, then moved to Detroit before going to Vietnam, Folger said. ""While others dodged the draft to become bankers, lawyers and doctors, my father left his roots as an architect and volunteered to enlist to go to Vietnam and do the nation's bidding,"" she said. Despite surviving his service in Vietnam, part of Baker died there, Folger said. ""He went to the Army a solid individual and came home a full-blown heroin addict,"" she said. Baker was identified for mental health reasons as being permanently disabled due to PTSD, Folger said. She said the VA Health Care system let her father down. Baker ""fought his demons every day,"" coping with drug addiction and flashbacks, in which he relived his experiences in Vietnam, Folger said. ""He was traumatized, and he traumatized others,"" she said. Folger recalled how, as people in their neighborhood set off fireworks each Independence Day to celebrate the freedoms Baker had fought to maintain, ""he would take cover under the kitchen table with his handgun, waiting for Charlie."" Baker was a husband and father of four, who is fondly remembered by his family, Folger said. She said her father enjoyed fishing, writing, cooking soul food dinners, exercising with Bowflex fitness equipment and playing with his grandchildren, while having them do impressions of him. Baker moved a year or two ago to live with one of Folger's cousins in Topeka, Folger said. During his time here, members of their family became increasingly concerned about how much control Vicki Lee Shelton had gained over Baker's life, she said. Folger said Shelton and Baker weren't in a relationship, but she did allege domestic abuse on Shelton's part. ""He was a vulnerable individual, and she exploited that,"" Folger said. Baker's cause and manner of death haven't been made public. Folger isn't sure she wants to know, she said. She shared these thoughts regarding her father on her Facebook page: ""I hope you found the peace that eluded you in this life ... ""You didn't die over there but we know pieces of you did ... ""Unfortunately the government failed you when you got home ... ""Thank you for giving your life for this country ... ""I hope you got a hero's welcome in heaven. ""Fly High.""
