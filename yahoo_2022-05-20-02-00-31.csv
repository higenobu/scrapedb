5/20/2022,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said, amid concerns more powerful weapons that could sink Russian warships would intensify the conflict. Ukraine has made no secret it wants more advanced U.S. capabilities beyond its current inventory of artillery, Javelin and Stinger missiles, and other arms. Kyiv's list, for example, includes missiles that could push the Russian navy away from its Black Sea ports, allowing the restart of shipments of grain and other agricultural products worldwide. Current and former U.S. officials and congressional sources have cited roadblocks to sending longer range, more powerful weapons to Ukraine that include lengthy training requirements, difficulties maintaining equipment, or concerns U.S. weaponry could be captured by Russian forces, in addition to the fear of escalation. But three U.S. officials and two congressional sources said two types of powerful anti-ship missiles, the Harpoon made by Boeing and the Naval Strike Missile made by Kongsberg and Raytheon Technologies were in active consideration for either direct shipment to Ukraine, or through a transfer from a European ally that has the missiles. In April, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Portugal to provide the Ukrainian military with Harpoons, which have a range of up to almost 300 km. But there are several issues keeping Ukraine from receiving the missiles. For one, there is limited availability of platforms to launch Harpoons from shore -- a technically challenging solution according to several officials -- as it is mostly a sea-based missile. Two U.S. officials said the United States was working on potential solutions that included pulling a launcher off of a U.S. ship. About 20 Russian Navy vessels, including submarines, are in the Black Sea operational zone, the British defense ministry has said. Bryan Clark, a naval expert at the Hudson Institute, said 12 to 24 anti-ship missiles like the Harpoon with ranges over 100 km would be enough to threaten Russian ships and could convince Moscow to lift the blockade. ""If Putin persists, Ukraine could take out the largest Russian ships, since they have nowhere to hide in the Black Sea,"" Clark said. Russia has already suffered losses at sea, notably the sinking of the cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. WHO GOES FIRST? A handful of countries would be willing to send Harpoons to Ukraine, the U.S. officials and the congressional sources said. But no one wants to be the first or only nation to do so, fearing reprisals from Russia if a ship is sunk with a Harpoon from their stockpile, the third U.S official said. That U.S. official said one country is considering being the first to supply the missile to Ukraine. Once that ""well stocked"" nation commits to sending Harpoons, others might follow, the official said. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) can be launched from the Ukrainian coast and has a range of 250 km. It also takes less than 14 days training to operate. The sources said NSMs were viewed as less logistically difficult than Harpoons, because NATO allies could loan mobile ground launchers which are available, and warheads from Norway. The first two U.S. officials and the congressional sources said the United States was trying to work out a way for Ukraine to obtain NSM and launchers from European allies. The congressional sources said another option would be for Norway to donate NSMs to Ukraine, an idea supported by Norwegian members of parliament https://mil.in.ua/en/news/norwegian-parliament-is-proposing-to-transfer-the-nasams-air-defense-and-nsm-strike-missiles-to-ukraine. The Norwegian Ministry of Defense declined to comment on what additional contributions of arms and defense equipment it may consider offering to Ukraine. All weapons requests that have U.S. content such as Harpoons and NSMs would have to be approved by the U.S. State Department, which takes guidance from the White House. Another weapon high on Ukraine's shopping list are Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 made by Lockheed Martin which can strike a target 70 or more kilometers away, a three-fold increase over many of their current howitzer rounds. In recent weeks, the Biden administration decided instead to send M777 towed howitzers which could be deployed faster and shipped in larger quantities, the two U.S. officials said. The two U.S. officials said the M270 or similar system like the M142 HIMARS would be considered for shipment to Ukraine once Congress passed a $40 billion supplemental funding bill that would authorize an additional $11 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority. That lets the president authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.

Nature is made up of some amazing and intriguing creatures. Perhaps one of the most intriguing is the octopus. Some even believe they could be aliens. One mystery that has long evaded scientists is the octopus’s self-destruction after mating. For years, scientists have wondered why octopuses torture themselves after mating.

Get the legendary Chom Chom Roller pet hair remover for $25 Don't Miss: Today’s deals: $150 AirPods 3, rare AirTag deal, $4 smart plugs, $3 sports water bottles, more We’ve long known that mother octopuses torture themselves and sometimes even eat themselves when their eggs are close to hatching. While they aren’t the only creatures in the wild that die after mating, they do have one of the more gruesome approaches to the process. For years, scientists have tried to discover why octopuses act this way after mating. Now, a new study published in the journal Current Biology could provide the answers we’ve all been looking for. Researchers say that mother octopuses torture themselves after mating due to chemical changes that occur around the time the mother lays her eggs. A study in 1977 found that a set of glands near the octopus’s eyes was responsible for the mechanism that caused the self-destruction. The researchers found that these glands produce steroid hormones in the octopus. And, when the mother has laid her eggs, these glands go into overdrive. It is these steroids that are believed to push octopuses to torture themselves. Altogether, the researchers found three separate chemical shifts that occur at the same time the octopus mother lays her eggs. First, there’s a rise in pregnenolone and progesterone. These two hormones are usually associated with reproduction in a host of creatures. So, it isn’t surprising to see them here. Next, they saw a second shift as the octopus began producing higher levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, or 7-DHC. This is a building block of cholesterol, and humans also produce it in the process of making cholesterol, as well. However, it may be one of the chemical changes causing octopuses to torture themselves after mating. 7-DHC can be a toxic compound. That’s why humans don’t keep it in their systems long. The researchers also noted that the optic glands began producing more of the components used in bile acids. Octopuses don’t utilize the same kind of bile acids as humans and other animals, but they do make the building blocks for those acids. The researchers believe that these chemical changes all come together and cause octopuses to torture themselves. The exact reasoning for why these changes occur, though, or why the octopus’s body is designed this way is still unclear. Z. Yan Wang, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, told Live Science that it could be a way to protect the younger octopuses. Octopuses are naturally cannibalistic creatures. As such, the torture, and subsequent death caused by these changes could be a way of naturally culling the older generation to protect the younglings before they can be killed and eaten by the older octopuses.

5/20/2022,"The Roeper School released a statement to Fox 2 on Tuesday saying it was reviewing the circumstances of the incident. A school for gifted students in Birmingham, Michigan, has come under fire after a teacher handed out an assignment that featured pictures of primates alongside a photo of former President Barack Obama. The educator at the Roeper School — which describes itself on its website as “the oldest preschool through grade 12 school for the gifted in the nation” — handed out the assignment earlier this month in a high school biology class, according to Fox 2 in Detroit. The worksheet asked students to look through the images of various animals and select the ones that were primates. One of those options was Obama, according to images circulating on social media. The Roeper School released a statement to Fox 2 on Tuesday saying it was aware of the assignment and was currently reviewing its circumstances. The station said it had obtained a letter that was sent to parents in which the school claimed the worksheet was taken from a university website and acknowledged that it was racially offensive and harmful. I can't imagine the teacher didn't know exactly what they were doing. And if they didn't, I'm curious to know what the vetting process is at a school with a $30k a year tuition. Someone is at fault here. — Danielle Dalton (@daniodee1) May 19, 2022 Some social media users have called out officials at the Roeper School, saying the teacher must have known what was going on. “There’s not noticing a typo, and then there’s not noticing Barack Obama’s face next to a bunch of monkeys,” said one user. “The teacher knew.” The school reportedly declined to provide further information to protect the privacy of its community members, per Fox 2. It is offering counseling services to students and said it will continue to provide staff training aimed at combating racial biases on campus, according to the outlet. The Roeper School, with tuition costs of around $30,000 a year, says on its website that 31% of faculty and students are people of color. A diversity statement on the school’s online homepage reads: “Justice requires that we respect the dignity and worth of every individual by providing equality of opportunity for those to whom opportunities have been historically denied. At Roeper, we believe that our cooperative community respects and embraces diversity thereby emphasizing the relationship between the individual and the community.” TheGrio is FREE on your TV via Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku and Android TV.

5/20/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has gathered intelligence that shows some Russian officials have become concerned that Russian forces in the ravaged port city of Mariupol are carrying out grievous abuses, a U.S official familiar with the findings said Wednesday. The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Russians, who were not identified, also feared that the abuses will undercut Russia's claim that they’ve liberated the Russian-speaking city. The abuses include beating and electrocuting city officials and robbing homes, according to the intelligence finding. The new intelligence has been declassified and was shared by a U.S. official as some of the last Ukrainian fighters in the devastated city emerged from the ruined Azovstal steelworks. The fighters were ordered by their military to abandon the last stronghold of resistance in the now-flattened port city and face an uncertain fate. Hundreds of the fighters had held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city. The city has been reduced to rubble and has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. The seaside city captured worldwide attention after a March 9 Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital, and then after another airstrike a week later on a theater that was serving as the city’s largest bomb shelter. At the theater, the word “CHILDREN” was written in Russian on the pavement outside to deter an attack. Nearly 600 people were killed, inside and outside the theater, by some estimates. It was unclear the extent of the suspected abuse gleaned in the U.S. intelligence finding, but it comes on the heels of widespread human rights abuses in and around Bucha and the suburbs of Kyiv. Evidence of the massacre in Bucha emerged early last month after Russian forces withdrew from the city.( Photographs and video from Bucha showed body bags piled in trenches, lifeless limbs protruding from hastily dug graves, and corpses scattered in streets where they fell. Meanwhile, the first captured Russian soldier to be put on trial by Ukraine on war-crimes charges pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing a civilian and could face life in prison. Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a tank unit, pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through a car window in the opening days of the war. Ukraine’s top prosecutor has said some 40 more war-crimes cases are being readied.",World/Associated Press,US intel shows Russians fear Mariupol abuse will backfire,https://news.yahoo.com/us-intel-shows-russians-fear-003934545.html

5/20/2022,"Russian soldiers are apparently so sick of Vladimir Putin’s “stupid” war in Ukraine that they are now openly plotting with their own commanders to go AWOL. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate released a recording on Thursday that is said to show precisely that happening, with a soldier heard in a purportedly intercepted phone call detailing the plan. The soldier, identified by Ukrainian intelligence as one of many men “mobilized” by authorities in occupied Donetsk, complains that he and others in his battalion are so under-equipped that even the Chechen forces fighting alongside them mock them as “meat.” “Everyone who is here … I’m telling you … everyone is planning to take off on the 26th,” the purported soldier says. “Isn’t that stupid?” says the other man, apparently a relative back home. “Isn’t it stupid that we’re here?” the unnamed soldier shoots back. He goes on to explain that the troops have decided to abscond “on the basis of the fact that they put us on the front with absolutely nothing.” Russia Uses Ukraine’s Azovstal POWs in Demented New Propaganda Plot “I want to tell you even more,” he says, adding that a “battalion commander is leaving with us and even a staff colonel.” “They don’t provide us with any [equipment],” he says, adding that the rifles given to snipers are “from 1945.” Other units “look at them and go, ‘holy shit, what would you need those for?’ They laugh at us. You know what they call us? Blessed. We ask, ‘Why blessed?’ They say because we are walking around with no equipment, no helmets, without anything. … The Chechens call us meat.” “It’s not desertion, because we shouldn’t be on this territory. … We crossed the border as 200s,” he says, using a Russian military term for those killed in battle. “We’re not actually here. So if they say I’m a deserter, fuck off, I’m not here. Prove otherwise.” Other Russian soldiers are said to have taken equally drastic measures to get themselves out of the war. Ukrainian intelligence has released several recordings in recent days that purportedly show Russian soldiers resorting to injuring themselves in an effort to get pulled from the war. On Thursday, Ukraine’s Security Service released another recording said to reveal that trend. In the purportedly intercepted call between two Russian soldiers, one of the men tells his friend that fighting is getting more and more intense by the day, and despite daily fatalities, the military leadership is not providing backup. “Take someone else’s weapon, a Ukrainian one, and shoot yourself in the legs,” his friend advises.

5/20/2022,"OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A tree trimmer in rural Northern California was found guilty in a series of throat-slashing attacks that left three people dead, prosecutors announced Wednesday. A jury in Butte County on Tuesday found Ryan Scott Blinston, 37, guilty of murder, attempted murder and arson, the Tehama County District Attorney's office said. Blinston, of Oroville, faces a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Blinston was working for a tree-trimming service when in 2020 he returned to the clients’ homes in Butte and Tehama Counties, north of Sacramento, after the work was completed and slashed the throats of the residents, prosecutors said. In May 2020, he attacked Loreen Severs, 88, of Los Molinos in Tehama County and her husband, Homer Severs, 91. Homer Severs survived the attack but died that December of an unrelated illness, authorities said. Blinston was also charged in the killing of Sandra George, 82, and an acquaintance, Vicky Cline, 57, both of Oroville in Butte County. He was also charged with torching Cline’s car. The District Attorney for Tehama and Butte counties agreed to combine the charges and have the case tried in Butte County, prosecutors said. Blinston was arrested before dawn on June 14, 2020 — about a week after Cline vanished — by a Butte County sheriff’s SWAT team that had tracked him to a motorhome in heavily wooded and isolated Brush Creek, where authorities planned to arrest him on suspicion of burning Cline’s car, prosecutors said. The team approached the motorhome and heard the muffled screams of a man inside and loud banging on the outside of the motorhome. The banging turned out to be Blinston attempting to get into the motorhome with a hatchet, prosecutors said. Blinston ran into the woods, refused to drop the hatchet and was captured after a short struggle and the use of a stun gun and pepper spray, authorities said. Blinston had met the 50-year-old owner of the motorhome earlier and then stayed over because he told the man he was afraid to leave after dark because of bears, the resident told authorities. The man said he was sleeping when he awoke to find Blinston attacking him with a knife, prosecutors said. Blinston slashed his neck but the man said he was able to kick him out of the motorhome and lock the door. A medic treated the seriously injured man and he was airlifted to a hospital, they said. The SWAT team may have saved the man’s life, prosecutors said, because the isolated area had no cellphone service and it was unlikely anyone would have heard the man’s cries for help. Prosecutors didn't mention a motive for the crimes other than to say robbery was not a motivating factor.",U.S./Associated Press,California tree trimmer guilty in deadly throat-slashings,https://news.yahoo.com/california-tree-trimmer-guilty-deadly-233436761.html
5/20/2022,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has said he hopes Philippine president-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jnr will maintain an independent foreign policy. On Wednesday Xi spoke to Marcos for the first time since his election victory, having previously sent a message of congratulations. Xi said China is willing to strengthen strategic communication and coordination with the Philippines on major international and regional issues. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. According to a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry he told Marcos: ""I hope the Philippines can continue to uphold its independence and autonomy in foreign policy."" Xi spoke highly of the China-Philippine relationship over the last six years under the outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte, who tried to boost cooperation with China and put aside an international court ruling brought by Manila that rejected China's claims to almost all the waters of the South China Sea. Duterte's administration was accused of human rights violations by the Philippines' traditional allies such as the United States, while China, its biggest trading partner, promised massive investment and provided help to some of his most controversial policies such as war on drugs. ""We have effectively managed our differences through dialogue and consultation, actively promoted practical cooperation in various fields and achieved fruitful results in bilateral relations,"" Xi said. Xi promised ""continuity and stability"" towards the Philippines and pledged ""active support and help"" for the country's economic and social development, highlighting areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, energy, education, pandemic control and post-Covid recovery. Duterte's daughter Sara was Marcos's campaign partner and won the separate election for vice-president by a huge margin. Marcos, widely known as ""Bongbong"", said his new government would make Philippine-China relations a foreign policy priority and was willing to strengthen contacts at all levels and deepen cooperation in various fields such as trade and the economy, infrastructure, energy, culture and education, according to the readout. ""I am looking forward to a better and stronger future for Philippine-China relations, and I am ready to work with the Chinese side to continue ... the development of Philippine-China relations,"" he said. The Marcos family have historical connections with China. In 1974, a year before the two countries established official diplomatic relations, his father, the late Ferdinand Marcos Snr, sent his wife Imelda and 17-year-old son to visit Beijing, where they met Mao Zedong. Xi referred to the visit during the call with the dictator's son and praised him as a ""constructor, supporter and promoter"" of the bilateral friendship. Marcos responded by saying the Philippine people see China as one of their most important partners. Zhuang Guotu, a professor and former dean of Xiamen University's Research School for Southeast Asian Studies, said China was paying close attention to the Marcos government's position on bilateral ties. President Rodrigo Duterte, pictured with daughter Sara the vice-president-elect, won praise from Beijing for establishing closer relations. Photo: TNS alt=President Rodrigo Duterte, pictured with daughter Sara the vice-president-elect, won praise from Beijing for establishing closer relations. Photo: TNS> Zhuang said Washington has drastically changed its Asia-Pacific strategy - including an increased emphasis on security - and may look to Manila for support. But Beijing is not concerned that relations will worsen under the new government, he argued, citing the Marcos family's ties to Beijing and China's status as the main Philippine trade partner. ""At this moment, [Xi is] emphasising that the Philippines needs to have an independent foreign policy unaffected by other large countries,"" he said. Lucio Blanco Pitlo III, a research fellow at Asia Pacific Pathways, said Xi's remarks reflected China's hope that Marcos would emulate the current president's policy by allowing for engagement with Beijing on the economic and political fronts and dialogue on the South China Sea dispute as well as a possible joint offshore oil and gas development in the contested waters. ""Policy continuity is in China's interest. Both sides can build on the momentum in the last six years, give full play and institutionalise platforms like a vice-ministerial level bilateral consultative mechanism and a joint coastguard committee to handle sea incidents and other related maritime issues,"" he said. Beijing will also hope that both sides ""will be able to prevent their sea spat from turning into crises that can draw rivals like the US into the fray"" in the build-up to a major Chinese leadership overhaul later this year, Pitlo said. ""This may complicate its external environment at a crucial time in its domestic politics,"" he added. Ngeow Chow Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya, said Xi's reference to independent foreign policy principally meant that the Philippines should ""not be fully aligned with the US in the strategic sense"". He added that Duterte Snr's China policy ""provided much room for the Philippines to improve relations with China notwithstanding the challenges in the South China Sea,"" Ngeow said.

How to avoid panic buying in an ultra-competitive housing market There’s nothing more disappointing than whipping out a Post-it note for an important reminder, only for it to unstick from the surface and get lost. Apparently, however, this isn’t a matter of product malfunction so much as it is one of user error. TikToker Ali Abdaal recently learned the correct way to use a Post-it note and shared how in a quick video. Watch this Brooklyn bedroom go from drab to fabulous in one day: “I was today years old when I realized I’ve been using Post-its all wrong,” Abdaal wrote in the caption. “You’re probably using Post-it notes wrong,” he explained in the video. Here’s how you use them properly. Normally we rip off Post-it notes like this. But the problem is that it naturally wants to unstick itself.” Instead, he suggested, placing the Post-it note pad sideways and pulling the note off that way. “Then it sticks properly,” he said. Because the note isn’t bent upward, it’s less likely to peel off and unstick. The useful tip racked up over 300,000 views on TikTok. “Are we just doing everything wrong?” someone joked. “Might not be the biggest thing but I just learned something new,” another wrote. “I’ve been doing this forever.

5/20/2022,"An angler recently reeled in a rare and “freaking scary” fish after casting his hook into a murky Texas marsh, photos show. The scaly creature’s striking look, jet black from tail to toothy tip, took the fisherman and his guide by surprise, according to a post by Lotus Guide Service. “Well … (we) found out melanistic gar do exist,” said the May 16 post, sharing photos of the fish whipping and thrashing against the fishing line. Long-established residents of Texas waterways, the prehistoric and prized alligator gar is typically brown or olive in color. But seemingly every inch of the one recently hooked in the “southeast Texas marsh” is dark black, save for the impressive teeth and pale gullet revealed by its open jaws. Though harmless to humans, alligator gar are fierce enough in appearance and in name to inspire fearful myths about them — and this strange variation is particularly stirring to some, even those familiar with the fish. “Freaking scary,” one commenter said. “Caught alligator gar growing up in Louisiana … put up a hell of a fight.” “I like this, looks hella mean,” another said. “Them thangs look deadly,” another read. Melanism, a genetic anomaly that causes darker fur, hair, skin or scales, is known to occur across the animal kingdom, though it is exceptionally rare, McClatchy News reported. How rare is melanism? Rare enough that experts generally lack enough data to offer exact figures.

5/20/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine's territorial defence force said on Wednesday its fighters had blown up an armoured train carrying Russian troops, but an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelinskiy later said the attack had been confined to rails near the train. Reuters could not independently verify the defence force's assertion, posted on Facebook, that it had carried out the attack in the occupied southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol. The city lies in the region of Zaporizhzhia and in a belt of southern Ukrainian land that was occupied by Russian forces after they invaded on Feb. 24. The defence force - the reservist branch of Ukraine's armed forces - said in an online posting that explosives had detonated under a rail car carrying military personnel. It did not elaborate on the extent of the damage. But several hours later, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych gave a conflicting account, saying Ukrainian forces had blown up the tracks ahead of the train. ""The partisans got it, although they did not blow up the armoured train itself,"" he said in a video posted on social media, saying the Russians ""got off lightly."" Arestovych said the incident showed that the partisan movement was actively disrupting Russian forces. Ukrainian news reports say partisans have been operating actively in Melitopol. The town's mayor was taken away by Russian troops for several days in March before being released.

5/20/2022,"Putin often became frustrated with Trump over his lack of knowledge on big issues, Fiona Hill said. ""He had to keep explaining things, and Putin doesn't like to do that,"" Hill said. Hill said this factored into Putin's decision to invade Ukraine during the Biden administration. Russian President Vladimir Putin often became frustrated with President Donald Trump over his lack of knowledge on geopolitical issues, Fiona Hill said, adding that this played into Moscow's decision on the timing of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One of the reasons Putin invaded Ukraine with President Joe Biden in the White House was that he expected the US to ""sue for peace"" and thought it would be better to deal with Biden than trying to negotiate with someone like Trump, whom the Russian leader had ""to explain everything to all the time,"" Hill, who served as the top Russia advisor on the National Security Council under Trump, said Tuesday at a Chicago Council on Global Affairs event. ""He thought that somebody like Biden — who's a transatlanticist, who knows all about NATO, who actually knows where Ukraine is, and actually knows something about the history, and is very steeped in international affairs — would be the right person to engage with,"" Hill said. ""You could see that he got frustrated many times with President Trump because he had to keep explaining things, and Putin doesn't like to do that,"" Hill said, adding: ""Even though he loves to be able to spin his own version of events, he wants to have predictability in the person that he's engaging with."" A number of Trump's former advisors have said the ex-president had a poor grasp of global affairs. The former national security advisor John Bolton, for example, said Trump once asked whether Finland was part of Russia. Similarly, Trump's former White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly also once said Trump ""doesn't know any history at all, even some of the basics on the US,"" says Hill's new book, ""There Is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the Twenty-First Century,"" which was published last year. In the book, Hill writes that Trump's meager comprehension of international affairs was a ""major liability"" for US national security.

5/20/2022,"“Mommy, help me,” 9-year-old Shalom Guifarro begged as she lay dying in her family’s Brooklyn apartment, after enduring hours of abuse — allegedly at the hands of the same person the child wished would save her. The heartbreaking details of the little girl’s final hours were detailed by prosecutors at her mother Shemene Cato’s arraignment in Brooklyn Criminal Court Tuesday, where she was ordered held without bail. Cato, 48, is charged with murder, manslaughter, assault and other crimes in her youngest daughter’s death over a missing tablet Sunday morning. Little Shalom was hiding from her infuriated mother, who spent two hours walloping her and her 13-year-old sister with an extension cord and bashing them with a broom inside their Lincoln Place apartment, prosecutors said. But the spot Shalom sought as a safe haven from her maniacal mother turned out to be the opposite. “The defendant lifted up the bed, attempting to pull the child out from underneath,” said Assistant District Attorney David Ingle in court. “The bed dropped on Shalom... The bed fell onto her head.” After Cato dropped the bed on her daughter, the child was still, prosecutors said. “Shalom could not stand up, was non-responsive and kept saying, ‘Mommy, help me,’” said Ingle. Finally, around 1 p.m. Shalom’s older sister called police. Shalom suffered multiple blunt force injuries to her head and body, and bled to death internally, the city Medical Examiners Office said. Cato shuffled into court Tuesday in pajama bottoms and pink flip flops and remained silent, fidgeting with her hands cuffed behind her back. The accused monster mom showed little emotion other than hanging her head low throughout the proceedings. The killing shocked members of the Crown Heights community, who regularly saw Cato and her two daughters out and about. Rev. Pedro Torres, who runs No Longer Bound Ministries just around the corner from the apartment, said he saw them almost every day and never noticed anything out of the ordinary. “She [Cato] was regular. She would have a conversation, we would talk,” Torres said, recalling that she asked him how she could improve her credit. “Everybody says she was always verbally abusive with the child. I never saw that. I always saw her with the child like a mom, taking care of her kids,” Torres said. He remembers a playful, happy, Shalom running around — a child he once gifted with a doll on Christmas. “She really had no worries in the world. Always smiling and funny,” he said. “I remember the time when I gave her the doll. The next day she saw me and she gave me a hug. She was very appreciative,” he said.",U.S./NY Daily News,"9-year-old Brooklyn girl cried ‘Mommy, help me,’ as she died after hours of beatings and abuse: prosecutors",https://news.yahoo.com/9-old-brooklyn-girl-cried-233900085.html
5/20/2022,"(Refiling to change meeting venue to New York from Washington, paragraph 23) By Jonathan Spicer, Humeyra Pamuk and Robin Emmott ISTANBUL/WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -When Finland and Sweden signalled they were thinking of making the historic decision joining NATO, the alliance expected a tough response from Moscow, not from one of its own. Yet at a gathering of NATO foreign ministers with their Finnish and Swedish counterparts on Saturday to celebrate the biggest shift in European security in decades, Turkey's participant darkened the mood. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was ""in crisis mode"", a NATO diplomat told Reuters of the evening meeting in Berlin. A day earlier Turkey's president, Tayyip Erdogan, had shocked fellow NATO members by saying he could not support membership for either Finland or Sweden. Cavusoglu not only set conditions for Turkey accepting the membership bids but raised his voice at Sweden's Ann Linde in what three NATO diplomats said was an ""embarrassing"" break in protocol. ""For us it was a historic moment and yet Cavusoglu said he was irritated at Linde's 'feminist policy', bringing so much drama,"" another NATO diplomat said, describing a very tense atmosphere in the German foreign ministry in Berlin, in which many allies opted for silence to calm the situation. ""We were trying to understand what our Turkish colleague wanted - you know, really wanted,"" said the diplomat, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""It was embarrassing."" Ankara's main demands are for the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory, and to lift their bans on some sales of arms to Turkey. A Turkish diplomatic source said Cavusoglu had outlined Turkey's stance respectfully, rejecting what he said was an allegation from Linde that its opposition was due to Sweden's feminist foreign policy. ""Her comments are not helping Sweden's NATO bid, while the statements coming from Finland are carefully crafted,"" the source said. Sweden's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours. Spurred on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both countries applied to join NATO on Wednesday. Russia, which says the threat posed by NATO expansion was a major reason it sent troops into Ukraine, has played it cool. While Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Finland and Sweden joining was a ""grave mistake"" with ""far-reaching consequences"", President Vladimir Putin said on May 16 their bids to join NATO posed no direct threat to Russia. CONTACT MADE The souring mood at Saturday's meeting was all the more surprising because NATO diplomats had told Reuters in early May that all 30 allies supported Finland and Sweden's accession to the alliance because of the security benefits it would bring. NATO allies had wanted to seal their accession in record time as a way of solidifying their response to Russia, yet on Monday, Erdogan said the Swedish and Finnish delegations should not come to Ankara as planned. On Wednesday, the Turkish presidency said a key Erdogan adviser had spoken with counterparts from Sweden, Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom and United States. NATO membership progess was only possible if Turkey's expectations were met, it said. One person close to the situation gave a more upbeat assessment, saying the conversation with Sweden was positive and opened the door for the delegation visits next week. Yet the calls on Wednesday came after five days of struggles by the Nordic countries to reach Erdogan's office, the person said. ""All this is muddying the waters, but not holding up the overall accession plan,"" the person said, under condition of anonymity. Ankara says the arms ban - adopted by the Nordic countries in response to Turkey's 2019 military incursion into northern Syria against Kurdish militants - is inappropriate for prospective members of a security pact. Turkish state broadcaster TRT said Sweden and Finland had not approved Turkey's request for the repatriation of 33 people with alleged links to groups it sees as terrorists. The chairman of the Swedish parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Kenneth Forslund, said a solution could be found, but elsewhere. ""That Sweden would start expelling people who are not considered terrorists according to the terror lists the EU has, that’s totally unthinkable,"" he said. UNFINISHED BUSINESS Diplomats in European capitals say they have seen brinkmanship from Erdogan before leading to a deal. An unpredictable but strategically crucial NATO ally, Turkey under Erdogan has pursued an independent foreign policy but remains a big contributor to NATO missions. The tension has clouded ties between Washington and Ankara just as they appeared to have improved following five years of disagreements on Syria, Turkey's closer ties with Moscow, and the erosion of rights and freedoms in the country. Cavusoglu met U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in New York later on Wednesday. ""We are seeing the winds of the Cold War again,"" Cavusoglu told members of the Turkish American community late on Tuesday. The source close to the process said Cavusoglu is taking a hard line publicly, pushed by Erdogan, but that there is a risk foreign allies will isolate Turkey if he goes too far. At home, Erdogan faces tight elections by mid-2023 and his jabs at Europe play to domestic nationalist sentiment. The United States is still confident of a solution. Blinken told a news conference on Sunday talks were ongoing over the differences between Turkey, Finland and Sweden. ""When it comes to the membership process, I am very confident that we will reach consensus,"" he said.

5/20/2022,"By Tom Balmforth and Jonathan Landay KYIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Even as the Kremlin prepares to take full control of the ruins of Mariupol city, it faces the growing prospect of defeat in its bid to conquer all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas because its badly mauled forces lack the manpower for significant advances. Russian President Vladimir Putin may have to decide whether to send in more troops and hardware to replenish his dramatically weakened invasion force as an influx of modern Western weaponry bolsters Ukraine's combat power, analysts say. Russia's forces are unlikely to be vanquished quickly even if no major new troop deployment materialises, setting the stage for the four-week-old Battle for the Donbas to grind on. ""I think it's either going to be defeat with the current force posture, or mobilise. I don't think there is any middle ground,"" said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy. He and other analysts said Russia's invasion force was facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses, and that their window for a breakthrough was narrowing with Ukraine now bringing Western heavy artillery into the fray. ""Time is definitely working against the Russians. They're running out of equipment. They're running out of particularly advanced missiles. And, of course, the Ukrainians are getting stronger almost every day,"" said Neil Melvin of the RUSI think-tank in London. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that ""everything is going to plan ... there's no doubt that all the objectives will be achieved,"" the RIA news agency reported. But in an unusually critical commentary on Russia's main television channel this week, a prominent military analyst said Russians should stop swallowing ""informational tranquilizers"" about what Putin calls a special military operation. With the increasing flow of U.S. and European weapon supplies to Ukrainian forces, ""the situation will frankly get worse for us,"" said Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired colonel. AZOVSTAL FALLS Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in a failed drive to capture the capital, Kyiv. It then withdrew to focus on a ""second phase"" announced on April 19 to capture the south and all of the Donbas, a chunk of which has been held by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014. Russia retained its land corridor in southern Ukraine, but was hampered by Ukrainian troops who held out against massive bombardments for 82 days in Mariupol's Azovstal steel works before ending their resistance this week. Meanwhile, Putin's forces pressed against Ukraine's battle-hardened, fortified positions in the east, while trying to cut them off in a massive encirclement by advancing south from the Ukrainian town of Izium. Around a third of the Donbas was held by Russia-backed separatists before the invasion. Moscow now controls around 90% of Luhansk region, but it has failed to make major inroads towards the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in Donetsk in order to extend control over the entire region. ""I'm deeply skeptical of their prospects"" of conquering all of the Donbas, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with CNA, a U.S. nonprofit research and analysis organisation. ""They're dealing with a dramatically weakened force, probably substantially reduced morale. There's a weak desire by officers to keep trying to prosecute offensives and the Russian political leadership on the whole seems to be procrastinating even as it's facing the strategic defeat itself,"" he said. Muzyka said Russia appeared to be switching its focus in Donbas and had shifted battalion tactical groups eastward after failing to break the Ukrainian defences in Donetsk. ""They couldn't push through from Izium so they moved to Sievierodonetsk and Lyman, possibly with the goal of trying to encircle Ukrainian forces around Sievierodonetsk and Lyman. Whether or not this occurs is an entirely different matter,"" he said. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the Russian chief of army staff, visited the front this month in an apparent bid to iron out problems, but there is no evidence he succeeded, said Jack Keane, the chairman of the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. ""That offensive has indeed stalled,"" he said. To the north of the Donbas, Kyiv has mounted a counter-offensive near the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine that has cleared Russian forces from shelling range of the country's second biggest city and even reached the border in one place. Muzyka said Ukraine might secure a significant part of its border with Russia north of Kharkiv this week. But Ukraine will not be able to replicate that quick advance in the Donbas where Russia's troops are much more densely concentrated. ""It's going to be a hard fight. There's going to be a hard fight and potentially a long fight. The Russian military hasn’t done well on the offensive, but it doesn't rout or surrender easily either,"" said Kofman. 'ARTILLERY WAR' The influx of Western heavy guns, including scores of U.S. - and some Canadian - M777 howitzers that have longer range than their Russian equivalents, could give Ukraine an edge in a war that has revolved around artillery duels. ""The Ukrainians are starting to outrange the Russians. That means they are able to operate without the threat of counter-battery fire from the Russians,"" said Muzyka. ""Don't get me wrong, the Russians still enjoy overall artillery superiority in terms of numbers, but I'm not sure if the same goes for the quality now... This is an artillery war."" Muzyka and Kofman said that even if Putin does send more troops, such a move could take months to organise. ""It's very clear they're preparing for at least some kind of measures to call up men with prior service experience. But right now, from what I can tell, Putin is just kicking the can down the road and letting the situation within the Russian military actually get worse,"" Kofman said. ""For now,"" he said, ""this is looking like the Russians' last offensive.""

5/20/2022,"Can you put a dollar amount on what it means to be wealthy in the U.S.? An annual survey asks Americans to do just that, and this year, $2.2 million is the magic number. That's according to the annual Modern Wealth Survey from Charles Schwab, which also finds people believe that an average net worth of $774,000 is what it takes to be financially comfortable. The report, which surveyed 1,000 Americans ages 21 to 75 in February 2022, asked respondents a range of questions about their personal finances, including the factors influencing their savings and investment decisions. The average net worth needed to be considered wealthy and to be financially comfortable both rose from last year's survey. In 2021, Americans said they needed $624,000 in net assets to live comfortably, while it would take $1.9 million to be rich. That said, the averages are still lower than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because many people are focusing less on hitting a specific number and more on their overall goals, financial and otherwise, says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at Charles Schwab. ""People are concerned about other things besides the balance in their portfolio and in their investment account,"" says Williams, including their physical health and overall stability. The average net worth of U.S. households actually isn't so far off from Schwab's survey: It stood at $748,800 in 2019, according to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve. But that's skewed by the richest households. The median net worth for U.S. households is $121,700, per the Fed. And as other reports have found, many U.S. households have very little or no savings at all. With little saved for emergencies or retirement, a number like $2.2 million—or even $774,000—might seem like an impossible benchmark to reach. But Williams says this doesn't have to be the case. Ultimately, each household should calculate its own wealth target and make an individualized savings plan. What one person or family needs isn't the same as another. “A plan is really just saying, ‘This is what’s important to me, this is what I need to save and invest for next year, in five years, 10 years from now,’” says Williams. Once you have some idea of a target, the most important thing you can do is start saving—regardless of the amount you put away. Five dollars is better than nothing, even if it doesn't seem at first like it will add up to much. Putting even a little bit of money away consistently is especially important when building a retirement account, as most Americans will be on their own to fund their golden years, says Williams. ""No matter how much money you have, get started and stay disciplined,"" he says. ""You’ll look back and say, ‘Goodness, those small steps really built up over time.’ You’ll find yourself in a position where you can make a lot more choices than you could before."" Once you start saving, make it an automatic ritual. Oftentimes, watching your savings accrue will provide the momentum to keep saving more and more, even if you're just starting out or well below your target number, says Williams. Keeping the long game in mind is critical, especially in a rocky market like we're seeing right now. Building wealth, for most people, takes decades of dedicated investments. Though investing money in assets that are on a losing streak can seem self-defeating, a down market is ""an opportunity to be saving and investing more,"" says Williams—and getting more for your money. ""If you’re investing for net worth, it takes time to get there,"" he says. ""It's good to be aspirational, but get started and don’t get overwhelmed by trying to get to a certain number in a day or a week.""

5/20/2022,"President Vladimir Putin has long tried to project an image of abundant good health. Ukrainian officials claimed in May that he is hiding that he is ""very ill"" with cancer. Rumors of health problems and secret surgery have followed the Russian president for decades. Speculation about President Vladimir Putin's health reached fever pitch on Sunday after former MI6 Russia spy Christopher Steele indicated the Russian president could be seriously ill. Speaking to Sky News, Steele said Putin's health could be a factor in the unfolding invasion of Ukraine. Since invading Ukraine Putin has had shaky media appearances and has been described — with varying reliability — as suffering from everything from Parkinson's disease to dementia. Putin has for decades cultivated an image of virile masculinity at peak fitness — but an investigation by independent Russian media outlet Proekt alleged that this was only possible with significant deception. Most specifics about Putin's health are almost impossible to confirm. His top spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has repeatedly denied any issues. Medical professionals have refused to give weight to the rumors, as Deutsche Welle reported, arguing that accurate diagnoses can only be made by in-person examinations. Here is a timeline of moments when Putin's health has come into question. In fall 2012, Reuters cited three government sources saying Putin had back trouble and would need surgery soon. The Kremlin denied this, but after Russian newspaper Vedomosti said that Putin had hurt himself while hang-gliding, Peskov said the trouble was due to ""an ordinary sporting injury"" in which Putin had strained a muscle, as The Atlantic reported. By the end of December 2012, Proekt alleged that Putin was wearing a corset and significantly limiting — or even skipping — sit-down engagements due to likely back problems. The outlet cited unnamed Russian officials for the information. On November 4, Russia's National Unity Day, the Kremlin limited itself to still photos of Putin's appearance at a ceremony in Red Square, according to Proekt. However, footage posted by religious leaders in Moscow showed the president with a slight limp. By matching the check-in dates of medical specialists with Putin's travel schedule, Proekt found that Putin was regularly accompanied by at least five doctors in these years — a number that would later swell to 13. They included an ENT specialist, an infectious diseases specialist, a staff rescuscitologist, and a neurosurgeon, the outlet reported. Between November 25 and December 1, Putin appeared only in pre-recorded meetings, Proekt reported. Meanwhile, 12 specialists suddenly checked in at the Sochi hospital near his residence, including his personal doctors, neurosurgeons, and a rehabilitation specialist, according to Proekt. Putin, an avid ice hockey player, almost somersaulted when he crashed to the ground during a match in Sochi at the age of 64, CNN reported. According to Proekt, the player Pavel Bure had crashed into him. After this, an orthopedic traumatologist known to regularly treat the president checked in to a hospital just outside Putin's residence, Proekt reported. Between August 8 and 16 that year, the president disappeared from public view, with oncologist-surgeon Evgeny Selivanov, Proekt reported. The presence of an ENT doctor suggested a thyroid issue, the outlet said. Selivanov joined Putin's medical entourage, flying to his location 35 times in the space of four years, the outlet reported. Only ENT doctors have seen him more often, the outlet said. Putin disappeared from view from February 12 to 1 in 2018, just one month before polling day, Proekt reported. Acknowledging his canceled events, Peskov said Putin has a cold, per ABC News. A COVID-19 outbreak among presidential staff in September last year led Putin to self-isolate for two weeks. Ten days later, he denied any ill health after he was seen coughing during a televised meeting. Soon after, The New York Times reported that Putin was imposing increasingly stringent isolation procedures on anyone due to see him face-to-face — including isolation for two weeks prior and the requirement to pass through a disinfectant tunnel. This came weeks after Russia lifted most of its COVID-19 measures nationwide, the paper reported. By February 2022 — as world leaders implored him not to invade Ukraine — Putin was having his in-person meetings at an extraordinarily long table. Bizarre footage of Putin meeting with his defense minister on April 21 showed the president gripping the edge of the table, looking uncomfortable and fidgety, as Newsweek reported. Along with his bloated appearance, the video prompted a welter of tabloid speculation — none of which was confirmed — that he could be suffering from the effects of steroid treatment or Parkinson's disease. —max seddon (@maxseddon) April 21, 2022 Further unverified rumors were emanated from an anonymous Telegram account claiming to be a former Kremlin insider. In early May, New Lines Magazine obtained a recording of an unnamed Russian oligarch saying that Putin ""is very ill with blood cancer."" The oligarch, who did not know he was being recorded, went on to criticize Putin's invasion of Ukraine, saying that ""we all hope"" he dies, and that ""the problem is with his head."" Ukrainian intelligence chief Maj. Gen.

5/20/2022,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The wife of a New Hampshire man accused of killing her co-worker after he discovered they were texting — and then forcing her to behead him — denied shooting him Wednesday, and testified that both were brutally assaulted by her husband in the hours leading up to the death that night. Britany Barron, 33, testified at her husband's first-degree murder trial that he choked and punched her and eventually put his gun into her mouth. “You know that you’re going to die tonight, right?” she testified her husband, Armando Barron, said in September 2020, not long before the two left the house to go to the park where he allegedly used her phone to tell the co-worker to meet her there. “Don't do anything stupid or the girls are going to walk into something (expletive) gruesome,"" she testified he said as they were leaving. He had sent the couple's three young children to go to their grandmother's home next door. On the way to the park, he read the texts aloud, striking her after finishing each one, she said. Britany, who asked a prosecutor in the Keene courtroom to address her by her maiden name, Mitchell, also testified that just a week earlier, she had told Armando she no longer loved him and wanted a divorce. When he heard that, he grabbed her throat and started choking her, saying, “Are you serious?"" She denied early in her testimony that she was the one who shot Jonathan Amerault, as a defense lawyer alleged during opening statements Tuesday. She pointed to her husband as the shooter. Barron pleaded not guilty to killing Amerault, 25. He acknowledged in court Tuesday that he had struck Britany, broke her nose, attempted to strangle her, and kicked Amerault in the head. Prosecutors allege that Armando Barron, 32, used his wife's cellphone to lure Amerault to the park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault and and tried to force his wife to shoot him. She refused. He also forced her to stand on his neck and slit his wrists, they said. Armando Barron forced Amerault into the back of the victim's car and told Britany to get into the driver's seat, she testified. At one point, he left them alone, she said. There was a machete inside and Britany testified that Amerault told her to pick it up and kill her husband, but she said no. “I wasn't going to test him,"" she said. She said Armando Barron eventually got into the car and shot Amerault three times. Barron had his wife drive the car back to their home in Jaffrey to pack some supplies, and he followed in the couple's car. They then headed 200 miles north (322 kilometers) to a remote campsite, with Barron talking on the phone with her throughout the trip, she testified. There, Armando Barron allegedly forced her to cut off Amerault’s head and bury it and wrap the body in a tarp. He left her to dispose of the body and returned home, she testified. “He said that we needed to cut off his head so that there would be no dental records of the body,"" Britany testified, saying she used a saw brought from home. She testified that they both destroyed evidence. The body was found by New Hampshire Fish and Game officers in a swamp after they found Britany at the campsite, where she was not allowed to camp. Britany testified that she and Amerault got to know each other better while working on a project in the days leading to his death and communicated via texting and social media apps. One afternoon, they drove to a nearby park after work and talked. She described him as kind, sweet and funny. “I said I couldn't offer anything more than friendship,"" she testified, and later gave him a quick kiss when he returned her to work so she could get her car. They shared one more kiss during a work break that week, a day before the texts were discovered. Britany pleaded guilty last year to three counts of falsifying evidence and was released from jail on parole last month. She apologized to Amerault’s family during her sentencing. The Associated Press had not been naming the couple in order not to identify Britany Barron, who said she suffered extreme abuse. Through her lawyer, she recently agreed to the use of her name.",U.S./Associated Press,Wife denies shooting co-worker in beheading case,https://news.yahoo.com/wife-denies-shooting-co-worker-170511760.html
5/20/2022,"On a sunny day at The Boathouse, a Santa Barbara restaurant, a Karen decided to cause an unnecessary ruckus. In a five-minute video recording of the incident, the woman confronts the person recording, a Black man, and takes things to another level.
 On May 11, Ian Soleimani, a local DJ, shared to his Instagram the footage he caught of the incident. The Daily Dot reported the woman had tried to pay at the restaurant with a PayPal card but the transaction declined. The restaurant allegedly held her ID and told her to come back the next day with another payment method. In the video, the woman goes back and forth with the manager asking for her ID and insisting she paid.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce “What part of you rejecting the payment don’t you recall because I know it wasn’t you, it was your Dr. Phil,” the woman said in the video. Then, she notices Soleimani recording her. More from the Daily Dot: “Hi, one of four black men in Santa Barbara,” she tells him. “Oh, now I’m a racist, terrible person. Oh, sorry, just because you’re an obnoxious guy. It’s not your fault that you’re black, of course.” “I’m against obnoxious people to be fair, not against black people,” she continues. The woman then turns to Soleimani and once again mentions his race amidst sarcastically calling him Mother Theresa for recording. “Again, don’t you have some fish to catch, African-American man?” she says. According to one of Soleimani’s comments on his Instagram post, he was wearing a Santa Barbara Fish Market sweater which may have prompted the woman’s fishing comments. “Don’t you want to go on a boat and do some African-American fishing?” It’s not your fault you’re Black?? African-American fishing?? Watch the full video from Soleimani’s Instagram page. Anywho, the situation concluded with the woman getting her ID back while also being told she’s not allowed at the restaurant again. Soleimani told The Daily Dot this wasn’t the first time somebody racist was kicked out the establishment. “People have been kicked out of boathouse a few times for [racially] motivated comments towards myself unfortunately. After experiencing stuff like that on and off for as long as that restaurant has been open, just doesn’t surprise me. Just learned how to deal with it better,” said Soleimani. Oh!

5/20/2022,"A South Carolina man, who has been in prison for seven years for a deadly Rock Hill fire that killed his baby brother, was denied parole Wednesday. However, even with that denial, it appears under state law that Jacob Matthew Morgan could be released from prison as early as December. At that point he would have served about half of a 15-year sentence. Morgan, now 24, was denied a chance at release Wednesday by the unanimous vote of a panel of the S.C. Parole Board after a video conference hearing, said Valerie Suber, associate deputy director of the S.C. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The parole board had gathered in Columbia. Morgan appeared in the parole hearing from MacDougall Correctional Institute in Berkeley County. It was his second parole hearing after he was denied in May 2021. Joshua Hill, Morgan’s younger brother, was 14 months old when he died in the March 2015 mobile home fire in York County, just outside Rock Hill. Morgan was babysitting at the time. The incident captured national attention. Morgan pleaded guilty in 2016 under what is called an Alford plea, a negotiated agreement with prosecutors where Morgan did not have to admit guilt but accepted there was evidence against him that would likely convict him. The agreement came after he had been indicted on charges of first-degree arson and murder and faced up to life in prison. Morgan was convicted in 2016 on charges of third-degree arson, involuntary manslaughter and child neglect. Morgan did not admit guilt Wednesday. Parole Board chairman Henry Eldridge, of Tega Cay in York County, said Morgan was convicted of a serious charge and asked Morgan how he felt about it. “Not a day goes by that I don’t regret my brother’s death,” Morgan replied to Eldridge via teleconference. “I would gladly change places with him.” Eldridge then asked Morgan why he became involved in the deadly incident. Morgan replied that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but did not elaborate. Morgan acknowledged in the hearing after a statement from Eldridge that he has received mental health treatment while in prison. Eldridge asked Morgan if he would work if released from prison to live with his mother. “I can work if it’s necessary,” Morgan said. “I have to be responsible for my own life.” The hearing ended with no more questions. Eldridge told Morgan the parole board would vote and Morgan would be advised of the vote results. The vote was released shortly afterward. Parole board hearings are public meetings. The Herald, a part of McClatchy company, obtained permission from South Carolina parole officials to watch Wednesday’s hearing. There were no other speakers at the hearing. In 2021 Morgan’s mother spoke as an advocate for him to be released. The 2016 guilty plea and sentence, later discussions about Morgan and the case, were covered by local media and other outlets such as CNN Headline News, the Daily Mail from the United Kingdom, and regional media in both Carolinas. Police and prosecutors said in court in 2016 that Morgan set fire in at least two places in the mobile home, and did not call for help despite having a cellphone. Prosecutors said in 2016 that Morgan had set a fire two weeks before the fatal incident. Police and prosecutors said in court that Morgan lied to cover up the crime and knew that his brother would die in the fire. Sixteenth Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett said Wednesday, after Morgan was denied parole, that Morgan should serve his full sentence. There was no question the fatal fire was set intentionally and a child died, Brackett said. “It is appropriate that Mr Morgan serve his full sentence in this case,” Brackett said. Morgan’s lawyer from arrest through the 2016 guilty plea, 16th Circuit Public Defender B.J. Barrowclough, said Morgan deserves parole. “It is extremely disappointing that Jacob Morgan was denied parole again today,” Barrowclough said in a statement to The Herald. “When he went to prison he was a gentle and soft-hearted young man who had endured a difficult childhood. A quick review of his incarceration on the SCDC website shows he’s had no disciplinaries. His crime, even from the State’s perspective, was one of recklessness, not evil intent. And I know the victim’s family, which is his family, want him home because they never wanted him incarcerated in the first place. To deny this young man parole is an indictment of the parole system.” Morgan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for all three convictions, court records. The S.C. Department of Corrections Web site shows that Morgan is eligible for release from prison in December. His release date is Dec. 23. Chrysti Shain, spokesperson for the corrections department, said South Carolina law allows inmates to reduce their sentences by earning work and educational credits. In the 2021 parole hearing, Morgan said he earned a General Equivalency Diploma to graduate high school while in prison.",U.S./Rock Hill Herald,Rock Hill SC man again denied parole after conviction in fire that killed baby brother,https://news.yahoo.com/rock-hill-sc-man-again-202439343.html
