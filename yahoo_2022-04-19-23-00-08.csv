4/19/2022,"An accused cannibal from Idaho, who allegedly microwaved and ate an elderly man’s body parts, has been found fit to stand trial. James David Russell, 40, has been deemed competent to stand trial for the September murder and suspected cannibalism of 70-year-old David Flaget, the Bonner County Daily Bee reports. Russell has been involuntarily committed since October, where he has been undergoing intensive psychological and psychiatric treatment in order to regain his competence, according to the Daily Bee. On April 5, a doctor at the institution provided an evaluation to District Magistrate Judge Tera A. Harden determining that Russell is now mentally able to participate in a trial. Russell was charged last year with both first-degree murder and cannibalism in connection with Flaget’s death. Parts of Flaget’s mutilated body were discovered inside his vehicle on Russell family’s property in Clark Fork, Idaho on Sept. 10 according to a probable cause affidavit previously obtained by Oxygen.com. Both of his wrists had been bound with duct tape and his remains were covered in trash bags. Some of his body parts were missing, which Russell had allegedly tried to eat. “His body showed postmortem removal of the penis, scrotum, both testicles and flesh of the outer right thigh,” the charging documents stated. A medical examiner allegedly determined that Russell may have microwaved some of Flaget’s flesh; forensic testing allegedly confirmed that Flaget’s DNA found in a bowl in Russell’s apartment, while the missing body parts were never found. Blood was allegedly found in the microwave, the Daily Bee reports. Flaget was the groundsman for the Russell family property where Russell was living at the time of the murder. Investigators believe he was killed by blunt force trauma. A review hearing for the case has been scheduled for May 17, according to a court docket obtained by Law&Crime. A two-day preliminary hearing is set for June 13 and 14.",U.S./Oxygen,Accused Cannibal Who Allegedly Microwaved Elderly Man’s Body Parts Fit To Stand Trial,https://news.yahoo.com/accused-cannibal-allegedly-microwaved-elderly-214913846.html

""The battle for Donbas, which was announced and apparently began yesterday, is under way and is going very cautiously. The battle will not go in Russia's favour,"" he said on national television.

4/19/2022,"Experts are warning China’s recent string of COVID-19 lockdowns is about to send another shock through global supply chains. At least 373 million people—in cities that represent roughly 40% of China’s gross domestic product—have been affected by the most recent wave of lockdowns across China, Reuters reported last week. The strict lockdowns have left some residents desperate for food, and led to viral videos of Shanghai residents screaming from the windows of their high-rise apartments. And with Chinese President Xi Jinping doubling down on the country’s zero-COVID approach, what happens in China isn’t likely to stay there. Global supply chains are set to take a hit. After all, Shanghai is home to the world’s largest port, and although it has largely remained open, trucks are struggling to unload cargo due to strict permit regulations, causing shipping containers to stack up. “Even with air and ocean ports open, the length of the shutdown could make this iteration the most significant logistics disruption since the start of the pandemic,” the shipping company Freightos said in an update to clients this week. That’s rough news for the American consumer, given the fact that the U.S. imported more goods from China than anywhere else in the world over the past decade. In 2020 alone, the U.S imported roughly $435 billion worth of goods from Chinese cities, and sent another $125 billion to the country in exports, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. That means, once lockdowns end, there’s going to be an “overwhelming movement of goods” that cripples supply chains, Jon Monroe, an ocean shipping and supply chain expert who runs Jon Monroe Consulting, told FreightWaves on Friday. “It’s probably worse than Wuhan. You’re going to have a lot of pent-up orders,” he said. Lars Jensen, the CEO of the shipping industry advisor Vespucci Maritime, said that he doesn’t see any immediate end in sight to production and logistics disruptions in China either. “The supply chain situation in Shanghai continues to worsen. The port is running out of capacity for some types of cargo as importers cannot collect their goods,” Jensen wrote in a Friday post. “With the outbreak in Guangzhou also leading to shutdowns there, the impact on export volumes out of China will grow larger.” Investment banks are also sounding the alarm on the potential impact of the strict lockdowns in China. In a note downgrading Chinese GDP growth expectations, UBS said even more localities have initiated “de facto lockdowns” since finding COVID-19 cases. “Logistic problems were more widespread in April, leading to production disruptions in multiple industries,” the UBS team led by economist Tao Wang wrote. “This could impact China’s trade more significantly in April.” The economists added that they believe the Chinese government is unlikely to adjust its current policy anytime soon, even if they are working to reduce transport blockages and production disruptions, meaning supply chain chaos is likely to continue in the near term. The effects of the widespread lockdowns in China are already being felt as far as Europe, according to the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The organization sent a letter to the Chinese government urging them to revise their policies last week, arguing the effects of the lockdowns have already begun to affect European suppliers. A flash survey from the German Chamber of Commerce in China conducted in the first week of April found that roughly half of German companies' logistics, warehousing, and supply chain operations were ""completely disrupted or severely impacted by the current COVID-19 situation in China,"" Reuters reported.

Two were found dead off base, and a third was unresponsive on the ship and later died, the Navy said. The Navy said an investigation is underway and the deaths don't seem connected. Three sailors on board the USS George Washington were found dead within a week, the US Navy told CNN. The Navy confirmed the deaths and the timeline to CNN, but did not give a reason for the deaths. Cmdr. Reann Mommsen, a Navy spokeswoman, told CNN: ""While these incidents remain under investigation, there is no initial indication to suggest there is a correlation between these tragic events."" ""Our thoughts and condolences are with the family, friends, and shipmates of our Sailors,"" he said. Two sailors were found dead at off-base locations on April 9 and 10, and another was found unresponsive on the ship on Friday and later died, CNN reported.

4/19/2022,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova's president called on Tuesday for people and opposition politicians to refrain from using Russian symbols during May 9 celebrations to mark victory in World War Two because Russian troops were killing civilians in Ukraine. ""It is impossible to combine in the same symbol the memory of lives given for peace and the current inhumane war,"" President Maia Sandu told a briefing. In 2020, the pro-Western Sandu won election against her pro-Russian predecessor Igor Dodon, but his allies still hold influence in the former Soviet republic. Dodon has urged people to ""go on the Victory March with a St. George ribbons"" despite possible fines, referring to the black and orange striped ribbon which has become a military symbol of Russian patriotism. Last week, Moldova's parliament voted to outlaw the ribbon of St. George in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Under the new law, anyone who makes, wears or displays the striped ribbon faces a fine of at least 900 lei ($49) or 69 hours of community service. Sandu urged her political opponents – communist and socialist parties - not to divide society for the sake of their political interests. ""Moldova...defends its neutrality - and peace in society. That is why the symbols of the war waged against Ukraine are prohibited in the Republic of Moldova. I urge politicians to refrain from any provocation,"" Sandu said. Russia has repeatedly denied its troops have targeted civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 to carry out what it calls a ""special military operation"". The West and Russia vie for influence Moldova, a country of 3.5 million people, which depends on Russian energy and part of which has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists for more than three decades. Last month Sandu signed a formal application for Moldova to join the European Union, hastening its planned pro-Western course after the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Lithuania's parliament on Tuesday also voted to ban public displays of St. George ribbon, the letter ""Z"", and other symbols seen as expressing support for the Russian invasion. The ribbon of St George, first introduced as an honour by Catherine the Great, has gained significance in the Russian-speaking world since separatists in eastern Ukraine adopted it as a symbol of their support for Russia in 2014. Russian military vehicles in Ukraine are prominently marked with the letter ""Z"", and it has started appearing on social media and on clothing elsewhere in support of the war.

4/19/2022,"“The Daily Show” correspondent Jordan Klepper on Monday shared a puzzling response he’s been getting when meeting some supporters of Donald Trump. Instead of wanting to chase him down or scream at him for his videos that expose the hypocrisy of the former president and his devotees, Klepper said right-wingers now often ask him for a selfie. Klepper was “shocked” by how many selfie requests he received at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year, he said on Monday’s episode of “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” “What I quickly realized is, I’m part of the narrative there,” he explained. Klepper recalled one teenager who claimed to be Trump’s biggest fan saying he’d seen all of his videos for Trevor Noah’s Comedy Central program. The teen told Klepper he watched “all Trump stuff; good, bad” because “it’s all part of this world.” “Even though I might be espousing some points of view that he doesn’t agree with, I’m the heel in this WWE world,” Klepper suggested. “He needs me. And so he might be mildly aggressive towards me, but beyond that he’s more excited to get this close to the world.” Watch the full interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/19/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian forces are ""methodically carrying out"" plans to ""liberate"" two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Russia's defence minister said on Tuesday. Sergei Shoigu said the West, by arming Ukraine, was doing everything it could to prolong Moscow's military operation. Russian forces entered Ukraine on Feb. 24. Driven back by Ukrainian forces from an assault on Kyiv in the north, Moscow has poured troops into the east for a ground offensive in two provinces known as the Donbas. The coal- and steel-producing Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin used proxies to set up separatist ""people's republics"" in Luhansk and Donetsk. ""The plan to liberate the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics is being methodically carried out,"" Shoigu was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying at a meeting of defence officials. Western countries have given Ukraine military equipment worth billions of dollars, with the United States alone offering aid worth more than $2.5 billion. ""The United States and Western countries it controls are doing everything to drag out the special military operation as much as possible,"" Shoigu said. ""The increasing volume of foreign arms supplies clearly demonstrates their intentions to provoke the Kyiv regime to fight to the last Ukrainian standing."" Shoigu, who is close to President Vladimir Putin, has been only rarely seen in public since Russia launched what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The Kremlin said last month that this was because he was preoccupied with his duties and had no time for media activity. Moscow said its operation is designed to demilitarise Ukraine and remove what it calls dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an unprovoked attack that has forced millions to flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and left Russia increasingly isolated on the world stage. ""The actions of our forces and the quality of the weaponry being used demonstrate once again that the priority set by our military and political leadership of building up the Russian armed forces is correct,"" Shoigu said.
