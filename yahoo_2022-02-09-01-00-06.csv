2/9/2022,"Fitness influencer Brittany Dawn is being sued by the state of Texas, court documents show. She falsely claimed specialist knowledge of helping people with eating disorders, the suit alleges. She also offered generic plans and advice on ""personalized"" plans costing up to $300, it claims. Texas' Attorney General is suing fitness influencer Brittany Dawn, accusing her of misleading customers with eating disorders and promising customized nutrition and fitness plans while really giving patrons the same plan. The lawsuit by AG Ken Paxton seen by Insider alleges that for fees as high as $300 per person, Dawn sold largely similar fitness plans while claiming they were personalized to each customer. The Christian influencer —who has nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram, describes herself as a ""Jesus seeker"" and ""Kingdom chaser"" in her Instagram biography — promised individualized feedback and regular check-ins that never happened, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Dawn charged shipping fees, when all her services arrived via electronic communications. Dawn did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The suit also accuses Dawn of misrepresenting her training to give health and fitness advice to customers with eating disorders. In one instance, Dawn shared a YouTube video in which she talks about how she overcame an eating disorder, according to the lawsuit. In social media posts sharing that video, Dawn linked to her fitness and nutrition plans — which customers took to mean she could tailor her services to those illnesses, the suit alleges. The suit said Dawn has denied having offered services to people with eating disorders, but noted that 14 people complained to her and mentioned the illness in their complaints. ""The main reason I chose her out of all the coaches out there was specifically that she advertised herself as an 'eating disorder soldier,'"" another customer is quoted as saying. Dawn gave inappropriate advice to at least one customer, the suit alleges. ""I currently have an eating disorder, horrible body image views ... I am underweight for my height,"" one customer is cited as telling Dawn. The influencer went on to advise cardio exercise and a low-calorie eating plan, which could only cause further weight loss, the suit alleged. Paxton wants the court to force Dawn to actually fulfill all the personalized services she advertises, as well as bar her from claiming she can give specialist advice to people with eating disorders. The suit seeks up to $10,000 in damages claims for each violation of Texan civil law. Allegations against Dawn first bubbled up in February 2019 when fans called her a ""scammer,"" alleging she failed to fulfill promised fitness services. Soon after, she apologized to her fans and offered customers refunds — on the grounds that they sign a non-disclosure agreement, as Insider's Jacob Shamsian reported. She later dropped this requirement after an outcry. By March that year, the Texas Attorney General's office said it had received 22 complaints and that it was looking into Dawn's business. At the time, the influencer told Insider that she had addressed all of the AG's complaints.

2/9/2022,"Peloton is firing over 2,800 employees — about 20% of its corporate staff. Part of the severance package for those thousands of fired employees is a one-year Peloton membership. CEO John Foley is also stepping down, after a challenging quarter that included earlier layoffs and slowing demand. Peloton is firing over 2,800 employees — 20% of its corporate workforce — as part of the ongoing headwinds at the company. As part of the severance plan for the over 2,800 laid off employees, Pelton is offering a curious benefit: A membership to Peloton. ""The Peloton monthly membership will be complimentary for impacted team members for an additional 12 months,"" Peloton said in its press release about the layoffs. That's in addition to a ""meaningful cash severance allotment"" that's determined ""based on job level and tenure"" with the fitness company, alongside several other benefits. Peloton announced CEO John Foley is stepping down as the chief executive, with former Spotify and Netflix CFO Barry McCarthy stepping into the role. The company is also scrapping plans to build a new factory in North America. In the last few months, Peloton has seen a major downturn after home fitness products spiked in popularity during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. With gyms re-opening as vaccine rates increased, Peloton's business took a huge hit: The company's market value has dropped from $50 billion last year to $9.8 billion as of early February 2022. On the company's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday morning, Peloton execs said they expect further sales decreases in coming quarters as the at-home fitness market continues to contract to pre-pandemic levels.

2/9/2022,"""I caught the crocodile by myself. I was asking for help from people here but they were scared. It got caught in the trap I set up,"" said Central Sulawesi province resident Tili, 35, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. After capturing the reptile, Tili used a small saw to cut the tire and posed for photographs afterwards. The crocodile had been elusive, only rarely resurfacing in the water, Tili said. He set up a basic trap with a rope tied to a log with live chickens and ducks as bait. After tracking the reptile for three weeks, it escaped his trap twice. The crocodile had evoked sympathy from local residents who worried the tire would eventually choke it as the reptile grew in size. In January 2020, provincial conservation authorities had offered an unspecified reward for anyone who could remove the structure. It's unclear whether Tili will try to claim it.",Science/Reuters Videos,Tire cut from croc's neck after 6 years,https://news.yahoo.com/tire-cut-crocs-neck-6-094148702.html
2/9/2022,"Try to find Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook’s home on the street view modes of Google Maps or Apple Maps, and you’ll hit a pixelated brick wall. It’s no accident, either. Cook’s house went incognito after he won a restraining order against an alleged stalker in January. But Cook isn’t the only person who can make his home disappear from two of the most used mapping apps out there. Regular users can do the same thing, especially if you happen to find their street view features a bit too revealing for your taste. If you’re unfamiliar, Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Street View, and Apple’s version, Look Around, allow you to get a close-up look at locations from a street level. The idea is to give you a better view of the address you’re looking up. Chances are you’ve used it a few times to get a look at someplace you're heading to, like a restaurant where you're meeting friends. But the features also put your home on the internet for all the world to see. Yes, people can just drive by your house in real life and see it, but there’s something creepier about having the place where you spend most of your time on display for the entire world. Thankfully, you can blur your house via either app, making them less visible to other users. And doing so is actually surprisingly quick and easy. Here’s how. Using the Google Maps app on either your iPhone or Android device, type in your home address. Tap the image of the location to get a Street View of your residence. Then press the options button, represented by three horizontal dots, in the top right corner of the screen. From there, select “Report a problem.” You’ll then be brought to a screen with an image of your home. Arrange the photo so that your house is in the red square. Then under the “Request blurring” option choose “My home.” Next, enter your exact address in the dialog box to blur your house. You can also blur your car and license plate if you’d rather no one see those, either. Then enter your email address and click submit. It can take some time for the blurring to take effect, but once the request is submitted, it will be permanently blocked. That means you can’t un-blur it either, so make sure this is something you want to stick with. If you’re using your laptop or desktop, the process is identical to the one for the app. Just look up your address, enter Street View, click report a problem, and choose blur “My home.” Apple Maps makes things a bit easier than Google Maps. Instead of having to go through a request process, you can submit an email to Apple at MapsImageCollection@apple.com and request that your particular address be blurred on Apple Maps. The whole process is very straightforward. Just be sure you are certain you want to blur the location for good. I personally like to go on a digital stroll around my childhood neighborhood every once in a while to kill time and see what’s changed in the years since I moved. If that’s something you might want to do in the future, then it’s best to leave your home easily visible. If not, blur away.
