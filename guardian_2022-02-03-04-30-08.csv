2/3/2022,"The advance version of Rishi Sunak’s grand bargain for the retail energy sector, to be presented in full on Thursday, sounds a reasonable fudge. All households will probably get a £200 rebate off their bills, to be funded via vast loans to the supply companies; and low-income and vulnerable customers will get further support from the public purse. In its own terms, it’s coherent: knock the sharp edges off April’s hike in bills and pray that wholesale gas prices plunge before next winter. But let us hope the chancellor answers this question: what’s plan B if wholesale prices don’t fall over the course of the year?  That, unfortunately, is how the future currently looks. Regulator Ofgem, also in action on Thursday, is likely to lift its price cap from £1,277 to £2,000-ish but worse is coming down the track. Analysts currently project that the mechanical formula will spit out £2,300-ish for an average dual-fuel bill in October’s adjustment. If that materialises, would Sunak’s sanction even more loans to defer the moment at which the full blast of higher prices is felt by high-income customers? Remember that Bulb already sits on the state’s book, supported by a £1.7bn loan of its own. If the £200-a-household exercise involves £5.5bn (which is how the maths on 27m homes comes out), it requires little imagination to see how the state’s lending exposure could quickly approach the £10bn mark. That is a serious sum, especially when more corporate casualties are expected. Doing nothing was not an option for Sunak, but finding a safe exit from this mammoth intervention could prove the hardest part. The bet here is not every billion will be returned to the Treasury. The cynical way to view chief executive Nick Read’s latest pitch to Vodafone’s suffering shareholders is to call it another airing of the “give us time” routine. But Read may have a point: you can’t just dial up deals. Talk about pursuing transactions with “multiple parties in multiple markets” is really a way of saying that Vodafone is game for a spot of “in-market consolidation”, in the jargon, if only regulators and other companies can be persuaded to play ball. Has a working-from-home pandemic reset competition rules? Will EU regulators now tolerate a reduction to three big mobile operators in a member state if faster 5G rollout, for example, is promised in return? If so, Vodafone might get somewhere in Spain, Italy and Portugal. And the UK, where a Vodafone-Three tie-up is constantly rumoured, can ignore Brussels if it wishes these days. But it takes two to tango, which seems to be one of Vodafone’s struggles. Similarly, Read can argue that he has been trying to make things happen on the masts side. The separation of Vantage Towers via a listing in Frankfurt did nothing for Vodafone’s share price because a 82% stake was retained, but the nucleus of “a European champion”, as he puts it, was created. It just needs one or both of Deutsche Telekom or Orange in France to perform their own internal re-jigs. In theory, the arrival of Cevian as an activist investor puts a rocket under management. In practice, simplification may be a slower burn than everyone wishes. In the meantime, Vodafone could do itself a favour by finding non-executives with telecoms expertise; on that score, at least, it’s got no excuse for delay. Annington Homes’ threat to sue the Ministry of Defence was virtually guaranteed when the landlord cried “expropriation” last week after the MoD said it would explore ways to take back control of 38,000 military homes by exercising “statutory leasehold enfranchisement rights”. The new twist on Wednesday was the offer by Annington, controlled by Guy Hands’ private equity firm Terra Firma, to settle the dispute peacefully. Would the MoD like a one-off refurbishment payment of £105m? Or perhaps it would prefer to buy the whole portfolio at its market price (or valuer CBRE’s estimate of a market price) of £7.97bn? On the face of it, it’s hard to see why the MoD would jump at either proposal. A sum of £105m ain’t a knockout when you consider that Annington paid a dividend of £794m last autumn. As for the buying the whole bundle of properties, surely the MoD’s aim in launching a test case was to establish, first, if the enfranchisement principle applies, and, second, where an independent valuer would set a market price. This battle may not go the distance, but one suspects there are a few more rounds yet. As things stand, the MoD can be mildly encouraged by developments.

2/3/2022,"The appointment of Michael Gove as secretary of state for levelling up last September was an apparent statement of intent by Boris Johnson. His most effective and energetic minister had been tasked with delivering his administration’s flagship policy, on which its prospects of re-election were believed to depend. The phrase “levelling up” has been criticised for its vagueness and lack of definition. But the political logic at work in its formulation was always crystal clear. The Brexit referendum and its aftermath led swathes of voters in post-industrial Labour heartlands to vote for a Conservative government. In order to consolidate the support of the red wall, Mr Johnson pledged to rebalance an economy that suffers from a higher level of regional inequality than any comparable country. However opportunistically the prime minister stumbled upon it, this is a praiseworthy and vital agenda. As Mr Gove said on Wednesday in the House of Commons, parts of the nation have felt “overlooked and undervalued” for decades.  The long-awaited levelling up white paper was supposed to lay out how this gigantic challenge would be met. It failed miserably to do so. Instead, Mr Gove offered a set of unresourced aspirations to be delivered by 2030 in areas such as health, transport, living standards, crime and “wellbeing”. These 12 “missions” to level up were coupled with a commitment to greater devolution across England, but no significant new powers were offered to mayors or local authorities. For the rest, it was mostly ad hoc, unstrategic stuff. Local regeneration projects were announced for 20 new towns and cities, starting with Sheffield and Wolverhampton, but the money appears to have been recycled. The pledge to increase R&D spending outside London and the south-east is certainly welcome, as is some money to improve the quality of parks and fund activities for young people. But Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal this was not. Such an anaemic end product after months of speculation and delay is profoundly disappointing, but hardly unexpected. It has long been clear that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has no intention of spending the kind of money necessary to level up regions scarred by accelerated deindustrialisation under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, and hammered by austerity under David Cameron. Mr Sunak’s refusal in November to fund the “northern powerhouse” high-speed rail line linking Bradford, Leeds and Manchester spoke volumes. Having unsuccessfully pleaded with the Treasury for proper resources, Mr Gove has been reduced to setting impressive-sounding long-term targets while offering little idea of how they will be met. Mr Johnson, a diminished prime minister beset by scandal, is in no position to twist his chancellor’s arm. The mismatch between what has been offered and what is needed is dispiriting. In a recent study, the IPPR thinktank noted that allocations in 2021 from the levelling-up fund added up to £32 per person in the north of England. That compares with a £413 per person drop in council spending on services during the austerity decade. Mr Johnson himself, in a speech in July, agreed that there “has to be a catalytic role for government” in levelling up, and cited the example of Germany’s transformation of its eastern regions since reunification. Between 1990 and 2014, successive German governments spent £71bn a year supporting private investment, building infrastructure and increasing productivity. That is what premier-league levelling up looks like. The government – however fluent Mr Gove’s rhetoric and deft his presentational skills – is playing in a far lower league. Electoral fate presented this administration with the opportunity to rectify some of the damage done by its Tory predecessors in post-industrial Britain. Wednesday’s underwhelming, underfunded and overhyped white paper will not do that.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the levelling up white paper: anaemic and inadequate to the task | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-levelling-up-white-paper-anaemic-and-inadequate-to-the-task
2/3/2022,"Smart daily brain tease works magic, makes eager crowd happy, later turns truly viral – until game’s adept maker earns great money (ample Times bucks). Yes, it is sometimes hard not to think entirely in five-letter words after an encounter with Wordle, the online game that requires participants to guess a five-letter word in six tries. It was quietly launched last October by Josh Wardle, a Welsh, Brooklyn-based software engineer who created it for the amusement of his partner. In November, its users numbered a few hundred. Now, they are in the millions. Mr Wardle has sold the game to the New York Times for a seven-figure sum – having previously said that he felt somewhat overwhelmed by the responsibility to the game’s fans to keep the site running perfectly.  Wordle’s (and Wardle’s) success is entirely deserved, even though it is sad to see the plucky, independent puzzle sucked up into the insatiable maw of big business. The game seems the apogee of simplicity, but in fact that is deceptive; it is pitched to utter perfection. Its ultimate ancestor is probably Scrabble, and it has that look about it, with its colour-coded virtual tiles. There is nothing off-puttingly high-concept about the game – it appeals across the generations and it is easy to grasp how it works. It takes but a few moments to complete it, too; rare are the days that players find themselves entirely outfoxed. But it has just enough difficulty to feel teasing and testing. Finishing the game brings with it a burst of satisfaction – whether that’s a feeling of delight at solving the puzzle in two (fluke?) or three (fortunate?) goes, or the sensation of relief at managing to crack it at the last possible opportunity. Players build up their own ways of playing, some beginning each new game with the same, intensely considered “starter word”, others throwing caution to the winds with a random guess. (Sharing one’s regular starter word, it turns out, is an oddly intimate thing to do.) At a time when many people long for reassurance, the game provides precisely that. Like the readers of a well-plotted detective story, its players are made to feel smart. There’s a great appeal, too, in the way that Wordle breaks the supposed rules of what works online. Instead of bugging its users with prompts and alerts, players must remember to seek it out. Refreshingly it offers only one game a day – you cannot fritter hours away on Wordle (except by playing in other languages – many versions have sprung up, from Spanish and German to Welsh, Gaelic and even Latin). At the same time, it cleverly allows its users to share the day’s results, without specific spoilers, so that friends and family can compare the day’s game. Only the harshest of critics would begrudge Mr Wardle his windfall. He has announced that the New York Times will keep the game free to access – and he is working with them, he says, to make the transition to the paper’s site as smooth as possible. The New York Times, for its part, must take its duty of care seriously. Even to consider hiding Wordle behind a paywall would be against the innocent spirit of this wholly delightful game.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Wordle: let the game stay free | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/the-guardian-view-on-wordle-let-the-game-stay-free
2/3/2022,"Canada’s Conservatives have ousted their leader amid accusations of “flip-flopping” on key Tory issues, and a broader debate over whether the party should appeal to a more rightwing voting base. In a secret ballot held on Wednesday, 73 Conservative parliamentarians voted to remove Erin O’Toole as leader. Forty-five voted for him to keep his job.  The vote comes as potential candidates to replace O’Toole have embraced a well-funded protest in Ottawa over vaccine mandates and public health measures, spearheaded by far-right groups. O’Toole, a former air navigator, took the party’s top job in 2020. But support for him collapsed after he was unable to topple Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party in the September 2021 election. In the months since, O’Toole has battled restlessness within the party, facing accusations that his positions on a carbon tax and assault weapons are inconsistent and that he has driven a wedge through the Conservatives over social issues, including LGBTQ protections. Earlier this week, 35 of the party’s 118 members of parliament signed a letter calling for a change in leadership, effectively forcing the vote on O’Toole’s political future. “I am asking for your support, colleagues. I am asking to have the courage to give a chance to our teams,” he said during the caucus meeting. “You have been heard. My goal will be to bring us together.” O’Toole, a four-term MP, had previously warned that a tack to the right risked losing any gains the party had made and would set it up for another loss to the Liberal party. O’Toole’s challenges have also come from former caucus members, who sent a letter earlier this week calling for a change in leadership. “Erin O’Toole has not only failed to unite the party, his words and actions in recent days have created greater disunity. It is time for him to step aside for the good of the Conservative party and the nation,” the former MPs wrote. Wednesday’s vote marks the second time Conservatives have searched for a leader during the coronavirus pandemic and comes amid questions over the trajectory of the party’s policies. A previous rift in the party after a tense leadership battle between former leader Andrew Scheer and Maxime Bernier led to a splintering, with Bernier forming his far-right People’s Party of Canada.",News/World news,Canada Conservatives oust leader Erin O’Toole,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/erin-otoole-canada-conservatives-oust-leader
2/3/2022,"Ashley Giles has become the first casualty from England’s chastening, error-strewn defeat in the men’s Ashes this winter after being sacked as director of men’s cricket and replaced by Andrew Strauss on an interim basis.Giles met with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Wednesday after recently submitting his report into the failed tour and was told his three-year spell in charge of the national team was being terminated with immediate effect.  It now comes down to Strauss, who Giles replaced in 2019, to decide the fate of Chris Silverwood as head coach looking ahead to the tour of the Caribbean in March. Both Silverwood and Graham Thorpe, the assistant coach, appear unlikely to survive after a sorry run of Test results that produced one win from the team’s last 14 outings and ended with the 4-0 defeat in Australia. A statement from the ECB read: “Ashley Giles is standing down as managing director, England men’s cricket. Ashley is leaving after three years in the role during which England Men became 50-over World Champions and are currently ranked the world’s best T20I side, 2nd in ODIs and 4th for Tests. “Sir Andrew Strauss has agreed to step into the role on an interim basis and will put in place arrangements for the forthcoming West Indies tour, while the search begins for a full-time replacement.” “I’d like to thank everyone for the support they’ve given me, particularly all the staff and the players, as well as the board for giving me this opportunity,” Giles said. “The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging and I’m proud of what we’ve been able to deliver in the toughest of circumstances.” “Despite these challenges, over the past three years, we have become 50-over world champions, the top ranked T20I side in the world, we remain [the] fourth-ranked Test team and our under-19s have just reached the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. “I wish all our players and staff great success for the future. I’m now looking forward to spending some time with my family before looking at the next challenge.” Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, said: “I’m extremely grateful to Ashley for his commitment and contribution to England men’s cricket over the last three years. “Under his leadership the teams have scored some notable results, most memorably the dramatic victory in the 2019 men’s Cricket World Cup, while dealing with some of the most challenging times English cricket has ever been through. “He’s highly respected throughout the game and has made a huge contribution to the ECB and England men’s cricket. Off the back of a disappointing men’s Ashes this winter, we must ensure we put in place the conditions across our game to enable our Test team to succeed.” England are due to announce their squad for the upcoming Test series against the West Indies next week.

2/3/2022,"People in Linlithgow campaigning to stop the UK’s biggest pub chain from changing the “extremely offensive” name of the town’s historic Black Bitch tavern have vowed to fight on after it was announced it would become the Willow Tree. Greene King announced on Wednesday that it would change the name of the popular 17th-century pub in West Lothian despite concerted opposition to the move, which has angered and upset many residents since it was first announced in November.  The proposal to rebrand the Black Bitch – which was named after a 13th-century legend about a black greyhound who brought food to her starving master – has resulted in protests, a 12,000-signature petition and a challenge by the local council. It has also been blamed for a rise in online racist abuse towards the town’s BAME community. But the Greene King chief executive, Nick Mackenzie, said his commitment to changing the name was “unwavering”. The company has publicly apologised for its founder’s links to transatlantic slavery and has already changed the names of two pubs called the Black Boy, as well as another called the Black’s Head. “There’s been plenty of publicity around those who don’t agree with our decision, but we’ve also had letters of support from people in Linlithgow,” he said. “This is a difficult balance and throughout this we have continued to highlight our respect for the history of Linlithgow. Our decision is not meant to diminish or denigrate the heritage of the town but at the same time we recognise that language has changed and the name can be extremely offensive to people.” Alistair Old, who leads the campaign to retain the pub’s name, challenged the scope of Greene King’s consultation with local people and said that the action committee planned to hold a town meeting “on what appropriate action to take in the face of this appalling insult to Linlithgow”. He said: “This company continues to pretend that they have some sort of mandate to proclaim that the historic name of the Black Bitch is racist and offensive, when nearly 12,000 people have signed a petition telling them they are wrong. West Lothian council have asked them to stop defaming the town’s heritage, but the removal of the name sends out that exact message.” The new name references a nearby statue of drover Katie Wearie and Katie Wearie’s willow tree, which was planted originally in 1832 to mark the Reform Act in Scotland. Last week, West Lothian council unanimously agreed a cross-party motion urging Greene King to “reflect on the wishes of the community and issues raised”. The composite motion read: “For generations people who were born within the boundary of the royal burgh have been proud to be known as Black Bitches given their association with the town. The origin reason given for the name change, that it was racist effectively, now makes this a slur on the reputation of these residents.”",News/UK news,Campaigners to fight on as Black Bitch pub becomes Willow Tree,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/campaigners-to-fight-on-as-black-bitch-pub-becomes-willow-tree
2/3/2022,"There was a popular Lee and Herring sketch in the 1990s in which the pair shout “you want the moon on a stick, you do”. Prime ministers, likewise, are used to being asked for more than they can possibly deliver. But usually they cherry-pick their priorities. David Cameron, or more accurately his chancellor, George Osborne, decided to focus on the north of England, with the “northern powerhouse”.  With the 332-page “levelling up” white paper, Boris Johnson goes full moon-on-stick, with 12 missions which promise to address some of the most intractable problems in society – from increasing life expectancy to eliminating illiteracy and innumeracy – all by 2030. Only the most churlish of critics could argue against halving the number of poor-quality rented homes or reducing crime, but they may well ask: how are you going to pay for it? The white paper does not have the answer. Some of the missions are simpler than others. It feels plausible that the government could ensure an increase of 40% in domestic public investment in R&D outside the greater south-east in eight years. Rolling out 4G broadband to the whole of the UK and 5G to most of the population seems achievable in that time frame too. China could do it in a few months. One of the policies proposed under the mission of reducing homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime is a “national spring clean”, under which offenders on community service would spruce up their local streets. Increasing healthy life expectancy will be much harder, involving as it does human willpower rather than fibre-optic cable. It is much easier to dig up a road than to get people to stop smoking, drink less and eat better. The white paper promises a “devolution revolution”, with more mayors “for those areas that want one”. Does this mean a series of referendums to ask the people of Cornwall – and eight other places, including Hull and East Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Norfolk and Suffolk – if they want their own Andy Burnham or Ben Houchen? Or will it be for local councils to make the decision? Are the powers on offer sufficient to complete these national missions locally without just following government orders? One reason Johnson likes mayors, now he isn’t one, is that he can devolve blame for the local implementation of unpopular national policies. In Greater Manchester, Burnham is currently at risk of turning from king of the north into an enemy of small business people after following government instructions to reduce air pollution by bringing in a clean air zone. The most polluting vans, buses, lorries and camper vans will soon be charged between £10 and £60 a day to drive around the 500-square-mile region. Burnham pleaded with the government for a rethink on Wednesday after Johnson dismissed the plan as “completely unworkable” at prime minister’s questions. Ten days after it emerged the government had halved the money it promised for improving local bus services, the white paper promises that by 2030 “local public transport connectivity across the country will be significantly closer to the standards of London”. “London standards” means regular services and sensible fares across all transport modes. It is often helpful to compare the service offered by London’s 46-mile Central line with trains chuntering between neighbouring towns and cities far from the capital. Take Sheffield and Doncaster, just 22 miles apart. There are currently just two trains an hour between these major conurbations, with a journey time of up to 41 minutes. The levelling up paper – like the integrated rail plan before it, which cancelled HS2 to Sheffield – does not offer a solution to this frankly embarrassing state of affairs. But it does single out the Steel City, along with Wolverhampton, as one of the first places to benefit from a project to “restore local pride” by “transforming derelict urban sites into beautiful communities”. Instead, under “transport”, there is a promise of a pilot project in Cornwall to “enable increased frequencies and reduced fares, with high-frequency services in densely- populated areas and new forms of demand-responsive transport to places, such as business parks and rural villages, that are not well served by linear bus routes”. All six Cornish constituencies are currently represented by Conservatives.

2/3/2022,"Zac Goldsmith has insisted that an official who worked in his private office was mistaken when they emailed last August to say Boris Johnson had authorised the rescue of Pen Farthing and his charity’s cats and dogs from Kabul. The Foreign Office minister told the House of Lords the email “was not sent under my instruction” and the decision to clear Farthing’s flight had in fact been “communicated by the defence secretary publicly in tweets” on 25 August.  Goldsmith was facing questions over the evacuation of the former Royal Marine, a week after an email from a Foreign Office official dated 25 August, had declared “the PM has just authorised” staff and animals of Farthing’s Nowzad welfare charity to be airlifted to the UK. The minister told peers “I don’t deny that there is some confusion”, but added that he believed the official had misrepresented the situation. “It’s not uncommon in Whitehall … for decisions to be interpreted or portrayed as coming directly from one department or another, even the prime minister, even when that isn’t the case,” he said. Controversy about the rescue of Farthing and his charity’s cats and dogs from Kabul has lingered for months, amid accusations that it amounted to the prioritisation of “pets over people”. An ally of Farthing, lobbyist Dominic Dyer, has said repeatedly he understood the prime minister cleared a privately funded rescue flight. But Johnson and Downing Street have denied they gave permission for Farthing’s plane to land, leading to a row that has raised further questions about the prime minister’s integrity. Last week, Johnson insisted “this whole thing is total rhubarb” – while Labour said he had been “caught out lying”. Goldsmith told the Lords that “animals were never prioritised over people at any time” during the fortnight-long emergency airlift from Kabul. Johnson, he added, had “zero role in authorising individual evacuations from Afghanistan”. The Labour peer Lord Collins was sceptical, and asked: “Why is it someone in his private office believed that the decision to facilitate this effectuation by animals was approved by the prime minister? It’s his private office?” In his answer, Goldsmith said the Foreign Office official in question was at the time seconded to the emergency evacuations unit. “The email was not sent under my instruction. It was not sent with my knowledge. It was part of a wider process,” he told peers. Farthing had been notified last August that the rescue had been approved by the prime minister’s parliamentary private secretary Trudy Harrison. The MP had written, in a letter that subsequently leaked, that “I have received confirmation … that you, your staff and their dependents are permitted to travel”. It was signed using her official title. No 10, however, said at the time she was writing “in her capacity as a constituency MP”, although Farthing was not a constituent of hers.",News/Politics,Zac Goldsmith: official who stated PM cleared Kabul pet rescue was ‘mistaken’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/zac-goldsmith-official-who-stated-pm-cleared-kabul-pet-rescue-was-mistaken
2/3/2022,"An activist from Insulate Britain hung a banner proclaiming “insulate or die” at the high court in London on Wednesday as five members of the group were sentenced to jail. El Litten, 35, Theresa Norton, 63, Steve Pritchard, 62, and Dr Diana Warner, 62, were given custodial sentences of between 24 and 32 days. Ben Taylor, 27, who was due to be released this month from a six-month jail sentence imposed in November, was sentenced to another 32 days. Eleven more protesters received suspended sentences.  All were convicted of contempt of court for defying injunctions banning their protest blockades of the M25 during a campaign of civil disobedience last autumn. The activists had vowed to continue their actions until the government agreed to a programme of insulating all Britain’s draughty and energy-inefficient homes by 2030, or until they were sent to prison. “Each defendant made a free and deliberate decision to breach the order, knowing that the consequence might be imprisonment,” said Lord Justice William Davis, sitting alongside Mr Justice Johnson. Davis said they were not reviewing the injunction. “We are simply concerned with the fact that an order was made by a court and a court order is to be obeyed,” he said. Insulate Britain said its activists received the “lightest possible sentences”. Various defendants spoke in the high court case. Ruth Jarman, 58, said: “I admit that I broke the injunction. It was a choice I made because I answer to a higher authority, that of love and life. “I am sorry for the impact of our protests on the people who were affected. I hate disrupting people and my actions were aiming to prevent the greater disruption of climate breakdown. So I do not regret breaking the injunction and I cannot promise not to do it again.” Those sent to prison had glued themselves hand in hand on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice and refused to move until they were taken away by police. Three defendants, Liam Norton, Arne Springorum and Jess Causby, walked free on Tuesday after Davis ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. Springorum returned to the court on Wednesday to hang the group’s protest banner from a balcony overlooking the great hall of the 140-year-old court complex. The group were the third from Insulate Britain to face court for breaking the order made last September, one of a series of injunctions granted to National Highways, which banned them from blocking the M25 and its sliproads.

2/3/2022,"Theresa May has urged her local council to reconsider plans to abolish its funding of the arts amid growing concern about widespread cuts to the cultural sector across England. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM), one of the most affluent local authorities in England, is to decide on 22 February whether to make a 100% cut to its funding for the arts.  The council’s allocation for cultural services – including libraries, entertainment venues, museums, galleries and recreation facilities – has already been cut by 69% since 2009-10, according to an analysis of government data by the Public Campaign for the Arts (PCA). Across all English councils, funds have been cut by 50% since 2009-10. The withdrawal of RBWM funding will put an arts centre in the former prime minister’s constituency at risk of closure. Norden Farm Centre for the Arts in Maidenhead said council funding was “absolutely essential to keep the charity going”. May, the town’s MP for 25 years, said she had seen “first-hand the excellent programmes Norden Farm” delivered and just how valuable its work was for the local community. She had spoken to the council, saying: “I am continuing to urge [it] to reconsider their position.” May hoped RBWM and Norden Farm would find a solution that would be “in the best interest of the entire local community”. Andrew Johnson, the leader of the council, said: “The council has historically supported Norden Farm with an annual grant, and provided £80,000 this financial year, a significant support package in the context of the pandemic … Due to tight budgetary constraints it was made clear that last year the venue would receive a reduced grant and in 2022/23 grant funding would cease.” In 2009-10, the amount spent on cultural services by English councils, adjusted for inflation, averaged £118.93 a person. In 2020-21, it was £59.90. In Windsor and Maidenhead, the figure was £131.75 in 2009-10 and £41.42 in 2020-21. Eight local authorities made cuts of more than 80% to their spending on cultural services over the period. Councils are now drawing up budgets for 2022-23. Some have already announced significant cuts as arts institutions are struggling to rebuild after the impact of the Covid pandemic. Guildford borough council has announced a cut of more than a third, from £310,000 to £200,000, over the next two years in its funding of the Yvonne Arnauld theatre. Joanna Read, the venue’s director and chief executive, said: “The theatre has just come through the worst period of operation in its history. To receive this cut now, this lack of support, at such a critical time, is deeply demoralising.” Jack Gamble, the director of the PCA, said further cuts would be a hammer blow to local arts services. He said: “We appreciate the financial pressures that councils are under, partly due to cuts from national government since 2010, but sacrificing our cultural services is not the answer. “The arts are not a luxury – they provide vital benefits to our lives and communities. We have to find a way to keep funding them alongside other services – it shouldn’t be an either/or.” Norden Farm, which has a 220-seat theatre, said it had already implemented changes to reduce costs and increase income. As well as council funding, the arts centre takes income from ticket sales, hire of its premises, memberships and donations. Jane Corry, its chief executive and artistic director, said: “It’s very hard to see what else we can do. Core funding from RBWM is absolutely essential to keep the charity going.” It “took 40 years of hard work” to secure sustainable funding for the centre, and “to lose that would be too tragic to imagine”, said Corry. RBWM said it had held a “very positive meeting” with Norden Farm after a public consultation on the plans, adding that it was examining ways it could help the arts centre “to become more sustainable”. The Old Court, a 148-seat theatre in Windsor, is also at risk as a result of the council’s zero-funding proposal. Gerald Vernon-Jackson of the Local Government Association said: “Pressure on core council budgets in the past decade, alongside rising demand for statutory services like social care, has placed significant strain on cultural services, which are largely discretionary. “Councils remain the biggest public funders of culture, spending over £1bn a year in England alone. They run a nationwide network of local cultural organisations, including 3,000 libraries, 350 museums, 116 theatres and numerous castles, amusement parks, monuments, historic buildings and heritage sites. However, these budgets remain under significant pressure.”",Arts/Culture,Theresa May urges her local council to drop plan to abolish arts funding,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/02/theresa-may-local-council-plan-to-end-arts-funding-windsor-and-maidenhead
2/3/2022,"Boris Johnson has warned Vladimir Putin that he will make a “tragic miscalculation” if he invades Ukraine, in a phone call delayed since Monday and preceded by Russian insults. Putin, the Kremlin said, had complained that Russia’s demand for justifiable security guarantees have not been met. The Russian president also told Johnson that Kyiv was involved in “the chronic sabotage” of the Minsk agreements designed to reach a political settlement in the east of Ukraine, including greater autonomy.  The Kremlin did not say how Russia will respond to what it described as Nato’s unreadiness to answer what it sees as justified Russian concerns. No 10 said: “The prime minister expressed his deep concern about Russia’s current hostile activity on the Ukrainian border. He emphasised the need to find a way forward which respects both Ukraine’s territorial integrity and right to self-defence. “The prime minister stressed that any further Russian incursion into Ukrainian territory would be a tragic miscalculation.” Johnson refused to backtrack on Nato’s open door policy, saying: “All European democracies have a right to aspire to Nato membership. This right fully applies to Ukraine.” He also reiterated that Nato is a defensive alliance. The spokesperson added: “The leaders agreed that aggravation was in no one’s interest. The prime minister stressed the importance of dialogue and diplomacy, and the need to include Ukraine in talks.” Putin and Johnson agreed that they had been able to co-operate over Iran, Afghanistan and climate change, according to No 10, adding they needed to “apply this spirit of dialogue to the current tensions in order to find a peaceful resolution”. The conversation finally went ahead following a cancellation of the call on Monday due to Johnson’s need to answer MPs’ questions about the damning update to an official report showing parties had been repeatedly held in No 10 in breach of Covid regulations. Johnson was expected to use the call to try to persuade Putin he will end up paying an unacceptably high price if he invades Ukraine, including sanctions on his inner political circle and the Russian economy, export controls and fierce British-backed military resistance by Ukrainians. He also sought to warn Putin that his explicit use of energy supplies to reward his political allies in Europe and punish his opponents is going to backfire as it is driving Europe to look for more reliable alternative sources of supply. With Britain at the forefront of the nations warning about the imminence of a Russian attack, Johnson could hardly have expected the red carpet treatment, but the Kremlin in advance of the call also tried to belittle the UK’s influence in the crisis saying Putin was happy to hold talks with anyone, even the “utterly confused”. Ahead of the call Johnson told MPs: “We have been helping to bring the west together to defy what I think is completely unacceptable threats and intimidation from the Putin regime against Ukraine. “The situation is very perilous, and the job of the UK is to lead the west in bringing together the most important countries in creating a package of economic sanctions that will deter President Putin from what I believe would be a disastrous miscalculation, and also to strengthen our support for the Ukrainian people and, indeed, the Ukrainian army.”",News/World news,Boris Johnson warns Vladimir Putin against ‘tragic’ Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/boris-johnson-warns-vladimir-putin-against-tragic-ukraine-invasion-uk-russia
2/3/2022,"Crossword clues have long been one way of disguising secret messages, so an aptitude for word puzzles could be seen as a welcome skill in any aspiring spy. Alas, those proclaiming their prowess online for the latest word-game craze, Wordle, seem not to have impressed UK’s top spymaster, Richard Moore, putting him at humorous odds with the country’s other spy agency, GCHQ.  MI6 chief Moore – who goes by the codename C – tweeted his annoyance at users who post their results after playing the web-based word game, created by a British software engineer and sold for a seven-figure sum after sweeping the globe in just a few months. “Thinking of unfollowing those who post their Wordle results …” Moore tweeted. In response, GCHQ tweeted a mocked-up picture mimicking a Wordle player’s score, which read: “Sorry”. Among those who replied to Moore’s tweet, TV presenter Anneka Rice tweeted: “Oh God I agree. What’s going on here!” Among those who appreciated GCHQ’s imaginative response was the UK’s ambassador to Sweden, Judith Gough, who tweeted “Genius”. Another Twitter user queried: “@GCHQ Surely you know the Wordle answer before you start.” Twitter feeds are now full of people posting pictures of the green, yellow and grey boxes used in the puzzle which challenges players to guess a five-letter word within six tries. A green box denotes a correct letter in the correct position, a yellow one means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, and a grey box means the letter in not in the word at all. The deceptively simple online word puzzle has had a meteoric rise since its launch last autumn, from 90 daily players in November to 300,000 at the beginning of January, to two million last weekend. The game was created by Josh Wardle, who was born in Wales but now lives in New York, and was bought this week for a seven-figure sum by the owner of the New York Times newspaper, who said it would remain free to play. Hemal Jhaveri, the managing editor of Wired magazine, may have come up with a solution to curb boastful players’ enthusiasm for sharing their results, tweeting: “If I were the NY Times I’d make Wordle free to play but charge 99 cents to post your score on Twitter.” She added: “They’d recoup their investment in a day.”",News/UK news,Shush!

2/3/2022,"Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has again insisted that Russia does not currently have enough troops in place to mount a further invasion of Ukraine, a day after Boris Johnson travelled to Kyiv and said there was a “clear and present danger” of an “imminent military campaign”. Even taken together, the troops currently massed on Ukraine’s border with Russia, in the annexed Crimea peninsula and in neighbouring Belarus, are “insufficient for a large-scale military operation”, said Kuleba, in a briefing for foreign journalists on Wednesday.  Kuleba’s words once again highlighted a notable difference between the rhetoric coming out of London and Washington, where officials say Putin could launch an attack imminently, and the government in Kyiv. On Wednesday, Kuleba tried to smooth over that difference. “The tone of voice of our messages may sound different but the actual content is the same. Everything is possible and we should be preparing for every possible scenario,” he said. He insisted Ukraine, which has been fighting a war with Russia-backed forces in the east of the country for the past eight years, knew very well that Russia could attempt a further incursion. Also on Wednesday, the White House said it would stop referring to a Russian attack as “imminent”, following Ukrainian complaints. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said using the word sent an “unintended message”. It comes after a period of mutual frustration between President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team and American officials, with those in Kyiv repeatedly saying the Americans are exaggerating the imminence of the threat. Much of any analysis of the current threat hinges on guesses about Putin’s psychological state and innermost thoughts. Is he only bluffing to win concessions, or does he really plan to launch an attack? Trying to answer that question, both American and Ukrainian officials have weighed all the evidence and come up with the same answer: maybe. But Washington and Kyiv have chosen to accent that “maybe” in different ways. For the Americans, the prospect of possible conflict has been a chance to rally reluctant allies, particularly France and Germany, to make genuine commitments to Ukraine’s security. “Within the US government, there is a tendency to be a little bit coming down on the side of more alarm,” said Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine who was part of a delegation of former US ambassadors and military generals that travelled to Kyiv earlier this week. “The US is trying to martial allies and partners in Europe to do what they can to indicate to the Kremlin that the cost of an attack on Ukraine will be very significant … the goal here is to maximise pressure on the Kremlin,” said Pifer, speaking at a roundtable event in Kyiv. For Zelenskiy’s team, long-requested supplies of defensive weapons from Britain, the US and other countries are very welcome, as are numerous high-level visits to Kyiv and declarations of support. But Zelenskiy fears that the repeated talk of an “imminent” war risks scaring off investors and adding to a sense of panic that will push the struggling Ukrainian economy to breaking point. “The weapons are very helpful, but we can’t feed weapons to our pensioners. If everyone thinks there will be war tomorrow, the economy will be in real trouble,” said a high-ranking government official. One factor which has particularly irked the Ukrainians is the decision by the United States and Britain to remove some non-essential staff and dependents from their embassies, as well as advise their citizens to leave the country. Images of the chaotic evacuation of Kabul after the city fell to the Taliban were lurking in the minds of decision makers as they pulled out staff, said a diplomatic source. But Kyiv is not Kabul, and Ukrainians feel the decision has helped reinforce an image of Ukraine as a country on the brink of collapse. At a press conference last Friday, Zelenskiy criticised that decision, and also said he judged the threat from Russia to be no higher than during a previous troop buildup in spring last year. “We don’t have any misunderstandings with President Biden. I just deeply understand what’s happening in my country, just as he does with the US,” he said. London and Washington insist there is a heightened risk now, and have even publicised specific intelligence they say shows Putin may be plotting either a coup, or a full-scale invasion. In the most striking public disagreement, US defence officials briefed CNN and Reuters last weekend that Russia had moved supplies of blood close to the border, seen as a sign of imminent military action. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, categorically denied the report. “The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society,” she said. Yuriy Vitrenko, the CEO of Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state gas company, said in an interview on Wednesday that while the risks were very real, making statements that could increase panic was extremely dangerous. “If we tell everybody stop working, go and dig some trenches, it may help if the invasion is tomorrow, but it will have a detrimental effect on the economy, and if there is no invasion tomorrow, then again in a couple of months we feel these very dire consequences for the economy,” said Vitrenko. This, he said, would be to give Putin just what he wants to intervene: “As soon as we have some economic problems, it increases the risk of social unrest, and social unrest is exactly the pretext Putin is looking for.”",News/World news,Don’t panic: why Ukraine doesn’t like western talk of imminent attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/ukraine-western-talk-of-imminent-attack-putin
2/3/2022,"Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest has launched criminal proceedings against Facebook alleging the tech giant breached federal anti-money laundering laws by not cracking down sufficiently on scam ads that used his image. The action in the Western Australia magistrates court is the first time Facebook has faced criminal charges anywhere in the world, Forrest said in a statement on Thursday.  The charges allege Facebook was criminally reckless by not taking sufficient steps to stop criminals from using its social media platform to send scam advertisements that aimed to defraud Australian users. It is alleged the scam advertisements – which used Forrest’s image and purported to promote cryptocurrency investment schemes – have appeared on Facebook since March 2019. Forrest, the chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, also claims Facebook failed to create controls or a corporate culture that would prevent its systems from being used to commit alleged crimes. It is unusual for a private citizen to bring criminal charges against a corporation. Forrest said he had sought and received approval from Australia’s attorney general, Michaelia Cash, to launch the action under the commonwealth criminal code. The attorney general has been contacted for comment. Facebook said it couldn’t comment on Forrest’s case specifically because it was “a potentially active legal matter”. But the company said generally “we don’t want ads seeking to scam people out of money or mislead people on Facebook – they violate our policies and are not good for our community”. “We take a multifaceted approach to stop these ads, we work not just to detect and reject the ads themselves but also block advertisers from our services and, in some cases, take court action to enforce our policies,” a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. “We’re committed to keeping these people off our platform.” One difficulty for social media companies and publishers is that scammers often use technology to show different content to users and internal ad reviewers – a practice called “cloaking”. But Forrest said he wanted social media companies to use their resources and revenue to protect vulnerable people. “Social media is part of our lives, but it’s in the public interest for more to be done to ensure fraud on social media platforms is eliminated or significantly reduced,” the mining magnate said on Thursday. An initial court hearing in WA is scheduled for 28 March with a committal hearing expected later in 2022.
