4/4/2022,"The first Amazon union was always going to be a big fucking deal. But it’s hard to imagine how it could have been any sweeter than this one was. When it became official on Saturday morning that more than 8,000 workers in an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island had voted to unionize with the independent Amazon Labor Union, it meant that America’s most powerful non-union company has just been cracked open not by some deep-pocketed institutional force, but instead by a former employee, with no real experience or budget, who started organizing just because he saw that it needed to be done. Before we plumb the analytical depths of the import of this for the future of the American working class, we must just say, to Amazon founder and mega-billionaire Jeff Bezos, recently returned to earth from a short trip to space in a personal luxury rocket: Ha. Hahahaha. From the perspective of labor power, Amazon warehouse employees are the most important kind of workers in America. By this I mean that whatever wages and working conditions these workers are able to win at this company will have ripple effects that change the lives of an enormous number of other workers across this country. Amazon is not just building warehouses; it is in the process of changing the service sector-dominated economy that has characterized America since the 90s into an on-demand online shopping-based economy in which Amazon itself becomes a sort of utility of the retail industry, enabled by a coast-to-coast network of warehouses staffed by low-paid workers with little power over their own destinies. The last generation of low wage American jobs was shaped by Walmart, a place that unions never managed to organize. The result of that failure by the labor movement has been tens of millions of Americans trapped for several decades in retail jobs that do not pay enough to live on, while the Walton family, which owns Walmart, became some of the richest people in the world. That is what happens when workers at a terribly consequential company are not able to unionize, and allow the executive and investor classes to monopolize all of the company’s power. Amazon is now transforming the American workplace just like Walmart did, and a failure to organize there would lead to an even more dramatic erosion of the idea that hard work in this country should provide a livable wage and economic mobility. Happily, we can now say that Amazon is no longer a union-free company. Much of the credit for starting and carrying out the union drive at the Staten Island warehouse goes to Chris Smalls, a former Amazon worker who the company fired after he led a walkout over safety concerns. We should all feel free to bask in glee at the fact that leaked memos in April of 2020 showed Amazon’s general counsel saying that the company should “make [Smalls] the face of the entire union/organizing movement” because he was “not smart or articulate.” Now, Smalls and the dozens of volunteers who helped him and thousands of those who actually do the work at the warehouse have done what many highly-paid consultants assured Amazon was impossible. Imagine a pie smashing Jeff Bezos’s face, forever. Ha. Ha. The Amazon Labor Union was a remarkably grassroots, worker-led effort not affiliated with any existing union. Meanwhile, in Bessemer, Alabama, the Retail Workers union has spent two years and many millions of dollars working to organize an Amazon warehouse there with the assistance of countless professional union organizers. The vote at that warehouse was counted at the same time as Staten Island’s, and the result is still up in the air due to hundreds of challenged ballots. Much will be made of the differing approaches and differing results. But the real lesson from these campaigns is: try everything. Should big, existing unions organize Amazon workers? Yes. Should small, determined bands of Amazon workers launch organizing campaigns themselves? Yes. All of those people are part of the American labor movement–a movement that has only begun what will be a decades-long struggle to mold Amazon into a place where a warehouse job can sustain a middle class lifestyle. A century ago, auto workers and steel workers and coal miners all undertook a similar union struggle, and created the greatest age of collective national prosperity that the world has ever seen. What is happening at Amazon is our generation’s turn in that class war. In 2015, I was part of a (much smaller and less important, but also novel) successful union drive at a digital media company. Labor movement people asked us then, as they are going to ask these Amazon workers now: how did you do it? The honest answer then, as now, was: we tried. A union listened to us, and helped us, and we tried to organize, and when people understood what a union could do, they said yes. The most powerful thing unions in America have going for them is that they are indisputably good for working people. There is no one right way to unionize the 90% of our country’s workers who are not union members; the only thing to worry about is unionizing people more. Winston Churchill was an imperialist scumbag, but he knew how to give inspiring quotes. It is time for the labor movement to channel his insistence, “we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.” We shall organize the warehouses, we shall organize the Uber drivers, we shall organize the big box stores, we shall organize the fast food restaurants. We won’t stop. Never ever. We shall organize everyone. If the Amazon workers can do it, so can you.

4/4/2022,"“Ilike to leave room for play and growth,” said Meredith Monk recently, talking about how the music she composes never really reaches a definitive, finished state – and there was plenty of play in this, her first appearance in concert in the UK in almost a decade. Monk turns 80 this year and her bird-like, mischievous magnetism seems all the more subversive given that she is at least a generation older than those who share the stage with her. Monk is sometimes bracketed with her male contemporaries on the US minimalist scene, but would any of them end a concert with a solo encore that was a vocal and physical portrait of a mosquito? Presented as part of the Southbank’s SoundState festival, the main programme was a slightly reordered re-creation of Memory Game, the album Monk and the other three members of her Vocal Ensemble recorded in 2020 with Bang on a Can All-Stars. It presents nine numbers from throughout Monk’s career in arrangements that expand their instrumental aspects. The first five are a sequence from Monk’s 1983 sci-fi opera The Games, starting with the mesmeric looping clarinet lines of Spaceship and moving on to Memory Game, with Monk and the other three vocalists intoning, speaking and singing seemingly random words that together form an outline of a memory, ending with a high-soprano imitation of birdsong. Gamemaster’s Song was a sinister turn from Theo Bleckmann, his voice all long swoops and insistent persuasion against a constant, Pac-Man-like electric keyboard pulse. The other four included Waltz in 5s, sung by Katie Geissinger and accompanied by bowed psaltery, a kite-shaped instrument sounding like memories of a tin violin. Monk, Geissinger and Bleckmann had a lot of fun with Tokyo Cha Cha, which was as much about the choreography as the infectious rhythms. And Monk herself was the solo vocalist in Double Fiesta, which sounded as if she had chopped a tape of the Laughing Song from Die Fledermaus into a thousand pieces, thrown them into the air and reassembled them from where they landed: precise playfulness from a composer and performer taking herself just seriously enough.",Arts/Music,Meredith Monk with Bang on a Can All-Stars review – magnetic and precise playfulness,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/meredith-monk-bang-on-a-can-rfh-review-magnetic-and-precise-playfulness
4/4/2022,"The auditor general has identified “shortcomings” in compliance checks for the jobkeeper program, including in relation to one company deemed eligible and pocketing $360,000 despite more than doubling its revenue, but found the Australian Taxation Office was effective in its delivery of the jobkeeper program. The audit of the the $89bn wage subsidy program raised compliance issues including accepting companies’ assertions about how they calculated turnover and in 15 cases failing to obtain evidence the subsidies had been paid to employees. The $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy was created in April 2020 to support employees through Covid lockdowns, before it was restructured in September 2020 and phased out in March 2021. The ATO has said that 95% of companies claiming jobkeeper it had audited were eligible, but the program’s lax rules made it controversial.The jobkeeper program required businesses to estimate whether their turnover would decrease by 30-50%, depending on their size, but did not require companies to repay money if they ultimately outperformed expectations. Eligible businesses that ultimately increased turnover were paid $13.8bn and the ATO forgave $180m paid to ineligible businesses due to their “honest mistakes” in claiming the subsidy. The Australian National Audit Office report, released on Monday, found the ATO’s implementation of the program effective “except for shortcomings in implementation across parts of the … compliance program”. The report made no recommendations to the ATO or the Treasury department for improvements to their processes. But the ANAO noted the ATO failed to ask businesses claiming the payment which turnover test they had used to qualify. Although the ATO told businesses the projected decline in turnover “needed to be a reasonable assessment of what was likely at the point in time” an entity calculated it, the ANAO found it “generally” accepted assertions about how it was calculated “and did not seek to verify the responses provided”. The ANAO suggested it could have requested primary documents, such as emails or board papers. “This reduced the intended assurance that entities had completed their decline in turnover projection before they submitted their application.” In a sample of 30 companies the ATO believed were eligible for the program, the ANAO found one case of a company which projected a decline of 50% in revenue only to record a 152% increase. The company was categorised as “low consequences” because it had fewer than 25 employees. The ATO sent it a “nudge email” encouraging it to review its eligibility, but when no response was received it was allowed to keep jobkeeper – a “potential overpayment” of up to $360,000. The ANAO found that out of 49 compliance cases involving questions over whether the employer passed jobkeeper payments on to their employees, in 15 the case was closed “without evidence that the risk … had been addressed”. The ANAO said it was “unable to conclude” whether other compliance checks such as employee verification and residency status were completed as intended. It also concluded that “a more structured approach for documenting the reasons for exercising discretion on jobkeeper overpayments would have provided more transparency and accountability for the use of public funds”. The ATO recognised that finding but noted “the actual environment required rapid implementation while balancing the need to support the community in a time of great uncertainty”. The ATO said it was a “challenge” to deliver a “program of the scale and complexity of jobkeeper under exceptional circumstances and in very tight timeframes”.",News/Australia news,Auditor general finds jobkeeper scheme effective despite ‘shortcomings’ in compliance checks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/auditor-general-finds-jobkeeper-scheme-effective-despite-shortcomings-in-compliance-checks

4/4/2022,"Like many of their generation, my grandparents managed the chaos of life with tins. Biscuits, buttons, screws, tea, picture hooks, old keys, shoe polish, used stamps, crackers, cakes, shortbread, plasters, crayons: all had one. Even tins – liquorice, mints, balms – had a tin, some of which seemed as old as my grandparents themselves, and were hard to open. Others celebrated events, or were reminders of places visited. The best tins by far, however, were those full of sweets. One lived in the kitchen, the other in the glove compartment of Grandpa’s immaculate car. I can picture my grandma opening the kitchen sweet tin, which was blue with a raised white pattern and shaped like a postbox; she’d pull off the lid, then lower it to grandchild level. I remember the cold smell of Fox’s Glacier Mints (Grandma’s favourite, so always dominant) and how we would rummage past their blue-and-white wrappers in search of a humbug or barley sugar. The dimensions of a boiled sweet are perfect, as are a wrapper that can be twisted off and the thick sweetness of a barley sugar, the most wholesome of sweets. I kept that thought until recently, when I discovered that barley sugar sweets don’t contain any barley. They did when they were first made in the 1600s by a French mother superior, who mixed barley water with sugar when looking for a remedy (apparently). I wonder when the recipe changed. Florence White’s, in her 1932 book Good Things In England, uses lemon and almond oil. I am similarly deluded with the Italian drink orzata – orzo being the Italian for barley – which was made into a cloudy syrup that refreshed generations of over-heating bambini, but is now made with almonds. So, in light of the concerning news that I can no longer rely on getting my daily barley from sweets and syrup, I have been looking at alternatives. Barley, along with lentils, peas, bitter vetch, chickpeas, emmer wheat and einkorn, is one of the eight Neolithic founder crops domesticated in the Fertile Crescent more than 12,000 years ago. Like all grains, its consumption is often observed at four stages: raw; toasted, and soaked or boiled; milled; and mixed with flour to make dough. The boiling is where I am today, with another ancient one, lentils: together, they produce a fantastically robust but gentle soup that we recently ate at a great place not far from Rome’s Porta Pia called Fiaschetteria Marini. You need beautiful pearl barley here. It is wonderful the way barley transforms as it cooks, from hard pearls to plump buttons, their texture and flavour a combination of oats and wheat. And it has a milky almost-sweetness about it – no wonder it makes such wonderful sweets. Barley is enthusiastic, too, and continues to swell off the stove, so add extra water and salt for a swishing rather than a stiff consistency. And while, sadly, it won’t help world chaos, it might help keep the cupboard in order if you keep the leftover pearl barley in a tin. Prep 10 minCook 40 minServes 4 1 onion, peeled and finely diced1 stick celery, finely diced1 carrot, peeled and finely dicedSalt and black pepper5 tbsp olive oil1 small potato, peeled and finely diced2 bay leaves250g pearl barley250g small brown lentils In a soup pan with a heavy base, gently fry the onion, carrot, celery and a pinch of salt in the olive oil until soft and translucent. Add the potato and bay leaves and cook for a few minutes more. Now, if their cooking time is the same (about 30 minutes), add the lentils and barley , along with a litre and a half of water. If they have different cooking times, add one and the water, then add the other a bit later. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for half an hour, or until both lentils and barley are tender. You will probably need to add another 500ml water – keep an eye on this. Remove half the soup, blend until creamy, then return to the pan and add salt and black pepper to taste. Serve with a little olive oil on top, plus red chilli flakes or croutons, if you like.

4/4/2022,"If you’re a fan of Strictly Come Dancing’s Johannes Radebe, this first solo theatre outing is a must-see show. But even if you’ve never seen Strictly, it’s safe to say you will be a fan of Radebe’s by the end of the night. It’s rare to see a show this personal, as if you’re watching someone realising their dream right in front of you. South African Latin dance champion Radebe is a lovable personality and fierce performer who leaves it all on the floor. And from his arrival on stage, where the cast parts in two and Radebe majestically sweeps forward wearing ceremonial Zulu costume, it’s clear there’s a star in our midst. Freedom packs in everything meaningful to Radebe, from his township childhood, delving into South African dances kofifi and pantsula, to the clubs of Johannesburg, the snaking bodies of tango-like kizomba, mixing up Latin, club and various African styles, and then a whole Bob Fosse section. Not every dancer in the energetic young cast is expert in every style. They can dance it, but their bodies don’t have that deep inculcation. Radebe, however, inhabits it all, with plenty of his own fabulous flair thrown in. He’s a dancer of speed and sass, and his tall frame is precise in its articulation; he really commands the stage. Radebe also takes the mic and proves a charming MC, telling his story from post-apartheid Zamdela to 2020s London, thanking many of the people who helped get him here, and appealing for freedom for everyone to be able to be who they are, not just pointing out there are 70 countries in the world where homosexuality is still illegal, but then sweeping on stage in an outfit of gold shimmer with a flowing train made of flags from those countries. The politics is heartfelt, the delivery inspired. The second half of the show relives some of Radebe’s favourite Strictly moments and then heads off into rousing and carnivalesque party territory. It’s frequently OTT – they must have bought up the city’s entire sequin stock – but performed with complete conviction, and there is simply unbridled joy in witnessing someone living their best life.

4/4/2022,"Stella, 10, attends a private school in Atlanta, Georgia, and explains to friends that she has four moms. Two of them are the lesbian couple that adopted her. The other two are her birth parents, one of whom recently came out as a transgender woman. “I’m so grateful that [Stella] is somewhere that sees” the family “as what it is: her moms just love her”, said Kelsey Hanley, Stella’s birth mother, who lives in Kissimmee, Florida. But Hanley, 30, worries that children who have multiple moms or dads or are LGBTQ+ themselves won’t get the same acceptance in Florida. That’s because the state recently approved legislation that bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through third grade and prohibits such lessons for older students unless they are “age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate”. Hanley and some pediatric psychologists say the law stigmatizes being gay or transgender and could harm the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth, who are already more likely to face bullying and attempt suicide than children who are cisgender and straight. “We all have processes around clarifying who we know in our heads and hearts we are and who we are drawn to or attracted to,” said Laura Anderson, a child and family psychologist in Hawaii whose focus is LGBTQ+ youth and their families. “To make an increasingly large percentage of the population’s experience invisible and taboo is just so harmful and unsafe for all kids.” The Parental Rights in Education legislation, which opponents labeled the “don’t say gay” bill, is part of a flurry of measures introduced by Republican lawmakers around the country. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, reports that lawmakers have introduced 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills this year. The wave not only includes laws similar to Florida restricting instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation but also ones that criminalize gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. Child psychologists say that such laws create an unsafe environment for LGBTQ+ children. Two-thirds of LGBTQ+ youth said debates concerning the state laws have had a negative impact on their mental health, according to a poll from the Trevor Project, an intervention and suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ+ youth. And transgender people, in particular, already often face greater psychological distress than the US general population. The National Center for Transgender Equality’s 2015 US Transgender Survey found that 40% of transgender respondents had attempted suicide, which is nine times the rate of the general population. “We have governors – that have no education or basis or expertise in child mental health – that impose such laws that are going to have horrendous impacts on kids,” said Natasha Poulopoulos, a pediatric psychologist in Miami. Supporters of the Florida law claim it’s necessary because children are being exposed to “radical concepts regarding sexual orientation and gender identity”. “What’s even more concerning about this is that parents are not just not being included but are being treated as the enemy here,” said Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, which supported the legislation in Florida and similar bills in other states. “This legislation is not only good, it’s necessary to protect children and their innocence.” But groups such as the Florida Education Association, the state’s teachers union, say that elementary school teachers do not teach curriculum regarding sexuality and that Republicans are just using it as a cynical political wedge issue. Rather than protect children, the Florida law stigmatizes gender exploration, which is a normal part of child development, Poulopoulos said. “It’s healthy and normal for kids to go out of specific gender roles that have been extremely outdated. Even if a child was assigned female at birth and identifies as female, it’s OK for a child to explore things that may be considered more gender stereotypical for boys,” said Poulopoulos. The legislation puts negative rhetoric “around aspects of gender identity and sexual orientation that are not heteronormative, so for example, if you are not cisgender and heterosexual, you are to be shamed”, said Poulopoulos. To prevent that shame, child psychologists say that it’s important for children to see themselves and their families represented in stories. For elementary school students, this could mean “using very simple language like: families can look diverse. Some families only have one parent. Some families have a grandparent and a mom. Some have two moms. Some have a mom and a dad,” said Poulopoulos. “That simple language is by no means sexualizing children. It is simply explaining the concepts of family structure, of sexual orientation and gender identity in a very developmentally appropriate way.” A 2019 report from GLSEN, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, found that two-thirds of LGBTQ+ youth respondents had not been exposed to representations of LGBTQ+ people, history or events in lessons at school. At schools that did have an LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum, 59% of respondents said they often or frequently heard the word “gay” used in a negative way, compared with almost 80% of students at schools that did not have inclusive curriculum. “If you are a family or a child that is figuring this stuff out about your identity and don’t see yourself anywhere, in curriculum, in stories,” that absence means they must “undo the harm of their child having felt othered for ever”, said Anderson, the psychologist in Hawaii. Two LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations shared the child psychologists’ concern and filed a lawsuit last week challenging the Florida law, describing it as an “unlawful attempt to stigmatize, silence and erase LGBTQ people in Florida’s public schools”. A spokeswoman for DeSantis said of the lawsuit: “This calculated, politically motivated, virtue-signaling lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend the legality of parents to protect their young children from sexual content in Florida public schools.” But Hanley, the Florida mom, said the law tries to shield students from something they are going to encounter anyways. Hanley, who works in customer service, said she was attracted to women before she was attracted to men and realized she was bisexual in middle school. “They are going to go grocery shopping, and they are going to see two women holding hands. They are going to see two men holding hands, and if that’s something that can’t be discussed in school, they are going to feel like they can’t talk about it at home,” said Hanley. ”And if their parents think it’s not appropriate to talk about, then their response is going to be: ‘If I have to hide this part of myself, do I have to hide that I’m on substances? Do I have to hide that I have a crush on somebody?’ They are not going to have any kind of openness.” Hanley also worries about what rhetoric from advocates for the Florida law – about the need to “protect our children” – will mean for children like Stella. “Stella would think that people want to protect children from her,” said Hanley. “And she would think: what do you need to protect yourself from?”",News/US news,How Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ law could harm children’s mental health,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/florida-dont-say-gay-bill-children-mental-health
4/4/2022,"The Morrison government says it will “rip up and redraw” Brisbane’s flight paths in an election-eve promise which could impact four marginal seats, three of which are held by the Liberal National party. Brisbane’s federal member, Trevor Evans, made the announcement on Monday alongside his counterpart in the seat of Ryan and the LNP’s candidate for the Labor-held seat of Griffith. It came after the release of an interim report by global air traffic consultants Trax International on Friday. That report made 49 recommendations to address the issues that arose after Brisbane airport’s second runway was built in mid-2020, including scratching the flight paths and starting again, with noise abatement as a priority. Anger has been bubbling away in affected areas of inner-city Brisbane since the flight path changes, finding organised expression in the Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance (BFPCA). A BFPCA spokesperson said people in some areas of Dickson, held by the defence minister, Peter Dutton, were also affected by the flight path changes. “People out in Samford Valley [in Dickson] are very active in the flight path alliance, people in Upper Brookfield and Pullenvale, who are in the Ryan electorate, are very active and then you’ve got all of the inner-city suburbs who have been impacted,” the spokesperson said. “Obviously coming out now, on the eve of the election being announced, [the LNP] are feeling the community pressure around this issue. “So this is definitely a response to community backlash.” The BFPCA member said that the report outlined solutions that could solve noise pollution, but would require long-term commitment from government. “We’ve certainly seen empty promises before,” the spokesperson said. “But we’re cautiously optimistic the genie is out of the bottle now.” Last month, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, introduced a private member’s bill to parliament for a Brisbane Airport curfew and hourly flight cap. “Unsustainable flight noise has had a devastating impact on the people of Brisbane,” Bandt said at the time.

4/4/2022,"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes and a “massacre” in Bucha, a town 18 miles north-west of the capital, Kyiv, after the bodies of unarmed Ukrainian civilians and mass graves were found on Sunday. Bodies of civilians – many with bound hands, close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture – were found on the streets after Ukrainian troops reclaimed the town. Ukrainian prosecutors said they had found 410 bodies in towns near Kyiv, and 140 bodies had been examined on Sunday. Russia denied allegations that its forces killed civilians as it retreated from war-torn areas of the country. Satellite images from Bucha appear to show an approximately 45ft-long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave has been identified. World leaders condemned the killings and called for independent investigations. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, all publicly condemned Russia’s actions. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described the killings as “a punch to the gut” and joined western allies in vowing to document the atrocities to hold the perpetrators to account. Russia described the situation in Bucha as a “provocation” by Ukraine intended to disrupt peace talks. The Kremlin’s foreign ministry said Russia was seeking a UN security council meeting on the matter. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s UN security council deputy representative, tweeted on Sunday: “In the light of heinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha Russia requested a meeting of UN security council on Monday April 4.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned Russian forces as “murderers”, “torturers” and “rapists” after the killings came to light, describing the Kremlin-ordered attack on his country as amounting to genocide. “How did they also become butchers? … They killed deliberately and with pleasure,” he said in a national address late on Sunday. He vowed to investigate and prosecute all Russian “crimes” in Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, said Bucha was a “deliberate massacre” while speaking on Times Radio on Sunday. Describing Russia as “worse than Isis”, he said Russian forces were guilty of murder, torture, rape and looting. He also urged G7 countries to impose “devastating” sanctions immediately. Zelenskiy criticised the west’s “policy of concessions to Russia” in the lead-up to the war. Describing Ukraine’s past pursuit of Nato membership, he said: “They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us … I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women.” Russian forces continued their attacks on other Ukrainian cities. Seven people died and 34 were wounded after a residential area in Kharkiv was struck on Sunday, local prosecutors said. At least 70% of Chernihiv has been destroyed by Russian forces, the city’s mayor said on Sunday. Vladyslav Atroshenko said the “consequences” of the attacks were severe and mirrored those of other badly damaged cities in Ukraine such as Bucha and Mariupol. Russian forces are continuing to “consolidate and reorganise” their offensive in Donbas, while the capture of Mariupol is a “key objective” of the Russian invasion, UK’s Ministry of Defence said. The Ukrainian military claims Russia has launched a “hidden mobilisation” of about 60,000 soldiers to replenish units lost in Ukraine, according to its latest operational report. Russian missiles struck “critical infrastructure”, most likely a fuel depot, near Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa in the early hours of Sunday but there were no casualties, officials in the city said. The European Union should consider a ban on gas imports from Russia, Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has said. The huge scale of sexual violence endured by women and girls in Ukraine has begun to emerge as victims recount the abuse they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers. The United Nations’ human rights office says there have been 3,455 civilian casualties since the war in Ukraine began. The figure includes more than 1,400 deaths and over 2,000 injured people, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher, the agency said in recently published report. Zelenskiy appeared in a video message at the Grammy awards, calling for viewers to “fill the silence with your music” and “tell the truth about the war” across social networks and on TV.",News/World news,"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 40, including the Bucha killings",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-40-including-the-bucha-killings
