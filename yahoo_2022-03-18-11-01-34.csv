3/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Jho Low was a big man in Vegas. He sported gold lame suits, traveled with an entourage and lost tens of millions of dollars, a New York jury was told.

All told, Low wagered almost $87 million at the Venetian and lost about $26 million, Godby estimated. “He was extremely extravagant,” Godby said. “He had requests that were parallel to none. He made requests like he wanted disco balls, dance floors and DJs.” Godby was testifying in the bribery trial of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Roger Ng over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scam. Ng is accused of conspiring with Low and Ng’s former boss Tim Leissner to help the financier steal billions of dollars from three bond deals Goldman underwrote for the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. wealth fund. Low is now a fugitive. Prosecutors may have called Godby to refute Ng’s October 2009 claims to Goldman superiors that he had met Low only once before, when he recommended the financier as a private wealth client to the bank. Low was known as a “premium” guest at the Venetian who spent more than $50,000 there, Godby said. Godby, who said he’d been a marketing executive at the Venetian for more than 20 years, explained to jurors it’s his job to “get people in the casino, get them in the door.” Casinos track visitors’ wagers through their loyalty cards, and provide complimentary services in part on how much people wager and spend. “We have the whole enchilada if you will,” Godby said. “Rooms, food, beverages, spas, and shows, cash back.” Ng gambled with Low during the former banker’s sole visit to the Venetian in late November 2010, Godby told the jury. Ng lost $22,500 playing baccarat during his visit, which took place before the first 1MDB bond deal closed in May 2012. Low played at the same table as Ng on the morning of Nov. 29 at around 5 a.m. and placed $4 million in bets, Godby testified. The Venetian wasn’t the only Las Vegas casino Low frequented though. To celebrate his 28th birthday, Low had a bash at Caesars Palace, with Leonardo DiCaprio being flown in on a private jet and receiving $150,000 to attend the party and a dinner, the jury was told earlier in the trial. The trial resumes Monday with prosecutors saying they expect to conclude their case as early as March 23. U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie told jurors they could get the case as early as March. 29. The case is U.S. v. Low Taek Jho, 18-cr-538, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). (Updates with more testimony beginning in seventh paragraph.)

3/18/2022,"Alibaba (BABA)'s ADRs could rip higher after a massive relief rally spurred by an ease of regulatory risks, which one equity manager called ""a sea change."" ""I think you're going to see China stocks rip for the next 8 or 12 months into the China National Congress [elections],"" Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you look at some of them in particular, we're focused on Alibaba, I think the returns are going to be spectacular.' On Wednesday, e-commerce giant Alibaba and its peers soared more than 30% after China's top financial body said it would ensure stability in capital markets and support stock listings overseas. ""The only two things holding these companies back were ... the tech crackdown over the summer, in earnest, and then the delisting risk,"" said Hayes. ""The businesses were growing despite the regulatory crackdowns, despite the zero-COVID shutdowns."" China's National Congress elections are coming up this fall, a reason why Hayes believes Chinese stocks will go higher from here. ""Both in China and the United States, the number one job of a politician is to get reelected. They figured that out, they want the transition to go smoothly. They're juicing the economy,"" said Hayes. Alibaba's American depository shares had been pounded prior to Wednesday's rally. They touched a multi-year intraday low of $73.28 earlier this week. China's recent lockdowns, regulatory risks, and U.S. disclosure requirements, which pose a threat to the delisting of Chinese firms, have all contributed to investors' recent flee from Alibaba and its peers. ""We did get forced selling and a final capitulation yesterday [Tuesday] on those delisting fears over the last couple of days, but both of those fears were largely taken off the table last night, when they decided to actively introduce policies to benefit the markets,"" said Hayes. On Thursday ADRs of Alibaba, JD.com (JD), Pinduoduo (PDD), and Baidu (BIDU) were all trading lower as investors took profits off the table.

3/18/2022,"By Oliver Hirt and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's secretive banks hold up to $213 billion of Russian wealth, the country's financial industry association estimates, as sanctions on Russia give a rare glimpse inside Swiss vaults. The Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) estimated that the banks hold between 150 billion and 200 billion Swiss francs ($213 billion) of Russian client money in offshore accounts. This indicates that the extent of wealthy Russians' business with banks in Switzerland, the world's biggest centre for offshore wealth, is far more extensive than the on-balance sheet exposures several of its financial firms have begun to detail. The SBA's revelation is rare for Switzerland, which has stone-walled many previous transparency requests, and comes as it took the unusual step of applying European Union sanctions to Russian cash following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last month. There is growing Swiss public debate about its role, with Mattea Meyer, co-president of the Social Democrats, calling for Switzerland to clamp down on any cash belonging to Russians close to President Vladimir Putin and his government. ""Part belongs to oligarchs loyal to the Kremlin. The money and their activity ... helps finance the war,"" she said, adding that Switzerland ""must do everything possible to turn off the money taps"". The SBA estimate, which dwarfs initial indications of the credit exposure to Russia, makes clear the scale of the task of imposing sanctions, such as by freezing the cash. The Swiss economy ministry said that it had no meaningful estimates on frozen Russian assets as it tallies reports from banks facing a growing Swiss sanctions list. Despite its Russian tally estimate, the SBA stressed that this was small compared to overall assets held in Switzerland, which has been regarded by generations of wealthy individuals from around the world as a safe haven for their money. ""The share of assets held for Russian clients likely accounts for a share in the low single-digit percentage range of the total cross-border assets deposited with Swiss banks,"" it said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday, referring to money held for clients residing abroad. RUSSIAN RISK As Western governments unleash a growing list of sanctions in response to Russia's invasion, banks are seeing their business with Russian clients scrutinized far beyond the loans they have granted or business done out of Russian subsidiaries that could lead to balance sheet losses. Analysts have said direct Swiss bank exposures to Russian clients look manageable, based on what has been made public. Switzerland's two biggest banks last week detailed ""limited"" exposures to Russia, with the largest UBS saying a $634 million direct exposure had been cut since year-end. Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein on Tuesday said some 4% of the assets Switzerland's second-biggest bank manages for wealthy clients belong to Russians, amounting to tens of billions of dollars. That is far greater than the 848 million Swiss franc net credit exposure in Credit Suisse's annual report. While the bank has not provided an updated tally, it managed 827 billion francs in its wealth management businesses at end-2021, so 4% would amount to some 33 billion Swiss francs in assets associated with Russian customers. UBS and Switzerland's third-largest listed lender, Julius Baer, have declined to detail assets they hold for Russian customers, but UBS CEO Ralph Hamers indicated sanctions were keeping the country's biggest bank busy. ""New lists come out every night,"" he said, adding that UBS was looking to shield not only against current compliance but also against the risk of future penalties.

3/18/2022,"Intel (INTC) used to be the dominant CPU force by a long distance but that is no longer the case. Under Lisa Su’s astute leadership, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has made huge strides over the past several years; by offering superior products and taking advantage of manufacturing issues and product shortages at Intel, the company has considerably closed the gap between the two chip giants. Intel, however, has put a new CEO in charge and has been hatching a comeback plan. The company even made the case in its recent analyst day that they believe the production of TSMC’s 3nm chip is a year late (TSMC has a close working relationship with AMD), which could mean that when Intel launches Granite Rapids on I3 in 2024, AMD will still be on the N5 TSMC node. “If that’s the case,” says Raymond James’ Chris Caso, “then it would suggest that INTC would have process superiority in 2024, not in 2025, as Intel has previously targeted.” This will also give Intel some “wiggle room” if required. But is that really the case? AMD, for their part, have stated they have not encountered any of the delays INTC has noted, and that their roadmap is “consistent with TSMC’s roadmap.” For the record, TSMC has said that by 4Q22, the N3 will be in “volume production,” and by 1Q23 should start generating revenue. So, what’s Caso’s take on the matter? “Our view is that if Intel executes flawlessly against their process roadmap (which is far from assured) Intel does have the potential to get close to TSMC/AMD’s transistor performance by 2024/25,” the 5-star analyst said. “But even if that were to happen, we still don’t think Intel would be able to maintain their currently dominant market share in client and server.” What Caso expects will happen over time, is a market which will “move toward a sustained duopoly.” The analyst believes that even flawless execution on Intel’s part is unlikely to stop AMD’s continued market share gains. To this end, Caso’s rating for AMD stays an Outperform (i.e. Buy) backed by a $160 price target. The implication for investors? Upside potential of 40%. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here) The Street’s average target comes in just under Caso’s objective; at $154.24, the figure suggests one-year gains of ~35%. Overall, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy, based on 15 Buys vs. 6 Holds.

3/18/2022,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Thursday, March 17, 2022 The Federal Reserve finally took the plunge and raised rates. As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell led the Federal Open Market Committee to raise its benchmark interest rate target by 25 basis points. The Fed famously operates according to two mandates (actually it has three by law): price stability and maximum employment. How the Fed achieves these goals is up to Powell & Co. but if past is prologue, there could be trouble brewing as the Fed amps up its hawkishness. In the modern era, the Fed has developed a bewildering array of tools: interest-rate targeting, forward guidance, interest on excess reserves, repo facilities, quantitative easing, and quantitative tightening, to name a few. Not to mention any number of emergency facilities to be conjured up and deployed with the Treasury in troubled times. This wasn’t always the case. When inflation was skyrocketing just over four decades ago, Paul Volcker was elected Fed chairman in 1979 with a mandate to crush high prices. The consumer price index (CPI) reached a high of 14.8% in 1980, before his inflation-fighting efforts took effect. Prior to Volcker, the Fed targeted short-term interest rates to manipulate the money supply to juice or put the brakes on the economy. Without wading too far in the weeds, the Volcker-era Fed targeted the actual money supply. This and other changes persisted mostly into the end of the 1980s — even after Alan Greenspan became chair in 1987. But Greenspan pivoted and developed his own style in the 1990s, returning to interest rate targeting and instituting ""insurance"" cuts to get ahead of various crises — including the 1998 bailout of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In fact, the Fed had raised rates a year before the beleaguered LTCM became a systemic risk. This made the 1997 single-rate hike the shortest rate-hiking cycle — if you can even call it a cycle — in the modern era. Its short duration is probably why the 38.5% stock market rally over the following year was by far the best among four other tightening cycles (see chart below). The other post-rate hike periods averaged gains of 5.9%, with the year following the 1994 increase barely eking out a 0.1% return. The bias toward easing earned Greenspan the nickname ""Easy Al."" After Greenspan popped the late 1990s tech bubble, he would eventually lower rates to 1% in 2003 and keep them there for a year. All this set the stage for the Fed to help fuel a housing bubble — this time concomitant with a huge run-up in commodities prices. WTI crude oil (CL=F) rallied relentlessly, topping out at $150 per barrel. (Sound familiar?) Ben Bernanke picked up where Greenspan left off, leading the Fed to raise rates a quarter percent 17 times at consecutive Fed meetings. In late 2007, as central banks around the world worked to reduce leverage in the bloated financial sector, cracks in the financial system turned into gaping holes. Bear Stearns nearly folded in March 2008 and was sold to JPMorgan for a song. At the time, many thought the worst was over. In the spring and summer of 2008, the Fed began winding down its balance sheet from all the emergency lending programs it had instituted — selling and letting roll off $300 billion in Treasury bills. Markets even started pricing in about 140 basis points worth of rate hikes into the end of 2008. (Sound familiar?) The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 put those hawkish notions to rest — perhaps an important lesson to remember, as the Fed is now forecasting six more rate hikes this year. Powell even said Wednesday at the presser that balance sheet runoff (quantitative tightening) could come as early as the next Fed meeting in May. ""Do we see balance sheet roll-off? And how aggressive is the Fed going to be with this? ... we're used to the central banks coming in and suppressing volatility, but that's not going to be the case for the foreseeable future,"" said John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, on Yahoo Finance Live, expressing concern that the Fed may not be paying attention to the recent volatility in stocks and bonds. ""We need to buckle up and understand that enhanced volatility in risk assets and interest rates are going to be here as we're unwinding unprecedented monetary stimulus [amid] a number of exogenous factors like ongoing war and rampant inflation.""

3/18/2022,"Let’s talk about artificial intelligence. AI is a growing segment of the tech sector, finding uses in almost every industry, especially those featuring autonomous systems. Self-driving cars, industrial robots, call center chatbots, even the smartphones in our pockets – all of them have some connection with AI and machine learning tech. It has already changed the face of the digital world, and its revolution is far from over. A tech with such a profound and wide-ranging impact will also make itself felt in the stock markets – that much is certain. Companies will move in, to make use of AI or to produce AI, or both, and their actions will open up plenty of opportunities for investors. AI isn’t just an important new tech, it’s also a driver for new investment capital and returns. Top analysts from investment firm Truist have found a couple of AI stocks that they believe are primed for further growth. According the TipRanks data, these are Strong Buys, with over 40% upside potential for the months ahead. Let's take a closer look. Five9 (FIVN) We’ll start with Five9, a tech company offering AI software on the cloud, tailored for use in the contact center niche. Five9 offers a series of AI-powered cloud software solutions for call centers in a wide range of industries, including telemarketing, financial services, customer service, healthcare, retail, and outsourcing. The company’s AI products include intelligent virtual agents, workflow automation, and interactive voice response, and reporting and analytics. Five9 boasts over 2,000 global enterprise customers, and more than 7 billion interactions annually. In the last reported quarter, for 4Q21, Five9 reported $173.6 million at the top line, up 36% year-over-year to a company record. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS rose from 34 cents one year ago to the currently reported 42 cents, for a gain of 23%. Looking at the full year, Five9 had over $609 million in total revenues for 2021, again a company record, compared to the $434 reported in 2020. However, for 1Q22, the company said it expects to report non-GAAP profit of 12 cents to 14 cents a share, well below Wall Street consensus forecast of 21 cents. Despite the earnings miss for this quarter, Truist’s 5-star analyst Terry Tillman believes the overall upward trajectory bodes well for the company. He writes, ""[Five9] commented that 2022 is poised for even greater international headcount. On the product side, the company noted that usage of IVAs among FIVN customers has tripled y/y, with IVA accounting for 10% of enterprise bookings in new logos in 2021. We believe the company is set to continue benefiting from its position in AI and its overall automation story along with IVA, Agent Assist, and the Workflow Automation capabilities.” These comments back up Tillman’s Buy rating, and his $150 price target suggests that Five9 has potential gains of ~61% ahead of it. (To watch Tillman’s track record, click here) Overall, Five9’s Strong Buy rating reflects a bullish consensus. The 18 recent analyst reviews include 16 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell; the shares are priced at $93.26 and the $150.59 average price target is practically the same as Tillman’s. (See FIVN stock forecast on TipRanks) Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) The second Truist recommendation we’ll look at is Nvidia. This semiconductor giant has built a solid reputation for the quality of graphics processors and memory chips that have been in high demand among both dedicated gamers and professional designers. More to the point, for this article, this top-ten chip maker’s products have found a niche in the AI industry, and the GPUs have the necessary computing capacity to power artificial intelligence tech. That, however, is not the limit of Nvidia’s exposure to AI. The company uses the tech, too, in its own chip design and production lines. It’s a case of AI being used to build better AI – literally, on the hardware end. Nvidia has shown 7 straight quarters to top line revenue growth, with the $7.64 billion reported in 4Q22 being up 53% year-over-year, and a company quarterly record. Fiscal year 2022 revenues were up 61% to $26.91 billion, also a company record. Earnings gains were also extreme, and the $1.32 non-GAAP EPS reported in Q4 was up 69% y/y, and 13% sequentially. The quarterly EPS was also 7% better than the forecast. In his coverage for Truist, 5-star analyst William Stein described Nvidia as ‘*the* AI company,’ and attributes that 'partly to its high-performance GPUs that provide the necessary parallel compute capability.’ He goes on, however, to note “NVDA's culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and significant investment in AI software tools and models. This creates a moat that challenges new entrants and supports NVDA's structural growth. Its investments in other aspects of parallel compute (especially graphics) solidify its position in gaming / e-sports and professional visualization. These make NVDA a unique asset in semis: a large-cap company with structural growth characteristics, justifying a premium multiple.” Stein’s Buy rating on NVDA stock is in line with his commentary, and his $350 price target implies a one-year upside of ~43%. (To watch Stein’s track record, click here) Stein’s objective is virtually in-line with the Street’s average target, which currently stands at $352.65. This top stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 recent reviews, that include 17 Buys against 4 Holds.

3/18/2022,"Ford’s Advanced Manufacturing Center has developed an interface that allows machines from different suppliers to speak to each other in the same language and operate parts of the production line autonomously. Automakers have been incorporating robotics into their manufacturing processes for decades to reduce costs and boost efficiency. But Ford’s patent-pending system solves a crucial bottleneck in the production line by using robots to operate the 3D printers through the night without human interaction. The autonomous system marks the first time the Carbon 3D printers and the KUKA-built robots can talk to each other in the same language, opening limitless possibilities for other machines involved throughout the production process to collaborate. So far, the venture has helped produce low-volume, custom car parts such as the brake line bracket for Mustang Shelby GT500 sports cars equipped with the Performance Package. “This new process has the ability to change the way we use robotics in our manufacturing facilities,” Jason Ryska, director, global manufacturing technology development, said in a statement. Javier, the name given to the wheeled robot from supplier KUKA, can run the 3D printer continuously without human interference, even once employees have gone home for the night. Ford says the robots are constantly learning from the printer data to help the automaker achieve more accuracy and reduce margins of error. “At Ford’s Advanced Manufacturing Center, Javier is tasked with operating the 3D printers completely on his own,” Ford said in a statement. “He is always on time, very precise in his movements, and he works most of the day – taking only a short break to charge up.” Usually, equipment from different suppliers are unable to interact because they use separate communication interfaces. Ford’s system allows equipment from different suppliers to talk to each other, sending commands and feedback in real time. Once the Carbon 3D tells Javier that the printed car component is ready, Javier retrieves it and puts it aside for a human operator to collect later. Ford has filed several patents for the technology underpinning its communication interfaces and the precise positioning of robots. Though the process is autonomous, human operators must upload the 3D designs to the printer and maintain the machinery.",Technology/TechCrunch•2 days ago,Ford is now using robots to operate 3D printers without human help,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-now-using-robots-operate-100007168.html
3/18/2022,"Can you pay taxes with a credit card? Yes — and with the right strategy, it can be a particularly lucrative decision for points and miles enthusiasts. Paying a giant tax bill likely doesn’t incite warm, fuzzy feelings. But if you make the most of it, you at least might be able to cozy up in a fuzzy robe at a five-star hotel or under a blanket in your lie-flat, first-class airplane seat. That’s because paying taxes with a credit card can sometimes help you rack up mega points and miles. Be aware that using a credit card to pay taxes isn’t for everyone, and it does entail fees that can sometimes exceed credit card rewards. But with the right strategy, your tax bill can net you a slew of credit card points and miles. The many ways to pay your taxes to the Internal Revenue Service include check, an ACH debit, wire transfer, cash payments, installment payments and yes, even credit cards. To make an IRS payment with a credit card, you’ll have to use one of the IRS’ three independent payment processors, which then sends your money to the IRS. But these payment processors charge fees, which start at either $2.20 or 1.87% of your overall bill, whichever is higher. Here are the processors and their fees for 2022: If you file and pay through a tax software such as TurboTax, you might owe even higher fees. For example, TurboTax charges a 2.49% credit card convenience fee if you pay income tax via credit card through its website. You can file through TurboTax and pay taxes separately through one of the above payment processors (but still expect to be charged a convenience fee by the payment processor). Given the fees, some experts suggest avoiding paying taxes with a credit card entirely. And if your card nets you less than 1.87% back in rewards, then certainly stop reading now, as you’ll owe more in processing fees than the value of your rewards. But if you’re willing to embrace your inner nerd, then read on, as you can turn your tax bill into an opportunity to accrue major miles and points. You can rack up rewards by paying your taxes on a credit card in several ways. Many rewards credit cards earn a fixed amount of points or cash back per dollar spent. As long as your card earns more than the 1.87%-1.96% fee, this can be a small rewards-generating venture. For instance, a small handful of cash-back cards offer 2% back (and some offer even more), netting you 0.13% or more in earned rewards. Many rewards credit cards offer introductory offers, where you can quickly amass a giant stash of points for hitting a certain minimum spending threshold within a relatively short period of time. Often, the biggest point bonuses are tied to bigger spending requirements. You might find a card offering 100,000 points, but it’ll also require you to spend $10,000 within a few months. That might not be realistic for your normal spending, but could be attainable in the month you’re paying taxes. Here are this month’s best credit card sign-up bonuses. And if it’s travel rewards you’re specifically seeking, here are the best travel credit card welcome bonus offers right now. Earning 2% cash back when you’re paying a 1.87% credit card processing fee isn’t exactly going to make you rich. But here’s a potentially highly lucrative way to earn rewards: Use this chunk of spending as a way to net other rewards. For example, many hotel cards offer free night certificates if you spend a hefty sum on them. Some Hilton cards offer free night certificates that can be redeemed for hotel night stays worth over $1,000, but they require you to charge thousands of dollars in a calendar year to the card. Say you owe $15,000 in taxes and would owe $280.50 in Pay1040 fees. But if you charge it to the right Hilton credit card, you could walk away with a free night certificate and redeem it for a room at Hawaii’s opulent Grand Wailea Resort, which otherwise typically costs between $1,200 and $2,000 per night. Meanwhile, many airline credit cards allow you to spend your way to elite status. For example, JetBlue’s credit card offers automatic JetBlue Mosaic status (which NerdWallet estimates has nearly $2,000 in value if you frequently fly JetBlue) if you spend $50,000 in a calendar year. That’s an unrealistic amount for most household budgets, but might be feasible if you have a large tax bill this year. Say you charge $20,000 in taxes to the card and spend around $2,500 monthly on the card for a year. Your tax bill would incur close to $400 in processing fees, but the payoff to earn elite status benefits could be worth five times that. Certain tax preparation software companies run promotions to earn bonus points if you use them. If yours does, don’t forget to connect your accounts to take advantage. For example, you can earn 1,000 American Airlines AAdvantage bonus miles when you purchase Basic or Deluxe H&R Block tax software before April 30. While that’s only worth about $12 by NerdWallet estimates, it can be an easy way to net more miles for a purchase you’re likely making anyway. If you opt to pay taxes with credit cards, there are a few other things you should know: Understand your credit limit: You might have a $10,000 tax bill to charge to a credit card, but take caution if you only have a $5,000 credit limit. Exceeding that limit can sometimes incur additional penalties or create a negative impact on your credit scores. You can use multiple credit cards: Paying taxes across multiple credit cards can be handy in avoiding that exact situation of exceeding your credit limit. Charging two different cards can also help you capitalize on two separate sign-up bonuses. If you’re paying money owed on a Form 1040, you can use two different payment types per tax year (or two per month if you have an installment agreement). Avoid paying interest: In general, it’s not a good idea to make charges on a rewards credit card that you cannot pay off in full purely for the sake of earning rewards. The amount you’ll owe in interest is typically more than the value of the rewards. If you can’t afford to pay your tax bill in full, you’re likely better off applying for a payment plan with the IRS. If you’ve got a bunch of money to spend in one go (like taxes), you might be able to jump on a sign-up bonus or qualify for a hotel free night certificate that typically requires hefty spending. Just understand the cost in fees before you pay taxes with your credit card.

3/18/2022,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will increase tariffs on stainless steel products from India and Indonesia after determining they benefited from unfair subsidies, including some from China under its Belt and Road investment programme. The European Commission, which conducted the investigation, has set the anti-subsidy duties on stainless steel cold-rolled flat products at rates of between 4.3% and 21.4%, the EU official journal said on Wednesday. They will add to anti-dumping tariffs already in place. Indonesia's IRNC faces a new tariff of 21.4%, bringing the overall rate, including anti-dumping duties, to 30.7%. The new rates for India's Jindal Stainless Ltd and Jindal Stainless Hisar Ltd are 4.3%, taking the total tariff to 14.3%. The Commission said the subsidies took the form of preferential loans, duty exemptions and cheap provision of raw materials, partly because of export restrictions for those materials. Indonesia also benefited from subsidies to help build up its stainless steel industry from China, which in return benefited from taking up a larger share of Indonesia's nickel ore exports. This is the European Union's second investigation into trans-national Chinese subsidies. In 2020, the bloc imposed duties on glass fibre fabrics and products from Chinese companies or joint venture operations in Egypt. The Commission said that the new tariffs, to take effect from Thursday, aim to remedy damage caused to EU producers such as Acerinox and Outokumpu. ""Today we are taking action to counter unfair state-sponsored subsidies in India and Indonesia that directly hurt our workers and companies in this vital industrial sector,"" EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said. Indonesia said the findings of the EU's investigation did not take into account arguments and evidence its government had presented during the investigation. That had ""clearly proved that there is no subsidy from the Indonesian government to the Indonesian stainless steel industry,"" said Natan Kambuno, a director at the Trade Ministry. He said the government would coordinate with the affected company regarding the duties.

A day later, ARKK jumped 10.4%, its steepest surge since last March. Wood has received both ire and praise for her dogged style of handpicking long-term growth companies with visionary stories. Believers in her approach have steadily added money to ARKK, with the ETF on track for the sixth straight week of inflows. This is despite the fund losing roughly 35% so far this year. Many are using the decline as an opportunity to buy the fund, analysts said. “ARKK is just a monster of an ETF nowadays,” said James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are trading it as if it were a non-profitable tech basket.” Meanwhile, the Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (SARK), which is structured to deliver the inverse of ARK Innovation’s performance each day, posted a 10% decline on Wednesday, its largest drop since its inception at the end of last year. BI’s Seyffart says SARK has added to its competitor’s ecosystem, which in addition to the inverse fund also includes options on ARKK. The sustained inflow of money into ARKK is also likely because some investors are trying to time the end of the selloff, given that the fund’s price had fallen to spring 2020 levels, BI’s Seyffart said. ARKK sold off this year as investors sought more defensive positions amid global stock-market turmoil. That, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s rate hiking cycle, dented the growth prospects of the companies that the ETF tracks. Some strategists say that the selloff might have gone too far and many hard-hit stocks could start to recover. There are “great opportunities in high beta, beaten-down segments that now include innovation, tech, biotech, emerging markets (e.g. China), as well as more broadly in smaller capitalization and more volatile stocks,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note. “These segments are already pricing in a severe global recession, which will not materialize in our view.” Many investors could have found ARKK’s selloff as an attractive entry point, said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital. “With the fund down 40% prior to the move the past few days, it might have been an opportunity to get back in,” he said. “There are still some Cathie Wood believers out there.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•8 hours ago,Cathie Wood’s Flagship Added $341 Million Just Ahead of Big Gain,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-flagship-added-341-175711250.html

3/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Faithful investors who helped pull AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. back from the financial brink are cheering its unorthodox investment in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp., a troubled goild and silver mining company. Most Read from Bloomberg 7.3 Magnitude Quake Hits North Japan, Tsunami Risk Receding Ukraine Update: Russia Keeps Up Shelling Ahead of More Talks Kremlin Embrace of Neutral-Ukraine Plan Sparks Hope on Talks Luxury Cruise Ship Runs Aground While Leaving Caribbean Port Xi Spurs Frantic Stock Buying With Lifeline for China Market The investment follows a challenging run for Hycroft, which went public in early 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company backed by hedge fund manager Jason Mudrick. It had lost around 80% of its value since its debut, and the company asked its lenders to grant it some breathing room on its debt last month. Hycroft’s largest shareholder, Mudrick Capital, has experienced this phenomenon before. Mudrick was an architect of AMC’s narrow escape from bankruptcy last year. When AMC’s shares jumped in early 2021, Mudrick encouraged the theater operator to capitalize on the rally with an at-the-market share offering. The company issued about $400 million worth of new shares and used the proceeds to pay down debt. This time around, Mudrick’s role was more involved. Mudrick’s Gambit After rushing AMC management to a remote Nevada location to visit the mine before finalizing the decision, Mudrick, AMC’s Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron and a handful of lawyers hashed out the details via Zoom. From the jump, time was short. Hycroft had only six days to put together its deal in order to preserve a low price for AMC’s stock purchases; Nasdaq requirements meant they would price at the average of the past several days of trading, and delay would include post-rally prices in that average. Representatives from Mudrick Capital, AMC, and Hycroft did not provide comment. Reddit investors started talking about Hycroft and drove its stock up to a high of $1.88 on March 11, the stock’s highest price since August. Social media activity preceded a surge in the shares last Tuesday that caught the attention of stakeholders, according to a person with knowledge of the dealmaking over the past week. Read More: Hycroft Options, Stock Trading Volume Went Crazy Before AMC Deal Jason Mudrick recognized a familiar opportunity and called on an old partner -- AMC’s Aron, who had become a skilled Reddit-whisperer -- to help him sell Hycroft on the idea of capturing the rally with an at-the-market stock offering, according to the person familiar. Instead, it also led to a surprise investment offer from the AMC CEO. Today, Hycroft said it would sell up to $500 million of additional shares in a future at-the-market issuance. It may use proceeds from that and the AMC investment to help finance new technology to better process its reserves, according to the person familiar. Hycroft shares fell as much as 9.9% to $1.37 in New York on Wednesday. AMC climbed as much as 6.9% to $15.48. From Crypto to Gold Aron has attracted retail investor support due to what they say is his willingness to listen to individuals and solicit their ideas on Twitter. AMC has spent months touting a move into crypto, with plans to create its own token and accept cryptocurrencies as payment, which investors had pushed for amid a broader movement positioning crypto as a new safe haven investment. But that thesis has come into question in recent weeks after a sell-off in the stock market and concerns about inflation and the war in Ukraine. Gold -- the traditional safe haven -- has soared to record highs this year. “That seemed like a pretty good move to me anyways, before I even read the release,” said Jolene Roderick, 37, who bought shares in AMC and Hycroft on Tuesday after the announcement. “Gold is supposed to be considered a relatively safe investment for companies to be adding to their portfolios.” To some AMC investors, the Hycroft investment is a much-needed pivot away from the movie chain’s traditional business. Zack Dillon, 23, bought more AMC shares after Tuesday’s announcement and is taking a look at Hycroft. Hycroft potentially has precious metal reserves that could be very beneficial for AMC, he said. “I think that will be a positive outlook for the future for AMC’s revenue.” Gerardo Maya, 28, owns both AMC and Hycroft shares. He bought Hycroft shares about a year ago and sold last week at a profit amid a Reddit-spurred rally, before quickly buying back in. Hycroft could benefit from a strong retail investor community like AMC’s, he said in an interview, and he plans to buy more shares if there’s a sell-off. “Everyone who invests in AMC is all about holding, and they see the CEO investing in another company that’s having trouble financially, like Hycroft,” he said. “I can see that helping Hycroft itself.” Ironic Rescue Observers may see some irony in AMC’s newfound role as a rescuer. The theater chain itself was itself on the brink of bankruptcy just over a year ago until it, too, caught the sight of rally-happy Redditors. In a matter of months, AMC’s fate turned dramatically, albeit without much clarity on how the company was going to actually remedy the business. The company discussed creating commemorative nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, related to major films. More immediately important was the seemingly self-perpetuating narrative in which stock surge begat stock surge, without much consideration for fundamentals. Aron acknowledged the likeness between the fates of the two companies in AMC’s press release Tuesday. Hycroft “appears to be just like AMC of a year ago,” with “rock-solid assets” but “facing a severe and immediate liquidity issue,” he said. “We are confident that our involvement can greatly help it to surmount its challenges -- to its benefit, and to ours.” Hycroft, which filed for and exited bankruptcy in 2015, rallied as much as 95% Tuesday after AMC said it was taking a 22% equity stake in the company.

3/18/2022,"Medicare Advantage is costing the U.S. government billions more compared to standard Medicare, according to a new report from a nonpartisan watchdog group. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent congressional agency established in 1997, said in a report released Tuesday that the U.S. made about $12 billion in “excess payments” to private insurers in 2020 for health care delivered through Medicare Advantage, compared to what it would have cost to deliver the same care under standard Medicare. Medicare Advantage, which has grown significantly over the last 20 years and now covers about 40% of all Medicare participants, allows seniors to purchase private health insurance plans with additional features not included in standard Medicare, such as dental and vision coverage. Major insurers including UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna are competing to offer plans in the program, but critics have raised concerns about rapidly rising costs. MedPAC has been warning about the excess costs in the Medicare Advantage system for years. Here’s a summary of what’s driving costs higher from the latest report: “The Commission has found that payments to MA [Medicare Advantage] plans are inflated as a result of plans maximizing the diagnoses they report for their enrollees in order to gain higher payments, while the underlying risk adjustment model relies on diagnoses collected from claims from fee-for-service (FFS) providers, who lack the same incentives to code diagnoses. MA plans also receive quality bonuses that increase Medicare spending for the majority of MA enrollees, yet the MA quality rating system does not provide meaningful information about plans’ quality of care. MA spending is also driven up by plan benchmarks that are set so high that the Medicare program ends up subsidizing the substantial extra benefits that MA plans offer to their enrollees—benefits that are not available to FFS enrollees.” With Medicare Advantage expected to cover about half of all Medicare participants by next year, MedPAC says it’s time to start reeling in costs. Medicare Advantage plans “need to face appropriate financial pressure,” the group says, bringing it in line with providers of health care services in the standard Medicare program. “These policy flaws diminish the integrity of the program and generate waste from beneficiary premiums and taxpayer funds.” Like what you're reading?

3/18/2022,"With premium gas costing drivers 65 cents more per gallon on average than regular gas as of Tuesday, drivers may be tempted to fill their tanks with regular fuel to save money. But is it a good idea? Experts say the right fuel choice will depend on what kind of vehicle you drive. If your car requires premium gas, switching to regular can help lower costs at the pump but could also lead to expensive repairs down the road. “If I had a car that required (premium gas) and there was a huge gap in price and I’m going on a road trip, you could probably get away with it,” said Jason MacDonald, director of operations at Village Ford, a dealer in Michigan. “But I wouldn’t risk it.” DON'T GAMBLE WITH YOUR GAS TANK: Why going below a quarter tank can cost more than a fill-up Most fuel stations sell three types of gas: regular, midgrade and premium. Some stations have different names for each grade – such as unleaded, super, extra, supreme or super premium – but they all refer to the different levels of octane. Typically, regular fuel has an octane rating of 87. Midgrade, a mix of regular fuel and premium fuel, has a rating of 89 or 90 while premium is somewhere between 91 and 94, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Ratings differ slightly from state to state. “That may seem like a foreign number to some people, but what it really means is the ability of the gasoline to resist detonation or exploding before it's supposed to,” Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering at AAA, told USA TODAY. Put simply, higher octane ratings mean the fuel is more stable, which is a necessity for certain engines. “If the octane isn't high enough for the particular situation, the fuel will light itself because it gets hot, and what that does is causes either spark knock or detonation. And that's really bad for your engine,” Brannon said. RATIONED GAS: Americans rationed gas during WWII and the 1970s oil shocks. Will that happen in ‘Putin’s war’? Experts advised against switching to regular gas if a vehicle requires premium. If a vehicle requires high-octane gas but is filled with lower-octane gas, drivers risk damaging the powertrain, which includes the engine, transmission and other components, MacDonald said. Damage to the powertrain could cost $20,000 to $30,000 in repairs to the engine plus labor costs, he said. Brannon noted that most cars are equipped with sensors that can help certain vehicles run on lower-octane gas even if they're built for premium gas, but switching gas can still cause damage. ""It's really not a good idea,"" he said. ""The engine may not be able to adjust (to regular gas)."" Brannon added that drivers who use regular gas in a vehicle that requires premium could void their warranty. Drivers can find out what kind of gas their vehicle requires by looking at the owners’ manual or their gas tank door. Brannon estimates roughly 75% of cars on the road take regular. HIGH GAS PRICES: Why are gas prices rising so quickly? And how high are they expected to get? But what should drivers do when they're told premium gas is recommended but not required? Brannon said AAA research has found there are “very, very small differences” in performance and fuel economy when these vehicles use the recommended premium versus lower-octane gas. “When a car recommends premium, you might only get one or two percentage points better fuel economy and horsepower if you use premium fuel over regular,” Brannon said. With gas prices up, he recommends these drivers use regular gas “in the vast majority of cases.” Certain circumstances, such as pulling a heavy load, may make premium gas worth the higher cost. FUEL SURCHARGE AT UBER, LYFT: Uber, Lyft tack on surcharge to help rideshare, delivery drivers cope with high gas prices Fuel requirements vary from vehicle to vehicle, but Brannon said premium fuel requirements are more common among sports cars, luxury sedans with high horsepower engines and engines that have turbochargers. “A luxury brand is not all that concerned with the cost of ownership because the vehicle itself is very expensive,” he said. “They're trying to get the most performance out of that car. If they have to require their customers use premium, that's fine. Their customers understand that and hopefully continue to do that.” At Village Ford, President Jim Seavitt said most Ford vehicles require regular gasoline and only high-performance Mustangs use premium. “I’ve got a Mustang Shelby that has to use premium. If it’s a high-performance vehicle then it uses premium and people who buy a high-performance car expect to put premium in it,” Seavitt said. Some drivers put premium gas in cars that run on regular gas, hoping for better performance. But Brannon said doing so is a waste of money. ""It is literally going out the tailpipe with absolutely no benefit to you as the consumer,” Brannon said. In search of higher grades of gasoline? Brannon recommends searching for stations that offer “top-tier” gasoline, which meets certain standards for enhanced detergent additives and can keep engines cleaner. The AAA recommends drivers look for a top-tier fuel that is the correct grade for their vehicle. GAS PRICES ARE UP: What can Biden do to lower costs at the pump amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine? HOW TO SAVE AT THE PUMP: How to save money at the pump as gas prices hit all-time high with Russian invasion of Ukraine “It’s easy to get confused because of all the marketing that's done around premium fuel,” Brannon said. But top-tier gas “will actually keep the engine running longer, happier, (with) better fuel economy and the like.” He added that top-tier fuel prices are “comparable” to other gas prices. Drivers interested in finding top-tier gas stations near them can search online at https://www.toptiergas.com/. Brock Gunter, an automotive instructor at Idaho State University, added that drivers looking to save on fuel costs should pay more attention to how they drive. ""Just stay off the gas,"" he said.
