12/31/2021,"Sebastian Coe has doubled down on his insistence that boycotting the Beijing Winter Olympics over China’s human rights record and treatment of the tennis star Peng Shuai would be a mistake, and says that dialogue and relationships are a better way of “flicking the dial” politically and socially. In his strongest intervention yet, the head of World Athletics and senior IOC member said that sporting boycotts were “historically illiterate and intellectually dishonest” and described the political boycott announced by the US, UK and other western countries as “frankly meaningless”.  Human rights groups have accused China of forcibly interning more than a million Uyghurs in re-education camps in Xinjiang, submitting them to forced sterilisations and intentionally destroying their culture, as well as destroying democracy in Hong Kong. That view is supported by the Biden administration, which earlier this month confirmed it would not send diplomats to the Winter Games due to “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses”. However, Coe insisted that a “balance” needed to be struck when it came to human rights and countries like China. He rejected claims that such a stance was ignoring the situation that the Uyghurs and others faced. “I’m not insouciant or cavalier about human rights, I take them very seriously,” he said. “But we have to be realistic, when we take our events around the world there are going to be challenges: culturally, politically, socially. I guess my fallacy position on this is always, in an imperfect world, sport is the one continuum that can actually create some stability. I’ve witnessed time after time the impact that sport has had in flicking that dial, socially, politically, economically.” When asked about boycotts, Coe, who led the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Organising Committee, was blunt. “Boycotts on balance are historically illiterate and intellectually dishonest,” he said. “A political boycott is, frankly, meaningless. And in a world where I actually think discussion and relationships are important, rarely do I see isolation bearing fruit. “But that’s not to be an apologist for countries that do not conform to the basic standards around human rights. I’ve never witnessed sport leaving any country in worse shape than when it’s been there. The impact across the board can be, on many occasions, quite profound.” Last month the WTA suspended tennis tournaments in China due to concerns over Peng’s safety, but Coe defended World Athletics’ plans to double the number of Diamond League events in China to two next summer. “It’s for each sport to decide its own approach,” said Coe. “It’s not an approach we would take in World Athletics and I don’t think over the long haul it is one that actually achieves a great deal. There are always unintended consequences. And at the end of the day, the people that most suffer in all that are the athletes. “All athletes should be free to voice their concerns and they should be free to without fear of censure and they should be able to travel freely,” he said. “That is an important right. But we’re talking about extrapolating from that into boycotting a sporting event, and I think there has to be proportionality here, and I think there has to be balance.” Meanwhile Coe confirmed that the Athletics Integrity Unit would be stepping up its safeguarding efforts in the sport. It comes after the Guardian revealed that the top sprint coach Rana Reider is being investigated by the US Center for Safesport after multiple complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him. UK Sport is also looking into whether UK Athletics properly handled an allegation involving Reider and an 18-year-old sprinter when it was made in 2014. While Coe would not comment specifically on that case, he accepted that athletics had to do more to make the sport safe. “I don’t know what is taking place within UKA,” he said. “I’m sure they would want themselves to look at what happened and they will need to go back through that particular pathology. But one of the things that came out of our congress was to extend the mandate of the AIU. It can look more broadly at some of these safeguarding issues. “It can’t become the world’s policeman on this, but I think it will take a far greater interest in those kinds of issues. During the convention we had Charlie Webster tell her story, and I can tell you that within hours of that, both World Athletics and the AIU were contacted by federations who said they couldn’t sit any longer and watch certain individuals just getting jobs in the system knowing what they knew. It was as if their conscience got pricked on this. “If we are all being honest about it there are red flags that sometimes get ignored, and too often a problem is swept away from one federation and unwittingly ends up in another federation. It’s really important we are able to share that kind of information in federations wherever they occur, because there are too many of them.”",Sport/Sport,Sebastian Coe calls political boycott of Winter Olympics ‘meaningless’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/sebastian-coe-calls-political-boycott-of-winter-olympics-meaningless
12/31/2021,"How Manchester United needed this victory. It derived from one of their three games in hand and moves them to 31 points, four behind Arsenal in the final Champions League berth, and was as emphatic as any display so far under Ralf Rangnick. This does not mean, however, all is tickety-boo with their play. The win came against a Burnley who, due to four matches being postponed because of Covid, last played on 12 December and whose sole victory, over Brentford, came on 30 October. Still absent is an overriding structure that can allow United to govern a game. Under Rangnick, they remain a side of moments: tonight it was enough to claim the three points but this lack of continuity will trouble their caretaker manager.  Rangnick’s record had stood at two wins (against Crystal Palace and Norwich) and two draws (Young Boys and Newcastle): hardly a searingly convincing start to an interim tenure that has to end in fourth place, at least, or he will have failed. For this hosting of Burnley he assessed Monday’s dire 1-1 at Newcastle and made six changes. Bruno Fernandes was suspended, and out – for reasons of preference – went Raphaël Varane, Diogo Dalot, Alex Telles, Fred and Marcus Rashford. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly joined Harry Maguire in defence – the latter’s form making him lucky to survive – Nemanja Matic came into midfield, Jadon Sancho played at No 10 (one of Rangnick’s two) and Edinson Cavani partnered Cristiano Ronaldo in attack. Burnley’s covid travails claimed Josh Brownhill, Nick Pope, Jay Rodriguez and Kevin Long as its latest victims, while Sean Dyche was also without the injured Ashley Barnes, Maxwel Cornet and Connor Roberts. This meant a first Premier League appearance since June 2020 for goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, while Aaron Lennon was starting for the first time since 2 October. Anything less than a home victory would therefore cause scrutiny of the Rangnick project, five matches in. But what the 63-year-old saw first concerned him. His team allowed Burnley to run along their left and, when Matthew Lowton crossed from the other flank, United were thankful Chris Wood’s header was wild. Also off target was Ronaldo’s shot via a Luke Shaw through ball that saw the forward spoon over. But Ronaldo turned provider to open the scoring. Mason Greenwood cannoned the ball off a defender before pulling it back to Ronaldo whose touch was designed to allow him to let fly. Instead, Scott McTominay was there to fire in, to Hennessey’s left, for his first goal this season. Joy mixed with relief followed. But the play was fractured, pell-mell. What United needed was control but Burnley were defiant. Dwight McNeil and Johann Gudmundsson were driving in from the flanks and causing Wan-Bissaka to make vital blocks. Shaw was more positive and one barnstorming run ending in his shot smacking the side-netting and drawing applause from Rangnick. United were about to score again. Sancho veered in from the left and took aim, Ben Mee stuck out a toe and redirected the ball in for an own goal. The hosts had become rampant. McTominay scattered defenders in a run that finished with a clever ball to Ronaldo. The No 7’s silky feet fashioned an effort but the shot was deflected. However by 35 minutes it was 3-0, the excellent McTominay blazing a shot at Hennessey, who tipped the ball on to his left post, only for Ronaldo to tap in. This should have been contest over. But Maguire proved a liability, his passiveness allowing Lennon to run through the defence and unload past David de Gea and into the corner. Dyche could use this as fuel for his interval chat. Burnley came out and tried hitting left-back Charlie Taylor along his corridor but Wan-Bissaka had his measure. Soon, the United right-back was running decoy, allowing Greenwood to serve the ball on to Ronaldo’s head, whose attempt was disappointing. A flowing sequence that featured another Shaw burst had Ronaldo dummying a pass, Cavani helping the ball on and Greenwood shooting. Hennessey repelled the effort. This passage of play continued the pattern of the match. Burnley were existing off scraps, at best. United were doing what they should: dominating an inferior, severely depleted opponent. For confidence moving forward, though, another goal would be welcome. Yet their play meandered, De Gea’s 70-yard hack that went straight out of play illustrative of this. Leadership was required from Maguire or one of the de facto captains – Ronaldo, Cavani, McTominay or Shaw – to gee up the troops and get them moving in high gear again. Instead, Lennon again drove forward, Bailly having to usher the ball out for a corner. United broke from this, Greenwood relaying to Sancho who played the ball to Ronaldo. His pass went back to McTominay who warmed Hennessey’s fingers again, the 20-yard shot being pushed on to the bar. With the score at 3-1 Burnley retained a sniff but this was dependent on them suddenly developing a killer edge. It was not to be, though James Tarkowski had an added-time chance for a consolation. While Varane replaced the injured Bailly, there was scant alarm for a side who next host Wolves on Monday. Again, only victory is enough.",Sport/Football,McTominay and Ronaldo on target as Manchester United ease past Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report

Scott Morrison said it was down to industry concerns, but the industries concerned deny lobbying about it. Follow Australia’s Covid developments today live right here. In non-Covid news, speculation is mounting that socialite turned convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell may try to cut a deal by naming names in a broader investigation of her ex-boyfriend Jeffery Epstein’s high society circle. And in case you missed it amid all the Covid yesterday, the front of Canberra’s Old Parliament House was set alight by protesters for the second time in as many weeks. The Aboriginal Tent Embassy has released a statement condemning the destruction. Now, on to the reads. Court testimony during Maxwell’s trial painted an “intimate” portrait of a woman born to wealth and drawn to power. Victoria Bekiempis tells the story of her entry into Epstein’s orbit and the luxury and horror that followed. Notable quote: “These girls were just a means to support her lifestyle,” prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said in her opening. “A way for the defendant to make sure that Epstein – who demanded constant sexual gratification from young girls – remained satisfied so that the defendant could stay in the lifestyle to which she was accustomed.” A word of warning: As the quote above suggests, this story contains descriptions of sexual abuse, so stay away if that isn’t something you’re up for today (or ever).

12/31/2021,"A little-known 17-year-old from Uzbekistan made a clean sweep of Magnus Carlsen and the global chess elite on Tuesday, incidentally setting a new world age record. Nodirbek Abdusattorov won the World Rapid championship in Warsaw, claiming en route the scalps of Magnus Carlsen and the No 1’s last two challengers, Fabiano Caruana and Ian Nepomniachtchi. In rapid chess, each player has 15 minutes for all moves, plus a 10 second per move increment. After 21 rounds of three-minute games on Wednesday and Thursday, France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda in a tie-break to win the World Blitz title. The 18-year-old world No 2, Alireza Firouzja, was third, but Carlsen was well adrift in 12th place. He said: “Some days you just don’t have it. I was nowhere near close to the level I needed to be today.”  At 17 years three months, Abdusattorov becomes the youngest ever world champion in open competition, surpassing Ruslan Ponomariov at 18 in the Fide version of the then disputed classical crown in 2001. The next youngest were 22 – Garry Kasparov in his first victory over Anatoly Karpov in 1985, and Daniil Dubov and Sergey Karjakin when winning speed titles. The world women’s championship has a younger record holder, as Hou Yifan won it in 2010 aged 16, after being the defeated finalist two years earlier. Earlier in his blossoming career, the teen from Tashkent had won the world under-eight championship, defeated two grandmasters at nine, and been singled out in this column when he narrowly missed becoming the youngest ever GM at 12. Abdusattorov had his share of good fortune at Warsaw, surviving three lost positions, but he also played a very strong field where Levon Aronian and Boris Gelfand were among his other victims. After 13 rounds he was in a quadruple tie on 9.5 points with Carlsen, Caruana and Nepomniachtchi, but the regulations excluded Carlsen and Caruana from the play-off due to their inferior tie-breaks. An angry Carlsen denounced the rules as “ idiotic. Either all players on the same amount of points join the play-off, or no one does.” It was balancing luck for Nepomniachtchi, who in this same event and under the same rules in 2017 was excluded from the play-off, but the Russian was outgunned in the tie-break games. Abdusattorov easily drew with Black then won the second game despite twice missing mate in two near the end. Abdusattorov is the second player from Generation Z, defined as people born from 1995 to 2010, to break through to the chess top. Firouzja, whose victories in Latvia and Slovenia last month made him No 2 behind Carlsen in the global rankings, was out of form in Warsaw in the rapid but finished strongly in the three-minute blitz to take the bronze medal and narrowly miss out on the Vachier-Lagrave v Duda play-off. Yet another Gen Z player surged into the limelight when Bibisara Assaubayeva, 17, captured the world women’s rapid championship silver medal with 8.5/11, half a point behind Russia’s “chess Queen” Alexandra Kosteniuk. The teen from Kazakhstan did even better in the women’s blitz, reversing the result to take gold to Kosteniuk’s silver. Uzbekistan has long punched far above its weight in world chess. Four of its teenagers did well in last month’s Grand Swiss at Riga while Javokhir Sindarov, 16, finished in eighth place in the blitz at Warsaw ahead of many of the world elite. Long ago the old USSR set the standard for young talent with a golden generation including David Bronstein, Tigran Petrosian, Ewfim Geller and Mark Taimanov. England in the 1970s followed the Soviet model with Jon Speelman, Nigel Short, Michael Adams and later Luke McShane, Gawain Jones and David Howell. India and the US are doing best now with super-squads,but Uzbekistan is showing what can be achieved even by a small nation with the right approach to developing an elite. Fide has announced that the eight-player 2022 Candidates will be staged in Madrid in June-July 2022, with patronage from the Scheinberg family, who have previously backed opens in the Isle of Man and whose fortune comes from the sale of PokerStars for nearly $5bn. So far the qualifiers are Nepomniachtchi (loser of the 2021 title match), Caruana and Firouzja (Riga Grand Swiss), Sergey Karjakin and Jan-Krzysztof Duda (World Cup), Teimour Radjabov (Fide nominee), with the remaining two to come from the Fide Grand Prix at Berlin and Belgrade in February-March 2022. The Candidates and its winner have become even more significant than usual after Carlsen’s announcement that he will only defend his title if the challenger is from the new generation, so raising the stakes for the top two Candidates who could end up playing between them for the supreme crown. 3796: 1 Rc1!
