3/11/2022,"In Culver City, a Chinese restaurant is selling bright blue and yellow “freedom dumplings”, the colors of the Ukrainian flag. In West Hollywood, a popular cocktail bar is offering a special “Pruzhnyy”, or resilience, cocktail, made with Ukrainian Khor vodka. Bakeries across California are making special batches of hamentaschen, a Jewish cookie associated with resistance to tyrannical government officials, and pampushka, a Ukrainian garlic bread. It’s all part of a wave of solidarity among California chefs, who are using food to show support for Ukrainians after Russia’s invasion and to fundraise for humanitarian relief efforts. All the proceeds from the special menu items are going to organizations such as World Central Kitchen, the non-profit offering hot meals to Ukrainian refugees at border crossings; Polish Humanitarian Action; Libereco PHR, a Swiss-German relief group; and Unicef. Although the individual dollar amounts raised are often modest, the chefs, bakers and bartenders involved said they want to send a message. “We’re a tiny little bar in Los Angeles, but we wanted [Ukrainians] to know that we’re here to support them, no matter what,” said Tom Sopit, the managing director of Employees Only in West Hollywood. “I understand the price of freedom. I didn’t grow up in a democracy,” said Shirley Chung, the Los Angeles chef who created the blue and yellow dumplings. Watching Ukrainians fighting for their democracy, she said, “I feel like they’re fighting for the world.” The California food industry relief efforts are part of a broader international movement. Chung said she was inspired by Cook for Ukraine, a global campaign started by London-based chefs Alissa Timoshkina, who is Russian, and Olia Hercules, who is Ukrainian, which raised more than £75,000 ($98,000) in donations in its first week. Those two friends were inspired by a previous culinary campaign, Cook for Syria, which encourages people to cook traditional meals and talk about the crisis, while also donating money for relief efforts. Food industry workers in California say watching the swiftness and brutality of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the past weeks has left them feeling powerless, so they turned to what they knew how to do: feeding people. The freedom dumplings at Ms Chi Cafe in Culver City are a tribute to Ukrainian-style varenyky, filled with chicken, mushrooms, dill, and sunchoke, a nod to sunflowers, the symbol of Ukrainian resistance. They’re for sale nationwide on Goldbelly, as well as in Chung’s Los Angeles restaurant. Chung said she was inspired by an NBC News story about Ukrainian women working around the clock to make dumplings to feed soldiers and people displaced by the war, and by conversations about Ukraine relief efforts among her own social networks. “Many of my friends, bakers and chefs, they’re all working on events to raise awareness,” she said. “We just wanted to do as much as we can as fast as we can.”Sopit, of Employees Only, said he searched across the region to find Ukrainian vodka, and then drove to Pasadena himself to pick up the only cases he could find. Raffles, bake sales and other Ukraine fundraising efforts across Los Angeles have drawn everyone from rising pastry chefs to the city’s most elite restaurants, such as award-winning chef Suzanne Goin’s AOC. Multiple Los Angeles bakeries have joined an international social media campaign, Hamantaschen for Ukraine. The Jewish cookie, traditionally served during Purim, is named after a tyrannical Persian official who tried to exterminate the Jewish people. “Ukrainians are, in real time, facing a modern-day Haman in Vladimir Putin,” the website explains, encouraging both professional and amateur bakers to sell the cookies to support refugees at the Polish border. Friends and Family, a bakery in East Hollywood, is selling out of dozens of hamantaschen every day by noon, said Roxana Jullapat, the co-owner and head baker. A Los Angeles vegan Jewish deli, Mort and Betty’s, is also participating. The donations are particularly meaningful because many restaurants, bakeries and bars are still struggling from the financial toll of the pandemic, said Steph Chen of Gather for Good, which organized a Ukraine fundraiser that has brought in tens of thousands of dollars. “Everyone is constantly in question of whether the lights are going to stay on or not, or if they could pay their staff,” Chen said. “Despite all of this, there is still this overwhelming response.”",Lifestyle/Food,‘Freedom dumplings’: the chefs cooking in solidarity with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/10/chefs-bakers-bartenders-solidarity-ukraine-los-angeles
3/11/2022,"Australian virologists have uncovered a drug-resistant mutation in the Covid-19 virus associated with the drug sotrovimab and say without the monitoring of patients given the treatment the mutated virus could spread in the community. The world-first findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, are the result of an analysis of the first 100 patients in western Sydney during the Delta outbreak in 2021 to be given sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody that is available in many countries to treat vulnerable patients who are at risk of severe disease and death due to Covid-19 infection. Sotrovimab must be administered via infusion within the first five days of Covid-19 infection, and prevents Covid-19 symptoms from becoming severe. It is one of the few human-engineered monoclonal antibodies that can target Omicron. The lead author of the study, Dr Rebecca Rockett, said four of the patients developed resistance to sotrovimab six to 13 days after treatment. The whole genome sequence of the virus analysed from the patients before and after sotrovimab treatment uncovered mutations in a few patients that “made the drug effectively inactive,” Rockett, from the University of Sydney’s Institute for Infectious Diseases, said. “We’re not sure if sotrovimab helps neutralise the virus early on in the infection before it develops resistance. But often drugs are given to treat Covid-19 patients and there’s not really any follow-up done. We realise that you can’t follow every patient with PCR testing or genomic surveillance, but we are trying to advocate for patients that progress to severe disease despite the treatment that we investigate using genomics to see whether they’ve acquired any resistance mutations.” It was important to monitor them because once the patients acquired the mutations, Rockett and her team could still take samples from them and grow the virus in the laboratory, which meant they were still infectious. It meant the patients were at risk of passing the mutated virus on to others. “What we don’t want to see is resistant virus disseminating in the community, because that will mean that a lot of other people can’t use this drug as well.” Rockett said it would be prudent for those who developed resistance to isolate for longer until the virus had cleared, and make extra efforts to remain separate from those in the same household. The virus persisted in the affected patients for up to 24 days after sotrovimab treatment.

An infectious diseases physician and drug resistance expert with the Australian National University, Prof Peter Collignon, said potential spread of resistant viruses in the community presented “a real problem”. “Thankfully, this mutation appears to be a relatively rare event, but the only way you ever know that is to keep an eye on it.” GSK, the manufacturer of the drug, said the study results were consistent with its large clinical trials, which found a small proportion of patients develop on-treatment resistance. “Resistance is also seen in studies for other Covid-19 monoclonal antibodies and oral treatments, and relates to how the immune system interacts with the virus,” it said in a statement. “This report does not change the positive benefit-risk of sotrovimab for use in the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in patients at high risk of progression.”",News/World news,"Covid treatment sotrovimab can cause drug-resistant mutation, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/covid-treatment-sotrovimab-can-cause-drug-resistant-mutation-study-finds
3/11/2022,"Roman Abramovich, one of the world’s richest men, was finally subjected to sanctions by the UK government after ministers accused him of having “clear connections” to Vladimir Putin’s regime and being among a group of businessmen who had “blood on their hands”. The owner of Chelsea FC was one of seven Russians worth up to £15bn who had their assets frozen on Thursday and were banned from travelling to Britain in a move designed to dramatically increase pressure on the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions against Abramovich – years after campaigners first raised concerns about his ties to the Russian president – left the London football club in turmoil, with his plans to sell it frozen indefinitely. After weeks of pressure to act more aggressively against the oligarchs who have made the UK their home, Boris Johnson said Abramovich had been targeted because of his links to Putin. “You have to have clear evidence that they are connected to the Putin regime, and that has been established. That’s why we are going ahead with the sanctions that we are,” he said. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, also insisted that oligarchs would “have no place in our economy or society”. She said: “With their close links to Putin, they are complicit in his aggression. The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame.” Abramovich was targeted because the government’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation suspected that a steel company he had effective control of, Evraz plc, supplied steel to the Russian military to produce tanks. The move will heap further pressure on Putin two weeks after he ordered troops to invade Ukraine in a bloody war that has seen thousands killed or injured and the Russian military investigated at the international criminal court over accusations of war crimes. Chelsea FC has been left in limbo by restrictions placed on it that ban any player transfers and the sale of further tickets or merchandise to fans. The club faced further financial headaches when the mobile network and sponsor 3 reportedly demanded its logo be removed from Chelsea’s shirt and stadium. Government sources suggested the licence granted to the club to continue operating would remain in place until at least the end of the season and act as a “safety net” to avoid calamitous consequences to the wider football system. They said some requirements were likely to be tweaked, such as the cap on “reasonable costs” of £500,000 a fixture. Evraz shares fell by 11% after the sanctions announcement, before trading was suspended on the orders of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, “pending clarification of the impact of UK sanctions”. Abramovich’s stake in the company was worth £1.4bn at the end of 2021, but that sank below £350m by the end of Thursday. Israel’s national holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, also said it was suspending relations with Abramovich, who is Jewish and last month agreed a “a new long-term strategic partnership” with the site. Evraz denied any links with the Russian military, and Abramovich’s lawyers argued before the invasion of Ukraine that he did not fit the criteria for sanctions, saying it was “ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state”. Abramovich did not respond to the announcement of sanctions against him. Other oligarchs hit with sanctions on Thursday were Abramovich’s one-time business partner Oleg Deripaska; Putin’s “right-hand man” Igor Sechin; and four men in the Russian president’s “inner circle”: Andrey Kostin, Alexei Miller, Nikolai Tokarev and Dmitri Lebedev. All have been barred from conducting any financial transactions in the UK, meaning those with property in the country will no longer be able to employ staff such as cleaners, housekeepers or gardeners, or even have contracts for utilities such as electricity. Meanwhile, the prime minister admitted that he feared Russia would deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine. Johnson said it would be “straight out of their playbook”, following Moscow’s unfounded claim that opponents were developing chemical weapons in the region. “When they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of maskirovka – a fake story – ready to go,” he told Sky News. “You’ve seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK. That’s what they’re already doing. It is a cynical, barbaric government.” After the sanctions announcement on Thursday, ministers were accused of acting too late to stop oligarchs who feared sanctions weeks ago, removing their assets from the UK. Abramovich’s private jet reportedly left the UK in late February. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, claimed that Britain continued to “lag far behind” other allies on the number of Putin-linked individuals and entities facing sanctions. Labour analysis found that the UK had issued 16 times fewer sanctions than Brussels, with Britain targeting 41 Putin-linked individuals or entities compared with 660 spread across the EU. Lammy demanded that tougher action be taken, such as excluding Beralusian banks from the international payment system Swift, imposing sanctions on all 351 members of the Russian Duma who voted in favour of recognising the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and limits being set on Russians depositing money in UK bank accounts. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, who is also the chair of the parliamentary group on Russia, argued it was “absolutely preposterous that we’re only doing all of these measures now – we should have been doing them years ago”. He said: “We’ve been woefully ill-prepared for this moment, which is why yesterday the EU sanctioned another 160 people and we only sanctioned seven people today.”",News/World news,UK imposes sanctions on Roman Abramovich over ‘clear’ links to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-roman-abramovich-over-clear-links-to-putin
