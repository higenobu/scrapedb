12/28/2021,"The Labour party has demanded stricter limits on air pollution after analysis showed the close correlation between children living in poverty and dirty air in the UK. Five London boroughs rank worst for child poverty and worst for dirty air, according to government data collated by Labour, mapping areas of high poverty against statistics on air pollution. The analysis showed that the higher the rate of child poverty in a given area, the dirtier the air there was on average, with most of the 50 most polluted areas in the UK also showing the highest rates of child poverty.  Boroughs in Birmingham, Southampton, Portsmouth, Sandwell and Walsall also showed high correlations between child poverty and air pollution. In the 11 local authorities that exceed the WHO’s recommended guideline limit of an annual mean concentration of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air (µg/m3), an average of 39.5% of children are living in poverty – much higher than the national average of 31%. Altogether, about 6.7 million children are living in areas of the UK where air pollution has breached legal limits, of whom about 2 million are also living in poverty, according to the research. The announcement by the Labour party follows a meeting in December with Keir Starmer, Ed Miliband, and campaign group Choked Up, a group of young black & brown teens living in areas affected by air pollution who are calling for a right to clean air. Last Wednesday we asked @Keir_Starmer and @Ed_Miliband about their plans to tackle #ClimateCrisis and their promise for a new #CleanAir act - met activists from @_TeachtheFuture @YCCNetwork @officialb2n @fon_xyz and more! Hoping for more meetings w/ @UKLabour in the future! https://t.co/hTd3TmlM3s Jim McMahon, the shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said: “Everyone should have the right to breathe clean, safe air, no matter where you live. If the pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that public health has to be at the very top of the political agenda, and that has to start with the air we breathe.” He pointed to Labour proposals for a Clean Air Act, which would establish a legal right to breathe clean air, and legal requirements for air quality based on the advice of the World Health Organization. The government rejected amendments to the environment bill that would have set pollution limits in line with WHO advice. He added: “The Conservative government refused to protect the health of British children, voting against tougher limits on pollution. Our children should be able to take clean, safe air for granted. Only a Clean Air Act is going to guarantee that.” Under the new environment legislation, the government will set new pollution targets from late next year. The government was repeatedly found to be in breach of EU air pollution rules, when they applied to the UK, before Brexit. A government spokesperson said: “Air pollution has reduced significantly since 2010 – at a national level, emissions of fine particulate matter have fallen by 11%, while emissions of nitrogen oxides are at their lowest levels since records began. But we know there is still more to do. To continue to drive forward tangible and long-lasting improvements to air quality, we are committed to setting stretching and ambitious targets on air quality through our Environment Act.” Some of the most polluted cities, including London, Birmingham and Portsmouth, have introduced clean air zones in an effort to reduce air pollution, which mainly comes from diesel and petrol vehicles, agriculture and wood-burning stoves.",News/Environment,Labour highlights link between child poverty and air pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/28/labour-highlights-link-between-child-poverty-and-air-pollution
12/28/2021,"Police in Devon are ramping up a search for a 12-year-old girl who vanished from her home eight days ago, missing Christmas celebrations with her family. Devon and Cornwall police said there were growing increasingly concerned for the welfare of Leona Peach, who was reported missing from the Newton Abbot area on 20 December.  Leona, who is 4ft 9in tall, was wearing flip flops and carrying a pink bag when she was last seen in the Hele Park area of the south Devon town. She is originally from north Devon and one line of inquiry police are looking at is that she may have travelled to the Bideford area. In a statement, the force said: “Police are growing increasingly concerned for the welfare of 12-year-old Leona Peach, who has been reported missing from the Newton Abbot area and are calling on her to get in touch. “Leona was last seen in the Hele Park area of Newton Abbot around 9.15am on Monday 20 December. Originally from the north Devon area officers believe she may have travelled to Bideford.” The police have appealed for Leona to make contact with her family in Newton Abbot. DI Dave Pebworth said: “Enquiries are continuing in our efforts to locate Leona and we are asking members of the public to help us. “We are supporting her friends and family and are appealing to Leona to contact home so that they know that she is safe and well. “This time of year is especially important for families and we are keen to make sure that she is OK and would ask that anyone who is with her encourages Leona to contact her family in Newton Abbot. “Leona if you are reading this, we want you to know you are not in any trouble, please contact us, or someone you trust, to let us know you are safe.” She is described as white and of slim to medium build. She is approximately 4ft 9in tall, has hazel-coloured eyes and has long brown hair which reaches the middle of her back. She has a bald patch above her right ear. Leona is believed to have been wearing grey/blue leggings or skinny trousers with a dark-coloured fur coat and flip flops. She was carrying a pink bag. Police have urged anyone who has seen Leona or knows of her whereabouts to call 999 immediately, quoting log number 0222 of 20/12/21.",News/UK news,Devon police search for 12-year-old girl missing since before Christmas,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/leona-peach-missing-12-year-old-girl-devon-newton-abbot
12/28/2021,"Russia’s supreme court has ordered the closure of Memorial, the country’s oldest human rights group, in a watershed moment in Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on independent thought. The court ordered Memorial’s closure under Russia’s controversial “foreign agent” legislation, which has targeted dozens of NGOs and media outlets seen as critical of the government.  Memorial was founded in the late 1980s to document political repressions carried out under the Soviet Union, building a database of victims of the Great Terror and gulag camps. It has also grown into an important advocate for the cause of human rights in Russia, spawning branches and initiatives in many of Russia’s more than 80 regions. In her ruling, judge Alla Nazarova ordered the organisation closed for “repeated” and “gross” violations of Russia’s foreign agent laws, a designation that Memorial has called politically motivated. The decision will close the “Memorial International Historical, Educational, Charitable, and Human Rights Society, its regional branches and other structural units,” she said. The Interfax news agency quoted a lawyer for Memorial as saying that it would appeal, both in Russia and at the European court of human rights. The Russian prosecutor portrayed the organisation as a geopolitical weapon used by foreign governments to deprive modern Russians of taking pride in the achievements of the Soviet Union. Those arguments dovetail closely with the Kremlin’s view on history, in particular a sense that western allies have refused to give the Soviet Union its due for its role in the defeat of Germany in the second world war. “It is obvious that, by cashing in on the subject of political reprisals of the 20th century, Memorial is mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state and whitewashing and vindicating Nazi criminals having the blood of Soviet citizens on their hands,” said Alexei Zhafyarov, a representative of the Russian prosecutor general’s office, during the hearing. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen? … Perhaps because someone pays for that. And this is the true reason why Memorial is so fiercely trying to disown its foreign agent status,” he continued. The daughter of Natalya Estemirova, a former Memorial board member murdered in Chechnya for her human rights work in 2009, wrote in response to the verdict: “My mother always used to say: ‘It can’t get any worse than this.’ Turns out it can.”",News/World news,Russian court orders closure of country’s oldest human rights group,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/russian-court-memorial-human-rights-group-closure

12/28/2021,"When I ask parents, siblings and children what they want Guardian readers to know about their family member lost to gun violence, each one emphatically tells me their relative didn’t deserve what happened to them. They tell me their loved ones adored animals, loved kids – that they were just special. The people I speak with, especially parents, want the world to know their sons and daughters weren’t stereotypes. This desire for posthumous exoneration isn’t anything new, but the pleas sounded especially urgent in 2021.  2021 was a brutal year for gun violence in the US, where communities across the country experienced a heartbreaking increase in homicides and shootings. The rise started in 2020, when homicides rose by 30% from the year before, the highest single year increase since the FBI began tracking crime data in 1960. The increase amounted to an estimated 5,000 additional deaths. The majority of victims were killed with guns. The full data for 2021 is not yet available, but the rise appears to have continued in 2021, with homicides in cities such as Oakland, Portland and Detroit continuing to climb. These dramatic increases have led to intense and divisive conversations about why people shoot others and the role police and prosecutors play in preventing injuries and death. It was discouraging to watch conversations about people losing their lives morph into political fodder and an excuse to push debunked “tough on crime narratives”. Reporting on gun violence this year reinforced that most Americans don’t understand that the deadly and traumatic toll of this violence isn’t spread equally across the country. Shootings, as well as the grief and trauma that come with it, are concentrated in lower-income, mostly Black and Latino communities in California, New Jersey, Louisiana and other states. No group feels the impact more disparately than young Black men. The stories that have struck and saddened me the most were those of children and teenagers who don’t get to make it out of adolescence alive or free of the scars that gun violence leaves on your heart, mind, and spirit. I continue to grieve the losses of Shamara Young, a 15 year-old who was gunned down after getting a fresh set of braids, Jasper Wu, a toddler who died while riding in a car seat and Demetrius-Fleming Davis, who, at 18, was shot while riding in a truck with friends. Communities are still reeling from these tragedies while new slayings force their way into our collective conscience. Just this month a 12year-old was killed and a nine year-old was wounded during a shooting in Wilmington, the next day a teenager was killed in Boyle Heights. Speaking with families and community members highlighted how gun violence incidents have ripple effects that extend far beyond what most people consider or what most news media covers. People may have read a local news story about a shooting, seen a vigil the day after a shooting or passed by a commemoration on the anniversary of a death. But few have heard about the day-to-day struggles that make the burden of gun violence so heavy to carry – making funeral arrangements or traversing the same streets your child was killed on to go to work – a burden that is exponentially more devastating when somebody is killed young, violently and in their own community. So many mothers I’ve spoken with on this beat told me about the physical consequences of having a child shot and killed. They are on anti-depressants, can’t go back to work, are fearful for their remaining children’s lives, are trying to muster the strength to go on and make their family work now that a huge chunk has been ripped from them. “I already know where my health is going and I’m not scared,” Sonya Mitchell, whose 23-year-old son Daimon “Dada” Ferguson was shot and killed, told me this summer. “I wanna stay here for my daughters and grandkids, but my heart’s too broken. I used to have a hella life, but I just don’t anymore.” “The death of my son doesn’t affect just me, it affects so many other Black women who I’ve seen suffer, mothers who are my friends and we all buried our sons,” she added. “We have to be there for each other because no one knows this pain but us.” The pain of losing a loved one to gun violence affects the entire family unit and community at large. Younger siblings, family and friends of people who have been killed, they all live with the repercussions of gun violence in all of these different ways. But as consistently as there’s been community gun violence, there are dedicated residents who swoop in to help entire neighborhoods heal. I spoke with Tashante McCoy in Stockton and Jasmine Hardison in Oakland, who embrace and support people in their homes and organize events to bring joy, awareness and healing in their communities. DeWanda Joseph in Richmond holds weekly meetings for people who still don’t know how or why their child was killed and are losing faith in the justice system’s ability to get answers. Reporting on gun violence before and during the pandemic made me realize how many systems– governmental and community-based alike – need to be in place and ready to respond to these traumatic situations. The many interactions someone has after a loved one is murdered can either compound trauma or start that healing process. And most people don’t get to see that unless they have been impacted by gun violence or work with those who are.
