""It is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalization,"" Harris said. In the interview with CBS, Harris also addressed the Built Back Better agenda, voting rights, and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. Vice President Kamala Harris avoided placing blame on unvaccinated individuals amid the recent surge of the coronavirus, and instead urged Americans to take responsibility and get their vaccinations and booster shots. Speaking in an exclusive interview with CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Harris said ""it is no one's fault that this virus hit our shores or hit the world"" and cautioned that she does not believe this is a moment to point fingers . ""It is more about individual power and responsibility, and it's about the decisions that everyone has the choice to make, no doubt,"" Harris told CBS's Margaret Brennan. ""It is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalization if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster, and so I urge people to do that."" An estimated 62% of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated, and about 32% of eligible individuals have received a booster shot, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As COVID-19 cases rise across the country due to highly infectious Omicron variant, Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Americans of a ""really dark time ahead"" come mid-January as the virus continues to spread. Meanwhile, scientists are scrambling to ensure tests and shots are effective against the new variant. Moderna has stated its booster shot increases antibody levels against the Omicron variant, while GlaxoSmithKline reported its antibody drug works against all Omicron mutations. Harris said earlier this month that the Biden administration did not foresee the Omicron variant nor the magnitude of its impact. ""We didn't see Omicron coming. And that's the nature of what this, this awful virus has been, which as it turns out, has mutations and variants,"" Harris told the Los Angeles Times. In Sunday's interview, Harris reiterated the administration's determination to pass the Build Back Better agenda, while also addressing the lack of progress on voting rights legislation and the contested withdrawal from Afghanistan earlier this year.

12/27/2021,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — Defense attorneys want to dismiss the indictment against five men accused of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer because of what they described as “egregious overreaching” by federal agents and informants, according to a court filing. In the 20-page motion, which was filed Saturday night, defense attorneys allege FBI agents and federal prosecutors invented a conspiracy and entrapped people who could face up to life in prison. They're asking U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker to dismiss the conspiracy charge, which would effectively knock down the federal government's case and other connected charges, according to The Detroit News. The request comes after developments and claims about the government’s team, including the conviction of Richard Trask, an FBI special agent who was arrested on a domestic violence charge and later fired and convicted of a misdemeanor. “Essentially, the evidence here demonstrates egregious overreaching by the government’s agents, and by the informants those agents handled,” defense attorneys wrote. ""When the government was faced with evidence showing that the defendants had no interest in a kidnapping plot, it refused to accept failure and continued to push its plan.” Five people are charged with kidnapping conspiracy and face a trial March 8 in Grand Rapids. They have pleaded not guilty and claim to be victims of entrapment. Federal prosecutors have argued the men were not entrapped. The government alleged the men were upset over coronavirus restrictions when they conspired to kidnap Whitmer, a Democrat, even scouting her second home in northern Michigan. Messages left Sunday with the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan and the U.S. Department of Justice weren’t immediately returned. In January, a sixth man, 26-year-old Ty Garbin, pleaded guilty and is serving a six-year federal prison sentence.",U.S./Associated Press,Whitmer kidnapping plot defense seeks to dismiss indictment,https://news.yahoo.com/whitmer-kidnapping-plot-defense-seeks-180136672.html
