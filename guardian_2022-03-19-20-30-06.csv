3/19/2022,"Allan Cockram is a former Tottenham Hotspur and Brentford footballer, but that doesn’t mean he’s rich. “If only!” says the 58-year-old from west London. “We got kicked up in the air on muddy pitches for the damn love of it.” When he was playing, footballers weren’t paid multimillion-pound salaries. Cockram always wanted to be a professional footballer and made his Tottenham debut in the old First Division (predecessor of the Premier League) against Watford in 1984. “It was almost gladiatorial,” says the former midfielder. “That excited nervous feeling when you’re in the tunnel, waiting to go out.” After leaving Spurs, he played for St Albans City and Brentford, then became a player-manager at Chertsey Town before hanging up his boots and retraining as a firefighter. A chance encounter with a friend’s son in the early 1990s changed his life. The boy had Down’s syndrome. “I was his friend,” says Cockram. “We played football together. We built a bond.” The boy died of complications relating to Down’s in the mid-1990s aged just 14. “I vowed that one day I would set up a football club for people with Down’s syndrome,” says Cockram. “Fast-forward 20 years, and I had the opportunity to do it.” He’ll never forget their first session in 2017. He had contacted DSActive, an organisation supporting sports initiatives for the Down’s syndrome community, and they put a notice in their newsletter. Cockram rented a community centre in west London and paid six months’ rent upfront, at £80 a week, out of his own pocket. About eight people turned up to that first session. Now, Brentford Penguins FC has 20 young people with Down’s syndrome, aged from four to 18. “We have some people who use hearing aids, are non-verbal, or can’t run, as well as kids who can take instruction and communicate verbally,” says Cockram. “We don’t turn anyone away. We are a family.” The club meets on Sunday mornings in Gunnersbury Park. The kids run drills and training exercises, before having a kick-about, with their parents on the opposing team. “We all train together for the first half an hour,” says Cockram, “and then split into groups. And then come back together again to kick lumps out of the parents, in a game.” For Cockram, running the Brentford Penguins does not feel like work. “Sunday mornings I’m like a little child,” he says. Watching the players progress in confidence and ability is a joy. “We had one kid who, during our first ever game, couldn’t take the noise,” says Cockram. “Now he’s singing and dancing.” After training, the players interview each other on how it went, like a mock post-match analysis. “They’re hilarious,” he says. “I’ll prompt them on certain questions. Say, ‘What did you think of the parents today?’ They’ll say, ‘Rubbish!’” More than anything, they are a community. “We all need to belong to something bigger than ourselves,” he says. “The smiles on their faces. That family environment. You see them flourish. The friendship they have for each other is crazy.” Brentford Penguins is as much for the parents as it is for the kids. “It’s given my son self-esteem, a social life, and outside interests,” says Samantha Schmidt, whose 12-year-old, Lucas, joined the Penguins in 2017. “It took him nearly two years before he properly joined in,” she says. “He would sit in the corner and not engage. Now he shouts out for Coach Al all the time.” The team go on trips to watch Brentford, who are in the Premier League for the first time this season and often donate tickets. Cockram often wonders what his friend’s son would think of the Penguins were he still around. “I think about him all the time,” he says. “But I know he is looking down at us saying, ‘Brilliant. Love it’.” When I ask Cockram what he’d like as his treat, he is in his living room. He casts around, and alights on a model Spitfire aeroplane. “I’d love to fly one of those!” He has been fascinated by the second world war since he was 14, when a football injury left him bedridden for a year. His grandmother would come and sit on the end of his bed, and tell him stories about the war. And so, one morning in February, the Fly a Spitfire at Biggin Hill company arranges for Cockram to fulfil his dream. Afterwards, I hear the euphoria in his voice. “It’s hard to explain,” he says. “The best thing to say is that it’s the closest to flying like a bird.” In the air, he thought about his uncles who’d died in the war: “You think about what those boys did. They were so young.” He was so moved by the flight that he wrote a poem about it. The pilot did a victory roll and let Cockram take the controls. He was able to take the Penguins’ coach, Big D, and their team captain, Charlie, along with him – and they went up in a support plane. “You should have seen them – it was fricking unbelievable!” Cockram says with a grin. “I am so happy.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

3/19/2022,"If you want to say thank you to – or remember – your mum, or someone who is like a mum to you, you may be considering buying flowers for Mother’s Day on 27 March. Or maybe you are trying to source the perfect blooms for a special occasion, or simply want to treat yourself. But where should you go, and which flowers should you pick, to get value for money? Which florists are offering the best discounts, and which are the most ethical and environmentally friendly? Most florists charge at least £2-£3 extra for delivery on Mother’s Day itself, as high demand for couriers pushes up the costs. Sometimes it can add £10 or more. So consider sending your mother flowers earlier in the week, when they should qualify for cheaper or even free delivery. As well as saving you money, this strategy gives you peace of mind because if there are any problems, you have time to contact your florist and organise a replacement. Another benefit, says Aron Gelbard, the chief executive of the online florist Bloom & Wild, is that if the flowers arrive midweek, they often look more spectacular on Mother’s Day itself. You may also be able to choose from a wider range and get better value for money if you order for delivery in advance, before the most popular bouquets sell out. For those keen to buy blooms when they are in season, at the moment Annabel Lamb recommends opting for classic British springtime flowers such as tulips, hyacinths, irises, scented narcissi and daffodils: “They are our British beauties.” Lamb and her family have been growing flowers in Lincolnshire for 40 years. Just over a year ago she decided to start selling the farm’s own produce directly to the public, and set up an online nationwide delivery service for her flowers called Love Delivered. All the flowers sold on it are grown in Britain, either at Lamb’s nurseries or those of a smaller British grower, and are hand-picked the same morning they are sent out. Cutting out intermediaries enables the family-run farm to keep its costs down. She has also taken steps to reduce the impact on the environment of growing flowers commercially in the UK: her nurseries are heated by biomass and irrigated with rainwater collected from gutters and stored in reservoirs. “It’s all ethically done. We have solar panels on our glasshouses and packing facilities to facilitate our electricity usage. All the packaging the flowers come in is fully recyclable – even the flower food wrapper is biodegradable.” Prices start at £12.99 for 60 daffodils or £25 for 32 tulips, while a more expensive Mother’s Day bouquet of 36 flowers – made up of eight roses, six hyacinths, 16 tulips and six ranunculus – costs £35. The cost of next-day, timed DPD courier delivery on a weekday is included in those prices but if you want delivery on Mother’s Day itself, expect to pay an extra £5. At the budget end of the spectrum, many of the big supermarkets, including Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury’s, are currently selling small bunches of UK-grown daffodils for only £1 a pop. These will often have been grown in Cornwall. Give it a few weeks and the UK’s tulip season will be in full swing in many locations. Instead of buying flowers from a nationwide company online, you may wish to use a local florist or grower. Many people will have a local florist they already use regularly or wish to support, although these may not always deliver to someone who lives some way away. A good website to try for locally grown British blooms is that of Flowers from the Farm, a membership association for cut flower growers in the UK. It has members from Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands, and its website lets you key in your town or postcode to find the nearest flower growers to you. We tried it out on a few locations and it suggested some great-looking growers including the London Flower Farmer in Walthamstow, east London, Clem’s Garden, a social enterprise based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and Flowers at Forty Hall Farm in Enfield, north London. With some of the UK growers, bear in mind that as it is still March, it may be a little early in the season for them, so you may have to try elsewhere for this coming Mother’s Day. Clare Cook runs the Flower Project, a small independent florist in Cambridge, and delivers all her flowers and house plants locally by bicycle. She says she often receives online and telephone orders from customers outside Cambridge who want to send flowers or plants to someone who lives in her delivery area. Prices start at £35 for a medium-sized seasonal bouquet of tulips, alstroemeria, narcissi and hyacinths, and she charges £3.75 for delivery. “Supporting an independent local business is really important, especially at the moment,” Cook says. “A lot of independent florists use other local businesses as well, so it creates that chain effect.” The money goes into the local economy and the local community of the person you are buying flowers for: “You’re not just supporting me, you’re supporting a whole ecosystem.” She thinks local florists also provide a more personal service: “I think you get a better selection and different varieties, and if you spoke to your local florist, you could probably get a bouquet that’s more custom-designed or special.” Cook tries to ensure her flowers are environmentally friendly by buying from local farmers and making deliveries by bicycle, and says a big advantage of using a local florist is that the person who makes up the bouquet is often the person who delivers the flowers to the recipient’s door. “You’re not going through a big courier like DPD. So if anything goes wrong, we know what’s happened.” Interflora is the best-known network of local florists (it works with about 900 in the UK and Ireland), although other players have muscled into this space – notably Floom, which launched in 2016. Cook says that if you place an order directly with the local florist, as opposed to using a brand such as Interflora, all the money goes to the florist.. If you want your flowers to be a surprise and are not sure when your chosen recipient will be home to accept delivery, consider sending “letterbox flowers”. With this option, a bouquet is posted – often via Royal Mail – in a long cardboard box that can typically fit easily through a letterbox. Bloom & Wild pioneered this method of delivery, and Gelbard says it offers particularly good value for money for consumers. “We are able to offer our best prices on letterbox bouquets. They cost a bit less to produce because we don’t have to hand-tie them in our studio, and their box and packaging costs are smaller.” Prices start at £22, including delivery, for 12 British tulips. In general, if you want to maximise value for money, it’s a good idea to opt for a multistemmed flower. “A multistemmed flower is going to have more heads on it, and then when they open, it really fills the vase,” says Dani Turner, a spokesperson for the online florists Bunches. She particularly recommends chrysanthemums and spray carnations, which are usually cheaper than roses and often last longer. Another tip is to look for a bouquet with a good range of different flowers and foliage, as this can also give a bouquet volume. Gelbard says: “Freesias stick out sideways and help create a sense of width.” One growth area is flower subscription services. Many florists offer these, although what you get and how much it costs varies greatly. Bloom & Wild offers a range of subscriptions you can buy for yourself or as a gift. For £70 you can get three bouquets delivered over the next three months (so £23.33 a bouquet). Freddie’s Flowers delivers regular boxes of blooms to people’s doors. The standard price is £25 a box, although you will find offers and codes online. Other firms doing subscriptions include the London florist Appleyard. Meanwhile, Interflora sells annual delivery passes. For £12 a year you get unlimited, free next-day delivery for a year. It’s often possible to get cashback when you make purchases from flower retailers at this time of year, and then use a discount code on top to reduce the price even further. At the time of writing, Santander and Lloyds current account holders could get up to 15% cashback on purchases made with their debit cards at Flying Flowers by activating this specific reward on their account. Prices at Flying Flowers start at £19.99 for a bouquet of 12 mixed alstroemeria, including delivery by post, and you can include free Lindor milk chocolates with the code FREECHOCS. Cashback websites also currently have some good offers available. Quidco was this week offering between 13.5% and 18% cashback at Eflorist, and between 11.25% and 20% cashback at Bloom & Wild, depending on what you order and the delivery date. TopCashback is offering all members 25% cashback at Bloom & Wild on Tuesday 22 March, and if you are new to the site, you can claim £10 cashback on top of that. To find a discount code, Google the name of the retailer you would like to buy from and the words “discount code” or “voucher code” to see what comes up. At the time of writing, there is a good selection of codes available on websites such as vouchercloud and VoucherCodes. Many of the big flower retailers Guardian Money spoke to have also provided discount codes for Guardian readers. The discount code Mum10 will give you a 10% discount at Love Delivered until 25 March, while Guardian20 will give you a 20% discount on most purchases at Bloom & Wild and Bunches. “If your flowers arrive in a sorrowful state, such as wilting or with browning petals or leaves, they are not of satisfactory quality and you should be entitled to a refund,” says the consumer organisation Which?. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at the body, says: “Take a photo of the flowers upon arrival, and grab a picture and description of the flowers from the retailer’s website as well if you can – as this evidence will be helpful when lodging your complaint.” If the flowers were a gift, speak to the person who sent them and let them know you think they have been let down by the retailer, he adds. It is likely the retailer will only discuss, rectify or refund an order with the person who made the purchase. Instead of buying flowers on Mother’s Day, why not get a gift that is more sustainable and will last longer? “I’ve always found it strange that we celebrate the important people in our lives by giving them cut flowers – dead flowers that might last a matter of days, leaving a puddle of browning water and a stained vase behind them,” Stephen Folwell says. His company, Muddy Trowel, works with British nurseries and growers to create plant kits that can be delivered in three to five working days. Each kit consists of seasonal flowers and plants, planted loosely in a pot, with a separate bag of soil for planting them properly in a pot outside so that they last until at least autumn. Prices start at £15 for a Japanese alpine cherry planted in a 23cm wide pot, plus £5 delivery. Alternatively, the website Plants4Presents has a wide range of house plants it promises it can deliver on Mother’s Day. Prices start at £22 for a colourful gerbera, and a pot and card are included. Delivery by DPD courier normally costs £6 – but on Mother’s Day this rises to £11. If you want an “almost unkillable” houseplant to send to someone by post, there is a good range for sale on the website of Patch, a plants and gardening firm, with prices starting at £12 for a snake plant. However, you must spend at least £25 to be able to check out, and delivery costs £5 on Mother’s Day. Bear in mind that a local florist is likely to sell plants, too, and should be able to provide advice on how to look after the plant and, for example, the size of pot it will need. “When you phone an independent shop, they can give you all their knowledge and expertise,” Cook says. All her plants are British-grown and bought locally in Cambridgeshire or Lincolnshire. “Plants are a nice gift to give because they can last indefinitely,” she says, “as long as they’re well looked-after”. When you look at which florists and delivery firms are rated the best by the likes of the ethical comparison website The Good Shopping Guide and the big-selling lifestyle magazines, there are some names that keep popping up. Arena Flowers is joint top (along with Prestige Flowers) of The Good Shopping Guide’s ethical rating table, and is also number one in BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine’s latest list of the best online flower delivery services. Arena Flowers claims to be “the UK’s most ethical florist” and was also recently named “best for socially-conscious shopping” by Good Housekeeping. In second and third place respectively on the Gardeners’ World list are Bunches and Bloom & Wild. The latter was named best flower delivery service by Good Housekeeping, while the publication named the former as best for next-day delivery, and Prestige Flowers as best for supporting charities.

3/19/2022,"Last year, I went a little mad for gladioli and filled my allotment with them. I would wander back through the park from a day’s digging with armloads of the blooms to take home. It felt so decadent to have such huge flowers to fill the house with. I planted one row in rich, velvety renaissance hues – deep purples (Black Sea and Espresso), plums (Plum Tart) and burnt peach (Indian Summer). And on the other side of the allotment, down the central path, a line of pure trash shades – pinks, oranges and yellows (Norma Jean, Prince of Orange, Pink Parrot and Bambino Candy Bar). Gladioli need to be picked early in the morning, cutting the spikes as soon as the first buds are colouring up to ensure the longest displays. Once in the vase, replace the water often and whip off any spent blooms towards the bottom of the spike as quickly as possible. The flower spike blooms from bottom to top and, if you don’t remove the spent lower ones, the ones above can give up and never bloom. With a little care you can get the whole spike to remain in good health for a week or two. Glads, much like dahlias, like the good life. They want full sun, in rich but free-draining soil in a spot sheltered from wind. If they are left in the shade or in poor soil, you risk not getting any blooms from them. And staking is also essential on nearly all except the dwarf varieties, as each flower spike can reach up to a metre tall and is heavy with it. If you are growing in pots, try the dwarf Gladiolus nanus ‘Charm’ (pictured below), which only grows to around 60cm and doesn’t need staking. Order your corms now (they are technically not bulbs, as they store their starchy nutrients in the stem itself rather than in fleshy leaves) and plant out in late April or early May. The corms need to be 15cm deep with 10cm between plants. If your soil is heavy, add grit to each planting hole. If you have some semi-rotted homemade compost, it won’t go amiss to top dress with this: it will help to lock in moisture and feed the bulbs a little as it breaks down. Glads flower roughly three months after planting. If you want them to return next year, you need to lift the corms in autumn once the foliage has died back. If it doesn’t say that the bulbs are pesticide-free, you can be assured they have been grown with chemicals, which is not good for the soil, rivers and wildlife where they came from (mostly the Netherlands) – and not good for yours either. Whereas Organic Bulbs and Natural Bulbs both offer organically grown corms at good prices, so please consider supporting them.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Time the planting right and you’ll have vases of blooming gladioli all summer long | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/19/time-the-planting-right-and-youll-have-blooming-gladioli-all-summer-long
3/19/2022,"John Richardson opens the final (fourth) volume of his magisterial biography of Pablo Picasso with the artist in more than usual disarray. The year is 1933 and, while his celebrity and his wealth are unassailable, Picasso’s marriage to the Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova has entered its bitter endgame. Meanwhile, his relationship with maîtresse-en-titre Marie-Thérèse Walter, tucked away in the country, is beginning to pall even before it has properly hit its stride. Waiting in the wings is Dora Maar, the surrealist photographer who will dominate Picasso’s life, mostly painfully, for the next eight years. Richardson shows himself as deft as ever at making connections between Picasso’s tumultuous private life and his art. The increasingly despised Olga appears in a series of nightmare images – as a hideously toothy horse, as a wonky ballerina straining to hold her arms above her head and, worst of all, as a disappointed bride whose veil is slipping off the end of her nose. Earth mother Marie-Thérèse, meanwhile, is transposed into what Richardson describes as “a kinky cluster of boxed vaginas, beehive breasts, and turdlike fingers”. Then there is glamorous Dora, depicted famously in The Weeping Woman with a green face, stringy hair and sausage fingers. As Richardson pithily puts it: “Picasso Picassified people.” It wasn’t only women who were fighting over Picasso. The surrealists, that group of Paris-based painters and writers who reached deep into the newly fashionable unconscious for inspiration, were eager to claim the most famous artist of the day for themselves. The figurative but distorted forms that Picasso was producing resonated powerfully with the dreamscapes that paid-up surrealists such as Salvador Dalí and André Breton were producing. While Picasso was not generally a joiner, he agreed to design the cover for the first issue of Minotaure, the influential magazine of the movement that was launched in 1933. The mythical figure of the minotaur – part-man, part-bull – functioned more personally as an alter ego for Picasso, representing all his lasciviousness, guilt and despair. His identification emerged out of a renewed relationship with his native Spain and its cult of the bullfight. With Franco in power, and the country at war with itself, it no longer felt possible for Picasso to maintain his previous position of studied political neutrality. In 1937 he embarked on Guernica, the massive painting that dramatised the apocalyptic destruction of a Basque village by the Nazi Luftwaffe. The tangle of mangled limbs, weeping women and dead children remains the single most powerful anti-war painting ever produced, and cemented Picasso’s status as the greatest artist of the 20th century. What has always made Richardson’s biographical work on Picasso so alive is the fact of his personal friendship with the artist. It is thrilling to read a narrative in which scholarly prose is regularly interrupted with the phrase “Picasso once told me … ” followed by an entirely fresh anecdote. Richardson died in 2019 at the age of 95 before finishing this book, and there are signs in the later chapters, completed by his research associates, of a slackening of pace. How lucky we are, though, that Richardson lived long enough to get this far, even if he departed leaving Picasso with three decades of life and art yet to live.  A Life of Picasso: The Minotaur Years 1933-43 by John Richardson is published by Jonathan Cape (£35). To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy at guardianbookshop.com.

3/19/2022,"Last week, we learned that Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – has temporarily changed its rules and will allow certain posts calling for violence to remain on its platforms. Users of Facebook and Instagram who live in countries close to Ukraine will be permitted to post calls for violence against Russian soldiers and even for the deaths of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko – though without specifics of location or method, the company stipulated. “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules, like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’. We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,” Meta said in a statement. Meta may be the biggest social media company to make changes to its operations, though it’s hardly the only one. You won’t find any Russian state-funded media videos on YouTube any longer, as Google, YouTube’s parent company, has blocked access to any channel that hosts those videos. TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, announced that it would block livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin passed a new law criminalizing what it considers to be “fake” news about its invasion of Ukraine. But Meta’s announcement, which has the company allowing more content rather than less, sets it apart from the others. In some ways, this brazen announcement is a welcome one, but not for its encouragement of violence. (The use of violence here is at bottom a moral question, though the right to armed resistance against a belligerent occupation is generally recognized under international law.) Meta’s statement is welcome because it clarifies something that many of us have already known for some time. When it comes to political speech, Facebook’s policies have never been applied evenly. Palestinians know this double standard better than most. Last May, when the Israeli government was seeking to forcibly uproot Palestinian families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, protests broke out on the streets of Jerusalem and on screens across the world. Facebook and Instagram were hardly neutral spaces for information-sharing during this period, and Facebook was definitely not on the side of the occupied in that situation. “Facebook has suppressed content posted by Palestinians and their supporters speaking out about human rights issues in Israel and Palestine,” Human Rights Watch wrote in a scathing report issued in October 2021. The suppressed speech that Human Rights Watch refers to was not even violent speech. Often, it was simply “reposts of content from mainstream news organizations” by Palestinians. “In one instance,” the report says, “Instagram removed a screenshot of headlines and photos from three New York Times opinion articles for which the Instagram user added commentary that urged Palestinians to ‘never concede’ their rights. The post did not transform the material in any way that could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence or hatred.” All in all, social media watchdog groups found more than 700 examples of content being deleted, hashtags being hidden, accounts being closed, archived content being deleted, and more. Facebook and Instagram, the report notes, accounted for 85% of those restrictions. Palestinians have become accustomed to fighting against this type of national erasure, though that doesn’t make it any less exhausting to confront. With its latest move, however, Facebook is not only acknowledging that it plays an important role in directing global politics, but is also now taking a very public position against foreign military occupation. This is an excellent development. Is Facebook now committing to transparency and to the principles of international law? Surely, we must hope so. Otherwise, the internet behemoth will come off merely as a corporate partisan of American and Western European positions rather than as a potential vehicle to uphold universally agreed-upon values. Therein lies the difference between Facebook’s Ukraine and Palestine stances. In other words, Facebook’s announcement could and should help us make the connections between besieged and occupied people everywhere and increase the desire to fight for them equally, and we should and will now be expecting Facebook to do the same. That’s why pointing out Facebook’s double standard between Ukraine and Palestine is about more than exposing a hypocritical past. It’s about raising the bar on everyone’s behavior. As such, it’s also the opposite of “whataboutism.” In case you’re not familiar with “whataboutism,” this is a term that refers to a rhetorical strategy of skillful deflection. Whataboutism aims to move the subject of conversation away from one party’s evil actions by pointing out the sins of another. Let’s say you are angry about what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Then, someone asks you, “but what about what the US is doing in Somalia?” Soon, the conversation is no longer about Russia and only about the United States. Whataboutism = deflect, distract, demobilize. Whataboutism has permeated so much of today’s discourse around Russia’s invasion, and often at Russia’s behest. Perhaps you saw that map circulating on social media the day Russia began its most recent invasion of Ukraine. The graphic, titled “Airstrikes in the last 48 Hours,” purported to show areas around the world that had recently been bombed by various powers on the same day of Russia’s incursion. The image, shared thousands of times on social media, was distributed by the Berlin-based media group Redfish in a classic example of whataboutism. (And, as it turns out, Redfish is sponsored by none other than the Kremlin.) In an article about this specific map, Vice quoted Idrees Ahmad, a lecturer in digital journalism at the University of Stirling, who explained that in cases of Whataboutism, “the hypocrisy being alluded to is often real, and can trigger righteous fury in the audience.” But people, Ahmad said, “are duped because the aim is not to generate greater sympathy for a different conflict but to deflect attention from the one at hand.” Facebook’s announcement of its newfound political bravery should awaken us to the fact that we need new terminologies that connect - rather than misdirect us from – the common human struggles for liberty that we see and experience around us. “And-also-ism” is my (admittedly poor) candidate for a term that captures this idea, but I recognize that there may be a simpler way around the issue. Come to think of it, how’s this for a word: Freedom. Freedom for Ukrainians. Freedom for Palestinians. Freedom from invasion. Freedom from occupation. Freedom for one. Freedom for all. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.

3/19/2022,"One of India’s best-known spiritual leaders is embarking on a 100-day motorbike journey from London to India to raise awareness of one of nature’s most undervalued resources. Sadhguru, or Jaggi Vasudev, is setting off on Monday on a 30,000km (18,600-mile) trip through Europe and the Middle East in an effort to “save soil”, meeting celebrities, environmentalists and influencers in dozens of countries along the way. The journey is part of his #SaveSoil campaign, which is calling on policymakers to make soil regeneration a priority. The UN has said a third of soil globally is degraded and more than 90% could become degraded by 2050. It can take 1,000 years to produce a few centimetres of soil, according to the UN’s campaign against desertification. “I’m not a scientist, I’m not an environmentalist. I belong to the land, not to the lab, but I know there’s a soil crisis so I’m talking to as many heads of state, politicians, leaders, top scientists and influencers [as possible],” said Sadhguru. The 64-year-old motorbike enthusiast and yoga guru, who counts Jane Goodall, Deepak Chopra and will.i.am among his supporters, will be joined by celebrities including the Colombian singer-songwriter Maluma, England rugby player Jonny Wilkinson and German footballer Michael Ballack at public events in cities including Amsterdam, Berlin, Geneva and Tel Aviv. In the run-up to the trip, he has been touring radio and TV studios, including The Daily Show in the US with Trevor Noah, ITV’s This Morning and Chris Evans’ radio breakfast show. “We’re using both motorcycles and music to connect with people so that 3.5 billion citizens understand that we must address this problem right now in order to make a significant turnaround within the next 10 to 15 years. It’s about turning the science into a social moment because otherwise, nothing changes,” he said. So far, 14 countries, including Barbados, Guyana and Dominica, have signed a memorandum of understanding to work collaboratively to secure soil health globally. Sadhguru hopes that more of the UN’s 193 member states will come on board as he bikes through Europe. But policy change cannot be too prescriptive, according to Sadhguru, so the #SaveSoil movement – backed by global agencies such as the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and World Food Programme – enables farmers to decide themselves how best to bring back more organic content into the soil. “Agriculture is a practical, economic and survival activity, which needs to be done judiciously according to the local conditions,” Sadhguru said. “So we’re not against fertilisers or pesticides – yes, those need to be controlled – but first we need laws, recommendations and incentives that enhance organic content in the soil, because soil is a living entity. “So much land is now ploughed or paved. But it’s not our property – it’s a legacy that’s come to us and we have a responsibility to pass it on to future generations as a living soil, not as inert sand.” Soil can be enriched by introducing cover crops and more vegetation or adding plant litter and animal waste. Increasing organic matter improves soil structure, aids water retention, reduces erosion and boosts biodiversity. A teaspoon of healthy soil contains more microbes than there are people on the planet. Healthier soils provide more nutritious food and more climate-resilient landscapes that are better able to cope with extreme weather events, such as floods. “We can’t address climate change without addressing soil health,” said Sadhguru. “Without citizens making a big statement, no government is going to make long-term investments, so from 21 March for 100 days, we want the whole world to talk about soil.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Indian spiritualist Sadhguru on 100-day motorbike mission to save soil,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/19/indian-mystic-sadhgurus-19000-mile-trip-to-save-soil-aoe
3/19/2022,"The star of the show here is the bechamel – in a blind taste test, you’d never guess it was vegan. What’s more, it’s incredibly versatile. Here, I use it as the base for a galette topped with caramelised onions; you can also use it to make lasagne or cannelloni and moussaka (next week, I’ll show you another way to use it). Experiment with the flavour profile by subbing the curry powder for different spices or fresh herbs (which you can blend straight in), but I’d recommend keeping the nutmeg in the mix, because it lends the sauce a lovely, sweet nuttiness. Prep 10 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 2-4 1 x ready-rolled puff pastry sheet, suitable for vegans (it usually comes in a 320g or 375g pack)2 medium onions, peeled and halved2½ tbsp maple syrup2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing¾ tsp mild or medium curry powder¼ tsp fine salt1 tbsp sesame seeds1 big pinch flaked salt10g dill leaves10g basil leaves1 tsp lemon juiceChipotle (or regular) chilli flakes, to serve For the curried bechamel300g silken tofu, very well drained40g white miso paste2 tbsp olive oil2 tsp dried onion granules1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped½ tsp mild or medium curry powderLots of freshly grated nutmeg (or ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg)¼ tsp fine saltFreshly ground black pepper (about 10 twists) Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Unroll the pastry on to a large, flat baking tray. Put all the ingredients for the bechamel in a blender and blitz until completely smooth. Very thinly slice the onion halves (use a mandoline, if you have one), then toss in a bowl with the maple syrup, olive oil, curry powder, fine salt and plenty of pepper and set aside. Spoon the bechamel on to the pastry, then spread it out leaving a 3cm rim all around the edges. Spread out the onions on top of the bechamel. Fold the rim of the pastry up and over the onions around the edges, then brush the exposed pastry with oil. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and flaked salt over the exposed pastry, pushing the seeds into the pastry so they stick. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the tray from the oven and turn down the temperature to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. The onions will at this stage have shrunk and clumped together a bit, so spread them out once again – this is to ensure they cook evenly. Drizzle with a little oil, return to the oven for 20-30 minutes, until the rim is puffed up and a deep, golden brown, then remove (keep an eye on it, just in case). Turn the grill to its highest setting, then grill the top of the galette for a minute or two, or until the onions take on some more colour. Keep a very close eye on things, though, because you don’t want to burn the pastry; you just want to char the onions a little (if you have one, use a blowtorch to char the onions instead, because that will give you more control). Set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the herbs with the lemon juice, a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt, arrange these over the top of the galette, sprinkle with chilli flakes and serve.
