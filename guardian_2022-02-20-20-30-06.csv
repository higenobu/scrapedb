2/20/2022,"At the heart of Patrick Wang’s cheeky indie comedy, split into a pair of two-hour films, is the Bread Factory, a community arts centre in the fictional Checkford (a proxy for Hudson, New York). The space houses a theatre, a newspaper and a makeshift town hall, as well as a bustling ensemble of lovably eccentric characters. Local leaders Dorothea (Tyne Daly) and Greta (Elisabeth Henry) tussle for funding with May Ray, a flashy but vapid performance artist duo. Part One is a manual for maintaining integrity as standards of art, journalism and personal ethics slip. It could exist comfortably as a standalone film, but it wouldn’t be as much fun without the weirder, more experimental Part Two, which revolves around a production of the Greek play Hecuba and features characters breaking out into surreal bursts of tap dance and song.

2/20/2022,"When Marian Keyes announced she had written a sequel to her 1997 smash hit novel, Rachel’s Holiday, social media went into overdrive. Rachel’s Holiday – which sold more than 1.5m copies and spawned generations of devotees to Keyes’s writing – was a cultural phenomenon, following protagonist Rachel Walsh as she struggled to come to terms with drug and alcohol addiction during a spell in a Dublin rehab clinic, the Cloisters. Again, Rachel picks up the story 20 years later, and Rachel is now an addiction counsellor at the clinic that once saved her. Where Rachel’s Holiday concluded with her estranged boyfriend, Luke Costello, declaring his love for her, here we learn that Rachel and Luke have now been acrimoniously divorced for six years, and have not spoken since. Rachel is dating Quin, “an adrenaline junkie, his particular poison being rock-climbing”, but in spite of his adoration of her, she is reluctant to commit fully. When Luke returns to Ireland for his mother’s funeral and he and Rachel meet up again, the truth about their failed relationship forces her to reposition the prism through which she had perceived the dissolution of their marriage.  Keyes, as ever, is dealing with a plethora of emotionally and psychologically knotty issues: as well as the driving narrative of addiction and recovery, Keyes tackles depression, sexual abuse, regret and grief. And yet typically she manages such a lightness of touch, effortlessly segueing from tragedy to comedy. There is chaos and humour in the life of the Walsh family, as when Rachel and her sisters prepare a “surprise” party for her mother’s 80th birthday. Rachel’s ageing mum – a highlight in a novel replete with beautifully well-rounded secondary characters – issues strict instructions: “Make them practise yelling, ‘SURPRISE!’… My sisters, but especially Imelda and Philomena, won’t want to, and some of the cousins are right bitches too, but tell them there’ll be no goody bag for them if they don’t.” Grief also runs through the novel – both Rachel’s own and that of her patients at the Cloisters – and it is here that Keyes’s skill at characterisation really shines: each patient is so vividly depicted that the chapters dealing with their therapy meetings are like exquisite short stories; the mother who’s lost a daughter, the teenager devastated by his alcoholic father, the abandoned son. But ultimately this is Rachel’s story, and as it unfolds, Keyes deftly draws parallels between her recovery and that of her patients, forcing her to reassess the progress she’s made and to confront painful truths about herself and her past. If there’s a core theme in Again, Rachel, it’s that of forgiveness: forgiveness of oneself for human failings. Forgiveness for loved ones who don’t always behave in ways we might wish. Forgiveness for the adversities – seemingly perverse in their cruelty – that life sometimes throws at us. Again, Rachel has all of Keyes’s trademark wit, humour and whip-smart dialogue, but it’s also a novel teeming with compassion and redemption.

2/20/2022,"“All ideas are good,” according to the great theatre teacher Jacques Lecoq. “The question is: will they work on stage?” This production is bursting with ideas, but they haven’t reached concrete expression in performance. Director Anthony Lau, designer Georgia Lowe and lighting designer Jack Knowles have taken Helen Edmundson’s celebrated 1992 ensemble-based adaptation of Tolstoy’s 1878 realist novel about families (happy and unhappy) and given it an early-20th-century Soviet theatre makeover. The stage is configured as a circus ring abutting a wall of doors (think Meyerhold; think Eisenstein before he moved on to film). Instead of a set, there are sculptural lighting effects (think Gordon Craig and/or Appia). This style is demanding. It sets the actors in sharp relief and demands incisive and imaginative direction.  The eight actors all perform creditably, but the direction is piecemeal. Too many scenes come across as if they are stuck in the early stages of rehearsal, not yet worked through. Edmundson’s structuring of the drama as a dialogue between Anna and the landowning, would-be family man Levin is poorly handled, made to feel slow and clumsy. Celebrations and dances are particularly raggedy (a movement director is credited, but it’s hard to believe they were employed). Adelle Leoncé’s Anna, in figure-hugging black satin dress, is the attention-holding emotional focus of the piece, achieving an impressive climax of despair and desolation in the second half. Nick Fletcher brings a simmering passion to the role of Anna’s wronged husband, Karenin, which is not counterbalanced by Chris Jenks’s Count Vronsky, more bashful schoolboy than dangerously dashing officer. As the “good girl” counterpoint to Anna’s “fallen woman”, Tara Tijani’s Kitty grows touchingly through girlishness to womanhood in her relation with Levin. In what is becoming a pattern at the Crucible, this is a studio-suited piece given a main-house razzmatazz that highlights its weaknesses, not its strengths. Anna Karenina is at the Crucible, Sheffield, until 26 February",Arts/Stage,Anna Karenina review – overthought and underdone,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/20/anna-karenina-crucible-sheffield-review
2/20/2022,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has failed to recognize that people with confirmed Covid infections, also known as “natural immunity,” have achieved some level of protection against subsequent infections and severe disease. This has unnecessarily fueled divisiveness, particularly when vaccines are mandated without acknowledgement that prior Covid is an alternate path, albeit with some limitations, for protection of the individual and helping to build the population’s immunity wall. While there has been a body of data supporting a robust immune response to Covid infections, that evidence has recently been substantially bolstered. In the very large trial on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine single shot compared with placebo, among over 2,000 participants with prior infections, as documented by positive antibody status, their protection against moderate or severe disease was 90%. That’s much higher than the vaccine efficacy of 56%, yet the CDC recognizes 2-shot of this vaccine as “fully vaccinated” but ignores these data, and many other proof points, of natural immunity protection.  A recent CDC report for Covid in California that included the Delta wave, the cumulative hospitalization rate for the vaccinated was 0.7% among vaccinated and 0.3% unvaccinated with prior infection. Notably, a 10-fold lower risk of subsequent infection was found in the people with natural immunity compared with those vaccinated in the Cleveland Clinic health system’s study of over 52,000 employees. These reports convey a high level of protection of natural immunity, at times comparable to 2-shot vaccines. Multiple studies following people at least 15 months out from Covid infections have shown persistent antibody levels and memory B cells. Reinfections among those with natural immunity throughout the pandemic, until the recent Omicron wave, have been very low, less than 1%. A United Kingdom study of about 9,000 people with prior infections demonstrated higher than 90% protection against subsequent infections, even among those who had Covid more than 18 months previously. If there is good protection from infections, then why is one-shot of a vaccine necessary and sufficient? A new report of nearly 150,000 people with Covid infections in Israel, with about half vaccinated, compared to the others left unvaccinated, there was an 82% lower risk of reinfection for people aged 16 to 64 years, and 60% for age 65 or older. There was no difference for the protection with more than 1-dose of vaccine. The same was found in another study. Both of these were performed during the Delta wave, but now we have data with Omicron, the strain of the virus with the most substantial evasion of our immune system. Substantiating that, In Qatar, while the protection of natural immunity was about 90% for previous Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants, it dropped to 56% for Omicron. In the United Kingdom, the risk of reinfection for people with prior Covid spiked to a level 16-fold what had been seen previously. Yet an Omicron wave study from Cleveland Clinic in about 8,000 people with natural immunity, 1-shot of vaccine markedly reduced the risk of infection and 2 or 3-shots had no incremental protective benefit. That same finding was consistent in the Israel and UK studies: 1-shot did the trick, no added protection from 2 or 3-shots. Indeed, the waning of protection after 1-year in the UK study was averted with one dose of vaccine. Past critique of natural immunity protection is still relevant. These studies have survivor bias—they only include people who survived their infections. We know that the symptoms of Long Covid can be reduced by vaccines, which is an important added feature of the controlled vaccine approach compared with the unpredictable chronic duration sequalae of an infection, which can be disabling, even when they are mild. Although about 90% of people with infections develop antibodies and memory B an T cells, that leaves some without an immune response, which appears to be more of an issue when a person did not have symptoms, or they were very mild. Since we do not assess antibody levels, especially those capable of neutralizing of the virus, and do not measure T cell responses, there is a blind spot in knowing about an individual’s level of protection, be it by infection or vaccination. Which brings us to hybrid immunity. It would be reckless to ever recommend someone get purposely infected with Covid. However, for those who have sustained an infection their immune response was directed to the whole virus whereas our vaccines are specific to the spike-protein. The result of combining the different immune responses is synergy, more than additive, a powerful and durable protection, 25 to 100 times more antibody response and broader against variants of the virus. It is now clearly overdue for the United States and the CDC to acknowledge natural immunity as a partial path to protection, as has been previously done in several countries. The term “fully vaccinated” needs to be redefined. For people who have received 2 mRNA vaccine shots, without prior infection, a third shot, booster, is needed to protect against symptomatic and severe disease. On the other hand, for people with natural immunity, with proof of a positive PCR test, one-shot is all that is necessary to be considered “fully vaccinated.” By providing immunity certification in this way, the polarization between natural and vaccine-induce immune camps will be bridged, at least to some extent. The evidence has become overwhelming and its adoption as policy will likely help get the low American vaccination rate of 64% , ranked worse than 60 countries in the world, to a much higher level, further building the immunity wall for the whole population. It’s also about sticking to the science when a large and ever-increasing body of data can no longer be ignored. One can fully understand why vaccine mandates would be repudiated when there was evidence of protection conferred by infection. Now, as the virus evolved, we are at a time when natural immunity alone is not sufficient, but with a single shot it’s as good as three. Eric Topol is the founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, professor of molecular medicine, and executive vice-president of Scripps Research",Opinion/Opinion,It’s time to consider natural immunity to Covid-19 as equal to one-shot of the vaccine | Eric Topol,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/its-time-to-consider-natural-immunity-to-covid-19-as-equal-to-one-shot-of-the-vaccine
2/20/2022,"Britain has frustrated its EU allies and weakened the west’s financial threat to the Kremlin by failing to close a loophole that will ensure London real estate remains a safe haven for Russian money, according to diplomatic sources in Brussels. New legislation, described as the “toughest ever” by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, gives the government powers to freeze the assets of individuals linked to the Russian state in the event of an invasion of Ukraine but fails to “capture” property owned via anonymous offshore structures.  The irritation in EU capitals at the perceived hole in the UK’s sanctions threat has only been exacerbated by Boris Johnson’s repeated calls in recent days for European governments to “wean” themselves off dependency on Russian gas. “Parading around preaching at your allies is all very well if you have sorted your own house out,” said one diplomatic source. “But they haven’t. You only need to look at the number of empty properties in Kensington and Chelsea to know that.” Truss had claimed that legislation laid in parliament on 10 February left the oligarchs with “nowhere to hide” as the UK is able to sanction entities and businesses of economic and strategic significance to the Russian government, as well as their owners, directors and trustees. But EU capitals are concerned by the failure of the government to ensure that the identity of those who own real estate is at hand in the event of sanctions being necessary. According to the NGO Transparency International, more than 85,000 properties in the UK are owned anonymously by entities registered abroad. The legal loophole in Europe’s punitive package has been the subject of discussions in recent days among diplomats coordinating Europe’s response to Russian aggression. It is understood these concerns have been conveyed to London. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment. On Sunday, Boris Johnson, speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, conceded that the City of London had a problem with Russian money but claimed that the government would be able to expose the true ownership of property through a register of beneficial ownership. Johnson told the BBC: “We are making sure that we open up the Russian doll of property ownership, of company ownership, in London and see who’s behind everything. And we’ve got to do it and we’ve got to hit very hard.” But such a database is yet to be established despite promises made by the government since 2016. Plans for an economic crime bill had been included in the 2019 Queen’s speech but the legislation is yet to materialise. Johnson conceded that the sanctions package “may not be enough on its own”, adding “it will be very damaging and very difficult”, but “it may not be enough to deter an irrational actor”. The west has sought to show a united front on the sanctions that would be imposed on Russia if Vladimir Putin does wage war in Ukraine, with warnings from the the US, the EU and the UK of “severe costs and massive consequences”. On Sunday, the European council president, Charles Michel, told the Munich security conference: “One thing is certain: if there is further military aggression, we will react with massive sanctions.” The UK has for a long time been a favoured hiding place for Russian oligarchs seeking to protect their wealth. Transparency International published a report last week which identified £1.5bn worth of property owned by Russians accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin. A report by the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee in 2018 concluded: “London’s role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlin-connected corruption risks signalling that the UK is not serious about confronting the full spectrum of President Putin’s offensive measures.”",News/Politics,UK ‘weakening threat to Kremlin by failing to close property loophole’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/20/uk-weakening-threat-to-kremlin-by-failing-to-close-property-loophole
2/20/2022,"Residents of a California county are mounting an aggressive campaign to oust officials who have supported Covid safety measures and vaccines, the latest example of a growing extremism in local politics fueled by the pandemic. A group in Nevada county, a rural expanse of about 100,000 people in the Sierra Nevada, is seeking to recall five county supervisors, saying that contact tracing efforts and the promotion of lockdowns and vaccines violate “religious freedoms and individual liberty”.  The effort comes on the heels of a successful recall campaign further north in Shasta county, where voters ousted Leonard Moty, a Republican supervisor and retired police chief. The Shasta county election, which followed nearly two years of threats and increasing hostility toward the longtime supervisor and his moderate colleagues, gave control of the board of supervisors to a group supported by local militia members. Both campaigns shared extreme rhetoric and in some cases aggression driven by discontent over Covid restrictions and rooted in a deep distrust of institutions. This antagonism has only accelerated during the pandemic, even in largely Democratic states like California. Experts warn angst over Covid rules, inflamed by social media, has become a gateway to extremism. Shasta county activists pitched their recall as a fight for “freedom” while the Nevada county recall campaign has accused supervisors of “promoting corruption” and enabling “crimes against humanity”. Nevada county officials have said the recall attempt is a “desperate effort” by a vocal minority who are pushing false and misleading information. “I did not enable ‘crimes against humanity’, I sought to protect citizens’ health in the face of a deadly virus,” Supervisor Dan Miller said in response to the filing. Experts say extreme language is becoming increasingly common in local politics and public meetings, even those that have historically been staid and orderly affairs. “We’ve seen an increase in threats against public officials and an increase in the climate of conflict,” said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, Long Beach. “Whether it’s supervisors or school board officials, we are now seeing an in-your-face brazenness with regard to personal interactions, but it’s also spread culturally.” In northern California, small groups with extreme beliefs have tapped into existing discontent over Covid restrictions, attracting residents who have long felt unheard or ignored by state officials, Levin said. “This kind of activity in northern California is a symptom and manifestation of how widespread and dispersed extremism can be and why it has particularly gained traction in rural areas,” Levin said. The last few years have been volatile, the Nevada county supervisor Sue Hoek said, with officials and staff subjected to personal threats amid growing anger over the pandemic. “We didn’t make Covid, but it’s our job to try to keep all of our community safe,” she said. Calvin Clark, a proponent of the recall, says the effort is a grassroots movement in which about 200 residents are involved. “This is simply the citizens asking for accountability from their elected representatives,” he said. The recall campaign in Nevada county has only just officially kicked off – organizers have 120 days to gather enough signatures to get the measure on the ballot – but the effort has already created tension. The county’s registrar of voters recently closed its office after maskless proponents of the recall “stormed” the office and pushed a worker, officials said. In December, the board of supervisors called for a recess amid a rowdy meeting in which recall supporters demanded the officials be removed from their posts. Clark said officials had falsely painted the recall as extremist, and that he and others were simply trying to have their grievances addressed. Invoking a talking point of the far right, he compared government Covid policies to living in Nazi Germany. “As they said in Germany, ‘Just get on the train.’ We’re not doing that. We’re not going to Auschwitz,” he told the Guardian. “It’s not about vaccines,” he said. “It’s about the liberty to choose how you’re going to live and if you’re going to give your rights to five elected representatives.” The Nevada county supervisors have had to call for recesses several times during the pandemic in order to de-escalate tense meetings, Hoek said. “It is one of our rights to speak up and have freedom of speech. I just wish sometimes we could do that a little more civilly,” she said. “I think we’re doing everything we can to keep things from escalating and let them be heard.” Disruptions and threats have been seen in public meetings across the country amid strife over pandemic health rules. A county commission in Oregon moved to virtual meetings last month due to anti-mask protesters. In Virginia, a parent was arrested after threatening to bring guns if officials didn’t make masks optional. “Distrust in government has permeated the most local levels,” Colin Clarke, a terrorism expert, told the Guardian earlier this month. “I’m familiar with the indicators of extremism and radicalization. I see them in places I never expected to see them. If you had told me as a terrorism expert I’d be talking about school boards, I’d have said you’re crazy.” Discord in rural politics has also been driven in part by pent-up anger from residents who feel they’re not getting a fair shake from the government, said Lisa Pruitt, an expert on rural law at University of California, Davis. That anger has trickled down from state leaders to local officials who people believe aren’t doing enough. The divisive state of American politics has only created more tension. “I can’t help but believe that had we not been in such a fractured political moment, the pandemic might not have become so political and people might not have responded in such emotionally charged ways,” Pruitt said. But that phenomenon can be seen across the US, she added. “I can’t see anything about this that seems unique to Nevada county,” Pruitt said. “We’re seeing uncivil behavior at public meetings and in public places. We’re seeing these really heated political clashes.” Regardless of the outcome, the use of extreme rhetoric in politics is cause for concern, Levin said. “People [might] dismiss it as hypercharged rhetoric,” he said. “Calling someone a traitor, talking about crimes against humanity, is part of the way individuals turn the spotlight away from their use of violence-glorifying rhetoric. People labeling their political opponents as traitors and criminals – we’ve seen what the results are in lesser republics than ours.” Despite the division in Nevada county, Hoek said she was proud of what officials had achieved amid the pandemic, from new housing to broadband projects, and is hopeful for the area’s future. “There are some challenges. Sometimes I go home and shake my head. But you know what, it doesn’t deter me from doing my job,” she said. “It’s worth it.”",News/US news,Extremists see opportunity as fury over Covid rules erupts in rural California,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/20/covid-restrictions-extremist-groups-local-politics-rural-california
2/20/2022,"A trio of bison has gathered around a fourth animal’s carcass, and Jimmy Doyle is worried. “I really hope we’re not on the brink of some disease outbreak,” said Doyle, who manages the Wolakota Buffalo Range here in a remote corner of south-western South Dakota in one of the country’s poorest counties. The living bison sidle away as Doyle inspects the carcass, which is little more than skin and bones after coyotes have scavenged it.  “If you don’t catch them immediately after they’ve died, it’s pretty hard to say what happened,” he said. So far, at least, the Wolakota herd has avoided outbreaks as it pursues its aim of becoming the largest Indigenous American-owned bison herd. In the two years since the Rosebud Sioux tribe started collecting the animals on the 28,000-acre range in the South Dakota hills, the herd has swelled to 750 bison. The tribe plans to reach its goal of 1,200 within the year. “I thought we had an aggressive timeline on it, but the thing’s gotten a lot of support,” said Clay Colombe, CEO of the Rosebud tribe’s economic development agency. “It’s been a snowball in a good way.” With their eyes on solving food shortages and financial shortfalls, restoring ecosystems and bringing back an important cultural component, dozens of indigenous tribes have been growing bison herds. Tribes manage at least 55 herds across 19 states, said Troy Heinert, executive director of the InterTribal Buffalo Council. The pandemic, which has hit tribes particularly hard, added to the urgency of bison restoration, said Heinert, who is also the minority leader in the South Dakota state senate. The first animal harvested by Wolakota helped feed homeless residents of the Rosebud Sioux reservation. “It did highlight the fact that many of our areas on tribal lands do have some kind of food insecurity,” he said. “When trucks stopped coming in, it was rural and reservation communities that got hit hardest. Our people don’t have the ability to travel long distances to find new food sources.” Although the words are used interchangeably, bison and buffalo are different animals. Bison – named the US’s national mammal in 2016 – are found in North America and Europe, while buffalo are native to Asia and Africa. “I used to be a stickler for calling them bison, but I’ve heard them called buffalo a lot around here,” said Doyle, who is also a wildlife biologist. “I feel like it rolls off the tongue more easily, and it’s just fun to say.” Millions of bison once roamed the US, but they were hunted nearly to extinction in the 19th century, partly to suppress Indigenous Americans as they were forced on to reservations. In many areas, bison were replaced by cattle, which overgrazed the western US and killed off native vegetation. Indigenous American leaders are hoping Congress will help tribes bring back the bison. The Indian Buffalo Management Act, modeled after a bill that provided federal help to fishing tribes, was passed by the House in December and is awaiting Senate approval. “For Indian tribes, the restoration of buffalo to tribal lands signifies much more than simply conservation of the national mammal,” said Ervin Carlson, president of the InterTribal Buffalo Council, at a House hearing last year. “Tribes enter buffalo restoration efforts to counteract the near extinction of buffalo that was analogous to the tragic history of American Indians in this country.” Not all the tribes that would benefit from the federal funds are in places where buffalo previously roamed. The Alutiiq tribe on Alaska’s Kodiak Island has been raising bison since 2017 to combat food insecurity. The tribe has nearly 90 animals – including three bulls from Yellowstone national park that were sent part of the way via a specially outfitted FedEx plane – and expects to reach at least 150 this year, said herd manager Melissa Berns. “People are excited to be able to harvest right in our own back yard,” she said. “It’s clean meat and we know exactly where it came from.” While food security is most often cited as the reason for the recent interest in bison, tribes also hope that returning bison to the land will restore ecological balance. At Wolakota, for instance, bison have been eating the yucca plants that became plentiful after native grasses disappeared, tearing them up by the roots and allowing grasses to return. The grass regeneration increases carbon capture. The bison also is tightly connected to the culture of Great Plains tribes such as the Sioux. The animals provided food, tools and shelter for indigenous people, and some tribes consider them to be family. “It’s a powerful feeling bringing our relatives home,” said TJ Heinert, Troy’s 27-year-old son who lives on the Wolakota range with his family and helps manage it. On a recent winter morning he was dressed in camouflage as he prepared to hunt coyotes as part of a tribal benefit for his mother, who is recovering from cancer surgery. “If our buffalo nation is healthy, we’re healthy,” he said. It takes a lot of work to keep that buffalo nation healthy. Doyle and TJ spend hours each day crawling over dirt roads that test the suspension on their trucks. “It’s bumpy out here,” Doyle said as he navigated his truck through rolling hills dotted with running coyotes. “It will really rattle your kidneys if you spend a full day bumping around.” Much of the past two years has included replacing 40 miles of fences to keep neighboring cattle ranchers happy. Another 40 miles will be replaced or added this year. In the winter, employees must constantly chop up frozen watering holes with axes to keep the animals hydrated. About once a year the bison need to be vaccinated against an array of diseases and the females checked for pregnancy. As with grass-fed cattle, the bison are herded from one pasture to another to prevent overgrazing. On a recent day, nearly all the animals were confined to a 2,000-acre pasture, except for a few “ornery” bulls that Doyle said had been reluctant to move with the rest of the herd and were left behind. “We’re trying to strike a balance of letting the buffalo express their natural behaviors, making sure they have plenty of room to roam,” Doyle said as he drove toward a group of about two dozen bison, “and being able to manage where they’re grazing so we can make sure we’re still improving the range health and habitat quality for other wildlife.” With millions of dollars donated to the project in the past two years, the Wolakota herd has grown quickly. That growth has been aided by donated animals from at least nine sources, most of them federal wildlife refuges and national parks. Doyle expected to bring in 60 additional bison from Montana in the coming days. “I think the rapid growth of this project is a sign of how much support there is for projects like this,” said Dennis Jorgensen, who coordinates the World Wildlife Federation’s bison initiative and has helped Wolakota get off the ground. “I really think there’s an energy among the American people to return bison to the native people.”",News/Environment,‘It’s a powerful feeling’: the Indigenous American tribe helping to bring back buffalo,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/20/its-a-powerful-feeling-the-indigenous-american-tribe-helping-to-bring-back-buffalo
2/20/2022,"What’s the story with the modern television sex scene? Are there too many of them? Or not enough? Are they overtly pornographic and shocking, or becoming so numerous they verge on monotonous? What about the actors who perform sex scenes: in the era of the post-#MeToo intimacy coordinator – this golden age of on-set respect and sensitivity – is TV sex feeling good for everyone? TV sex is nothing new (the still-legendary I, Claudius aired in 1976), but increasingly the small screen is all panting, writhing bacchanalia.  The leads in the BBC One show Cheaters barely complete their meet-cute before they are rutting in randy abandon. Elsewhere, just in recent memory, there have been sex scenes galore (couples, group sex, masturbation) in prestige programming. Euphoria. Normal People. Sex Education. It’s a Sin. Girls. Fleabag. The Great. I Hate Suzie. Industry … and a fair few lousy shows too. Meanwhile, streaming giant Netflix continues to live up to its “Sexflix” and “Netflix and chill” (youthful code for hook-up) reputation with series such as the spoofing uber-sexuality of The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window and the global hit Bridgerton, a period drama featuring a show-stopping performance of cunnilingus. But much as this is about a changing, more open and sexually charged world – and one affected by a pandemic – it is also about an evolving film and television landscape. The post-#MeToo era ushered in guidelines, moving towards a new protective climate where actors would no longer be at the mercy of capricious – and worse – producers and directors. Enter, the intimacy coordinators, with tools of their trade including nudity riders, modesty patches, nipple pasties and vajogas (a yoga mat used as a genital barrier when two bodies are grinding against each other). They work alongside directors to turn difficult scenes into a form of choreography. The intimacy coordinator also serves as an artist advocate, representing a crucial shift in the on-set power dynamic; the message being: just as with real-world sex, consent is all. Great, problem solved – right? Except that maybe there remain issues that are a little too complicated and deep-rooted to allow complacency to set in. What about gratuitous, boring, unnecessary sex scenes – those that exist purely to prop up a lame plot? What about the fact that generally younger, less established actors perform the most explicit sex scenes? For a while, reality shows such as Love Island featured pixelated “sex scenes” of contestants. Some of them were fine about it, but what about those who were not? While this was going on, all across the arts, working class people were finding it increasingly difficult to break in. One factor that cannot be ignored is the crossover of screen sex with the rise in consumption of online porn, particularly among young people. There have been many studies about the impact of porn on young brains. One such effect could be the expectation of something close to hardcore imagery from ordinary television. An instance of “porn-creep”, where not only has the porn glut normalised porn, it has also normalised the idea of explicit sex on mainstream television. Is that fair on actors who did not sign up to be quasi adult entertainment stars? Certainly, entitlement is out there, as is ugliness within the industry. Ruth Wilson is reported to have left The Affair after suffering extreme disrespect, including coercion to perform scenes she was not comfortable with. When Emilia Clarke spoke about dreading nudity in Game of Thrones, there was a public pushback, basically amounting to: you were paid, stop whingeing. As I thought at the time, it was almost as if Clarke was perceived as a buzzkill, splintering some fantasy of her unbridled joy at getting her kit off in front of millions. There was no acknowledgment that some actors – whatever their sex – are laid-back about doing sex scenes, while others, Keira Knightley among them, at times are not. This is part of the problem: the dearth of nuanced debate. Some of us remember Mary Whitehouse and her campaign against onscreen sex and are in no big hurry to join her. That said, you cannot speak even mildly critically about onscreen sex without setting off the prude klaxon. Personally, I find a lot of TV sex risibly gratuitous, and feel directors should be more creative. I still accept that the answer is not to replace the sex scene with clunking expositional dialogue along the lines of, “We’ve just had sex and how marvellous and life-affirming it was.” Sexual content can be meaningful. The funny, cartoonish stunt sex as seen in Sex Education can dispel fear and anxiety. I May Destroy You spoke powerfully about consent. In the This Is England series, actor Johnny Harris demonstrated how rape is not a sex scene, or a porn scene – it is purely about violence. In Girls, Lena Dunham’s nudity promoted body positivity. LGBTQ+ sex in shows such as It’s a Sin and the lesbian drama Tipping the Velvet can be groundbreaking and inclusive. All successful sex scenes perform specific functions in terms of plot development and characterisation. Normal People is an example of sex scenes building an emotional dimension, not because it is “posh TV”, but because it is beautifully crafted. One poignant aspect was how nice Connell was to Marianne during sex, sharply contrasting with the rise in real-life porn tropes of domination, violence and choking: a dark world where young women pretend to enjoy strangulation because it is “hot”. In this way, Normal People gave younger viewers valuable information about what sex can be – and what sex does not have to be. Another underrehearsed aspect of this debate concerns power and who has it? Recently, Sydney Sweeney, a big rising talent, spoke of turning down a nude Euphoria scene: with the cooperation of her director, she felt able to use her power. In therecent Disney+ series Pam & Tommy, Lily James, playing Pamela Anderson (brilliant, by the way), was furnished with assorted prosthetics, including a fake breastplate. She still had to enact graphic scenes but not (really) with her own body: she was, in effect, her own prosthesis-clad body double. Other actors ask for dimmed lighting, certain angles, or strategically arranged sheets. In the Sex and the City follow-up And Just Like That the character of Miranda has a riotous sex scene with her non-binary lover, Che. It is OTT, unintentionally hilarious: the fuss Miranda makes, you would think no one had touched her clitoris before. Tellingly, the scene is staged fully clothed, as befits an actor of Cynthia Nixon’s age and stature. All of which is great, but it does not magically erase the reality for other television TV actors. Those who continue to feel degraded and nerve-racked about sex scenes, but who, even in the enlightened post-#MeToo climate, find it difficult to refuse graphic material. Actors who are starting out. Who need the work. Who need the first break. Who want to appear to be a team player. Who ostensibly have “choice” but – hmm – not really. This is something to remember as we stand before the churning ethical tsunami that is 21st-century TV sex culture. If you have noticed a lot more sex, you are not imagining it, or a prude – it is happening, and while at times it is brilliant and valid, at other times, it is boring, unnecessary and potentially harmful. Moreover, let us remember that television is an artform with a remit wholly separate from pornography. No viewer is ever “entitled” to nudity or simulated sex. Furthermore, sadly, it may be naive to think that all actors consider themselves fully protected, or that intimacy coordinators will always be welcome on set or listened to. Such measures may be an industry figleaf for issues that are of continuing concern.

2/20/2022,"Uda looks like a much thicker vanilla pod but instead of micro-seeds inside the pod, there are pebble-like things. They are the length of my finger, usually; it depends where they’re harvested from. The ones that my grandma brings back from Nigeria in her suitcase are usually twice the size of my finger but the ones I get from the store are quite small. The taste of uda is very hard to describe – there’s nothing like it. It’s almost woody, then there’s a tiny bit of bitterness, but not overpowering. It’s kind of warm, like nutmeg or cinnamon. The key distinction is its musky smell.  Traditionally, I use it in suya and pepper soup, which is a kind of broth with goat meat and offal like tripe, or sometimes a fish broth. The whole point of the dish is that it’s really, really spicy, and then you have the woody taste from uda. It’s also amazing in place of vanilla; I make suya ice-cream. When you mix the uda pods with any form of dairy, it really seeps into it, so the taste is strong. You have to be careful how long you leave the uda in the custard for – if it’s too long it will taste more bitter. I use it in a scotch bonnet jam for my supper clubs. Obviously the scotch bonnet is really spicy but the uda gives a musky, calming scent. It takes dishes to a whole new level. It’s not a shy spice.

Moody weather, an unsteady electronic score and cute-but-creepy young Megan (Niamh Dornan) suggest we’re heading into horror territory. The increasingly desperate Laura (Riseborough) is bewitched by the 10-year-old, who reminds her of her own late child. Gregg crafts a spooky atmosphere charged with the supernatural. Riseborough’s intensity helps sell the idea of a possible otherworldly presence, but the script is less committed, faltering with a lacklustre ending.

2/20/2022,"When he was a teenager, Joe Woodhouse bred and showed whippets. His dogs won the junior category at Crufts and other big shows. On the way home to their farm in Cambridge, he and his mum would stop at pubs for some food. Woodhouse has been a vegetarian since he was 10 and, this being the 1990s, Woodhouse’s best hope was that the pub would serve mushroom stroganoff with wild rice. Woodhouse, a 35-year-old former chef who is now a food photographer and stylist, revisits that dish in his vivid, inspiring new cookbook, Your Daily Veg.  “It’s so nostalgic, but still a bloody great meal,” he writes. Woodhouse’s take on mushroom stroganoff, though, shows how far vegetarian cooking has come in the intervening decades. His version is lighter, more sophisticated, less gloopy. “Sort of reminiscent of the flavour,” says Woodhouse, over the phone, “but there’s a bit of chard in there and the old one would definitely have had a lot more cream.” Your Daily Veg is one of those cookbooks that you can tell will go into heavy rotation in your kitchen. Each chapter is given over to a different, common vegetable and how you can turn it into a satisfying, straightforward meal. “Get nice stuff, don’t do too much to it and make a nice dish – that’s the ethos,” Woodhouse says, with a chuckle. “My food is very healthy, but it’s also realistic and it’s not about shutting anything down: no fat, no cheese, no fun kind of thing.” When Woodhouse first became a vegetarian, his parents wondered if it might be a phase but 25 years on, he thinks he’s only scratched the surface of what you can do with vegetables. Your Daily Veg was a lockdown endeavour, and he proved the perfect one-man band for the project: he created the recipes (in his 20s, he was a chef at the Towpath cafe in east London) and then shot them in his kitchen. Woodhouse’s partner, the food writer Olia Hercules, was also working on a book, and they have a two-year-old son, so there was little lounging around. “When Wilfred was quite young I used to do little cooking demos with him,” recalls Woodhouse. “He’d be strapped to me and I’d talk him through it as if it was a cookery show.” The task of recipe testing in lockdown mainly fell to locals in Forest Gate, east London. “Our neighbours are pretty happy they are our neighbours,” says Woodhouse. “We would put up a picture on the street WhatsApp and say: ‘First come, first served!’ And it would go in this kind of bidding war. But to be fair we get loads of food back. One of our neighbours brings us amazing Bengali curries. And there’s cakes from across the road because they have a bakery. So it’s quite a nice back and forth.” The feedback Woodhouse had on his doorstep drop-offs was overwhelmingly positive, but what he really enjoys is when his food surprises people. “Sometimes people think, ‘It’s just vegetables,’ but they start eating it and it’s almost like they’ve forgotten they’re having a vegetarian meal,” he says. “I like it when the first reaction of someone is slightly unexpected: ‘Oh, this tastes really good!’” This dish reminds me of my childhood. I used to travel around a lot, dog-showing with my mother. It was a wonderful time, the weekends spent camping and barbecuing with pit-stop pub visits on the long journeys home. As a vegetarian, 20-odd years ago, I often found the pub mainstay was the mushroom stroganoff, if I was lucky, dusted with paprika and served alongside white rice flecked with wild rice. It’s so nostalgic, but still a bloody great meal. I’ve added chard to round it out a bit, but spinach works just as well. Feel free to add some wild rice to keep true to the 1990s. Serves 4neutral oil 4 tbsp (such as groundnut or sunflower)mixed mushrooms 750g (button, chestnut and portobello), whole, halved, quartered or sliced, depending on sizeonions 2, finely slicedgarlic 5 cloves, finely slicedpaprika 1 tsp (preferably sweet)cayenne ¼ tsp, or chilli powderwhite wine or cider 200mlrainbow chard 300g, leaves separated from stalks, stalks finely sliced, leaves roughly choppedstock 200mlcreme fraiche 200mllemon juice 3 tbsp, or more to tasteparsley 15g, finely chopped, or chervil (or both)sea salt and black pepperboiled rice to serve Heat half the oil in a deep pan large enough to accommodate everything. Fry the mushrooms over a medium heat for 5-7 minutes, turning once or twice, until a good golden brown colour. If they begin to stick, add a splash of water to keep everything moving. Once the mushrooms are coloured well, scoop out and reserve. Add the remaining oil followed by the onions and a good pinch of salt and cook for 12-15 minutes until translucent and soft. Follow with the garlic and give them a stir. Add the mushrooms back in, along with the paprika and cayenne or chilli powder. Stir to combine well in the pan. Add the wine or cider and allow the alcohol to bubble off for 30 seconds. Add the chard stalks along with the stock and cook for 5 minutes. Then add the creme fraiche and allow to bubble away for 2 minutes until slightly thickened. Add the chard leaves and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice with the chopped herbs. Check the seasoning and add more salt if needed. A good grind of black pepper is welcome. Serve spooned on top of rice. This is a fresh beans on toast, but the beans are livened up with sherry and the toast is oven-baked crisp bread. The crisp breads can be made ahead and stored in a sealed container. They go well with anything. Try breaking them to form croutons or use as scoops for dips. The beans take well to being topped with herbs or cheese, or eaten with just some bread and good-quality oil over the top. Serves 6neutral oil 2 tbsp (such as groundnut or sunflower)onions 2, roughly dicedcarrots 3, roughly dicedgarlic 5 cloves, roughly choppedplum tomatoes 2 × 400g tins, or 8 fresh tomatoes, roughly diceddried white beans 200g, soaked and cooked (cannellini, haricot and coco are good here), or 500g tinnedbest-quality sherry vinegar 3 tbsp, or to tasteextra-virgin olive oil for drizzlingsea salt and black pepper For the crisp breadsolive oil 6 tbsplarge baguette or slender loaf 1, finely sliced Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. For the crisp breads, drizzle some of the olive oil on several large, flat baking trays, or work in batches. Lay the bread slices, evenly spaced, in a single layer on the trays. Gently rub the slices with the rest of the oil and flip them over to lightly coat each side with oil (too much and they tend to be a bit greasy when cooked). Bake in the oven for 25 minutes until golden and crisp, turning halfway through. Some will inevitably cook faster and some slower. If working in batches, pull out the done ones and replace with freshly oiled slices, essentially having a production line on the go, while you are making the beans. Meanwhile, heat the neutral oil in a pan over a medium heat and sweat the onions, carrots and garlic with a pinch of salt for about 15 minutes until soft. Add the tomatoes, roughly breaking them up with a spatula. Half-fill each tin with water and add to the pan. Cook for 25 minutes until reduced but not too dry, topping up water as needed. Blend the contents of the pan in a blender until smooth, then return to the pan. Add the cooked beans, then gently cook together for a further 30 minutes or longer, adding water if needed: the consistency should be loose but still amalgamated. Season with salt and pepper, then add the sherry vinegar to taste: you want the sharp, sweet twang of the vinegar to be a solid backbone of the sauce. Serve drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil, the crisp breads cracked over the top. Spanish tortilla goes well with the beans. Also great with whole roasted portobello mushrooms on top. This garlic chilli crisp can and should go on everything and anything. Here, the sweet, creamy corn and potatoes act as a wonderful platform for the fiery, floral oil. The crisp can be used to dress noodles, fried eggs or steamed vegetables such as broccoli or greens, or stirred into egg-fried rice or crunchy veg salads. It’s worth having on hand to bring simple ingredients together into more of a meal. It will keep well in the refrigerator, sealed in a jar, for four weeks or so. Serves 4 as a light meal with a salad or as a starterfrozen sweetcorn 350g, or kernels from 4 earsunsalted butter 50gonion 1, finely dicedpotato 1 large (about 300g), such as king edward, maris piper, desiree or estima, cut into roughly 1cm cubesfull-fat milk 200mleggs 4sea salt For the garlic chilli crispneutral oil 250mlonions 1 large or 2 medium, finely dicedgarlic 1 head, cloves peeled and evenly slicedchilli flakes 3 tbspSichuan peppercorns 2 tbsp, crushedstar anise 5sea salt flakes 1 tbsphoney 1 tsp To make the garlic chilli crisp, add the oil, onion and garlic to a medium-sized saucepan and simmer for 20-30 minutes until golden but not too dark. You want to slowly drive the moisture from the onion and garlic; if you cook it too quickly they will burn. Just before the end, when the mix has slowed its bubbling and the garlic is nice and golden, add the chilli flakes, Sichuan peppercorns and star anise. Give a good turn around and remove from the heat. Mix in the salt and honey. Set aside until ready to use. Set aside 100g of sweetcorn. Pulse the remaining kernels in a food processor five or six times until broken but not pureed. A hand blender is also fine, or roughly chop them with a knife. Add the butter to a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Follow with the onion when the butter begins to foam. Stir around the pan for 10-12 minutes until translucent. Add the potato and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring so nothing sticks. If the mixture gets a little dry, add a splash of water to keep things moving. Add the pulsed corn and milk. Cook over a medium heat for 1 minute, then reduce to a low heat, stirring often, for about 3 minutes until the mixture slightly thickens. Add the reserved kernels and cook for a further 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Season with salt to your taste. Place the eggs in a medium-sized saucepan filled with cold water and cover with the lid. Heat over a medium heat until gently simmering. Remove from the heat and leave to sit in the water for 2 minutes. Drain the eggs and return to the pan. Shake it to break the shells, then fill with cold water, empty and refill with cold water. Let sit for a while until the eggs are cool enough to handle. Remove the shells and halve each egg. Add the corn to a plate and top with 2 egg halves. Spoon over as much garlic chilli crisp as you like. The beautiful golden crust on top with crispy cabbage edges hides a creamy, cheesy, mustard-spiked sauce below. The cabbage goes wonderfully with the chestnuts and makes this a great wintertime dish. The richness is kept in check by the acidity from the mustard and this, combined with the wine, makes for a rather alpine-style eating experience. It is important with this recipe to use good-quality wine as it shines through in the finished dish; a dry or oxidative white wine is best. Serves 4savoy cabbage 1 (about 800g), trimmed of any tough leaves and the dry base, cut through the stem into 8 wedgesolive oil 2 tbspunsalted butter 50gonions 4 (about 600g), roughly dicedgarlic 4 cloves, roughly choppedgood-quality white wine or sherry 100mlcreme fraiche 200gdijon mustard 1 tbspvegetarian cheese 100g, grated (non-vegetarians can try gruyère or comté)cooked chestnuts 200g, roughly broken upsea salt and black pepper Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Place the cabbage wedges on a roasting tray, drizzle with the oil and season with salt. Roast in the oven for about 45 minutes until tender and the edges are beginning to colour. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan with a lid over a medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and salt. Cook, covered, for 15-20 minutes until soft but without colour, checking occasionally and giving everything a good stir. Add the wine or sherry and allow to bubble off, stirring, for 2 minutes. Put the mixture in a blender and add the creme fraiche, mustard and half the cheese. Blend until smooth, check the seasoning and adjust accordingly. Spoon some of this sauce on to a suitable dish for the gratin. Add the cabbage wedges, cut-side down, in one layer. Scatter over the chestnut pieces. Coat everything well with the rest of the sauce. Finish with the remaining cheese. Bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes until the sauce is bubbling and slightly thickened. Heat the grill to a high heat. Grill for a final 5-10 minutes to get the top lovely and golden. Crack over black pepper and serve with a salad, to drag around in the gratin juices. This pie is a thing of beauty. Layering the cheese means you get molten pockets, which gives a strong taste set against the platform of the potatoes and onions. Do use a strong cheddar if you can. And eat it warm; you want it cooled just enough to taste everything but still warm enough that things are still in motion. The apple sauce is a lovely fruity foil. I use whatever variety I have to hand, but go for sharp-flavoured cooking apples if you want something to really cut through the cheese. A good braeburn or russet is also most welcome. Go for cider over water to add a further dimension.

Add the vinegar and water. Pulse a couple of times, tip the mix out onto a clean work surface and knead gently to combine. Place the dough in a bowl, cover and chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Place a baking tray in the oven to heat through. Grease a round 24cm or 20-30cm square pie dish. For the filling, heat the butter and bay leaf in a pan over a medium heat, add the onions and cook for 10-12 minutes until well softened. Add about 125ml water, and continue to cook until it has evaporated. Add the potatoes and cook for 1-2 minutes, turning them around to coat well with the onions. Remove from the heat, discard the bay leaf and stir in the mustard. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry to about 5mm thick and line the base of the pie dish, leaving some overhanging. Roll out the rest of the pastry to form the lid, a little larger than the pie dish. Over the base, lay out a third of the potatoes as flat as possible. Follow with a third of the cheese. Repeat twice. Brush the edges of the pastry with a little of the egg wash and lay the pastry lid on top. Press the two pieces together to seal. Trim the edge to neaten if necessary. Brush with more egg wash and pierce the lid a few times. Place the pie on the heated baking tray and bake in the oven for 40-50 minutes until golden. Meanwhile, in a lidded pan, cook the apples with the water or cider over medium heat for a couple of minutes until the apples are collapsing. Purée with a stick blender until as smooth you like. Remove the pie from the oven and allow to stand for 20-30 minutes. Try to avoid cutting it too soon. Serve with a mustardy salad. I was introduced to this dish by my friend, wonderful chef Paola Carosella. It has such vibrancy to it. Paola originally made it as a soup, but I lean towards a more stew-like consistency. If you prefer a soupier version, add more water accordingly. The longer this sits, the deeper the flavours will develop – so happily make it ahead of time.

Add a splash of water if they go too dry. Crush the garlic under the heel of your knife and throw it into the pan as is. Grate the ginger directly into the pan using a fine or medium grater (or finely chop and add to the pan). Add the spices. Sauté for a further 2 minutes until the onions have fully softened. Add the tomatoes along with water from half-filling the tins and rinsing them out, then cook for 10 minutes. Add the sweet potato chunks and gently simmer for 20–30 minutes or until they are tender when poked with a knife. Keep topping up the water if needed. Check the seasoning when they are done. Cook the quinoa in salted boiling water for 15 minutes. Usually I cook and drain quinoa ahead of time, refreshing it in cold water to stop the cooking process. When the stew is ready, stir in the cooked quinoa to warm through. Add a touch of water, if necessary. In suitable bowls, add the diced mozzarella or stringy cheese, if using, then spoon over the sweet potato stew. Sprinkle on chilli slices and coriander leaves – fresh and punchy is the idea here, so don’t hold back on the garnish. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.

2/20/2022,"Some years everything happens at once. In 1998, the photographer Ewen Spencer started taking shots of nightclubs for the Shoreditch-based style magazine Sleazenation around the same time that he became a father. For the next three years, Spencer would spend each weekend racing between clubs with his Mamiya 6 rangefinder camera and then get back home to Brighton to look after his son, Kuba, on Monday morning. Two decades later, during the first pandemic lockdown, Kuba was helping his dad rescue a digital archive from a deteriorating hard drive when he became fascinated by the club pictures. “His eyes upon it made me realise the significance of it,” says Spencer. “He said to me, ‘When were you doing this?’ and I said, ‘While you were sleeping.’” This became the title of the digital folder and, now, a handsome book. In magazines such as Mixmag and Ministry, club photography was primarily an advertisement for club culture, bright and glamorous, but Spencer came at it from a different angle. He had recently graduated from Brighton School of Art, where his lecturers included the documentary photographers Mark Power and Paul Reas. He was also inspired by Wolfgang Tillmans, who began his career photographing Berlin nightlife. “I saw someone who was capturing his experience in 360,” Spencer says. “It was a new approach to a documentarian’s body of work: very personal, very subjective. This was a world that I understood: music and style coming together in a little room somewhere. I just applied my passion and love for that school of photography to my other passion and love, which was the northern soul scene.”  Spencer, who had fallen in love with northern soul as a teenager in Newcastle, took those photographs to Sleazenation’s photographic director, Steve Lazarides, and became a regular contributor. Lazarides’s preference for black-and-white photography enhances the anthropological tenor of Spencer’s pictures. “It was less about clubbing per se and more about being young and British and what that meant,” he says. “We’ve always been very good at enjoying ourselves.” Avoiding the glossy superclubs that dominated late 90s nightlife, Spencer sought out niche events in small venues, where he was invariably the only photographer in the place. Being a participant as well as an observer helped him to win the confidence of his subjects. “I’m photographing something I understand,” he says. “I wasn’t creeping around in a trenchcoat and hat; I was part of it.” Spencer’s personal passion for the nascent UK garage scene led to a book, short films and a collaboration with Mike Skinner of the Streets, but he covered everything, weaving between distinct subcultures: hip-hop, funk, trance, rock. “Nu-metal was unbearable to listen to but I liked them as a group of kids,” he says. With only 12 exposures on each roll of film, Spencer had to choose wisely. “You don’t want to waste a moment. I would look for characters who resonated and work around those people. Sometimes I can’t put my finger on it. I’m just drawn.” His subjects aren’t podium peacocks, craving attention, but people lost in music or conversation. Some of them aren’t even dancing. One of his favourite shots captures a couple kissing beside an extremely glamour-free bank of plug sockets at Sonic Mook Experiment in Shoreditch, east London. “We’ve all been there, haven’t we? And if we haven’t, then we should have been. I love that embrace. It’s awkward but it’s real.” In her preface to While You Were Sleeping, the photographer and film director Elaine Constantine (a fellow northern soul aficionado) mourns “a spirit of a freedom we have forgotten… a moment in time that has irretrievably passed”. Spencer doesn’t wholly agree – when he visits a club now, people are still having a whale of a time. But he says that something has changed – and it’s not just the demise of smoking on dancefloors. Smartphones have made clubbers, like everyone else, accustomed to taking photographs and being photographed. When it is expected that a great night should be documented and shared online rather than confined to a moment and a memory, a degree of self-conscious performance enters the equation. “Everyone’s more visually literate now because everyone’s got a camera in their pocket all the time,” Spencer says. “Some people go out with almost the sole intention of photographing themselves and being seen. The thing I was doing for Sleazenation 22 years ago, people are doing on their social media accounts now.” Spencer’s pictures represent a less inhibited era. Even the extroverts – a man spinning on one arm at Deep Funk, a kid seizing the open mic at WKD, a shirtless dancer at Queer Nation – seem unaware of the camera, forging their own physical relationship with the music. This era is far less mythologised than the renegade heyday of acid-house clubs and open-air raves a decade earlier but through Spencer’s curious lens, these look like glory days.

2/20/2022,"He was the Russian genius who founded the celebrated Ballets Russes in Paris in the early 20th century and whose revolutionary influence on the world of dance and theatre design is still felt today. But, despite his extraordinary talents, Sergei Diaghilev resorted to underhand and even vicious tactics to ensure that the spotlight remained firmly focused on him, according to new research. Professor Lynn Garafola, an American dance historian, discovered a previously unpublished text in which Bronislava Nijinska, the dancer and one of the most innovative choreographers of the 20th century, wrote of Diaghilev’s attempts to claim credit for the work of fellow artists – even blocking their employment elsewhere.  Nijinska, whose brother was the celebrated dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, had joined the Ballets Russes in 1909. She wrote: “[Diaghilev] victimised the ballet artists when they left his company and tried by all means possible to prevent their employment by other companies... he hindered their receiving an entry visa to England.” She added: “Everything had to originate with Diaghilev. He considered himself the creator and the ruler of the Russian Ballet, and all had to submit to him. “To create one’s own and to destroy somebody else’s – this was his principle. But such a principle seemed to me not only dangerous but also unworthy of a great man.” She continued: “Diaghilev was beside himself when the new company of Ida Rubinstein was organised. [He] conceived a hatred for us and vowed to destroy us … This great man regarded as a mortal enemy anyone who … encroached on ‘his’ art: I personally was subjected to cruel reprisal: Diaghilev criticised me maliciously and impeded my work in every way.” Nijinska, who died in 1972 aged 81, had trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St Petersburg and joined the Mariinsky Theatre company in 1908. She danced with the Ballets Russes, like her brother, and choreographed several ballets for the company, including Les Noces, which was described by the writer HG Wells as “the soul itself of the Russian people in sound and vision”. Sir Frederick Ashton regarded her as one of the greatest influences in his career as a choreographer, once saying: “Her achievements have proved to me time and again that, through the medium of classical ballet, any emotion may be expressed. She might be called the architect of dancing, building her work brick by brick into the amazing structures that result in masterpieces like Les Noces.” Garafola, professor emerita of dance at Barnard College, Columbia University, has now written Nijinska’s first biography. Titled La Nijinska: Choreographer of the Modern, it will be published by Oxford University Press in February in the US and in June in the UK. She said that, when Nijinska tried to set up her own company in Britain in 1925, Diaghilev indirectly informed the Home Office that her dancers did not have the correct visas. Five of those dancers had to leave within 48 hours under the Aliens Order of 1920, according to research in an unpublished MA thesis to which Garafola had access. She spoke of being the first to draw on Nijinska’s writings, including “very rich” diaries, letters and notes, among newly available documents held in the Library of Congress in Washington. She said: “There’s quite a bit about Diaghilev. She was always trying to please him but she also felt that he wanted to claim everything as his own. She had already been choreographing for a number of years in Russia, but he didn’t want her talking to the press. He wanted to present her new work as though this were Diaghilev’s. There were times when he hurt her professionally. When she decided to leave the company, he went out of his way to ruin her first independent effort. She had a small company in England. She had a number of young men she’d trained. They were now part of the Diaghilev company. They were on vacation and were to appear in her company. But he pulled strings in order to alert the Home Office and make sure that they didn’t have the correct visas.” But she was clearly conflicted over Diaghilev. In a draft note to an unnamed correspondent, following his death in 1929, she wrote: “[He] knew me entirely and idolised me in art – and he created me (without intending to – because I was a woman, after all).” Garafola said: “Her diaries… allow one to track from the inside her obsession with creativity, her self-doubts, her triumphs, and her most intimate thoughts about love and, especially, her obsession with the opera singer [Feodor] Chaliapin.” It was unrequited love. Chaliapin made it clear that he had no interest in any romantic involvement although she never doubted – at least in these diaries – that she owed the inspiration for her creative achievement to Chaliapin. Garafola added: “Once she began working for the Ida Rubinstein company in 1928, her craving for Chaliapin’s physical presence intensified. As opening night approaches, all she can think about is Chaliapin and whether he will be in the audience. He isn’t. He misses all of the season’s performances, denying her the pleasure of hearing how much he admires her art. “She sees him day and night in her dreams. They are ‘full of caresses’, she writes, and she wakes up happy. It doesn’t really matter, she adds, if this ‘happiness’ is real or not: ‘I was with you’.”",Arts/Stage,Diaghilev and me: Ballets Russes star’s diaries reveal how the maestro was also a monster,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/20/diaghilev-and-me-ballets-russes-stars-diaries-reveal-how-the-maestro-was-also-a-monster
