4/28/2022,"The selling pressure in tech stocks amid slowing growth and rising interest rates is so brutal that an end has to be in sight, according to one tech analyst. ""Our conversations with institutional investors is clearly very negative [on Big tech stocks],"" Piper Sandler tech analyst Brent Bracelin said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Folks continue to be very concerned around increasing global risk. That said, my personal view is, it feels like we're kind of nearing peak bear sentiment."" Tech carnage is anywhere one looks right now. All members of the closely watched FAAMG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google) complex, as well as Tesla and Netflix, are down more than 10% year to date. Tesla has dropped 18% in April alone as drama around CEO Elon Musk buying Twitter unfolds, and Netflix is down a whopping 68% year to date following a lackluster first quarter and weak subscriber guidance. Alphabet didn't help its cause on Tuesday evening, posting a rare earnings miss on a shortfall for YouTube sales. The stock, among the most active tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform, also fell 3.75% in Wednesday's session. A rare bright spot in tech this week is Microsoft as shares rose 4.8% on Wednesday after an earnings beat. Nevertheless, the company's stock has shed 15.8% so far this year. Fintechs haven't been spared either, as Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports. PayPal is hovering around a 52-week low, and Robinhood's stock continues to suck wind as it struggles with execution issues (including laying off 9% of its workforce). Overall, the Nasdaq Composite has shed 20% so far in 2022 — on Tuesday, the Nasdaq notched its worst session since September 2020 — and the S&P has declined 12% year to date. Bracelin says sentiment is so negative on Big Tech that the point may be nearing where it makes sense to buy. ""Everyone is universally bearish,"" Bracelin said. ""Typically when you have all investors on one side of the boat, that is typically when the boat flips. There is probably more risk for the next two quarters around slight changes to the numbers, factoring in these increasing global risks. But from a sentiment perspective, it's hard to see how things can get more bearish from here."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

4/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook’s main social network added more users than projected in the first quarter, potentially staving off concerns that the company is losing momentum as a new generation flocks to younger sites like TikTok. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Russia to Cut Gas to Poland and Bulgaria, Making Energy a Weapon Russia to Cut Gas to Poland, Bulgaria Until Pay Demands Met Amazon’s Twitch Seeks to Revamp Creator Pay With Focus on Profit Hwang’s Spectacular Collapse Culminates in Criminal Charges Shares surged more than 19% in late trading after Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. reported 1.96 billion daily users for its flagship platform, a return to growth after the first-ever decline in the December quarter. Analysts had estimated 1.94 billion. Revenue for the period jumped 6.6% to $27.9 billion, and would have been higher if not for the war in Ukraine, the company said. The stock had dropped almost 50% this year as investors became increasingly worried that Meta’s main business and profit engine -- advertising in its social media feeds -- was losing steam. Those concerns appear to have been put to rest -- at least for now -- given Facebook added 31 million new daily active users in the recent quarter. Still, many of Meta’s challenges remain. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that video-sharing app TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., is providing serious competition for young users’ attention. At the same time, changes to data-collection rules on Apple Inc.’s iPhones have hindered Meta’s ability to serve users targeted ads. Last quarter, Meta executives said the privacy changes would reduce the company’s 2022 sales by $10 billion. Advertisers have also been spending less due to issues with supply chains, inflation and the ongoing war in Ukraine, Meta executives said. A prolonged slowdown would make it tougher for the company to justify Zuckerberg’s expensive, virtual-reality-fueled vision of the metaverse, a business that won’t bring in profit for years -- if ever. On an analyst call Wednesday, Zuckerberg reiterated that it will be years before Meta’s Reality Labs unit, which is building AR and VR technology, will contribute meaningfully to its business. Meanwhile, the company has said it’s spending billions and hiring thousands of workers to develop the platform, which Zuckerberg sees as the next major computing shift, into a fully immersive digital environment where users will interact virtually while they work, shop and play games. Shares of Menlo Park, California-based Meta climbed as high as $210.14 in extended trading following the report. They had slipped 3.3% to $174.95 at Wednesday’s close in New York. Read more: What’s the metaverse? Who’s in it? Why does it matter? Net income in the first quarter was $7.47 billion, or $2.72 a share. Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.56 per share. Sales in the current period will be $28 billion to $30 billion, Meta said Wednesday in a statement, compared with the $30.7 billion analysts had predicted on average. Again, the company pointed to the ongoing war in Ukraine as a factor. “This outlook reflects a continuation of the trends impacting revenue growth in the first quarter, including softness in the back half of the first quarter that coincided with the war in Ukraine,” the company said in the statement. Meta said that in light of the revenue outlook, it is paring overall spending plans for the year, to $87 billion to $92 billion from a previous target of as much as $95 billion. On the call with analysts, Zuckerberg said Meta plans to launch its new virtual reality headset, code-named Project Cambria, later this year. The headset is meant to be used for work purposes as a replacement for a laptop, he added. The company shocked investors in February when it said daily users for its core Facebook service declined slightly in the fourth quarter for the first time ever, raising the possibility that the main social network had peaked in popularity. The stock tumbled 26% the next day, underscoring the concerns that people -- especially teenagers and young adults -- were defecting to newer platforms like TikTok, and that advertisers would follow. In October, Zuckerberg had said that Facebook would focus on attracting “young people” to the service as a way to combat the rise of TikTok and other competing products. That meant prioritizing Reels, a TikTok copycat video format on Meta-owned Instagram and Facebook. While usage of Reels is growing quickly, the company’s advertisers haven’t been as fast to switch to the new format. On Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on the call that making significant money from Reels will be “a multiyear journey” similar to the company’s efforts to make money from disappearing Stories. Reels already makes up more than 20% of the time that people spend on Instagram, Zuckerberg said. The company doesn’t give metrics for total time spent on Instagram or on its other apps, which include WhatsApp and Messenger.

4/28/2022,"Warren Buffett is sitting pretty on Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) — up 91% this year. As investors grapple with a frustrating trading environment this year, one veteran portfolio manager has a unique perspective on why Buffett is piling into the oil company. Buffett first dipped his toes in OXY in 2019, when he bought $10 billion in preferred shares — paying a fat, 8% dividend — along with warrants to buy 84 million shares. Buffett maintains the position to this day, but stayed away from its common stock for years. That is, until he read the earnings transcript from the Occidental's February 25 earnings call. ""W]e know exactly what hit [Buffett] like a ton of bricks,"" Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, said at a recent Yahoo Finance Plus webinar. It was CEO Vicki Hollub, who thoroughly impressed Buffett, leading the Oracle of Omaha to later say in an interview she was ""running the company the right way."" Buffett promptly went on a buying spree, scooping up 136.4 million shares worth $7.7 billion — 14.6% of the company. (The position is Berkshire's eighth largest.) Thanks to surging oil prices, Occidental is generating piles of cash — $2.9 billion of free cash flow in the last quarter, noted Smead. ""[A]at the time that [Buffett] started buying [Occidental stock], maybe they had a market cap of what — maybe $40 to $45 billion — where annually, it means they're generating 25% of their market cap at that time [in] free cash flow,"" he said. Occidental is returning much of that capital to its shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends — quite the turnaround from its 2020 low when it had plunged 93% from its 2011 record high of $117.89. Flush with cash, OXY is also paying down its sizable debt load — much of which was raised to finance its $55 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. The company reported long-term debt of $29.4 billion as of year-end 2021. But this elevated liabilities load may have been a selling point, as being ""short"" bonds has been one of the best trades of 2022. ""If anybody likes to think about the hedge fund world, the perfect trade on January 1 of this year was to be short long-term bonds,"" Smead said. ""And what was OXY on January 1? Short bonds that they'd sold to buy Anadarko long oil."" Smead then divined the Oracle's thought process as he was reading that Occidental earnings transcript in February. ""Buffett is looking at this and going — wait a second — a company that used to not have great returns on equity is about to go through great returns on equity in a way that he never could have envisioned."" Smead also sees the potential for Berkshire to fully acquire Occidental — which at its current market capitalization of $52 billion — would be Buffett's largest purchase ever. ""I'd say there's maybe a one in four or one in three chance,"" Smead said, ""which is a very good chance."" Jared Blikre is a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance Live.
