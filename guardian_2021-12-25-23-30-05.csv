12/25/2021,"On New Year’s Day the UK will have been fully out of the European Union for a year: out of its political and legal structures, out of its single market, out of its customs union. This was what Boris Johnson and Michael Gove – who led the Leave campaign – had wanted. No awkward halfway house like Theresa May had negotiated. No Brexit light. Out completely. Gone. Brexit well and truly done.  It was only with a clean break, they told us, that the UK could unleash its full potential, and wrestle free from the chains of EU regulation and bureaucracy. Liberated, we could take back control of our borders, our money, our laws. We could look outwards to the world in a new age of discovery, striking trade deals far away from the EU, creating fresh levels of prosperity for Global Britain. So a year on, how is it all going? The resignation last weekend of Lord Frost, the minister overseeing Brexit, gave a clue that all was not entirely well. “Brexit is now secure … the challenge for the government now is to deliver on the opportunities it gives us. You know my concerns about the current direction of travel,” Frost told the prime minister in his resignation letter. There are suggestions from some in government that Frost – a Brexit purist and fanatical deregulator – came to suspect Johnson had no real plan, no real detailed idea of how to make Brexit work beyond slogans and soundbites. He was also frustrated at the deadlock over Northern Ireland. A year into Brexit proper the UK is still at loggerheads with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol that Frost and Johnson themselves negotiated and hailed as a good way to solve difficult border problems, as part of the withdrawal agreement. Whatever issues were riling Frost the most, delivering on Brexit promises is proving a lot harder than making them had been. What is clear is that, initially at least, Brexit is making us poorer. It has contributed to labour shortages in many business sectors as EU workers have returned home. There are grievances that run deep in specific sectors that were promised much and got almost nothing. Fishermen feel betrayed. Farmers are uncertain that a replacement subsidy and payments regime will be all it is being cracked up to be. Small businesses which export to the EU have been hit by extra costs and paperwork. The extent of economic damage from Brexit has been made clear by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which predicts that leaving the EU will reduce our long-term GDP by around 4%, compared to a fall of around 1.5% that will be caused by the pandemic. Rather than boosting our trade, Brexit is holding it back. Goods exports were down 14% year on year in the third quarter of 2021 according to the Office for National Statistics, with both exports to the EU and non-EU destinations suffering. According to the Food and Drink Federation, UK exports of food and drink are down £2.7bn (-15.9%) in the first three quarters of 2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This is largely due to a drop in sales to the EU of £2.4bn (-23.7%) resulting from new barriers to trade with the EU and the ongoing effects of the Covid pandemic. And this is before new rules on imports from the EU will be implemented in January, which business leaders say will lead to further falls and delays. Then food products from the EU will face extra physical inspections from the summer. Disentangling precisely what has been caused by the pandemic and what is the result of Brexit is difficult. For Johnson the coincidence of Covid and Brexit has proved convenient in one sense, shielding him from blame and obscuring the picture. But economists broadly agree that the long term economic hit from Brexit will be far greater than from the pandemic. Another central promise of the Leave campaign was that the UK would take back control of its borders. But in a year of tragic loss of lives in the Channel, and unseemly arguments between the French and the UK over who is to blame, that claim has looked utterly hollow. Refugees living in northern France have said Brexit has made it easier and more attractive for them to reach the UK in small boats, not less. Refugees who have fled conflict zones including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Eritrea have told journalists that the fact that the UK is no longer part of the EU makes it more worthwhile risking the dangerous crossings because they could no longer be sent back to other European countries. Asked how Brexit has gone so far, Charles Grant, director of the thinktank the Centre for European Reform says that, ironically, the most obvious post-Brexit negotiating successes for the Johnson government have been in areas where it has managed to stay close to the EU, not move away – such as the “rolling over” of EU trade deals. These have included agreements “rolled over” with Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey and South Korea which have become bilateral ones with the UK. The only entirely new trade deal is that recently signed with Australia. The UK, he says, has also managed to secure agreement over flow of data with the EU, though this could soon be under threat as we seek to weaken privacy rules. In other areas, Grant says the UK has been weakened, particularly in its influence and power on the European and world stages. “Lord Frost refused to have any form of structured relationship on foreign and defence policy post-Brexit with the EU – though the EU wanted one – and we are paying a very heavy price as a result,” he says. “We lack intelligence about what is happening in the EU because we don’t have any regular system of meetings with people in Brussels. We can’t influence what is going on because we are not in the room. On issues such as Russia, China and climate issues the British – even outside the EU – could have a degree of influence because we have good people and real expertise.” Joël Reland, researcher at the independent thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, has worked on a “divergence tracker” which has looked at the extent to which the UK has succeeded in breaking free and replacing EU rules with its own, as Johnson promised. What he has found is a lack of divergence in many areas and an absence of a plan.“The main message is that the UK has been talking a big game on divergence. Frost has spoken repeatedly about the long dark years of EU membership and the need for change to free up growth and innovation but it has just not been followed through. If you look at the most significant policy changes in the budget or the net zero strategy there is very little that could not have been done inside the EU.” Reland says that in agriculture, city regulation, and areas such as green taxation and fintech, new ideas and progress on divergence are evident but in big areas such VAT little or nothing has happened. “There is no joined up thinking on divergence strategy across government,” he says. The reason he says is that while replacing all EU regulation sounds neat, in practice it is complex and costly for business. “I think the UK is finding that it is really difficult to develop and there is more bureaucracy rather than less once you try to change everything,” he says. “The cost of getting all UK companies stamped with a UK mark rather than an EU mark … it is not worth the cost.” Our latest Opinium poll shows that over 60% of people now think Brexit has either gone badly or worse than they expected. It also found that 42% of people who voted Leave in 2016 had a negative view of how Brexit had turned out so far Getting Brexit done was the easy bit. Proving it was worth it and for the good, is turning out to be far more difficult.",News/Politics,Brexit one year on: so how’s it going?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/25/brexit-one-year-on-so-hows-it-going
12/25/2021,"The lost episode of the Morecambe and Wise Show screened this Christmas dates from 1970, just as the comedy duo had made it to BBC One. They would go on to be Britain’s most popular entertainment act, with their Christmas special seven years later drawing over 20 million viewers – by some estimates an extraordinary 28 million. Of course, that was in the days of only three TV channels, and no internet or smartphones. The viewing figures this time round will be considerably smaller. But what of the comedy itself? How will it have aged?  Coincidentally, the day before the news broke of the rediscovered episode, the veteran actor Maureen Lipman claimed that comedy was on the brink of being wiped out as a result of “cancel culture”. “It’s in the balance,” she said, “whether we’re ever going to be funny again.” Leaving aside the question of whether Lipman herself was ever funny pre-cancel culture, do Morecambe and Wise fit her contention that “all the things that are being cancelled … are the things that have always made people laugh”? It’s hard to imagine Morecambe and Wise offending anyone, though we should never underestimate the forensic commitment of the most intrepid seekers of offence. Although they were at their height in an era in which crass racist and homophobic stereotypes and jokes were commonplace on TV in programmes such as Love Thy Neighbour and The Comedians, the duo’s comedy was at no one’s expense so much as their own. What it most evokes now, perhaps more than laughter, is an almost touching sense of innocence. The episode that is being screened this Christmas is the first in which they were filmed together in a double bed. That two middle-aged men in pyjamas shared a bed without any resort to double entendres or, indeed, explanation was a conceit that seemed bizarrely natural. According to his son, Eric Morecambe was reluctant to introduce the bed scene but was persuaded when he was reminded that his comedy heroes Laurel and Hardy used the same setting. The comedic links between Laurel and Hardy and Morecambe and Wise are not hard to see, in terms of slapstick and wilful misunderstandings, though it’s the sense of enduring friendship that is perhaps their joint comedy legacy. It’s about a relationship put to an unceasing, yet not unaffectionate, test of teasing, and from it springs a world of gentle absurdity that everyone can – or at least once could – recognise. In a different but related way, another highly productive partnership from that period was recently placed in the spotlight to fascinating effect. The year before the Morecambe and Wise episode was shot, the Beatles met to record, and film the recording of, an album that would become Let It Be. Because the album and resulting film were not released until after the band had split, they have long been known for the acrimony that led to the break-up. But in Get Back, Peter Jackson’s three-part eight-hour re-editing of the original film tapes made by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, we can see that the relationship between the band members, and in particular the lead songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney, was still drawing on substantial stores of mutual respect, understanding and fondness. It’s an amazing film in many respects, not least because of the insight it gives into the creation of music that would become timeless. You can’t quite believe there was a time when McCartney didn’t know what the lyrics were to the song Get Back, or that George Harrison was struggling to work out what words should come after “Something in the way she moves, attracts me like …” You feel like shouting the answer back through time. What is most affecting, though, is to witness the often non-verbal communication between Lennon and McCartney, a realm of creativity inaccessible to the rest of the world, including Harrison, who had grown into a songwriter to rival his bandmates. The way they laugh at each other, mess around with songs, then are gripped by moments of shared enthusiasm is magical to behold. It speaks of the bottomless possibilities when two people “get” each other, the sense of the very future opening up before your eyes, but also of the countless experiences from the past that went into forming that understanding. There is also, amid the banter and playfulness, an encroaching awareness of the final curtain being drawn. You can hear it in McCartney’s instant-classic ballads The Long and Winding Road and Let It Be – that knowledge that even the best of times come to an end. Or as Harrison put it in his debut solo album made up of his songs that Lennon and McCartney had rejected: All Things Must Pass. The Beatles lasted 10 years, Morecambe and Wise 43 years, concluding only with Morecambe’s death in 1984. How long they will last in the public imagination is anyone’s guess, although it’s undoubtedly true that music has a far longer shelf-life than comedy. But in both cases, what’s worth bearing in mind, particularly at a time of the year when we focus on family and community, are the love and joy that informed those partnerships, even in periods of tension. As Dawn French said last week, talking of her jealousy when her comedy partner Jennifer Saunders enjoyed huge success with Absolutely Fabulous: “When you love somebody as much as I love Jennifer, the glee and the happiness and the pride overshadows any other stuff in the long run.” Cue Morecambe and Wise dancing off into the brand new bright tomorrow to the strains of Bring Me Sunshine.",Arts/Television & radio,Bring me sunshine: ‘new’ Morecambe and Wise Show episode brings Christmas cheer,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/25/bring-me-sunshine-new-morecambe-and-wise-show-episode-brings-christmas-cheer
12/25/2021,"Daniel Boffey Brussels Bureau Chief  When Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, gave her lengthy “state of the union” speech last September, there were mentions aplenty of the EU’s vital relationships with Turkey, the western Balkans and Africa. The continent’s security and economic prosperity depended on nurturing and deepening ties with its neighbourhood, explained Von der Leyen, a former student at the London School of Economics. Britain did not register in the hour-long speech. Not a word was said of the UK, the recently exited EU member state and the sixth-largest world economy. Now, read back Liz Truss’s, admittedly short, back catalogue of speeches as foreign secretary. A visitor from Mars might assume that the UK is an Indo-Pacific power. Europe barely gets a mention and if it does it is described in terms of being historical baggage. The year 2021 has been marked by a remarkable level of petulance in the UK-EU relationship. The unfortunate reality is that 2022 doesn’t offer much hope of redemption. France will hold the rolling presidency of the EU for the first six months, during which Emmanuel Macron will have an election campaign to fight and win against the centre and far-right. Boris Johnson is on his uppers, with a large and vocal wing of the Conservative party frothing over Covid restrictions and a lack of Brexit dividend. It is quite hard to imagine a less favourable context for relations to be patched up and mature conversations to be had. And yet the spats must be buried, the difficult compromises simply have to be found. To give just one joint challenge as an example, the most immediate military and diplomatic threat to British interests on the global stage remains Russia, whose government has thought nothing of murdering people on UK soil. The Kremlin is building up a fighting force of more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, whose army and navy has been the beneficiary of British training and support. British and EU interests are as one on this. The UK did not want to include a foreign and security cooperation aspect to the Brexit deal it signed last Christmas Eve. After almost five years of being lectured at, and with the bloc being far from nimble in this area, this was perhaps understandable. The UK holds many of the cards, given the strength of its intelligence agencies and investment in its military. The government instead sought to focus on bilateral relations, particularly with France, with whom it has close military ties through the 2010 Lancaster House treaties. But the lesson of this year must surely be that relations with France, or indeed Germany, cannot be dealt with in isolation from the wider relationship with the EU. Downing Street has been seeking a summit between Johnson and Macron for months, where it had hoped to build on past agreements, but has been stonewalled by the Élysée Palace, irritated by the British approach to its treaties with the EU and its constant bad-mouthing of the project, whether over the vaccine rollout or the challenges of illegal migration. New German chancellor Olaf Scholz attended his first EU summit just a week ago, but it is yet to be seen whether a date with the British prime minister is even in the diary. Britain might not want to be part of the European union, but the EU exists. Ignoring one other might be an option but it isn’t a smart one. Phillip Inman Economics Editor Britain’s economy heads into the new year weighed down by a decline in trade and falling business and consumer confidence. Exports were 14% below their 2018 average level in the third quarter of 2021, and there are many economists who doubt sales of UK products abroad will return to 2018 levels until 2024. UK car manufacturing output declined by more than a quarter in November as the combined shocks of Brexit and the after effects of the Delta variant forced factory owners, struggling with job vacancies and component shortages, to cut production. December, marred as it is by the Omicron variant, is not expected to provide a lift to an industry that exports 80% of what it makes. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, says: “Exporters have lost market share, due to the woefully inadequate EU trade deal,” adding that the uncertainty over trading relationships with the EU and other countries, “will continue to deter firms from making Britain their export base.” On the domestic front, high street sales have failed to hit their usual Christmas peaks and most events, indoor and outdoor, have reported declining visitors. The Bank of England, worried about the effect of inflation, became the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the pandemic started when it increased the base rate earlier this month. While the 0.15 percentage point nudge to 0.25% is unlikely to tip many businesses or households into bankruptcy, it came at a time when official figures showed levels of corporate insolvencies already hitting pre-pandemic levels. Insolvency experts have predicted a threefold increase in bankruptcies across the UK in 2022 and probably more if interest rates rise by more than the expected 0.5 percentage points by December next year. The BoE’s GDP growth forecast of 5% next year is beginning to look vulnerable to a downgrade, especially if the government fails to restrict the spread of the Omicron variant and consumer confidence falls further. Rishi Sunak has avoided providing a further stimulus to the economy after the closure of the furlough scheme after warnings about a rise in unemployment proved unfounded, notwithstanding a £1bn boost for the hospitality and leisure industries to support them during the crisis However, it has become clear that high levels of inflation will be sustained well into 2022, damaging households’ real disposable income and putting pressure on the chancelor to provide more support, especially for low-income families. In April, disposable incomes will probably be hit again by a near 40% to 50% rise in Ofgem’s energy price cap, which will push average inflation above 6%. At a deeper level, the Office for National Statistics revised data for business investment last week. It showed the money spent upgrading plant, machinery and IT fell by 2.5% in the third quarter to leave private-sector investment 11.7% below that seen in the fourth quarter of 2019. Taking note of the collapse in funds devoted to capital spending, the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, said it could be partly laid at the door of Brexit, which had cost the UK 4% of its GDP, or around £80bn. The UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, based at Kings College London, said Brexit had left a permanent scar on the UK economy, damaging investment and trade, to the extent that it cost 6% of GDP. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at Oxford Economics, said that the outlook for the economy would be determined by the way the government reacted to Omicron after a sharp slowdown in growth over the last five to six months. “The extent to which this hangover carries on into the first three months of 2022 will be determined by what we learn about the new variant of the virus, and the way in which the government responds,” he said. James Tapper If any areas were to see the sunlit uplands of Brexit, the most likely were surely farming and fishing. These two industries were being hamstrung by EU rules which government ministers could not change, Leave campaigners had claimed. Yet both have taken serious hits since last January, and there is deep anger and a sense of betrayal. “It’s been an abject failure,” said Jane Sandell, the chief executive of UK Fisheries, which owns Britain’s largest trawler, the Kirkella. It makes up the UK’s distant waters fleet, operating in Arctic waters and providing about 12% of the cod cooked in British chippies. “The only conclusion is that they just don’t care about the distant water sector.” Fishing is governed by international quota agreements to prevent fish stocks being destroyed by overfishing. Quotas are negotiated each December by Norway, Iceland, the Faroes, Greenland and the EU and in 2016 the fisheries’ minister, George Eustice, said British fishing was being harmed because the UK was denied a seat at the table. When UK officials took up that seat in December last year they failed, according to Sandell. “There was no deal with Norway. They just gave up,” she said. “They decided there wasn’t a deal to be done.” Since December 2020, the Kirkella has been moored in Hull. “It’s been devastating for our crews.” Jacob Rees Mogg’s “British fish” have mostly been Norwegian. Last week, the UK did reach a deal with Norway and the EU. “They’ve done a deal, but it’s not a good deal,” Sandell said. “The arctic cod [quota] is a derisory amount. We would normally have about 10,000 tonnes – there’s 500.” The government said UK vessels could catch 7,000 tonnes of arctic cod, an increase of 1,500 on last year – a statement Sandell said was misleading because it was half the normal amount. “We’ll be operating at 50% capacity next year. In the new year, we’re going to have to sit down and seriously think about the way ahead.” The Kirkella may be moved abroad. Not all crew are worse off – those catching mackerel and other pelagic fish have seen an increase in the amount they can catch. But, overall, the fishing fleet will be £300m worse off by 2026, according to the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations. At the start of the year, many vessels had been unable to land catches in European ports due to new export rules, but those issues had been resolved, according to NFFO chief executive Barrie Deas. The deal signed with the EU meant that UK fishermen could only catch 12,000 tonnes of non-quota fish in European waters, while their counterparts could take 40,000 tonnes. “It really reflects the imbalance that was in the Common Fisheries Policy,” he said. Farmers are less directly involved in EU trade but there is clear discontent about the outcome of Brexit. Farming is a significant part of the North Shropshire constituency, a Leave-dominated area that swung dramatically to the Lib Dems in a by-election earlier this month. The National Farmers’ Union said that total agri-food exports so far this year were down by 16% compared to 2019. Although the pandemic created trade problems, exports to the EU were down by 22% to £7.2bn, but only by 2% in the rest of the world to £4bn. Pig farmers have been hit by shortages of abattoir workers, while fruit and vegetable growers have not been able to find people to pick crops. Livestock farmers have benefited from higher prices caused by extra demand during the pandemic last year – beef is up about 15%. Nick Adams, an organic beef and sheep farmer in Derbyshire, helped campaign for Leave and remains convinced it was the right decision. “The prediction was that we would lose our main export market to Europe, but that hasn’t happened,” he said. As an organic farmer, he relies less on fertiliser, which has risen in cost, and does not need a large labour force. “I do appreciate other sectors have found it incredibly difficult, but relying on cheap labour needed to be changed and would have had to change anyway.” Michael Savage Policy Editor Brexit has forced Northern Irish businesses to deal with new barriers, while the delicate political balances in the region have been strained. Yet close observers warn that the combination of Northern Ireland elections next year and the potential for a Tory leadership challenge mean further pitfalls await for the region in the months ahead. Months of negotiations with the European Union over the workings of the protocol governing the special treatment of Northern Ireland after Brexit have seen both sides give ground. However, the talks have also resulted in last week’s resignation of Lord Frost, the government’s chief negotiator, and provoked growing agitation from the Democratic Unionist party. Several figures said that negotiations that should be about technical fixes to the trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Britain were already being used politically – and those tensions would only increase as May’s elections to Northern Ireland’s assembly in Stormont approached. Business figures in Northern Ireland said that some of the early teething troubles with the new arrangements had dissipated and their impact was now split. Some companies continue to be hit by the new checks taking place in the Irish Sea, but others are booming – exports to Ireland have increased 63% over the last year. While difficulties remain, Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said the vast majority of his members were “protocol pragmatists” who wanted to make existing arrangements work. He also questioned the UK government’s previous insistence that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) be removed from oversight of the protocol – something Frost had demanded before his resignation. “I haven’t had a single conversation from 2016 to today with a business that is concerned about ECJ oversight,” said Kelly. “It is purely a political issue. The things that we’ve been asking for begin with stability, and there’s no doubt about it that we have an unstable political environment here. But business is getting on with it as best it can. Where you have prosperity, you have peace.” Political tensions are rising, however. The DUP are already reported to be planning to pressure Liz Truss, the foreign secretary now in charge of negotiations, to suspend part of the protocol. That would provoke some kind of reaction from Brussels. The UK had been softening its demands before Frost’s resignation, but there are fears that Truss’s leadership ambitions could tempt her to woo the support of Tory Brexiters with more sabre rattling. “At the beginning of the year, there was a hope that because we had the [overall UK-EU Brexit] agreement, because we had the protocol, there could have been the possibility of bedding down and just dealing with it,” said Katy Hayward, professor of political sociology at Queen’s University Belfast and senior fellow in the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. “We end the year in a very different situation, with the DUP threatening to pull out of power sharing. Coming into this next assembly election by May next year, the protocol can be seen genuinely as a campaigning issue.”",News/Politics,A year after Brexit: how have four key areas fared?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/25/a-year-after-brexit-how-have-four-key-areas-fared

A spokesperson said: “Following an extensive investigation, Raymond Wesley Reese has been charged with first-degree murder. Reese is currently being transported to the Palm Beach sheriffs office for processing.” Investigators have not detailed the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Emergency services tried to save Trost’s life on the property driveway, but she died before she could reach hospital. “When officers arrived, they discovered a vehicle with one female occupant in the driver’s seat suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Despite immediate medical treatment, the driver succumbed to her injuries on scene and was pronounced dead,” the Coral Springs police department said. Following an extensive investigation, Raymond Wesley Reese (W/M, 51YOA) has been charged with 1st degree murder. Reese is currently being transported to the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office for processing.
