2/3/2022,"Belgian skeleton racer Kim Meylemans has been freed from an isolation facility in Beijing following a plea for help in a tearful video posted on Instagram. Meylemans confirmed that she now felt “safe” at the Olympic village after the Belgian Olympic Committee and the IOC stepped in when they learned she had wrongly been taken by ambulance to a second government facility and was told she would have to isolate for 14 more days due to Covid-19 concerns.  The Belgian tested positive for the virus upon her arrival in China, which meant she had to enter isolation and return several negative tests before being cleared to move into the Yanqing Olympic village. She thought that was happening Wednesday and boarded an ambulance for what she thought was a ride to the village. “But the ambulance went to another facility,” Meylemans said in an Instagram post that quickly captured attention and raised questions about how her mental health was being affected by the saga. In a video update on Wednesday evening Meylemans, 25, added: “At 11.35pm there was a knock on my door and I was escorted to the Olympic village. I’m now in a wing that’s just isolation, but at least I’m back in the village. I feel safe and I’ll be able to train a little better here. “It seems like the video and the efforts of my Olympic Committee have really paid off.” Meylemans was 14th in her debut Olympics at Pyeongchang in 2018, but is expected to be more of a contender at the Beijing Games. She has one medal from World Cup races this season, a bronze, and was no worse than sixth in five of the final six races on the circuit this season. “Relieved to hear that Kim Meylemans is now in the Olympic village,” IOC spokesman Christian Klaue tweeted. “We are glad that all the efforts led to the successful resolution of this situation.” Meylemans will now stay in an isolated room and still needs seven days of testing before she can be released from that wing. However she should be able to begin practice for the women’s skeleton, which starts next week, before the competition begins on 12February. Earlier Rob Koehler, the director general of Global Athlete, an organisation geared to helping athletes, called Meylemans’ treatment “totally unacceptable”. “She should never have to endure these conditions,” he added. “The IOC is failing athlete rights.”",Sport/Sport,Olympic skeleton racer freed from Beijing isolation facility after tearful video plea for help,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/olympic-skeleton-racer-freed-from-beijing-isolation-facility-after-tearful-video-plea-for-help
2/3/2022,"I’m the disabled guy on several committees, advising governments what to do to keep people with disabilities safe from Covid-19. I know there are good people who have been working very hard on the policy responses, but it’s time to call it out – governments, both state and federal, and all these committees, are failing disabled people. I haven’t always felt this way, and back in 2020 I was satisfied by the proactive approach that governments were taking. Listening to advice from the council that I chair and with the support of our minister at the time, the Victorian government established the disability liaison officer program that funded staff across hospitals throughout Victoria to help vaccinate people with disabilities. This program continues to do good work, including providing disabled people with access to a limited supply of rapid antigen tests and helping disabled people with Covid to navigate the hospital system.  Following our advice, Victoria also set up the call-to-test service that enables disabled people, who are unable to leave their house, to access PCR tests at home. And the federal government had a plan to prioritise the vaccination of people with disabilities. In the early days, these committees were achieving things, and it felt like the government was listening and taking action. But in March 2021, as the royal commission report showed, the vaccination of disabled people was deprioritised. I was expecting disabled people living in residential settings to be at the front of the queue, but no. Ten months on, the latest figures show vaccination rates of disabled people still fall 10% behind the rest of the population and the booster program for people is failing. And now we’ve had Omicron ripping through our nation, causing mayhem for disabled people who rely on others for daily assistance. January has been a nightmare – battling to get our hands on RATs and N95/P2 masks, rearranging shifts because staff have tested positive, and playing the “who hasn’t got Covid” shuffle. Trying to do the staff roster in January has been a game of figuring out who is least likely to kill me. My lungs aren’t strong enough to blow out a candle and the possibility of dying from this virus is real. So whenever I hear the governments – and I use the term in plural deliberately – telling me I need to live with Covid, I’m filled with anger and frustration. I’m trying to, but you’re not making it easy. Despite the hard work and strong advocacy, the absence of proactive government policy measures stack the odds against people like me. There are a lot of things that governments could have done and should be doing to help keep disabled people safe. Every disability worker should have access to a RAT before every shift and N95 masks should be available and mandatory for all disability workers providing close personal care. We need to improve ventilation in disability care settings and address the serious workforce shortages. We must increase efforts to fully vaccinate and deliver boosters to people with disabilities across the country – and boosters must be mandatory for all disability workers. If we want disabled people to live with this virus in the community, we need governments to take action and put in place evidence-based measures. They must listen to and act on what advocates and health experts are calling for. All of these things are achievable, and if I don’t die, I hope to see them happening. If I do die however, I blame the governments.  Dr George Taleporos is chairperson of the Victorian Disability Advisory Council and host of the podcast Reasonable and Necessary.

2/3/2022,"A Brisbane Christian school says it will withdraw its demand that families sign anti-gay and anti-trans enrolment contracts prior to the new school year. The decision comes before a meeting with the Queensland schools accreditation board.  While Citipointe Christian College says it “deeply regrets” that the contracts made students feel discriminated against, the principal says the school has the right to maintain its ethos and the “freedom to continue to provide an education based on our shared beliefs”. Those beliefs – and the statement parents were asked to sign – are taken from the school’s governing body, the International Network of Churches, and its formal “statement of faith”. It includes statements that homosexual acts were “immoral” and “offensive to God” and that transgender people would not be recognised. The withdrawal of the contract comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he “did not agree with” the school’s use of the document. Teachers have told Guardian Australia that the school principal, Brian Mulheran, this week had repeatedly doubled down on his decision to implement the contract. He released a video statement to parents on Tuesday defending the contracts and then gave families a two-week extension to sign. The decision was made before a scheduled meeting of the state government’s statutory accreditation board, which assesses eligibility for government funding and monitors compliance with the Education Act. The board has received a discrimination complaint about the contract. It is also understood that dozens of students and families had already chosen to withdraw and have enrolled at the local state school. Lawyers and others had said the contract was a clear breach of the Queensland anti-discrimination act. The state human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said organisations could not “contract out” their responsibilities under the act. In a letter to families Mulheran said the school would work with the community to update the enrolment contract, but that no families would now be asked to sign the existing one. A statement posted on the college website said the school would “continue to ensure that families are provided with information that is necessary to make informed choices about … our approach to teaching”. “We deeply regret that some students feel that they would be discriminated against because of their sexuality or gender identity, and I apologise to them and their families on behalf of the college,” Mulheran said. “As stated previously, the college does not and will not discriminate against any student because of their sexuality or gender identity. It is central to our faith that being gay or transgender in no way diminishes a person’s humanity or dignity in God’s eyes. “It is also deeply distressing that some of our students have been vilified in the community simply for their religious beliefs or because they attend the college.” Mulheran said society “gives freedom to people to be a part of groups with shared beliefs”. “Citipointe has the freedom to maintain its Christian ethos and this is an essential part of Christian education and choice for parents. As a college established for religious purposes, we will continue to provide an education based on our shared beliefs.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, said she welcomed the decision and had called for it on a number of occasions. “In the interests of the mental health of students, staff, carers and parents I hope they abandon it completely and nothing like it ever surfaces again,” Grace said.",News/Australia news,Brisbane’s Citipointe Christian College withdraws anti-gay contract but defends ‘statement of faith’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/brisbanes-citipointe-christian-college-withdraws-anti-gay-contract-but-defends-statement-of-faith
