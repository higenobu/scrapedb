2/24/2022,"Health unions have criticised the government for offering NHS staff in England a “miserly” 3% pay rise from April, despite inflation having hit 5.5%. Ministers have proposed the increase in their written evidence to the NHS pay review body, which advises what salary uplifts the service’s 1.3 million staff should get.  “With spiralling inflation and hikes to National Insurance contributions, this derisory proposal means NHS workers are staring at yet another real terms loss,” said Rachel Harrison, a national officer with the GMB. The union, along with Unison and the Royal College of Nursing, warned that offering only a 3% rise – the same as staff got in the current year – will prompt frontline workers to quit and thus exacerbate the NHS’s already widespread understaffing. Harrison said that the GMB had warned ministers and the pay review body that staff are already leaving. “This will be the final push that many others need”, she added. Lambasting the pay rise as “miserly”, Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, said: “This tight-fisted proposal falls well short of rising costs and staff hopes. It’s barely half the rate of inflation, which is far from peaking and won’t be for many more months.” Pat Cullen, the general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said that its members “will see this as a deliberate attempt to pitch nurses against patients.”. Gorton said that the below-inflation offer “would mean floods of NHS staff quitting for less stressful, more lucrative jobs”. Meanwhile, NHS staff in England who get Covid-19 will still have to stay off work for at least five days, despite Boris Johnson scrapping that requirement for the general public from Thursday. NHS England confirmed on Wednesday that health service personnel will have a continuing duty to isolate once the lifting of restrictions in Johnson’s “living with Covid” strategy kick in. In guidance telling NHS care providers how to respond to the prime minister’s new approach, NHS England made clear that “healthcare staff who have tested positive for Covid-19 should not attend work until they have had two negative lateral flow test results, taken 24 hours apart. “The first test should not be taken before day five after their initial positive test. “These tests need to be 24 hours apart and, providing there are medically fit, they can return to work on the morning of day six providing they tested negative 24 hours earlier.” The chief executive of one hospital trust welcomed the guidance. “Continued isolation is sensible,” they said. “We have vulnerable folk coming in for care and need to protect them, and we also know how quickly Covid can run through a team.” However, the guidance does not explain who will pay for NHS staff’s Covid tests once free testing in England ends on 1 April. The uncertainty was triggered last week when the Treasury rejected a request from the Department of Health and Social Care for £5bn to pay for them, prompting concern that other parts of the health budget may be cut to cover the cost. It simply says that the matter will be decided “in the coming weeks”.",News/Society,Health unions criticise ‘miserly’ 3% NHS staff pay rise ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/health-unions-criticise-nhs-staff-pay-rise
2/24/2022,"Boris Johnson is in his happy place. The Russian invasion of Ukraine couldn’t have come at a better time. At a stroke, people have stopped asking him awkward questions about the cost of living and the price of fuel. Better still, both Labour and – more importantly – Tory MPs have also suspended hostilities on Partygate. At a time of imminent war in eastern Europe, a united front must be maintained at home. Just in case Vladimir Putin happens to be watching and starts taking our threats seriously. Not that there’s much sign of that so far. But we can live in hope. So, for The Suspect, the heat is off temporarily. He can swan around doing his Churchill tribute act – “We shall fight them on the tennis courts. We shall fight them in the Tory party fundraising auctions. We shall never give up” – safe in the knowledge that right now it’s hard for him to screw things up too badly. No one is coming after him and there is no vote of no confidence imminent. Because however many lies he happens to tell, they are nothing to those being told by Vladimir Putin. And his corruption is amateur hour when compared with the delusional venality of the Russian president. Though it’s obviously something to which he can aspire.  All of which made prime minister’s questions a curiously subdued affair with both The Suspect and Keir Starmer on their best behaviour. Something that came far easier to the Labour leader as he is by far the more serious politician. Even in an international crisis, Johnson can’t totally conceal his inherent levitas. At heart he still thinks the whole thing is a bit of a game. Starmer began by making it clear he was going to go easy on Boris. For the good of the country. The last thing people wanted to see at such a time was politicians squabbling and point-scoring. So he was thoroughly behind the efforts of the UK and other Nato countries to deter Putin. He was – as he had said the day before – just disappointed that the sanctions had been so feeble. The Russian president must have been delighted. That’s if he had even noticed. Steady on old chap, The Suspect replied. While he was very grateful to have the support of the Labour party in principle, he did want to point out that sanctioning five small banks and three individuals who had already been sanctioned by the US since 2018 was actually a massive deal. Not only had it caused Putin to rethink his invasion plans but it had given other oligarchs time to liquidate their assets and get their cash out of the country. Which was a good thing, no? Johnson didn’t really seem to have much of a grasp how sanctions were supposed to work. In any case, it was important to remember that this was just the first phase of an internationally coordinated response. So our next sanctions would be marginally less pathetic. The UK’s role was to always look a soft touch compared with other countries. The Labour leader then moved on to RT television. Surely it was time to have it banned? As it happened, Nadine Dorries had already written to Ofcom about this, The Suspect said. Though there had to be a place in the UK media for outlets that tolerated lies and made-up stories. Otherwise Johnson would never have had a career at the Telegraph. As for donations from Russian oligarchs, he wasn’t going to pay them back because he was sure the Tory party had never taken them. And just to be on the safe side, he definitely wasn’t going to investigate because who knew what you might find once you started. Sensing that they might be on the verge of kicking lumps out of each other in their usual adversarial style, Starmer and The Suspect backed off. The Labour party offers its full support etc. The government appreciates the opposition’s full support etc. Only the Labour leader managed to sound halfway sincere. In keeping with the mood, most Tory backbenchers went out of their way to avoid asking Johnson anything difficult about Ukraine, parties or the cost of living and in return he congratulated them on doing whatever it was they did. He still gives the impression of having no idea who any of them are. Others weren’t so docile. Caroline Lucas tried to ask about Russian involvement in UK elections. Her question went on a bit and she got drowned out by Tory MPs shouting her down as they tried to protect their leader from all too believable truths. Lindsay Hoyle did himself no favours in his failure to allow Lucas to be heard. The most telling intervention came from Margaret Hodge who wanted to know if it was possible to sanction members of the Duma. “It’s quite a thing to sanction parliamentarians,” said The Suspect. Inadvertently giving away far more than intended. Because few parliamentarians have more experience of getting away with things than Johnson. He knows he’s lied to the police. To parliament. To everyone. And he still reckons he’ll get away unscathed. People in power are untouchable. At heart, Boris is just another oligarch manque. Only without the billions. Rejoicing in his freedom, The Suspect went on to tell some lies. He’d forgotten how naturally it came to him. The UK was the first to appreciate the seriousness of Ukraine. Alex Salmond was a member of the SNP. He was on the point of telling the Labour party Jeremy Corbyn was still its leader when Hoyle called time. Labour’s Chris Bryant made a point of order. For the first time ever, Johnson had apologised for lying to the house. About Roman Abramovich facing sanctions. It had taken the fear of reprisals from a Russian oligarch to get him to do the decent thing. The sanctions were working. Just in the opposite way to what had been intended.",News/Politics,Putin’s looming threat gives Johnson some breathing space,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/putins-looming-threat-gives-johnson-some-breathing-space
2/24/2022,"Good morning. A senior US defence official says Russia has moved nearly 100% of its troops into a position needed for an invasion as the UN chief warns: “The world is facing a moment of peril.” Ukraine has urged millions of its citizens in Russia to leave immediately. Nato has accused Russia of attempting to “rewrite the entire global security architecture”, saying the Kremlin is using “force and ultimatums … to redraw borders in Europe”. The EU approved wide-ranging sanctions that go beyond the UK and US response, including leading Russian military figures, state “propagandists” and parliamentarians. The former US president Donald Trump has called Vladimir Putin’s decision to declare independent states within Ukraine “genius”, praising as a “smart move” the call to send “the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen” into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s parliament is set to unveil state of emergency laws that will allow citizens to carry lethal firearms, with Ukrainians reportedly rushing to buy guns and ammunition at weapons stores across the nation.  The Australian government will implement a raft of sanctions against Russia, insisting there “must be consequences” for Moscow’s military actions and recognition of separatist-controlled regions in the east of Ukraine. Scott Morrison unveiled the “first tranche” of sanctions on Wednesday, bringing Australia in line with its US, UK and European allies’ initial responses. Australia’s sanctions would target specific Russian individuals, corporations and industries in the hope of pressuring the Russian government to stop “behaving like thugs and bullies”, Morrison said. Here’s what they’re designed to do and what their impact might be. One-in-five major coal, gas or oil facilities emit significantly more greenhouse gases than previously estimated, a report by the Australian Conservation Foundation has documented. Regulatory failure at state and federal level has allowed some fossil fuel projects to emit more than 20 times what was previously approved, the report claims, with authors of the 18-month research project concluding that the excess emissions were “supercharging our climate problem”. Global research has suggested climate change is responsible for moving twice as much water as previously calculated away from warm regions and towards the poles. Disability recipients cut off from NDIS payments are claiming a campaign of defunding by “stealth” after new figures revealed a 400% spike in appeals over the past six months. A single business in Barnaby Joyce’s electorate has received a half a million dollar NBN upgrade, Senate estimate documents have revealed. A spokesperson from Joyce’s office confirmed that the then backbencher wrote a letter of support for the business in question, a company in which his partner, Vikki Campion, is a shareholder. Former Australian of the Year Rosie Batty says she will avoid “divisive conversations” as the host of the ABC’s interview show, One Plus One. Batty endured several confronting media encounters as a campaigner against domestic violence. France’s parliament has extended the legal limit for abortion from 12 to 14 weeks after an epic wrangle that lasted more than a year. President Emmanuel Macron had voiced his opposition to the move but members of his party helped carry the vote. US health officials have revised the recommended time between receiving Covid-19 vaccines, suggesting a delay of up to eight weeks – rather than the previously advised three to four – could provide better lasting protection. Asteroid strikes that prompted mass extinctions could have been exacerbated by the season, scientists have claimed, with research suggesting that strikes in early springtime might have decimated animal numbers emerging from harsh winters. Three days on from the spectacular shutdown of Sydney’s train system, questions are still being asked. Amid a fury of claim and counterclaim, Michael McGowan and Tamsin Rose pose five key questions, including, “What led to the shutdown?” and, “When will normal services resume?” Scott Morrison has warned that if Mike Cannon-Brookes’ bid to fast-track the shutdown of coal plants succeeds “electricity prices go up”. But is the prime minister right? “There might be some truth to it,” the energy expert Tony Wood tells Graham Readfearn, but only presuming no alternative energy solutions come online. And with $20bn worth of plans for a green energy rollout, it’s unlikely Cannon-Brookes would sit on his hands. Real wages in Australia “completely tanked” in 2021. While the public sector is often a buoy during economic downturns, state and federal government decisions to cap wages growth during the pandemic exacerbated the stagnation. And ongoing misinformation isn’t helping, Greg Jericho argues: “If there is one constant in our economic debate, it is that employer groups and certain members of the Coalition will continually warn that we are about to experience a wages breakout due to unions’ exaggerated pay claims.” The internet can be a scary place. Which is why this week’s curator of our. 10 funniest things on the internet, Eliza Reilly, has plumped predominantly for babies and/or animals. “Oh, bear. Why are you doing this?” It’s Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter. So why is Mike Cannon-Brookes making a multibillion-dollar bid for the polluter?

2/24/2022,"A decision by the US supreme court to hear an appeal by a Colorado web designer who refuses to serve same-sex couples has sparked outrage among LGBTQ+ advocacy groups who fear a major setback for anti-discriminatory laws across the country. On Tuesday, the supreme court agreed to hear the case of Lorie Smith, a Christian web designer based in Denver who plans to expand her services to wedding website designs. Smith has said that due to her Christian beliefs, she will decline any requests from same-sex couples to design a wedding website.  Smith wants to post a statement on her website regarding her beliefs; however, doing so will violate Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. As a result, Smith argues that the law is a violation of her religious rights and free speech. Although the supreme court has said that it will only be looking at the free speech aspect of the case, many LGBTQ+ advocacy groups fear that a potential ruling in favor of Smith will overturn anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBTQ+ customers. Jennifer Pizer, senior counsel at the civil rights organization Lambda Legal, criticized the case, saying in a statement: “We are witness yet again to the unrelenting anti-LGBTQ crusade being waged by self-described Christian fundamentalist legal groups aiming to chip away at the hard-won gains of LGBTQ people by carving out swaths of territory where discrimination can flourish.” She urged the supreme court justices to do what they “should have done three and a half years ago in Masterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission”, referring to a case the court heard in 2018 in which a Colorado baker, Jack Phillips, refused to bake a cake for two men who were getting married. The supreme court said the Colorado civil rights commission had acted with anti-religious bias against Phillips and ruled in his favor. Pizer said: “The supreme court here has the opportunity to … reaffirm and apply longstanding constitutional precedent that our freedoms of religion and speech are not a license to discriminate when operating a business. It is time once and for all to put to rest these businesses’ attempts to undermine the civil rights of LGBTQ people in the name of religion.” One Colorado, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, also criticized the case. In a statement, Nadine Bridges, the organization’s executive director, said: “Just because a business serves a customer doesn’t mean they share or endorse everything that customer believes in. The best way to respect those differences is to ensure that all Coloradans are able to go about our day-to-day lives free from discrimination.” Garett Royer, One Colorado’s deputy director, said a potential ruling in favor of Smith would affect numerous communities, not only LGBTQ+ people. “A decision by the supreme court allowing discrimination would have implications for our country that reach far beyond LGBTQ people. It could threaten our longstanding anti-discrimination protections. Coloradans have shown time and time again that our state is open to all and these efforts do not represent our values.” The organization went on to say that if the supreme court chooses to allow “creative businesses”` to be exempt from anti-discriminatory laws, “any business owner that provides custom services or products could claim a right to violate anti-discrmination laws as they apply to others, not just LGBTQ people.” Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian advocacy group, will be representing Smith in court. The group, which has been labeled as an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement that the Colorado anti-discrimination law “censors and coerces the speech of creative professionals whose religious beliefs do not conform to state orthodoxy”. Smith’s attorneys have asked the supreme court to reconsider whether it should overrule Employment Division v Smith, a precedent set in 1990 when the court ruled that generally applicable laws not targeting specific religious practices do not violate the first amendment. The ruling has been a pain point for some conservative Christians and some justices, who argue that it fails to offer enough religious protection. In 2020, Justice Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito Jr and Neil Gorsuch, the supreme court’s most conservative members, said it was time for the ruling to be overruled. “Smith was wrongly decided,” Alito wrote. “As long as it remains on the books, it threatens fundamental freedom. And while precedent should not lightly be cast aside, the court’s error in Smith should now be corrected.” The supreme court, controlled 6-3 by conservative justices, is expected to hear the case in the fall.",News/Law,"Web designer’s US supreme court case could trample LGBTQ+ rights, advocates say",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/23/supreme-court-lgbtq-rights-web-designer
2/24/2022,"Police in Canada have released footage of axe wielding attackers as they investigate a “calculated and organised” night-time raid on a remote work camp. Up to 20 people are believed to have attacked Coastal GasLink’s pipeline construction camp last week on Marten Forest Service Road in British Columbia.  Dressed all in white the attackers smashed vehicles with axes, including one vehicle with a security guard inside. “I heard smashes on the back tailgate and when I looked in my mirror I could see one of them was holding an axe … it was terrifying,” said the employee, Trevor, in a release from the company. The attackers spray painted the vehicle’s window and set off what was believed to be a flare gun. The group then hijacked heavy machinery, using it to destroy buildings and a drill pad. The company estimated that the cost of the damage was in millions of dollars. The few workers at the camp were escorted to vehicles by security guards and driven to safety. No injuries were reported in the attack. When police arrived, they found the service road blocked by trees, tar-covered stumps and a wooden board with spikes. Police say people in the forest threw smoke bombs and fire-lit sticks at them as they approached the camp. “Because of the nightfall and the actual booby traps that were set up, and one of our members actually getting injured … the attackers just ended up disappearing into the forest,” Sascha Baldinger, a sergeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said on Saturday. No suspects have been identified and no group has claimed responsibility. The location of the attack, about 37 miles south of Houston, BC, is the site of a controversial pipeline project that has attracted sustained protest over the last three years. The C$6.6bn pipeline project, running for more than 400 miles, will carry natural gas (fracked) to the province’s western coast. A third of the pipeline passes through the traditional lands of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation. CGL says its project is supported by 20 First Nation band councils and five of the six elected band councils in the Wet’suwet’en nation. But Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs have fiercely opposed the project and say the band leadership does not have the authority to negotiate such agreements. Opposition to the project by Indigenous land defenders has led to police raids on the protest camps in previous years. But the RCMP say there are not any links to the demonstrations against the pipeline. “Although there have been confrontations in the past and there has been active protest in the area, at this point we have no linkages to those events and this current event,” said Baldinger.",News/World news,Night-time attack on controversial Canadian gas pipeline site,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/night-attack-controversial-canadian-fracked-gas-pipeline-site
