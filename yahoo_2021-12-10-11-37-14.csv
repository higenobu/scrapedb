12/10/2021,"Source: Ivan Sviatkovskyi / EyeEm / Getty American Airlines is under scrutiny after a video of a Black couple and their seven-week-old daughter being kicked off a flight last week by unprofessional staff members has been circling the web. On Dec. 4, Allan Ali, his partner and their seven-week-old baby were abruptly asked to get off of their 1 p.m. flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Philidelphia, Pennsylvania — where they live. The mother, who goes by Ms. Kam on social media, calmly tried to explain a misunderstanding she had with another staff member on the plane to a flight attendant in now viral-footage Allan has shared on Instagram.

Even though the mother seemingly made an effort to follow through with the request, the flight attendant dubbed Ms. Kam as an “aggressive” passenger. Once other staff members got involved in Ms. Kam and the unidentified flight attendant’s misunderstanding, things quickly escalated and the family was asked to get off of the plane before it took off. At one point, a white male flight attendant with shoulder-length light blondish hair violently reached over Ms. Kam and the newborn and knocked Allan’s phone out of his hand in an attempt to prevent the father from recording the events that took place. “I just want this to be known, that she has a newborn [and] you’re putting her off the plane due to the negligence and unprofessionalism of one of your staff members,” Allan says to two of the American Airlines staff members as the incident took place. “If we are treated unfairly, should we take this? We paid to be on this flight,” he continued. “This is my seven-week-old daughter being mistreated. If you had any compassion or empathy or decency…” It was disturbing to watch as many other passengers looked face forward and kept silent as the family’s ordeal with the American Airlines crew happened. “Somebody who saw this or heard this, I hope you speak up, because it’s wrong,” Allan is heard expressing to fellow passengers in the footage. As his wife began to cry and a flight attendant removed their luggage from the overhead compartment, Allan redirected his words to the male flight attendant who knocked down his phone and said the staff member should be ashamed. “We’re not fools, we’re educated,” Allan said of he and Ms. Kam’s backgrounds. ” Masters degrees, working hard. We didn’t come here for conflict –” As Allan was talking in the video, the male staff member is heard saying, “Oh please,” — clearly being dismissive of the horrible disrespect the family was subjected to. Toward the end of the clip, Allan seemingly pointed to the flight attendant with whom his wife had the initial misunderstanding. The couple is seeking justice and answers from American Airlines regarding the incident. In the footage Allan took, the father stated he planned to take legal action against the airline over his family’s mistreatment. American Airlines has yet to formally acknowledge the family’s experience, despite clips of this incident increasingly gaining traction on social media. The family ended up catching the 11 p.m. flight to Philly that day — booked by the airline, according to sources who spoke with TMZ. The outlet additionally shared that a spokesperson for American Airlines said, “We are investigating the incident and working to understand what took place.” In another clip, taken after the couple was forced off the plane and back in the airport, Ms. Kam explained more about how the incident initially got started.

12/10/2021,"PARIS (AP) — Germany's foreign minister warned Russia on Thursday that it would pay a “high political and economic price” if it makes any militaristic moves against neighboring Ukraine. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock emphasized the need to coordinate a common European position when dealing with hostile neighbors such as Russia, which has amassed troops near the border with Ukraine. “The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine aren’t up for negotiation for us,” Baerbock said in Paris while making her first foreign trip, a day after taking office. She added that the highest priority must be to avoid a military escalation. “Russia would pay a high political and economic price for a renewed breach of Ukraine’s statehood,” Baerbock told reporters during a a joint news conference with French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affair Jean-Yves Le Drian. “We can only find solutions down the diplomatic route, and we are both ready to become personally deeply engaged (on this matter).” Russia insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine unless it is “provoked.” In a phone conversation Thursday with Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked the now-retired German chancellor for “years of fruitful cooperation,” according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. Putin underscored Merkel’s “significant contribution to the development of the Russian-German relations” during her 16 years in office and said she was always welcome in Russia. Merkel, in turn, wished Putin success in “establishing a dialogue” with new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the readout said. In France, Baerbock said a possible diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in China was another “big topic” on Thursday. The White House and the British and Australian governments have said none of their diplomats will attend the Beijing Games, decisions intended to protest Chinese human rights abuses. Germany wants to decide how to proceed “in unison with our European friends,” she added. Le Drian also said a common European stance regarding a diplomatic boycott of the Olympics was needed. The French foreign minister spoke shortly after French Education and Sports Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said Paris would not join such a boycott. “Sports is a world in itself, which must be protected from political interference, otherwise...we can end up by killing the competition,” Blanquer said on French news channel BFM-TV. During the wide-ranging news conference with her French counterpart, Baerbock stressed that the sexual assault allegations made by Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai against a former Communist Party official should be taken seriously. “If a woman makes such allegations, then they should be heard, including internationally,” said Baerbock, who is Germany's first female foreign minister. ___ Jordans reported from Berlin.
