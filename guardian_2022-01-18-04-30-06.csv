1/18/2022,"Dominic Cummings has accused Boris Johnson of lying after No 10 denied the prime minister was warned against allowing a “bring your own booze” party during the first lockdown. Johnson admitted to parliament last week that he attended drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 but claimed he had not realised it was a social gathering.  The event was organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary (PPS), Martin Reynolds, who told people to “bring your own booze” - but No 10 denies that the prime minister saw the emailed invitation to about 100 staff. It has also denied allegations that two senior staffers warned Johnson not to go ahead with the drinks event, saying this was “not true”. But Cummings, a former senior aide to the prime minister, wrote a new blog post on Monday challenging that account. He said he personally told Reynolds that the invitation broke the rules and claimed Reynolds replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Cummings then said that during a discussion over the future of the cabinet secretary and Reynolds, he had said to the prime minister something like: “Martin’s invited the building to a drinks party, this is what I’m talking about, you’ve got to grip this madhouse.” Cummings added: “The PM waved it aside. I had told him repeatedly the PPS should be replaced, as had other competent officials who knew the whole structure needed a huge upgrade in personnel and management. ‘He’s MY guy, I don’t want you replacing him with YOUR person.’ (Yes, this says a lot.) I went home to bed at 3ish, still very ill from Covid.” He claims Reynolds had checked with Johnson whether the party should go ahead, the prime minister agreed it should and they both went to the party. Another former Downing Street staffer told the Guardian: “It is inconceivable: there is no way Martin would go ahead without checking with Boris. There is no way any PPS would. If two senior people come to you and say, ‘this shouldn’t happen’, you don’t then proceed with it without speaking to the principal.” Asked about Cummings’s latest claims, a No 10 spokesman pointed to an earlier statement, saying: “It is untrue that the prime minister was warned about the [20 May] event in advance. As he said … he believed implicitly that this was a work event. He has apologised to the house and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” The party on 20 May has emerged as the most contentious event for Johnson out of all those investigated by the senior civil servant Sue Gray over allegations that lockdown rules were broken in Downing Street. With Tory MPs openly questioning Johnson’s future as party leader, there are worries among backbenchers about a drip-drip of further damaging revelations causing harm to the government’s reputation.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson lied about lockdown party, Dominic Cummings claims",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/boris-johnson-lied-about-lockdown-party-dominic-cummings-claims
1/18/2022,"The climate crisis will wipe at least 1% a year off the UK’s economy by 2045 if global temperatures are allowed to rise by 2C, the government warned on Monday. More action would be needed on key areas such as flood defences, restoring natural protections such as peatlands and wetlands, and making the built environment more resilient to extreme weather, ministers said.  The government’s third five-yearly assessment of the risks from climate change was published on Monday. While taking what many regarded as a conservative estimate of future risks, it painted a future of drastic disruption and costly impacts from the climate crisis. Damage to the UK’s food production, and to infrastructure, from extreme weather, and the risks of flooding, are all likely to cost more than £1bn a year each. In all, at least eight areas of risk were judged likely to cost more than £1bn a year by 2050 – however, some may cost much more, as the risks were assessed in bands, with more than £1bn the highest available. Many other potential areas of risk, such as risks to business supply chains and to the delivery of health services, and the potential damage to culturally important heritage sites, were judged unable to be fully assessed. Jo Churchill, the minister for climate adaptation, said: “The scale and severity of the challenge posed by climate change means we cannot tackle it overnight, and although we’ve made good progress in recent years there is clearly much more that we need to do. By recognising the further progress that needs to be made, we’re committing to significantly increasing our efforts and setting a path towards the third National Adaptation Programme which will set ambitious and robust policies to make sure we are resilient to climate change into the future.” Green campaigners said the predictions showed the government needed to do far more to prepare for the impacts. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “This report makes clear that even modest increases in global temperature will have profound impacts across every aspect of our lives. Adaptation can no longer be an afterthought, action on climate change of all kinds needs to be right at the heart of government policy and programmes.” The costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions – a renewed focus of political attention, as some backbench Tory MPs have called the net zero target into question amid energy price rises – also looked modest in comparison with the cost of the impacts of climate breakdown, according to analysts. Matt Williams, climate and land programme lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The damage caused to the UK by climate change will be greater than the investments needed to avoid harmful levels of warming.” Signe Norberg, of the Aldersgate Group of businesses supporting sustainability, said: “Investing in a healthier natural environment is key to making the UK more resilient to the impacts of climate change and it will be critical that the government puts forward ambitious and credible targets under the Environment Act as well as a new and comprehensive environmental improvement plan later this year. The UK must also continue its efforts to deliver rapid emission reductions across the economy and beyond just the power sector. Key policy gaps remain in crucial areas, such as energy efficiency, agriculture and land use, and skills.” Labour said the government had failed to reduce emissions and to prepare the country’s infrastructure for the impacts of the climate crisis. Jim McMahon, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said: “After more than a decade in power the Conservatives have failed to build the efficient homes, strengthened flood defences, and resilient natural habitats necessary to tackle the climate crisis. Their lack of action and empty promises are putting people, nature, and our economy at risk.” The government said it was investing £5.2bn to build 2,000 new flood defences by 2027, and increasing the Nature for Climate Fund on peat restoration, woodland creation and management to more than £750m by 2025.",News/Environment,"Climate crisis may wipe 1% a year off UK economy by 2045, say ministers",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/climate-crisis-1-percent-a-year-off-uk-economy-by-2045
1/18/2022,"Even a Marmite reaction – some loving it, some hating it – would have been better from brand owner Unilever’s point of view. Unfortunately, almost everybody seemed to agree: the big idea of offering £50bn for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division, a proposal rejected by the pharmaceutical firm’s board, was a shocker.  Unilever’s share price plunged 7%, which is a large move when you’re worth (or were) £100bn. “Initial feedback on the deal from investors over the weekend has been almost uniformly negative,” reported Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. Amid chief executive Alan Jope’s talk about “rotating” Unilever’s product portfolio, one line of thinking says he’s in danger of rotating himself out of a job. Is it really such a terrible proposal, though? In purely strategic terms, the fit looks decent. If your aim is to be bigger in “health, beauty and hygiene”, which Unilever has been saying for a while, then GSK brands such as Panadol, Advil and Sensodyne are one definition of what you want. If the targeted operation can be relied upon to increase sales annually at 4%-6%, which is GSK’s revised estimate, that’s a notch above the 3%-5% at which Unilever generally travels. The difference is not huge, obviously, but Unilever would also seek buyers for some or all of its food operation, parts of which show roughly zero growth. That’s the “rotation” part of Jope’s script, also designed to ensure that borrowing does not rise to nose-bleed ratios. Jope faces at least five problems, however – and none is small. First, GSK is under little pressure to sell. Its investors seem happy with the current plan to demerge the consumer products business this summer via a listing in London. It might take an offer at £55bn to force negotiations. Second, Jope is trying to execute a mega-deal with Unilever’s share price close to a five-year low. Given that new shares represented £8.3bn of the rejected £50bn offer, the deal mechanics would turn far more smoothly at a higher share price. Third, Jope has exposed himself to the charge that he should try to fix what he’s got before contemplating a “transformational” mega-deal. Grumbling about Unilever’s pedestrian performance is not confined to Terry Smith, the fund manager who made an entertaining jab last week about a corporate obsession with finding purpose in mayonnaise. The wider issue is a sense that Unilever isn’t converting its “sustainability” credentials into grubby profits at the required rate. Nestlé’s success stands in contrast. Fourth, Jope didn’t calm nerves by talking about alternative deal-making “options” should the GSK adventure not come off. If plan A for a big acquisition is hopeful, plan B is vague. Fifth, any strategy that involves spending £50bn and then selling, say, £30bn of food assets is complex. Brands like Hellman’s, Ben & Jerry’s and Marmite might attract a rush of would-be buyers, but the overall disposal tally is what matters, and it’s not guaranteed. For all those reasons, Jope’s chances of success in his pursuit look slim – maybe 25%. But that is a day-one view and momentum can turn. If Unilever could produce a big and credible cost-saving plan, it might change the mood. Evidence that revenues have accelerated after last year’s tepid third-quarter performance would also help – financial results are due next month. It’s not much to cling to, but do not count out Unilever just yet. This could be a long campaign and the ambition, for all the practical difficulties, looks entirely reasonable. A medicines-for-Marmite strategy is not illogical. The default assumption is usually that Swiss banks are inward-looking institutions that always find a way to remove a reform-minded outsider from the boardroom. No such conspiratorial thinking is required in the case of António Horta-Osório at Credit Suisse, however. The former Lloyds Banking Group boss is entirely the author of his own downfall. He seems to have broken Covid quarantine rules in both Switzerland and the UK, the latter on a trip to watch the tennis at Wimbledon last summer. And the initial plea that the breaches were “unintentional” was undercut by reports in the Swiss press that he sought official exemptions from the quarantine rules and was refused. Resignation was the only possible outcome, especially as Saint António was hired as chairman of Credit Suisse to promote what he called “a culture of personal responsibility and accountability” at the bank after its many entanglements, including Greensill Capital. Even on his home patch at Lloyds, AHO surely wouldn’t have survived this episode.",News/Business,Unilever’s bid for GSK consumables isn’t quite the shocker it seems | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/17/unilever-bid-for-gsk-consumables-isnt-quite-the-shocker-it-seems
1/18/2022,"A man has been jailed for raping a teenage woman more than three decades ago after he was arrested last year for an unconnected crime and his DNA found to match the attacker’s profile. Armed with a large sharpened stick, Paul Shakespeare grabbed his 18-year-old victim from a footpath in Gloucestershire as she walked her dog and dragged her into bushes before attacking her.  The daylight rape in Cheltenham left the teenager so traumatised she never told her family what happened to her on the afternoon of Sunday 29 April 1990. After raping the girl, Shakespeare threatened to find her and kill her if she told anyone, Gloucester crown court heard. Shakespeare, now 66, was brought to justice after he was arrested in Cumbria last year and his DNA matched. He was jailed for nine years. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the victim said the rape had a profound effect on her causing her to try to take her own life. “I couldn’t tell my family because of the shame I felt, I felt embarrassed, violated and dirty,” she said. “To this day my mum is not aware of what happened to me. “Being raped will haunt me for the rest of my life. On that day I was the most scared I have ever been. I didn’t know whether I would live or die – I was petrified.” Virginia Cornwall, prosecuting, told the court the attack took place in daylight near to a children’s play area on the Honeybourne line, a former railway line area popular with walkers and cyclists. She said: “This was a premeditated stranger rape when a weapon was used to gain the victim’s submission. The defendant had noticed the teenager alone and he had selected her. “After raping her he asked where she lived and where she worked and it seems she told him through fear. Before running off he told her, ‘I know where you live and where you work and I’ll come and find you. If you tell anyone I’ll kill you.’” An investigation was launched and despite local and national press coverage, Shakespeare was not caught. In 2008 the victim took part in a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction but the defendant still evaded justice. In June last year Shakespeare was arrested for possession of an offensive weapon and his DNA matched samples taken from the rape. He pleaded guilty to rape and possession of an offensive weapon. Kim Whittlestone, defending, said Shakespeare, from Carlisle, has been married for 20 years to an NHS nurse and he had three adult children. Judge Michael Cullum said: “I am so relieved this day has finally come for your victim. For 30 years she has been denied justice and living daily with the nightmare you inflicted upon her. She knew this day would come and her remarkable faith in criminal justice has been borne out.” Outside court, DC Simone Bowley praised the victim’s courage, adding: “She has had to wait for more than 30 years for Shakespeare to admit his abhorrent crimes.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

1/18/2022,"On Sunday, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, tweeted that the BBC licence fee will be abolished in 2027 and broadcaster’s funding frozen for the next two years. The licence fee is the guarantor of the BBC’s financial independence and underpins its unique quality. Doing away with the funding stream without warning and with no replacement in sight in advance of a mid-charter review revealed Ms Dorries’ true intentions. The backlash to her peremptory threat was enough for her to back down. It was hard not to believe the reason the BBC was being sacrificed was to distract attention away from accusations that the prime minister lied over illegal Downing Street parties. Nothing appears too valuable in British life that cannot be wrecked to save Boris Johnson’s premiership. The BBC has not got off lightly: Ms Dorries confirmed she intends to keep the fee flat at £159 for a colour licence until April 2024, which will mean a severe real-terms cut to the corporation’s funding. The negotiations between Ms Dorries and the BBC to agree a settlement had not been conducted transparently or appropriately. This is ominous. The Tories have long used the BBC as a punchbag. But under Mr Johnson the “Brexit-Bashing Corporation” is key to drawing up cultural dividing lines rather than economic ones. The longer-term threat to get rid of the licence fee has not gone away. Linking the BBC’s mid-charter review, and implicitly the fate of the licence fee, with the “impartiality” of a broadcaster’s editorial output makes ministers sound more like tinpot tyrants than respectable democrats.  Ms Dorries’ defence is that she is cutting the cost of watching television in a cost-of-living crisis. This is not an unreasonable argument. But low inflation in the last decade did not mean a better deal for Auntie. Licence fee income has suffered a real terms cut of 30% since 2010. The BBC is the glue of the nation, bringing people together with its sports coverage and landmark dramas and documentaries. Dissolving those bonds is in no one’s interest apart from the BBC’s corporate rivals like Rupert Murdoch. Defund Auntie and ministers also help to defund TV’s private sector, which relies on the BBC to commission shows. Cutbacks also don’t help the one in eight people who spend three hours a day watching the five major public sector broadcaster channels. The media analyst Claire Enders points out that despite public debate being dominated by the tastes of younger viewers, audience fragmentation and online subscription services, there are 8 million adults in the UK who lack the means, or do not wish, to pay for any TV service beyond the licence fee. The central role the BBC plays in national life ensures a source of trusted news and information benefits from large audiences thanks to entertainment-driven schedules. The pandemic has reminded us of this social and political role in dramatic fashion. Much has been made of the rise of subscription services such as Netflix. The BBC might do very well under such a model, but it would not be the BBC as it exists today. Netflix has built its empire on $15.5bn of debt. Ministers’ are delusional to think the BBC could compete with a £700m borrowing facility. Modern national polities are in part a creation of television, which is why governments decided to monopolise broadcasting at its outset. The Conservative party appears to want to cast society in the image of the market rather than the democratic state. Hence its death-by-a-thousand-cuts approach to the BBC. There needs to be an independent and transparent process to set the level of the licence fee. Discussions over whether to replace the funding model and the BBC’s wider obligations cannot be decided by ministerial whim or implicitly by commercial rivals’ interests.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Tories and the BBC: a backlash sees off an immediate threat | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-tories-and-the-bbc-a-backlash-sees-off-an-immediate-threat
1/18/2022,"In better times, the French left used to draw inspiration from the old Popular Front phrase, “les lendemains qui chantent” (the tomorrows that sing). These days that kind of optimism – along with any sense of unity among progressives – is just a poignant memory. With less than 100 days to go before the first round of the French presidential election, the jockeying for position among the flatlining candidates of the left has become a fractious sideshow, as the campaign continues to be dominated by the right. At the weekend, the Socialist former justice minister, Christiane Taubira, became the latest hopeful to formally throw her hat into the ring. She joins the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo – also a Socialist – France Unbowed’s veteran hard-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the Green candidate, Yannick Jadot, and an assortment of fringe figures. None of the candidates has managed to break through the 10% barrier in polls and none has a chance of making it through to the second round of voting; yet all remain in the race, vying to take votes from each other. “Singing tomorrows” have given way to a cacophonous clashing of stubborn egos. The result is that the 30% or so of voters who identify as being on the broad left are being effectively disfranchised.  Ms Taubira is associated with one of the most notable progressive victories in recent times, having pushed through same-sex marriage in 2013. Charismatic and popular with grassroots activists, she will hope that her radical pedigree can transcend the factional warfare. But there is also a risk that she simply divides this divided field still further. Ms Hidalgo recently warned that the choice for the left was to either unite or risk eventual extinction as a political force in France. But Mr Jadot and Mr Mélenchon, whose poll ratings have more than halved since the election of 2017, have both refused to recognise the validity of an unofficial “people’s primary” at the end of the month. It is a sorry spectacle. In 2012, following the election of François Hollande as president, the Parti Socialiste controlled the Élysée, both houses of parliament and most regional administrations. It then paid a heavy price for enacting post-crash austerity measures and haemorrhaged working-class support during the growing backlash against globalisation. In 2017, the party was out-manoeuvred by Emmanuel Macron, who left it to set up the centrist En Marche movement and successfully brought about a realignment in which he became the presidential bulwark against the threat of the far right. Faced with these formidable structural challenges, the French left cannot afford the luxury of endless infighting and self-indulgent campaigns leading to mutually assured destruction at the polls. The people’s primary was set up by progressive activists in a last-ditch attempt to achieve a united front. It seems destined to fail in that aim – though it may serve as a kind of launchpad for Ms Taubira, who has said she will not run unless she wins. The near-certain humiliation that awaits the left in April should be the catalyst for a radical reboot of how progressive politics is done in France.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on French progressives: divided they fall | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-french-progressives-divided-they-fall
1/18/2022,"Millions of households could face a second record energy price hike this year which would lift the average gas and electricity bill to £2,255 from October, intensifying the UK’s cost of living crisis. Energy bills are expected to soar to almost £2,000 a year from April under the regulator’s energy price cap, and industry analysts have warned that a second surge in October could drive bills more than 75% above today’s prices.  The energy price cap, which sets a limit on default energy tariffs used by 15m households, climbed to an average of £1,277 this winter in the steepest bill increase since the cap was introduced in 2019. The level of the cap is expected to surge to £1,925 from 1 April, according to analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight, and rise again in October, unless the government takes action to help prevent millions of people from plunging into fuel poverty. The number of households who are in ‘fuel stress’ because they are unable to pay their energy bills is expected to treble overnight to 6.3m across the UK from 1 April, according to research from the Resolution Foundation thinktank. The research has added to growing calls for ministers to take urgent action to avert a national energy crisis, triggered by a global gas supply crunch, including proposals that the Treasury scraps VAT on energy bills and moves green levies and other policy costs into general taxation. Gareth Miller, the chief executive officer at Cornwall Insight said: “It is not helpful for government to keep pointing to the default tariff cap when pressed on what action it is taking. The cap will not protect consumers from increases in gas and power prices in the long run.” Miller warned the government against “quick fixes” to counter the record energy market highs which threaten the livelihoods of households and businesses in favour of a rethink of the UK’s energy sources. He urged ministers to “look again” at low-carbon energy technologies which could protect the UK from a boom in international fossil fuel prices, and consider homegrown gas supplies because “where we get gas from is irrelevant so long as we stick to a declining usage as we move to net zero”. “The current energy crisis is of economy wide concern, having a potential impact on business competitiveness, general inflation, and household affordability,” Miller said. “It is vital that the magnitude and speed of actions match the scale of risk faced by the economy from the current situation, and that attentions turn away from quick fixes, and instead focus on large scale reform of the energy system.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Millions face second record energy price hike this year, analysts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/17/millions-face-second-record-energy-price-hike-this-year-analysts-warn
1/18/2022,"A British man who flew to the US, acquired a gun and took hostages at a Texas synagogue had a criminal record and an extensive history of mental health issues, the Guardian understands. Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old from Blackburn, was killed after a tense 11-hour hostage standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville on Saturday evening. All four hostages survived the siege and were unharmed.  President Joe Biden on Sunday declared the incident an act of terror and the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK government condemned “this act of terrorism and antisemitism”. In a statement to Sky news Akram’s brother Gulbar asked how he had been able to acquire a visa to enter the US. “He’s known to police. Got a criminal record. How was he allowed to get a visa and acquire a gun?” he said. Asked by reporters on Sunday how Akram could have procured weapons in the US, Biden said: “the assertion was he got the weapons on the street. He purchased them when he landed.” The Guardian understands that Akram had a criminal record in the UK but no known terrorism convictions. Investigators in the UK believe that Akram had no connection to Texas and travelled there earlier this month. Officers at MI5, the British Security Service, were on Monday examining their records to see if he had ever been known to them. Akram had been the subject of an exclusion order in 2001 banning him from Blackburn magistrates court after he made remarks about the 11 September, 2001 attacks on the US, saying he wished he had been on the planes flown into buildings to commit mass murder. During the synagogue siege, Akram could be heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida, who was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan. Siddiqui is in federal prison in Texas serving an 86-year sentence. As the siege unfolded the FBI asked British police to get Akram’s family to try to talk him into surrendering. They spoke to Akram as he held hostages, but could not convince him to give himself up. British detectives continued to question two teenagers arrested in Manchester who are both believed to be male. They are being questioned to see if they knew anything about Akram’s intentions to travel to the US to stage the attack. A community source in Blackburn said Akram was known to behave unusually, including in and around mosques in the Lancashire town. Malik Faisal Akram was known as Faisal to those who knew him in Blackburn, Lancashire. A neighbour of the former family home described him as “a bit hotheaded”, but otherwise a generally unremarkable man who at one point had been trying to build a property business. “I never thought at all in my wildest dreams that this was ever going to happen”. A taxi driver, who had known Akram since childhood, said he had recently lost his business and house. “He went through some bad issues, he must have lost a lot. But his mental health issues were genuine, we’ve known him for all of our life.” MP Kate Hollern said the Akram’s actions were “not a reflection of Blackburn or any religious community”. The head of the local council, Mohammed Khan, said Blackburn and Darwen would be assisting with the investigation. “In Blackburn we firmly stand by the belief that no community should live in fear for its safety as they go about practising their religious beliefs or identity. We stand in solidarity in condemning this act of hate, violence and terror.” Lancashire Council of Mosques also condemned the hostage situation in Texas and urged its members to avoid speculation and sharing unverified information. The standoff began during a Saturday morning service at the Reform synagogue in the affluent city of about 26,000 residents. The service was being live streamed on Facebook when a man with a British accent could be heard shouting off camera. The feed was eventually cut hours later and police were called at about 10.41am. One male hostage, believed to be the synagogue’s rabbi, was released at around 5pm as negotiations continued throughout the day. Armed FBI officers stormed the building and rescued the three remaining hostages at around 9pm, authorities said. Details of the manner of Akram’s death have not been released.",News/News,Texas hostage taker had criminal and mental health history in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/17/texas-hostage-taker-had-criminal-and-mental-health-history-in-uk
