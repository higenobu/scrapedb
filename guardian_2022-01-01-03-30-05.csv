1/1/2022,"And so here we are: among the dark, blustery, not so cold days of between-Christmas-and-new-year. A time to say goodbye to 2021, the year everyone hoped would be better than 2020, and that wasn’t, really. The year many hoped would mean the end of the pandemic, though the one certainty of early 2022 is the Omicron variant. This moment of the calendar – curiously inert for those whose work pauses at this time of the year – offers for many a precious kind of deep inactivity. This year, the British are not entering a prolonged and complete lockdown as we did when 2020 slipped into 2021, but still, in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, there are many restrictions on the extent to which people may gather together, and in England, those alert to the dangers are broadly following suit voluntarily. The time, in short, is one of retreat; for some, loneliness.  The temptation is to switch on the TV and to revel in the teeming joys of all that the bafflingly myriad streaming services have to offer. Christmas movies – all the way through the spectrum from Die Hard to Love Actually, according to taste – are available at the click of the remote. For some, it’s a time to finally binge-watch Succession; or to sit down in front of a classy adaptation of a family classic, like the BBC’s entertaining Around the World in 80 Days. But solace comes in other ways too, ones that are easy to forget amid the seasonally guiltless possibilities of TV immersion. Company and comfort can come through reading, and, in particular, the reading of wintry, frosty books. There are many stories that readers turn to again and again at this time of year, some of them at least supposedly for children. Philip Pullman’s modern classic Northern Lights has its culmination in the icy far north where the aurora borealis dances, ruled over by polar bears and witches. Susan Cooper’s 1973 story for young readers, The Dark Is Rising, is for some grown-ups an annual ritual, to be begun on the eve of the solstice, 20 December, when the story begins, and continued in real time until its end on Twelfth Night. The tale is set in the unmagical semi-rural locale of Windsor and Slough. But for young Will, who turns 11 on the shortest day, his life is about to become one of enchantment and danger. The world around him is to be submerged in the deepest, longed-for, but perilous snow. The forces of dark will do battle with the forces of light, and Will is to play his part. Cooper, who as an undergraduate attended lectures by JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, drew on Arthurian tales, and British and English folklore, to invest her chosen landscape with a rich stratigraphy of story. Her book also has a fond relationship with the 1935 children’s novel The Box of Delights by John Masefield – poet laureate and, briefly, a Guardian leader writer. It is another child’s story, drawing on British mythology, that takes place in deep snow – and in which those benign-seeming theological students out carolling might not be all that they seem. The Box of Delights itself is a thrilling, magical mechanism that can take you anywhere you desire. It is a metaphor for the act of reading itself – the power of story to transport a person anywhere, out of isolation, into thrilling new worlds far away from the anxieties that attended the limping, wintry end of 2021 in Britain.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on wintry reading: a box of delights | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/31/the-guardian-view-on-wintry-reading-a-box-of-delights
1/1/2022,"Boris Johnson faces a further headache over the scandal surrounding the funding of his Downing Street flat refurbishment after Labour demanded the findings of an investigation be made public after reports it will exonerate him. Calls for all evidence to be handed over to parliament’s standards commissioner, amid fears of a “Whitehall whitewash”, led to the prime minister trying to prevent the saga spiralling further.  Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on interests, is looking into whether he was misled during an initial inquiry in the spring investigating if Johnson knew about payments to cover the redecoration of his flat above No 11. Despite Johnson telling Geidt he knew nothing about donations to fund the makeover until immediately ahead of newspaper reports in February 2021, the Electoral Commission revealed that prime minister had exchanged WhatsApp messages with the donor, Lord Brownlow, in November 2020 about securing further funds. The watchdog imposed a fine of more than £17,000 on the Conservatives for breaching donation reporting laws. On Thursday, the Financial Times said Geidt had exchanged several letters with Johnson and that, while he would criticise the prime minister’s behaviour, he would not change his initial ruling that there had been no wrongdoing. A senior government source confirmed the outcome to the Guardian, and Geidt is expected to publish the letters early in the new year. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the leak would “only serve to underline the deep flaws in this system”. She called on Geidt to publish his findings immediately and hand the evidence over to Kathryn Stone, the standards commissioner. Stone is said to be considering launching an investigation of her own into whether Johnson broke the MPs’ code of conduct. Evidence Rayner said should be handed over includes WhatsApp messages exchanged between Johnson and the Tory peer who initially covered some the costs of the No 11 refurbishment. A senior Labour source said the prime minister had “made a fool” of Geidt and the outcome of the report showed “you can lie to him and get away with it”. Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrats’ chief whip, said people deserved “proper answers, not another Whitehall whitewash” and that Johnson was only concerned about “getting himself off the hook”. Tory MPs believed Johnson being exonerated avoided setting off events that could have ended with calls for his resignation if it was found he breached the ministerial code. However, they remained sceptical of whether it was enough to win back the confidence of his disgruntled backbenchers. A minister said: “This is a guy who’s the political equivalent to a cat. He’s been burning through his nine lives and may have got one of them back, but he’s still got very few left. He now needs a period of calm and quiet achievement.” Another frontbencher added of the ill-feeling caused by the scandal: “It’s stuck and it’ll take a lot for the PM to rid himself of the image.” Other senior Tories stressed that regardless of the report’s outcome, they still believed Johnson’s defence was – at best – questionable. One suggested that the prime minister may struggle to “meaningfully regain credibility”. Caroline Slocock, director of the Civil Exchange thinktank and a former private secretary to Margaret Thatcher, told the Guardian that Stone should launch an investigation. She said, comparing the situation to the 1980s political satire: “This looks like classic Yes, Prime Minister – the PM both knew and didn’t know about the funding of his flat and was both open and not open to Lord Geidt by concealing WhatsApp exchanges.” Slocock added the outcome showed “the need for a truly independent adviser on ministerial standards” who was independently appointed and able to investigate breaches of the ministerial code without permission from the prime minister. Dr Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, agreed that Geidt “needs to show he can still be an effective watchdog” by pushing for the report to be published imminently and seeking to gain more powers and independence “so that this situation can never arise again”. She said while Johnson may feel relieved he has been cleared, the “saga of the wallpaper is unlikely to be over”, and that the investigation had “badly damaged the public’s confidence in ministerial code investigations”. The Cabinet Office said it would “not comment on speculation” and pointed to the terms of reference of Geidt’s investigation, which said his advice to the prime minister would be “published in a timely manner”.",News/Politics,PM’s flat overhaul: Labour demands inquiry findings be made public,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/31/labour-demands-findings-of-probe-into-johnsons-flat-overhaul-be-made-public
1/1/2022,"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them.  Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails. “If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks when ever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers. The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”",News/World news,UK government’s Covid advisers enduring ‘tidal waves of abuse’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/uk-governments-covid-advisers-enduring-tidal-waves-of-abuse
1/1/2022,"Three hours after an impassioned public plea by Middlesbrough’s manager, Chris Wilder, the Football League finally agreed on Friday afternoon to postpone his side’s Championship match at Sheffield United, scheduled for Saturday lunchtime. An alternately incandescent and bewildered Wilder had made plain his shock after the EFL declined initial requests by the Teesside club to call off the televised game. Boro had registered 19 positive Covid tests in the wake of their 2-1 win at Blackpool on Wednesday night.  Nine players and 10 staff members were affected, with seven of the nine senior professionals affected due to have been in Wilder’s starting XI at Bramall Lane. “It’s been the most difficult 48 hours of my 20-year managerial career,” he said. “We’ve been absolutely decimated by Covid.” With two more players developing sore throats on Friday afternoon and a 20th positive test result recorded, the fixture eventually fell but Wilder, in charge of Sheffield United until last March, was earlier astonished when, he says, the EFL advised him to recall four loan players. Two played a full 90 minutes for their clubs on Thursday night, Djed Spence appearing in Nottingham Forest’s 1-0 home Championship defeat against Huddersfield and Lewis Wing featuring for Sheffield Wednesday in their 5-0 League One thrashing at Sunderland. “The blunt message we keep getting back from the EFL is: ‘You have an obligation to fulfil this fixture,’” said Wilder on Friday afternoon as he suggested that playing in South Yorkshire on Saturday would threaten the league’s integrity and player welfare, while exacerbating Covid’s spread. “Apart from Covid we have four or five injuries and one boy who might last 30 minutes but the EFL want us to supplement our available players with the group out on loan. I can’t get my head around that. I’ll be making calls to Forest and Wednesday to see if we can have Djed Spence and Lewis Wing back to sit on the bench.” The away dugout would have been sparsely populated after key members of Wilder’s backroom staff, including his assistant, Alan Knill, the first-team coach, Matt Prestridge, and Kieran Scott, the director of football, tested positive along with three kit men, a sports scientist and a trio of performance analysts. It would not have been the first return Wilder had wanted to the club he led from League One to the Premier League, played for and supported as a boy. He had never envisaged joking that he might be required to lay out the kit at Bramall Lane and even drive the team bus. Since succeeding Neil Warnock at the Riverside in November, he has presided over a marked upturn in form with promotion-challenging Boro having won four of their past five games, climbing to fifth. He remains adamant he was not crying wolf and insists he had been looking forward to the reunion with Paul Heckingbottom’s recently much improved Sheffield United, regarded by Wilder as potentially the strongest side in the Championship. “I’m a man of integrity and a man of honesty,” Wilder said before the postponement. “I’ll play a game anywhere against anybody on a level playing field and I understand you can’t always play your best side. But we’ve been absolutely decimated. There’s been zero preparation. “Our history as a club in the past two years shows we’ve had minimal Covid issues, our protocols are very tight, we’re not sloppy and we don’t cut corners, but this outbreak has ripped through us. “It’s quite baffling that other games are being called off but we’re having to do our best, with hardly any staff or players, to prepare for a top game in the Championship live on Sky in front of 30,000 people. “I’ve not seen anyone else have to recall anybody from loan. What will Public Health England [now UK Health Security Agency] say about this? There’s obviously an outbreak at our training ground. It’s incredibly confusing.”",Sport/Football,Wilder’s Blades return finally called off after 20 Middlesbrough Covid positives,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/31/chris-wilder-sheffield-united-return-finally-called-off-after-19-middlesbrough-covid-positives
1/1/2022,"They arrived at Bristol Temple Meads train station clutching cans of booze, a change of clothes and this year’s most essential New Year’s Eve accessory – a negative lateral flow test. The closure of nightclubs and restrictions in bars and pubs in Wales was not going to stop a determined band of Welsh fun-seekers hopping across the border for a big night out on the English side of the Severn.  “Mark Drakeford [the Welsh first minister] doesn’t want us to have a good time in Cardiff but he can’t stop us coming over here,” said Luke Spear, a 22-year-old bar worker. “Covid has affected young people a lot. I spent my 21st birthday in lockdown. We’re going to have a good time now.” Gabe Mason, 23, a student from Swansea, said he believed the Welsh government had been too cautious. “I think they have panicked, to be honest with you.” Mason was accompanied by a carrier bag filled with cans of lager. He and a group had booked rooms at a budget hotel. “Usually we would go out in Swansea,” he said. “We’ve all been vaccinated and had boosters so we’re not worried.” The Welsh government has been criticised by many in the hospitality industry for bringing in strict rules while the UK government has allowed a pretty normal New Year’s Eve to take place. Drakeford told people thinking of travelling to England from Wales for New Year’s Eve celebrations to “think consciously and carefully” but stopped short of asking people to stay put. Chanel, a 26-year-old nursing assistant from Cardiff, was planning to dance the night away at Bristol’s Motion club. “I don’t think Omicron is any worse than the flu. We’ll be careful, we’ve all got our negative tests, but we don’t want to miss out any more. We’re here to rave,” she said. Keeley, a bar manager, also 26, said she feared Cardiff would be horribly quiet. “At the place where I work there’s no band and no DJ. They’re stopping serving drinks at 11.30pm. People will be wandering around the streets at midnight. It’s such a shame.” It was not just a Cardiff exodus. Pubs and clubs all along the English side of the border were reporting large numbers of Welsh people arriving. And though the Scottish government asked people not to cross the border for Hogmanay and argued that to do so broke the spirit of its hospitality restrictions, inevitably, some defied the request. Grahame Vallance, who runs the Coach and Horses pub in Carlisle, eight miles from the border, said: “I’ve noticed a lot more Scottish people coming in – a lot of Rangers scarfs, Celtic scarfs. They are still showing caution. It’s not like: ‘Wahoo, let’s get on with it!’” Back at Temple Meads, British Transport Police patrolled the station but the mood was jolly and festive. Amy Norman, 23, of Caerphilly arrived with cans of pre-mixed gin and tonic. She said: “We just wanted a night out. I don’t understand the rules. I don’t see why places have to close in Wales but they can be open in England – it doesn’t make any sense.” Some were heading farther afield. Jake Alexander, 27, a media company worker, was travelling from Wales to London. “It’s time to party,” he said. “A lot of my friends in Cardiff have been crying off events because they are so bored of the rules. Table service is fine when it is quiet but who wants to do that on New Year’s Eve? And the rule of six in Wales is no good when you want to get out there and usher in the new year. So it is Islington for me.” Eve Humphries, 24, who works for an education company, said: “I just want to get on with life. I’m leaving my friends in Cardiff and heading off to stay with friends in London. I don’t want to be looking over my shoulder and people ticking me off for breaking the rules. People of my age want to get out there and live life. I’ve just so, like, had it with rules, rules, rules. I love Wales but not on a dead New Year’s Eve.”",News/UK news,‘Time to party’: roving revellers cross Welsh border to escape Covid rules,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/revellers-cross-welsh-border-escape-covid-rules
1/1/2022,"Official statistics on gender-based violence in Spain will be broadened to include killings of women and children by men regardless of whether there was a prior relationship between victim and killer, in what is being described as a first in Europe. “What is not named does not exist,” said Spain’s equality minister, Irene Montero. “We have to recognise all of the victims and make visible all forms of violence – all machista [sexist] killings – so that we can put in place policies for prevention, early detection and eradication.”  Since 2003 Spain has logged killings as gender violence if there is evidence that the killer and the victim had been or were in a relationship. From Saturday 1 January the definition of gender violence will be broadened to include the murder of any woman or children in which gender is deemed to have played a role. Every case will be analysed, and the statistics will be further divided into five categories ranging from killings linked to sexual exploitation, trafficking or prostitution to the killing of minors – boys and girls – if the crime is believed to have been carried out with the intent of harming a woman. “We’re going to be the first country in Europe to officially count all femicides,” said Montero, describing the move as the “most basic exercise of redress” for victims of male violence. “To name femicides for what they are is to carry out justice,” she added. The move puts Spain’s leftwing government at the vanguard of an approach that focuses on the role that power dynamics, rather than personal relationships, play in gender violence. “We have to repair the machista terror that kills women simply because they are women,” said Montero. The change in record-keeping comes after several high-profile cases that have rocked Spain. Protesters took to streets across the country in June after the discovery of the body of a six-year-old girl believed to have been murdered by her father and dumped at sea. An investigating judge later alleged that the girl and her one-year-old sister were killed by the father to cause “the greatest pain imaginable” to their mother. Statistics kept by the Spanish government show that since 2003 at least 1,125 women have been murdered by their partners or ex-partners, including at least 43 women in 2021.",News/World news,Spain says it is first in Europe to officially count all femicides,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/spain-says-it-is-first-in-europe-to-officially-count-all-femicides
1/1/2022,"Few artists can claim Willem de Kooning and Walt Disney as equal influences in their work. The California painter Wayne Thiebaud was one. Thiebaud, who has died aged 101, signed on as an “in-betweener” at the Disney Studios in Los Angeles as a teenager, filling in the backgrounds to Mickey Mouse cartoons whose figures were drawn by experienced animators. For the rest of his long life, he would be open in his admiration for cartoonists, and for commercial art in general.  Two decades later, in 1956, Thiebaud “went east to meet those heroes of mine”, De Kooning pre-eminent among them. New York, in those days, was in thrall to abstract expressionism. “De Kooning and I could talk endlessly about brushstrokes and so on,” Thiebaud recalled in an interview in 2017. When he got back to Sacramento, he started over again as a painter, returning to the basics – “Shapes, seeing if I could get them to sit on the plane, that kind of thing.” The unlikely meeting place of these two disparate strands in his work was to be patisserie. “If you really look at a lemon meringue pie or a beautiful cake, it’s kind of a work of art,” Thiebaud recalled on turning 100 in 2020. (Asked what kind of cake he would like to celebrate his birthday with, he plumped for the lemon pie.) It was a different filling that was to reveal the potential of pastries as subjects for his art, though. In the early 1960s, Thiebaud set to work on a still life of pumpkin pie – Pieces of Pumpkin (1962), perhaps, or a work like it. “I mixed a big gob of what I thought was the colour and put it on the triangle,” Thiebaud later said. “I was horrified.” Hoping to rescue the painting, he made a second version with an under-drawing of blue and yellow that showed around the filling’s edges. The result of this was to make the orange shimmer, an effect Thiebaud was to dub “halation” and take as his own. “I looked at the picture and said: ‘Boy, if I paint that stuff that’ll be the end of me as a serious artist,’” he mused, half a century later. That Pieces of Pumpkin sold at Christie’s for £1.6m in 2008 suggests how wrong he was. (In 2019, his Encased Cakes of 2010-11 went for £6.2m, a record for his work to date.) Thiebaud’s shortcrusts and butter icing whetted an appetite for his art that even a Stakhanovite output was unable to sate. In part, this was a case of mistaken identity. In 1962, the year of Pieces of Pumpkin, pop art burst on to the American scene. Thiebaud’s pies and cakes were seen as part of the ironising of consumerism that underpinned Andy Warhol’s soup cans or Roy Lichtenstein’s outsized cartoons. This was not quite the case. Its subject notwithstanding, Pieces of Pumpkin is shaped by such modernist concerns as mark-making and the disposition of forms on a grid. That the grid happens to be a diner display cabinet and the marks of Thiebaud’s paint those of gooey pie filling is only part of the story. Josef Albers, a rigorously abstract artist, compared his own painting of squares to the spreading of butter on pumpernickel. Thiebaud’s pastries are as close in spirit to Albers as they are to Warhol, and perhaps more so. If its ingredients remained the same, the meaning of his confectionery changed with time. Iced cakes, in 1962, were as much a symbol of American affluence as were cars with tail fins. When Thiebaud painted Encased Cakes 50 years later, angel food had been supplanted in the California diet by sourdough bread. Piped cream and glacé cherries now spoke of that more innocent time when, as a teenager, Thiebaud had worked behind the counter of a Long Beach deli called Mile High and Red Hot. His work came to seem touched with melancholy, whether or not it actually was. Thiebaud’s father, Morton, a sometime inventor and motor executive, had moved the family to California from Arizona when his son was six months old. Wayne’s mother, Alice (nee Le Baron), then a telephonist, was from an old Mormon family: her grandmother had walked across the plains to Salt Lake City with Brigham Young, the so-called American Moses, pushing a handcart. Morton moved the family back to Utah in 1931, to a small ranch he had managed to buy but lost three years later. If life on a hardscrabble farm was hard, Wayne remembered it as happy. “The Mormon community is very, very intersupportive,” he laughed in old age. “I was what you’d call today, I think, a spoiled child.” By 1934, the family was back in California, where Thiebaud would spend the rest of his life. Sent to the Frank Wiggins Trade School in Los Angeles (later called LA Trade Technical College), he took a course in signpainting that led, briefly, to a job with the department store chain Sears, Roebuck. An undistinguished year at Long Beach Junior College – “I got one credit, and that was in public speaking and athletics,” Thiebaud ruefully confessed – was interrupted by the outbreak of war. This he spent in the US army air force, drawing a cartoon strip called Aleck for a service newspaper and, later, scenery for bomber training films under the command of Capt Ronald Reagan. (“It wasn’t a very pleasant experience,” recalled Thiebaud, a lifelong Democrat.) It was during this time that he met and married Patricia Patterson, in 1943. They had two daughters, Twinka and Mallary, before divorcing in 1958. In 1947, Thiebaud took advantage of the GI bill to train as an art teacher, first in San Jose and then in Sacramento. Realising that teaching would not provide for his growing family, he took a job in the advertising department of the Rexall Drug Company, where he met a commercial artist called Robert Mallary. (Thiebaud’s second daughter would be named in his honour.) The son of a Berkeley professor, the cultivated Mallary also worked as a fine artist, showing with the Allan Stone Gallery in New York. Stone gave Thiebaud a show in 1962: Pieces of Pumpkin was in it. Against the advice of Barnett Newman, who warned him to “lose the pie guy”, Stone would represent Thiebaud until his death in 2006. There was, in both Thiebaud’s life and his art, something deeply American. The formal seriousness of his work was not the only thing that separated it from the glibness of pop. His paintings, like the man who made them, were good-natured and heartfelt. These qualities won Thiebaud the affection of generations of students at the University of California, Davis, where he taught, latterly as an emeritus professor, for 60 years. His pupils at Davis included the polymathic artist, Bruce Nauman. Above all, Thiebaud counted himself “one of those lucky, lucky people”. If he resented being typecast as a painter of pastries, it did not show. A retrospective of his work at the White Cube gallery, London, in 2017 came as a surprise to those visitors who knew him simply as a purveyor of pies. Among the works on display were portraits – the 1966 Green Dress was one – and the so-called Delta landscapes, including the elegiac Fall Fields (2017). The only animus against confectionery Thiebaud owned up to was a dietary one. Asked, at 100, to name a cake that might cheer up a Covid-stricken populace, he replied: “I think I’d rather tell them, be careful about eating too many sweets and watch your vegetables.” Then he added: “Sugar is kind of an enemy of good health.” In 1959, Thiebaud married Betty Jean Carr, who died in 2015. Their son, Paul, died in 2010. Wayne Thiebaud is survived by Twinka and Mallary, by his stepson, the artist Matt Bult, and by six grandchildren.

1/1/2022,"No crowds attended the cortege for Assunta Maresca, better known as Pupetta Maresca, who died at home this week in Castellammare di Stabia aged 86. Maresca, a convicted murderer and mafia boss also known as Lady Camorra, had been the centre of such frenzied media attention in her life that Naples authorities declared she would not have a public send-off. “We are seeing on social media a glorification of this woman who is a symbol of the Camorra in our neighbourhood,” Francesco Emilio Borrelli, a regional councillor for the Europa Verde party, said in a letter to the Naples police. “The mythologising of bosses is to be avoided at all costs.”  Maresca, a tiny woman with great charisma and film-star looks, was the author of her own mythology. She made headlines at the age of 18 when she murdered her husband’s killer in broad daylight – an act of revenge made more dramatic by her youth and beauty, and the fact that she was six months pregnant. “I would do it again in a heartbeat,” she declared at her trial. She was the subject of a number of films (including by the great Francesco Rosi) and TV shows that depicted her as a glamorous avenger. One controversial TV drama was called The Courage and the Passion, and in another fictional treatment of her life she played herself. “Pupetta understood the rules of the game,” said Barbie Latza Nadeau, who interviewed her recently for a forthcoming book. “She kept a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings about her. She enjoyed the publicity. She understood her power and when to play the woman card.” Maresca used publicity to protect herself and to draw attention away from her two brothers, both gangsters. After the notorious serial killer Raffaele Cutolo launched a new criminal organisation to take on the traditional Camorra families, in 1982 she called a press conference and denounced him as a “power-crazed madman”. It was astonishing for a person associated with the mafia – let alone one so glamorous – to make a public declaration, and the press went mad for it. “She knew what she was doing, taking Cutolo on,” said Felia Allum, senior lecturer in Italian and politics at the University of Bath. Gabriella Gribaudi, a professor of contemporary history at the University of Naples, said: “Pupetta Maresca was one of the old school of women bosses – she was ahead of her time. There have been many others since. Women have a much more prominent role in the Camorra than in the other mafias, just as they do in the rest of society in Naples.” Women such as Anna Moccia, “the Black Widow”, and Maria Licciardi, “the Little One”, are figures of considerable power in the Camorra. Moccia had four sons, and when her husband was killed she took the decision to fight rather than flee, and sent her 13-year-old son into the Naples courthouse with a gun to shoot his father’s killer. Licciardi took the reins of the clan after her brothers went to prison. Her nephew, known as “the Little Prince”, carried out a series of hits on her command. “Both women wiped out their enemies over time,” said Gribaudi. “And they ran the clan’s business affairs very successfully.” The business affairs of the clans, in the case of the Naples Camorra, have kept the city and its satellite towns in a state of critical underinvestment, unemployment and cyclical poverty for about 150 years. The Camorra has infiltrated local authorities and run public works contracts for roads, schools and hospitals like a cartel. The Camorra’s brand of loan sharking typically involves an enforced “partnership” in which the original owner loses control of their business. In this way, the clans have come to dominate the economic lives of citizens across much of the region. Women in Naples traditionally control loan sharking and extortion, for which violence or the threat of violence is considered essential. The Contini Bosti group consolidated its power when three sisters, Anna, Maria and Rita Aieta, married three bosses and brought the families together. After their husbands were arrested, the three sisters took over the business and ran the extortion racket very successfully. “When they went to make collections they would take female muscle,” said Gribaudi. The sisters also have a keen eye for branding. They drive identical yellow Smart cars, so people know they’re coming. The Giuliano family from Forcella cultivated a rock-star image, protected by a cult-like following in the neighbourhood. Erminia Giuliano, known as Celeste for her bright blue eyes, took over the family business when her brothers became collaborators (pentiti), which she defiantly refused to do. Already famous for her friendship with Diego Maradona, she cultivated a glamorous public image. “Celeste has had affairs with men from clans at war with her own,” said Gribaudi. “It’s a high-risk game she’s playing, but she gets away with it because she has charisma.” When police arrested Celeste in 2001, she insisted on having her hair and makeup done before she emerged for the perp walk. She had learned from the master, Pupetta Maresca. “Pupetta knew how to show her power,” said Allum, “which is traditionally a male trait. She never hid.”",News/World news,‘She understood her power’: the death of mafia boss Pupetta Maresca,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/she-understood-her-power-the-death-of-mafia-boss-pupetta-maresca
1/1/2022,"Spain registered record-breaking temperatures this week and areas of the Italian Alps are forecast to reach up to 15C above the seasonal average in the coming days as much of Europe experiences an anomalously warm start to the new year. In Bilbao, northern Spain, temperatures hit 24.7C, a high not seen since record-keeping began in 1947. In Segovia, near Madrid, 22.7C was recorded, the highest since 1920, and nearby Avila reached 20.2C, its highest since 1983.  “These high temperatures are not normal,” said Rubén del Campo, a spokesperson for the state meteorological agency AEMET. “These are temperatures that you would normally see in the month of April.” He attributed the year-end heat to a mass of hot air over Spain combined with high pressure. “It’s a normal phenomenon that we do see, but what’s strange this time is the high temperatures we’re seeing.” Scientists have long predicted that the climate crisis and global heating would lead to more frequent extreme weather, although random extreme events occur naturally. The high-pressure anticyclone has shifted to France and Italy, and alpine rescuers have warned of a risk of avalanches. Luca Mercalli, a meteorologist, said: “At the moment it is about 15C in areas of the Alps at an altitude of 1,600 metres and is not hitting zero beneath 4,000 metres. It hasn’t even been freezing at night – the temperature has not dropped below 10 degrees, and this is very unusual.” Temperatures in some of Italy’s best-known ski resorts, including Cortina d’Ampezzo and Courmayeur, are forecast to be 13-15C above the seasonal norm on New Year’s Day, and the balmy weather is expected to linger until 3 January. Ski resorts at an altitude of up to 2,000 metres are bereft of snow. “And they can’t produce artificial snow as the temperature is too warm,” said Mercalli. Italy’s alpine rescue service has advised skiers to regularly check weather bulletins owing to the risk of avalanches. “The elevated temperature combined with strong winds create the conditions for avalanches,” Mercalli said. The rest of Italy is also experiencing abnormally warm conditions, with a high of 18C expected in Rome on Saturday and 22C in the Sicilian city of Catania by the middle of next week. In Spain, the high temperatures cap off a year that began with a deadly snowstorm that blanketed large parts of the country in snow and brought Madrid to a standstill. “It’s been a year of extremes,” Del Campo said. The snowstorm left some municipalities grappling with temperatures as low as -25C, while days later the coastal city of Alicante hit 30C. “We’ve never seen -25 and nearly 30C in the same month,” said Del Campo. “That’s not something we’ve ever seen in Spain.” Italy also experienced extreme weather events in 2021, with Siracusa in Sicily believed to have broken the European record for the highest temperature, reaching 48.8C in August.",News/World news,"24C in Spain, 15C in the Alps: oddly warm end to 2021 in parts of Europe",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/24c-in-spain-15c-in-the-alps-oddly-warm-end-to-2021-in-parts-of-europe
