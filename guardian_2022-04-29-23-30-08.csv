4/29/2022,"If Liverpool are to stumble in their pursuit of Manchester City then it would not be completely surprising if it came at St James’ Park. Eddie Howe – with the help of a considerable amount of money – has transformed Newcastle from relegation fodder to the Premier League’s most upwardly mobile team. Four wins on the spin has lifted them to ninth and they are an even tougher proposition at home where they have won their past six. That is unlikely to prove too daunting for a Liverpool side boosted by the news of Jürgen Klopp’s contract extension and who have won 13 of their past 14 in the league – the only blip a 2-2 draw with City – while going unbeaten since 28 December.

4/29/2022,"AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot has called on the government to provide access to its Covid-19 medicine Evusheld, saying it’s a “sad situation” that Britain is one of the few developed nations not to have ordered the drug, designed for those with poor immune systems. His comments came as the company flagged declining sales of its Covid vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford. Strong performances by other medicines for cancer, diabetes and other conditions catapulted overall sales 60% higher to $11.4bn in the first three months of the year, despite the pandemic affecting cancer diagnosis rates. Last month the firm received UK regulatory approval for its long-acting Covid-19 antibody treatment Evusheld, in a boost to its coronavirus portfolio. Aimed at preventing Covid infections in immunocompromised people who cannot be vaccinated, Evusheld had already been approved in the US, France and other countries, and the US government has ordered 1.7m doses. It is a combination of two long-acting antibodies that works by binding to the spike protein on the virus’s membrane that causes Covid-19, preventing it from attaching to and entering human cells. “The UK is probably one of the rare developed countries in the world that has not ordered Evusheld. It’s a sad situation, quite frankly, because people who are immune-compromised are really suffering from the Covid crisis,” Soriot said, adding they were at greater risk now that Covid restrictions have been lifted. “They also represent a pretty large proportion of the people who are hospitalised for Covid, so they do need access to this medicine.” The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker made sales of $1.1bn from the Covid jab between January and March, and $469m from Evusheld. It has moved away from not-for-profit pricing in new Covid vaccine contracts, but insists that it still supplies it at affordable rates. It reiterated that revenues from the jab are set to decline in coming quarters. Soriot explained: “We are no longer in a period of scarcity of vaccine supply. We have oversupply everywhere in the world, so what’s out there needs to be used, and then we’ll be able to get a better sense for reordering.” He said the vaccine had shown itself to be a “very strong booster”. The jab has not yet received approval in the US, and Soriot said the company remains in discussions with the US regulator, and hopes to wrap these up soon.",News/Business,AstraZeneca head calls for UK to provide new Covid-19 medicine to the vulnerable,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/evusheld-covid-19-medicine-astrazeneca-immunosuppressed-vulnerable-uk
4/29/2022,"William Barr, Donald Trump’s former attorney general, said in an interview on Thursday that it would be a “big mistake” for the Republican party to nominate Trump for president in 2024. Appearing on the Newsmax television channel, Barr said Trump, who has hinted that he will run again, would not be a sound choice. “I don’t think he should be our nominee – the Republican party nominee,” Barr said. “And I think Republicans have a big opportunity – it would be a big mistake to put him forward.” In a poll in January 57% of Republican voters said they would choose Trump in 2024. Trump also won the less scientific Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll, in February, by a large margin. Trump, who was impeached twice during his four years in the White House, has repeatedly teased his supporters with suggestions he will run again. “We did it twice, and we’ll do it again,” Trump told a crowd at the CPAC convention – claiming again that he won the 2020 election. “We’re going to be doing it again a third time.” Still, Barr’s remarks will be sure to anger Trump, who has repeatedly clashed with his former attorney general since losing the 2020 election. In Barr’s book, One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General, he wrote that Trump had “shown he has neither the temperament nor persuasive powers to provide the kind of positive leadership that is needed”. Trump, Barr said, has surrounded himself with “sycophants” and “whack jobs from outside the government, who fed him a steady diet of comforting but unsupported conspiracy theories”. Trump responded by calling Barr “slow” and “lethargic”. “When the Radical Left Democrats threatened to Hold him in contempt and even worse, Impeach him, he became virtually worthless to Law and Order and Election Integrity. They broke him just like a trainer breaks a horse.” Trump had previously called Barr a “swamp creature” and a “Rino [Republican in Name Only] … afraid, weak and frankly … pathetic”.",News/US news,Barr: it would be ‘big mistake’ for Republicans to nominate Trump in 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/william-barr-donald-trump-2024-nomination-republians-big-mistake
4/29/2022,"Just Stop Oil’s disruptive protests, blamed for petrol shortages across parts of England, have been funded by US philanthropists who say they want to incite a global “spring uprising” over climate change. The environmental activists, whose oil terminal blockades have enraged ministers and rightwing commentators, have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the New York-based Climate Emergency Fund (CEF). “We’re their lead institutional funder,” CEF’s executive director, Margaret Klein Salamon, said. “I think actually their exclusive institutional funder at this point.” On Friday, eight Just Stop Oil activists were still being held after 43 were arrested for allegedly blockading and smashing petrol pumps at service stations on London’s M25 orbital motorway. About 400 people have been arrested more than 1,000 times taking part in the campaign since it began less than a month ago, according to organisers’ own tally. “A lot of groups we fund use civil disobedience and high stakes civil disobedience,” Salamon said. “But Just Stop Oil to me is the next stage, the next evolution of climate campaigning, in that they really seem to me to be operating as a nonviolent army with that level of discipline, planning, coordination. “I’m so impressed with what they’ve been able to do with extremely slim resources and, you know, not that many activists.” This year CEF has paid $1.7m to activists in 25 countries, including the UK, the US, Australia Canada, France, Germany and Switzerland. It has particularly focused on the UK with $650,000 given this year to groups including Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. Salamon confirmed CEF had paid Just Stop Oil hundreds of thousands of dollars. Extinction Rebellion had received about $200,000 from the fund this year, she said. CEF has earmarked $1.3m of its donations for a “spring uprising” to revive the climate protest movement. Before Covid, Salamon said, “the movement was just on absolutely an upswing, gaining so much momentum, with Earth Day 2020 supposed to be the largest environmental demonstration in history”. “Covid just absolutely took the wind out of its sails and so this uprising this April is the answer to that, as far as I’m concerned. It’s like, OK, the movement’s back and there’s energy. Just Stop Oil and Scientists Rebellion are great examples of how it’s not just back, it’s levelled up during the last two years.” Insulate Britain, whose roadblock protests last autumn polarised public opinion but catalysed a national debate around its demand to insulate every home, were also funded by CEF. This year, it is funding nine groups in various different countries copying the road blockade tactic. CEF operated like venture capital, according to Salamon, seeking out small groups who could benefit hugely from $50,000 to $100,000 donations that would barely make a difference to the larger environmental charities. “We’re looking for ultra-ambitious groups and campaigns, generally that are quite new, that have a plan to scale up and make a huge impact,” Salamon said. Direct action, in which those taking part put themselves in either legal or personal peril, was preferred as a way to communicate the urgency of the crisis. Salamon insisted CEF does not fund any illegal activity. “What we do fund is recruitment, training, organising staff, core staff, etc … and we fund legal protest and disruption,” she said. “The fact that some of these groups get into harder edged civil disobedience, that’s their choice. And we think that from a historic and social science perspective, it’s very well supported, and we commend their bravery in doing so.” All the groups funded by the CEF must be committed to non-violence. “And we don’t fund groups, presently, that allow their membership to take action while concealing their identities,” Salamon said. Donations to CEF come mainly from wealthy individuals and family foundations. The fund was started with a $500,000 donation from Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of Jean Paul Getty whose petrochemical empire made him the world’s richest man, a source of some controversy in the climate activist world. Adam McKay, the producer and screenwriter behind the climate change satire Don’t Look Up, had just donated $250,000, “particularly inspired by Just Stop Oil”, Salamon said. Concerns have been raised bout the funding of direct action groups by wealthy individuals. Extinction Rebellion, in particular, has been vague on its economic critique of the fossil fuel economy. Salamon said she was aware of concerns around “capitalist corruption” but she insisted that the CEF did not demand its grantees tone down their protests or critique. She pointed out that Scientists Rebellion had explicitly called for economic de-growth. Other groups have targeted banks and corporations. “I think that we need to solve the climate emergency from the system we have,” Salamon said. “That doesn’t mean we don’t transform it, we absolutely have to, but I think we need to channel capital from wealthy individuals to the movement and to the cause of just emergency speed decarbonisation and restoring a safe climate, and living within planetary limits.” CEF was keen to be more transparent about the work it was doing – and hopefully attract more donors, Salamon said. “And listen, regarding the abuse, which I totally agree is coming, if the activists can take it, so can we,” she said.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil’s ‘spring uprising’ protests funded by US philanthropists,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/just-stop-oils-protests-funded-by-us-philanthropists
4/29/2022,"Amid mounting fears among western officials that Russia’s war in Ukraine could drag on for months or years, the Kremlin appears to be focusing its operations around the city of Izium as part of renewed efforts to seize the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. According to Ukrainian military officials, Russian forces have been massing fresh forces around the city, 75 miles south east of Kharkiv on the Donets river, as well as around the Russian city of Belgorod across the border. There are unconfirmed claims that the chief of the Russian general staff, Valery Gerasimov, has been put in command of the push. In the past week alone, Moscow has added 13 battalion tactical groups to the forces fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine, representing between 10,000 and 13,000 extra troops. The mounting scale of the offensive around Izium comes as an unnamed US official suggested on Thursday that some Russian troops who had been fighting in the southern port city of Mariupol were being pushed north west, perhaps as part of an effort to encircle areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions still under Ukrainian control. According to the latest update from the Institute for the Study of War, Russian forces appeared to be seeking to bypass Izium to avoid getting bogged down in fighting there, instead heading in the direction of Slovyansk, an assessment was echoed by the most recent Ukrainian updates. “Russian forces attacking [the] southwest from Izium likely seek to bypass Ukrainian defences on the direct road to Slovyansk,” read the institute’s update, noting that Russian forces had only made minor gains in the past 24 hours. It added, however, that “additional Russian reinforcements continue to deploy to Belgorod to support the Izium advance”. Russian forces appear to be attempting to break through the Ukrainian defences on a salient to the north-east of Slovyansk, while attempting to encircle Ukrainian forces to the east at Severodonetsk. The new focus of the Kremlin’s war – aimed at building a broad land bridge from the Russian border to occupied Crimea and beyond – has come with a shift in tactics to a slower and more deliberate advance as the Russian military has continued to struggle with logistics and other problems in managing its campaign. The latest stage of the offensive has been marked by an increased concentration of artillery, and the use of artillery fire, to support the slowly advancing Russian troops, with a Pentagon official describing “slow and uneven” progress in fierce fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. According to a Pentagon official quoted by the New York Times, Russian troops, however, are still only making “incremental” progress in the campaign around Izium. Commenting on the reported appointment of Gerasimov to personally command the offensive “at the operational and tactical level”, the Institute for the Study of War said that, if confirmed, it would “indicate both the importance of the Izium drive to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the breakdown in the Russian military’s normal chain of command”. With the failure of its attempted coup de main against Kyiv in the initial weeks of the war, which saw Russian special forces infiltrate perilously close to where Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was sheltering, Moscow has settled on a tactic of slowly grinding away at Ukrainian resistance. And while Moscow has lost thousands of troops and hundreds of armoured vehicles, Ukraine’s spending on ammunition and weapons systems has also left it depleted, explaining the huge $33bn (£26.3bn) military aid package announced this week by US president Joe Biden. All of which has not only raised the spectre of a long war, but the risk that in the end – as Boris Johnson said a week ago – Russia might prevail. “We need to be prepared for the long term,” Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary general, told a summit in Brussels this week. “There is absolutely the possibility that this war will drag on and last for months and years.” That assessment followed comments by Boris Johnson, made while visiting Delhi last week, that painted an equally pessimistic picture, including the prospect of a Russian victory. “I think the sad thing is that that is a realistic possibility,” he said. “Putin has a huge army. He has a very difficult political position because he’s made a catastrophic blunder. “The only option he now has really is to continue to try to use his appalling grinding approach led by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down. “He’s very close to securing a land bridge in Mariupol. The situation is, I’m afraid, unpredictable at this stage, but we’ve just got to be realistic about it.” That pessimism has been driven by a number of factors. Even while Bulgaria has offered to help Ukraine export its wheat via the port of Varna, Russia’s naval blockade of Ukraine’s coast remains significantly damaging. In the short term, despite the heavy losses of men and material, Russian forces still have easier access to equipment resupplies until US and other western arms supplies step up, including a significant advantage in deployed naval and air forces. And while the United States and the western community believes Ukraine “can win” the war against Russia – a view expressed by US defence secretary Lloyd Austin after his recent visit to Ukraine it is likely to involve a bloody and protracted entanglement.",News/World news,Russia’s push into eastern Ukraine comes amid fears of a protracted war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-eastern-ukraine-push-protracted-war
4/29/2022,"Last year, over a quarter of a million British women took an online test for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The condition is most commonly diagnosed in childhood, but with cases routinely being missed in schoolgirls – just one is referred for every four boys – many women may find themselves wondering later in life. I asked Tony Lloyd, CEO of ADHD Foundation, what they need to know. What are the symptoms of ADHD?There are three core characteristics: impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity. You only have to have two to get a diagnosis. It’s about the intensity of those characteristics right? Because I imagine most people experience all those things regularly. I sure do.It can be overwhelming. And impulsivity is not just impulsive actions; it’s impulsivity of emotion and thought. So you go to bed and you’re exhausted, but you can’t sleep because your mind is still racing. Oof, that last bit sounded way too familiar.Anybody who is really stressed is going to look a bit like they’ve got ADHD. But whereas anxiety is a direct response to environmental stresses, ADHD is an innate genetic cognitive impairment, which can be exacerbated by stress. If somebody’s got anxiety, once you remove the stresses, the response goes. With ADHD, it’s more constant. So if someone’s reading this thinking, “This sounds like me”, what next?There is a free booklet on our website about what ADHD is, and ways to manage it. I’d caution everybody to read that first – because you can’t expect your GP to know how ADHD presents in adults. They’re not trained. Even many general psychiatrists aren’t. If you think you’re still struggling and need medication, ask for an appointment with an ADHD specialist. The problem is, there’s a three- to five-year waiting list for adults. And nearly half of all new adult diagnoses are made by private clinicians. Blimey. So why has testing increased so suddenly? Is it just greater awareness? I know a number of celebrities – singer Solange Knowles, reality star Olivia Attwood – have opened up about their adult ADHD diagnoses.I think so, though the pandemic may be a factor. When most people leave education, they gravitate towards careers where they can play to their strengths and have strategies. But during lockdown, routines, structure and support mechanisms were disrupted. So people may have found themselves struggling, having coped for a long time, and begun asking why. I still don’t really get why schoolgirls in particular have been so underdiagnosed.ADHD correlates with neurodevelopmental delay. So certain parts of the brain develop more slowly. Girls mature quicker than boys, so that immaturity appears more obvious in boys. Also, girls are more likely to mask anxiety that comes from a difficulty with cognitive functioning. One more thing, Tony – how many people are estimated to have ADHD?Roughly one in 20 people. We know that one in 10 have dyslexia, one in 60 have autism – and in fact roughly one-fifth of the human population are neurodiverse. One in five people can’t be seen as errors of genetics. We have to acknowledge there is diversity of human neurocognitive capacity and we’re all the richer for it.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Could I have undiagnosed ADHD?

4/29/2022,"On a recent trip to Spain, I noticed something called torrijas on the dessert menu. A quick Google told me to expect French toast, but what arrived couldn’t have been farther from what I’d imagined. The first surprise was that it was cold, and the second was a crunchy layer of caramelised sugar on top covering a pillowy-soft, custardy interior infused with orange and cinnamon. I’ve since discovered there are many regional variations, so this is my attempt to recreate the dish I tried that day. Prep 5 minCook 45 minServes 8 ½ loaf white farmhouse bread350ml milk100ml double creamPeel of 1 large orange1 cinnamon stick4 egg yolks50g caster sugar, plus extra to top50g unsalted butter Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas mark 3. Cut the loaf into four slices about 4cm thick, trim off the crusts and cut each slice in half. Put the bread on a tray and bake, turning occasionally, for 15–20 minutes, until the slices feel dry to the touch. Remove and leave to cool. In a small saucepan, gently heat the milk, cream, orange peel and cinnamon stick until warmed through, then take off the heat, cover and leave to steep for 20 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy, strain the warm milk into the egg mix and whisk again. Pour into a shallow bowl. Dip a couple of slices of bread into the milk, turning them around to soak evenly on both sides, then leave them to sit in the milk for five minutes. Transfer to a plate – be careful because they’ll be very soft and delicate – then repeat with the remaining bread and custard. Put about a tablespoon of butter in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat. Once the butter has melted, sprinkle a heaped teaspoon of caster sugar evenly on top, then fry the bread two slices at a time for five to six minutes, turning occasionally, until browned and caramelised. If serving warm, scatter a little more caster sugar over the top of the bread slices, use a blowtorch (or grill) to heat the sugar until it bubbles and caramelises, then serve with custard or ice-cream. If you’re having the torrijas cold, leave them to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until well chilled. Just before serving, sugar the tops and blowtorch.

4/29/2022,"As the cost-of-living crisis bites, and households look for any opportunity to cut the bills, headlines suggesting consumers can save hundreds of pounds just by turning off unused chargers have been an appealing prospect. But, experts say, such claims about “vampire devices” are actually more like a zombie statistic. “Things have dramatically improved since those studies were first carried out,” said Craig Melson, an associate director for climate, environment and sustainability at techUK. “Processors are low-power, screens have switched from LCD to LED technology, fridges and washing machines have become more efficient. Technology is just more miniaturised, more efficient, using better processors – and, crucially, they are more adaptable as well.” One recent report from British Gas claimed “Brits could … save an average of £110 per household per year by simply flicking a switch”. The energy provider said 23% of British energy bills were caused by “vampire electronics, those that continue to drain power when left on standby”. But that statistic came from a 2015 report from the US National Research Defence Council, based on analysis of homes in California. “Think about the laptop you used 10 years ago,” Melson says: “That might need a big ugly plug in the middle, a big transformer. By and large, now you can just plug them straight into USB-C: that is much more energy efficient, and there is no need to draw power.” As well as being seven years old and based on another country’s energy, consumers may struggle to make some of the suggested savings: a third of the “always on” electronics identified in the study are “recirculation pumps, fishponds, aquariums, and protected outlets in bathrooms, kitchens and garages.” Consumers who switch off their aquarium at night can save money but their fish may object. Other devices included in the 23% figure are left on because they are intended to run all the time: wifi routers and electric space heaters or air conditioning units increase the electricity used by a home but provide benefits while doing so. More importantly, Melson notes, American consumers are not covered by the array of European regulations that have slashed power use for British consumers. He said: “The eco-design directive, European regulation, has driven design changes across the sector. It’s much more regulated, and business practices have evolved.” The US report that first found the 23% figure even highlights the advantages of European regulation: “The European standard addresses a large portion of the idle load issue highlighted in this study,” the American researchers say. Other claims of “vampire devices” reach even further back. In October, the UK’s Energy Saving Trust claimed a modest £35 saving from turning off devices on standby each year, citing a 2013 report that itself accounted for the energy use of devices including a VCR, largely discontinued in 2004, and a PlayStation 2, first produced in 2000. For consumers who want to save electricity, Melson says, a better focus is to examine the “eco mode” settings on devices such as TVs and games consoles, turning off features such as auto-updates to reduce the standby use further. British Gas did not reply to requests for comment.",Lifestyle/Money,Tech expert slays myth of energy-guzzling ‘vampire devices’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/29/tech-expert-energy-vampire-devices
4/29/2022,"Boxers can train with one hand tied behind their back, snooker players can practise with smaller pockets and golfers can hit heavier balls on the range but they’d all claim that nothing really prepares you for a true test in the white heat of battle. It explains why the eyes of England’s head coach Simon Middleton light up when discussing his side’s grand slam decider in France on Saturday, when they will put a 22-match winning run on the line against the last team to beat them in the Six Nations, four years ago. For all that England speak of squad rotation in the early rounds, of improving quarter-by-quarter throughout each match, of using internal pressure to maintain their high standards, the three-times defending champions are evidently aching for the kind of challenge that few teams pose. France are one of those and the fixture takes on far greater significance with the delayed World Cup to be held this autumn in New Zealand – arguably the only other team on a similar level. There is a certain irony that his England men’s counterpart, Eddie Jones, is criticised for prioritising the World Cup and treating the Six Nations as second-rate whereas Middleton is happy to admit that his side are not the finished article and, “that’s the very last thing we want to be at this point in time”, but perhaps it is an unfair comparison considering this is the first time the annual championship has had a title sponsor and there is still no prize money on offer. Saturday’s fixture must therefore be seen in the context of the World Cup and while you could put the mortgage on both sides making the knockout stages, the fact England and France are in the same pool adds further spice. “It is winner takes all which is literally what knockout rugby is, whether it’s quarter-final, semi-final or final so it is certainly brilliant practice for the occasions hopefully we’ll be a part of later in the year,” says England’s captain for the day, Emily Scarratt. “Winner takes all games are different, they come with pressure naturally, but they are brilliant tests and you don’t get to play in them particularly often. The way the Six Nations has panned out it gives us that opportunity.” If the World Cup narrative is inescapable, the fact the competition has reached Saturday’s climax – like England, France have won all four matches – is no surprise. It would have been a huge shock had either side been beaten hitherto and if it makes for a prescribed sense of theatre on the final weekend of the championship, the standard of competition so far has not matched the burgeoning interest. England arrived in the Basque country on Monday on the back of two consecutive record crowds and Saturday’s clash has long been a sell-out. If the Stade Jean Dauger in Bayonne were not undergoing renovation there would be considerably more than the 11,000 expected and the fact it will be broadcast on BBC2 is also significant. How the organiser could do with a contest, with a one-score game with five minutes to go, though, because dominant superiority does little to advance a developing sport and as much as England are bracing themselves for a sterner test, there remains the possibility that they could sweep France aside. The French press certainly make England favourites. Inevitably the chance to follow in the footsteps of Antoine Dupont’s side has been mentioned plenty this week – their under-18s sides were both triumphant too – but France have not put away Scotland, Ireland and Wales with the same imperiousness as England. They average 35 points per match to England’s 64.5, have scored 20 tries to England’s 42 and it was telling to hear their scrum-half Laure Sansus concede that they have nothing to lose. Still, the hope is that the hostile crowd in Bayonne knocks England from their stride and it says a lot about the occasion that Middleton describes it as the toughest match in the international game at present. Arguably, though, that says more about the plight of the Black Ferns, winners of five of the last six World Cups but comfortably beaten by both England and France last autumn. The decision to call on the services of Wayne Smith to shake things up before their home tournament is, in the main, a compliment to both England and France. “For us [the match] has a number of values – winning the tournament first and foremost with a Six Nations and a grand slam that comes with it,” says Middleton. “But it’s the probably the toughest game you can play in international rugby at this moment in time, France in France, so for us it will be a benchmark or a proving point of where we’re at and that’s probably as important for us, given the nature of this year, as any result.” While tournament officials may not want to hear it, that is Middleton’s priority. He describes the match as “win-win – but I know which side of that we want to be on” but you sense he would not be despondent if his side are behind on the scoreboard in the closing stages. It was the kind of thing you’d hear the All Blacks saying around the time the British & Irish Lions were touring in 2017. Back then it sounded like face-saving, bordering on arrogance, but look at how their Super Rugby teams no longer face the South African franchises – something the All Blacks head coach Ian Foster lamented this week – or how the Springboks are making overtures towards the Six Nations and the problem presented by the absence of genuine competition becomes clear. The depth of genuine quality in the women’s game is considerably shallower than the men’s so it stands to reason that England, just like France, feel they have little to lose on Saturday. “We’ll come up against a side who will be stronger defensively than we’ve played and I’d imagine the share of possession will be even and we’ve tended to dominate possession,” says Middleton. “Less possession means you’ve got to be more clinical. The key is that it’s winner takes all and they come so few and far between. They are really special occasions to be involved in. Why are we in the business? To get to these moments so we can see how good we are.”",Sport/Sport,England embrace ‘winner-takes-all’ Six Nations showdown with France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/england-embrace-winner-takes-all-six-nations-showdown-with-france

Shares retreated to an 18% gain at midday in London. Johnson Matthey has a 205-year history in Britain’s chemicals sector, but it has struggled in recent years. In November, it abandoned an effort to become a leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles, to the dismay of the UK automotive industry. The company’s roots go back to testing precious metals in 1817. It later became one of the world’s main suppliers to the automotive industry as rising awareness of pollution risks prompted the introduction of catalytic converters. The catalytic converters business made it into one of Britain’s biggest companies, but it was demoted from the FTSE 100 index of blue chips in December after investors questioned what it would do when sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines are replaced by electric cars with no exhaust emissions. Its share price hit a high of £25 on Friday, its highest since November, but still well below the £30 to £35 levels reached regularly since 2013, leaving it vulnerable to a takeover. Standard is a privately held conglomerate with interests in specialty chemicals, building materials, property and investments. Last year it bought chemicals business Grace. The fund that bought the stake is controlled by Standard’s co-chief executives. The Johnson Matthey investment will probably increase scrutiny on chief executive Liam Condon, who only started as Johnson Matthey’s chief executive in March after the retirement of Robert MacLeod. Condon is reviewing company strategy, and is scheduled to update investors on 26 May, but he has said the company will in future focus on the chemicals needed for “decarbonisation, hydrogen technologies and circularity”. Condon is also selling the company’s business providing specialist chemicals for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Charles Bentley, an equity analyst at Jefferies, a US investment bank, said Standard would be “something like an ideal owner for the JM business”. A deal would offer “operational overlap” on the business providing chemical catalysts to other manufacturers, and “an ability to take a long-term view” on what to do with the money from continued sales of catalytic converters for cars. Johnson Matthey declined to comment. Standard Industries was approached for comment.",News/Business,Johnson Matthey shares soar after US conglomerate buys stake,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/johnson-matthey-shares-soar-after-us-conglomerate-buys-stake
4/29/2022,"Tens of thousands of domestic abuse survivors have been “forced to continue living under the shadow of their abusers” in the decade since access to legal aid was scaled back, research suggests. About 34,000 people are estimated to have been denied support allowing them to seek orders to help remove attackers out of the family home or prevent them from returning at will. The House of Commons library also calculated that since the law was changed 10 years ago, the proportion of domestic abuse cases funded by legal aid had fallen from 75% to 47%. Emily Thornberry, Labour’s shadow attorney general, blamed the “wilful cruelty” of the coalition government, which she said had been “perpetuated by their successors in the current cabinet”. She added that urgent reform of the legal aid system was needed to “avoid a second lost decade for the survivors of domestic abuse and their children”. The Legal Aid, Sentencing, and Punishment of Offenders Act was introduced in May 2012 and sought to impose capital and income limits for applicants for civil legal aid. On the 10th anniversary of the legislation coming into effect, the Commons library was asked to review the impact. It found that real-terms spending on civil legal aid for domestic abuse cases had fallen by 37% from 2020-11 compared with 2020-21. Officials said it was “not possible to say exactly how many people have become ineligible who would otherwise have been able”. But they found the ratio of domestic abuse cases that received legal aid compared with those without it fell from 0.75 in 2012-13 to 0.5 in 2020-21. If the ratio had stayed the same, the Commons library forecasted that 41,000 more people would have been eligible for legal aid in domestic abuse cases. Excluding roughly 17% of recipients who are alleged perpetrators, it concluded: “Around 34,000 alleged victims might have been eligible for legal aid since 2012-13, were it not for the changes brought in.” The true number could be higher, the findings said. A note about the statistics added it was “likely that some people are put off applying to the family court to settle matters where domestic abuse is involved because they already know they are not eligible for legal aid”. Thornberry said the law change had been pushed through by ministers who were “hellbent on driving through their austerity agenda on the backs of the most vulnerable in society, even at the expense of their duty to protect the safety of women”. She said tens of thousands of women were being “forced to continue living under the shadow of their abusers”. Thornberry added: “We need urgent reform of our legal aid system to avoid a second lost decade for the survivors of domestic abuse and their children. We cannot have another 10 years when those women desperately turning to the government for help against their abusers find the door slammed in their face.” The Ministry of Justice was contacted for comment.",News/Society,"Thousands of domestic abuse survivors denied help after legal aid cuts, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/thousands-of-domestic-abuse-survivors-denied-help-after-legal-aid-cuts-study-finds
4/29/2022,"From academic works giving women a supporting role to hunter-gather men, to Raquel Welch’s portrayal of a bikini-clad cavewoman in the 1966 film One Million Years BC, the gender division of the stone age is firmly entrenched in public consciousness. While men strode out to spear woolly mammoths, women, as mothers or exploited objects of male desire, sheltered in caves from the violent world, according to an understanding said to be increasingly removed from the latest research. The historians and film-makers behind Lady Sapiens: the Woman in Prehistory, a French book and documentary to be published in the UK in September, say they are now seeking to debunk the simplistic division of roles by highlighting advances in the study of bones, graves, art and ethnography often ignored in the public sphere. “For a long time, prehistory was written from the male point of view, and when women were mentioned, they were portrayed as helpless, frightened creatures, protected by overly powerful male hunters,” Sophie de Beaune, a professor in pre-history at the Université Jean-Moulin-Lyon III, writes in the book’s preface. “Since women have begun to enter the ranks of prehistorians, a different picture has gradually emerged. “The reader will perhaps be astonished to find that men’s and women’s roles were not so clearcut, and that it was cooperation between all members of the group, regardless of their gender or age, which ensured their survival,” she writes. Today’s cliches, the book suggests, have largely been formed by a lack of interest in the role of women among the 19th-century pioneers of research. It is the imposition of the cultural understandings of that period on the scholarship, and a welter of art ranging from Paul Jamin’s 1888 artwork Dangerous Encounter and A Rape in the Stone Age to Don Chaffey’s One Million Years BC, that “pushes this eroticization to its limit – embodied by sex symbol Raquel Welch”. Thomas Cirotteau, one of documentary makers behind the book with Jennifer Kerner and Éric Pincas, said the purpose was not to portray the pre-historic woman – black-skinned and largely blue-eyed – as a “superwoman” but to “widen the possibilities as to her role”. “She could hunt. She had a very important economic role. She could do art, and the link between men and women could be very respectful and full of tenderness,” he said. Focusing on the Upper Paleolithic period of 10,000 to 40,000 years ago, the book highlights the etchings found on stone plaquette at the Paleolithic site of Gönnersdorf in Germany, of a woman with a baby carrier on her back, allowing her hands to be free for hunting and foraging. The documentarians note studies of skeletons that reveal the strength of the upper arm muscles of women, and a recent finding at Peru’s Wilamaya Patjxa site of evidence of humans hunting big game. Five burial sites were excavated and six individuals were exhumed. Two of them were found with hunting tools: a man in his 30s, and a young woman under the age of 20. Twenty-four stone artefacts had been placed in the young woman’s tomb, comprising a toolkit of everything needed to hunt and butcher big game: six projectile points, four scrapers, a knife and several chipped flakes of stone. Ten sites in the US from the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene (between 12,000 and 8,000 BCE) yielded 11 burial sites where women have been interred alongside weapons, suggesting that the discovery in Peru has wider significance. De Beaune notes in the book that the importance of small-game hunting has also been underplayed by researchers, along with fishing, gathering shellfish or hunting small marine animals, all activities women were likely to have been involved in. Being a mother was just one facet of the lives of women of that period. They were not continually pregnant, the latest understanding of the diet and lifestyle of the age suggests. Studies of the carbon, strontium and calcium in bones suggest that children remained breastfed until the age of four, a practice that reduces fertility. Vincent Balter, director of France’s Centre for National Research, writes in the book: “As Paleolithic women were able to bear children until they were about 30, if we say breastfeeding went on for two or three years, and they gave birth to their first child at around fourteen, that gives us a maximum of five or six births per woman.” The book also posits that women achieved high status within their communities. The site of the Lady of Cavillon, the remains of a woman buried wearing a skullcap of seashells in the Balzi Rossi caves complex in Italy, is said to be able a valuable clue “that reveals the respect that the tribe had for this woman”. The documentary accompanying the book in France had an audience of 1.5 million people when it was broadcast on France-5, but it was not without controversy. In an open letter published in Le Monde last October, nine pre-history specialists wrote that the works “systematically eliminate all the elements which could suggest the probability (or even, the mere possibility) of male domination, either by mentioning them in a more or less disguised way, or by resolutely ignoring them”. Cirotteau said the documentary and book were not “militant” about the life and experience of pre-historic women as so little could be certain. “Our role is not to be emphatic about the role of men and women, but just to show the possibilities in their activities and status in pre-history.”",News/Science,"Prehistoric women were hunters and artists as well as mothers, book reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/29/prehistoric-women-were-hunters-and-artists-not-just-mothers-book-reveals
