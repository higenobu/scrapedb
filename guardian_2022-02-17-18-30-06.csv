2/17/2022,"Mikaela Shiffrin’s nightmarish Olympics spilled into Thursday when she was unable to complete the slalom leg of the women’s combined, the latest disappointment in a Beijing Games that alpine skiing’s biggest winner would sooner forget. The 26-year-old American star appeared on course for a redemptive medal on the last day of individual competition in Yanqing after clocking the fifth-best time in the morning’s downhill portion, only 0.56sec behind halfway leader Christine Scheyer of Austria and ahead of a gaggle of contenders including the Swiss pair of Michelle Gisin (by 0.13sec) and Wendy Holdener (0.43) along with Italy’s Federica Brignone (0.44).  But Shiffrin, who has won more World Cup slalom races (47) than any male or female skier in history, was left fighting back tears on the side of the course after crashing out about 10 gates into the afternoon slalom, ensuring she will depart Beijing with no individual medals after managing to complete just two of the five women’s races. “I haven’t seen the video but I think that I actually had a really good start and got into my tempo, my rhythm, quite well,” Shiffrin said. “I felt really full acceleration off the first gates and I think back in my career, 47 different times that I had this feeling – the right balance of intensity, focus, the feeling I had on my skis – it always worked. It was always good, fast skiing but I never had an issue not finishing and especially not that early.” Gisin won the gold, following the 12th-fastest downhill with the fastest slalom for a combined time of 2min 25.67sec to defend her Olympic title in the event. Holdener finished 1.05sec behind to claim the silver while Brignone took bronze, coming in 1.85sec off the pace. Shiffrin’s disqualifications for missing gates early in her opening runs of last Monday’s giant slalom and Wednesday’s slalom were unexpected enough. After all, the Colorado native had failed to finish a race only twice in four years entering the Beijing Games – and a total of 13 times in 228 starts across all disciplines at World Cup, Olympic and world championship events. Her third failure to reach the bottom of the course at these Olympics matches her total number of DNFs over the previous four years. “I didn’t make it to the finish again and … 60% of my DNF rate for my entire career has happened at this Olympic Games,” said Shiffrin, whose three Olympic medals include gold in slalom in 2014 and in giant slalom in 2018. “I didn’t feel pressure there. I mean, there’s always pressure but I didn’t feel … I just felt loose and relaxed, like I knew my plan; focused, good skiing and I was doing it and it still didn’t work.” Shiffrin’s final chance to earn a medal in Beijing will come in Saturday’s mixed team parallel slalom, an event which debuted in 2018, when she will join her Slovakian rival Petra Vlhova as just the second woman in history to compete in six alpine events at a single Olympics.",Sport/Sport,Mikaela Shiffrin’s Olympic nightmare goes on after third failure to finish,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/mikaela-shiffrins-olympic-nightmare-goes-on-after-third-failure-to-finish
2/17/2022,"Russia’s claim to be withdrawing troops from the border with Ukraine seems to be a “disinformation campaign” and the troops are instead making their final preparations to invade, a UK defence minister has said. James Heappey, the armed forces minister, said Moscow was continuing to deploy thousands more soldiers to the region and building bridges across rivers that could be used as part of a military incursion into Ukraine.  Despite brief hopes of a respite in tensions after Vladimir Putin’s announcement on Tuesday that there would be a “partial” drawdown of forces, some Nato countries remained sceptical about how many of the roughly 130,000 troops had really been withdrawn. There have been suggestions that the Kremlin has deployed a further 7,000 soldiers to the border, and Heappey said: “Worryingly what we’ve seen over the last 48 hours is not the reversal that has been announced in Moscow.” He said he still hoped Russia was committing a “hugely expensive exercise” that would end up being a hoax to “wind us up”, but he admitted: “We’re on the threshold of a major war in Europe in which tens of thousands of people could die”. Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I fear that it is a disinformation campaign when we are seeing apparent footage of Russian troops moving away from the border. Because all of our indicators suggest that the buildup and the preparations continue.” He said that equally as challenging as an immediate invasion would be Putin’s decision to “leave this military mass in place indefinitely”, given the impact it would have on Ukraine’s internal security, political system and economy. Earlier, Heappey told Times Radio that having seen “open source intelligence”, key “combat enablers” being moved by Russia to the Ukrainian border was one of a number of indications to “suggest the final preparations are being made for them to invade”. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will embark on another tour of European countries this week, visiting Ukraine, Poland and Germany in an effort to present a united front among western states to dissuade Russia from invading. A senior US official said late on Wednesday that Russia’s claims about withdrawing troops were “false” and that Moscow had “increased its troop presence along the Ukrainian border by as many as 7,000 troops”, many of them arriving in the past 24 hours. “Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk and make claims about de-escalation while privately mobilising for war,” the official said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said earlier on Wednesday that Russia was continuing to send troops to what is now the biggest concentration of forces in Europe since the cold war. Stoltenberg said the military alliance was considering deploying further battle groups in eastern and central Europ, to complement those established in 2014 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, led by the UK, Canada, Germany and the US. The French government has offered to lead a force in Romania. “We will have advice from the military commanders within weeks and we will make a decision after that,” Stoltenberg said. “What we see today is that Russia maintains a massive invasion force ready to attack with high-end capabilities from Crimea to Belarus.” On Thursday he said Nato would prepare for “the new normal” of Russia showing “a disregard for the principles underpinning European security” and threatening force “in pursuit of its objectives”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed all claims of reinforcements and criticised Stoltenberg, who is to leave his Nato post at the end of September to become chief of the Norwegian central bank. Zakharova said: “Frankly, I can tell you the truth. We’re not interested in these statements made by Stoltenberg, who is either Nato secretary general or a banker, I haven’t figured out which yet. We’re no longer interested in them. He is not a person whose statements Moscow would consider serious arguments. He is a Nato has-been now.”",News/World news,"Russian claim of Ukraine drawdown is disinformation, says UK minister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/russian-claim-of-ukraine-drawdown-is-disinformation-says-uk-minister
2/17/2022,"Twins are everywhere in fiction at the moment, from Brit Bennett’s bestseller The Vanishing Half to Claire Fuller’s Costa award-winning Unsettled Ground. The challenge for any novelist, of course, is not merely to use twins as an off-the-peg plot device, but to capture the existential experience of growing up in exact parallel to a sibling, or, in the case of identical twins, being the genetic double of another human being. As a twin myself, I’d say Renée Branum’s riddling debut, Defenestrate, gets very close to a true depiction, as Marta and Nick attempt to individuate from each other – first in Prague, and then in a midwest hospital after Nick falls from a fifth-storey window.  Narrated in short, anecdotal chapters, Marta’s first-person account of the twins’ shared life is perceptive and witty. While the impetuous Nick is infatuated with Buster Keaton, a star who “spent his whole life falling”, Marta is gently protective of her brother, whose homosexuality outrages their “painfully devout” mother; a woman who writes out psalms on notes to place above the twins’ beds. Aware of the strangeness of their living together after college, Marta knows they are “buying ourselves some time” before their inevitable adult separation: We were our whole world, Nick and I, and there was a kind of splendour in that – contained by each other, two yolks sharing an egg. But there was something in that doubling that made me feel all the more fragile – the two of us poised on a sweet precipice before falling blindly forward into the rest of our lives. The precipice turns out to be more than metaphorical when Nick suffers a fall while apparently trying to feed a rare bird from his window. Marta is suspicious. Was Nick attempting suicide in the fashion of his favourite author, Bohumil Hrabal? In addition, their family history has been plagued with falls and acts of defenestration. Believing they were cursed by their Czech great-great-grandfather, who pushed a stonemason from a Prague church steeple for seducing his daughter, Marta becomes obsessed with historical falls, from the ur-fall in the Garden of Eden onwards: “The fall that has been hanging over us our whole lives.” While Marta visits a recuperating Nick in hospital, she also battles with her growing dependence on alcohol and harrowing encounters with predatory men. By her brother’s bed, she tries to gain a deeper understanding of their parents and their past; their painful process of individuation, and the restrictions it has exerted over her life. “I didn’t seem to have room at the time to love and worry over my brother while giving whatever was left over to someone else.” Eventually, she realises she will have to accept her own fall from the prelapsarian innocence of a shared childhood: “As a kid, I assumed that if we were going to fall, we’d fall together. Twinned … I have begun to realise, we must follow each other separately.” What this meditative, fragmentary novel lacks in narrative propulsion it makes up for in digressional detail. There’s also much sparkling imagery, including fin-de-siècle Prague “preening and polishing itself like a vast peacock, with slate and granite and sandstone feathers”. While its obsession with historical correspondences and coincidences can be overly schematic, the book’s single-minded focus on violent death by falling is almost Ballardian in its macabre beauty. Defenestrate is an original and engaging novel from a fresh new voice, one deeply committed to understanding the beguiling experience of twinship, and to writing twins from the inside. As Marta reflects: “Perhaps the world will always seem a little too large or too small, once you’ve shared a womb with someone.”  Jude Cook’s latest novel is Jacob’s Advice (Unbound).

2/17/2022,"The Mars weather is beautiful today, and an astronaut is about to suffocate to death under the cloudless blue sky. The trouble starts after three crew members leave the safety of the Hab, their pressurized six-person living station, and venture outside to do some routine work. They trudge along in 35lb spacesuits, breathing air pumped in by a fan and watching the jagged red landscape through their fishbowl-like glass helmets.  As they head back to the station, one astronaut, Aga Pokrywka, begins acting strangely. Her movements are sluggish. She stops walking. The radio crackles. “Aga, are you all right?” the crew’s commander, Sionade Robinson, asks. The Hab is only a few dozen yards away, but Pokrywka can’t seem to go further. She collapses on to the red clay. Robert Turner, the crew’s medical officer, radios the Hab: “Astronaut down, astronaut down!” The three crew members inside begin emergency protocols. Two don spacesuits, grab a stretcher and enter the airlock. They must wait five painstaking minutes for the air pressure to adjust. If they don’t, they may be torn apart when they step into Mars’s thin atmosphere. After the agonizing wait ends, the rescue party rushes to Pokrywka and rolls her on to the stretcher. They run toward the Hab, maneuver her body into the cramped airlock, and begin the countdown all over again. A crew member inside, Kay Sandor, holds a timer against the airlock window: “Five … four … three … two …” They get Pokrywka inside and on to the ground and remove her helmet. After a while, she starts to revive. “Patient stabilized,” someone says. Everyone relaxes. After a beat, Pokrywka asks: “Did I win my Oscar?” It is hard to imagine that anyone would volunteer to live with five semi-strangers in a tin can in the desert. Yet hundreds of people from around the world apply for the chance to come to the remote wilderness of south-east Utah and pretend to colonize Mars. Crews at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) conduct research to understand what humans may face when visiting or settling the red planet. And, in a sense, the crew members are the research. For two or three weeks, they live like Martians. They wake each morning in bedrooms slightly larger than coffins. They gather in a small common area to eat breakfast – usually a surprisingly edible meal made with dehydrated food, bacteria cultures and harvested greenhouse plants – and watch the sunrise through portholes. Each crew member is allotted one 90-second shower every three days. Operated by the non-profit Mars Society, the MDRS is a so-called analog space station. The crews there have no communication with the outside world except for a brief window every 24 hours when off-site personnel playing ground control make contact. No one is allowed to go outside without donning a spacesuit, or before going through airlock procedures. The station is surrounded by one of the most stunning landscapes on Earth, but crew members are allowed to interact with it only while confined, in effect, in a diving bell. Knowing all this, I headed to the MDRS expecting my hosts, the members of Crew 238, to resemble the cast of The Thing, the clammy 1982 sci-fi film about an Antarctic research station riven by paranoia, at the phase shortly before the flamethrowers come out. On the way to Mars, I stopped to gas up in Hanksville, Utah, a tiny roadside hamlet whose main attraction is a convenience store built, missile-silo-style, into the side of a mountain. Due to an epidemic of sign theft, the miles-long dirt road to get to the station, Cow Dung Road, is unmarked. This may be for the best, as the station has an occasional trespassing problem – tourists, sometimes bearing drones, show up uninvited and disrupt the simulation. (The Mars Society asked me to remind readers that the station is a private research facility and closed to the public.) Arriving at the MDRS is a slightly surreal experience: the small white compound, framed by windswept desert devoid of a single tree or shrub, really does look like a settlement on an alien planet. When I knocked cautiously on the airlock door, I heard a flurry of pleasant, multinational voices – a German accent followed by a British one, and then by an unflappable southern American drawl straight from The Right Stuff or Apollo 13. My astronaut hosts turned out to be an affable group: earnest, collegial and not visibly suffering from the kind of nervous breakdown that one might expect of a group of six sharing a single, bucket-powered dry toilet. After a week “in sim”, they were eager for a visitor and pressed me for news from outside. “In my daily life I produce – ironically, perhaps – Big Brother,” PJ Marcellino, the executive officer and crew journalist, said. “So I guess observing people gave me this weird foray into small-team dynamics.” In addition to working as a protocol producer on the reality TV show, Marcellino is a political scientist by training, a documentarian and an amateur writer of speculative fiction. Ranging in age from 37 to 74, the other crew members had similarly eclectic career backgrounds – art, nursing, engineering and as a business professor. None have held space-related day jobs, though Turner, a paramedic from Tennessee, has attended Nasa launches as an observer. The Mars Society reviewed their individual research applications and matched them as a crew. Crew 238 started planning their mission more than two years ago, but only met in person when they arrived. Touring the MDRS doesn’t take long. The Hab is deliberately cramped, to replicate the size of living quarters that could conceivably be delivered to Mars by rocket, and the rest of the facility is similarly utilitarian. Covered walkways connect the Hab to several outbuildings – a greenhouse, a telescope, a lab and a mechanic room fashioned from the belly of a decommissioned Chinook helicopter. The facility has a small fleet of electric dune buggies. An array of solar panels provides much of the MDRS’s energy, which, like water, is strictly rationed. The only neighbors are the program’s on-site director, who lives in a trailer nearby, and a desert rat occasionally seen scavenging. Over lunch – lentil soup, Verdean chili, homemade bread and an apple crumble made from dried food – the crew members talked about what attracted them to space. One common denominator: science fiction. Two members of the crew were born behind the iron curtain – Pokrywka in Poland and Simon Werner, the crew engineer, in East Germany – and Marcellino was raised by leftwing parents in Portugal after the fall of the rightwing regime. Where North American sci-fi novels tend to emphasize individuality and the importance of technological innovation, they said, the Soviet sci-fi they grew up reading was more interested in the political and social aspects of future life. Everyone disputed the perception of space travel as an expensive boondoggle. “We spend billions on our militaries – on fighting each other,” Werner said; by comparison, he argued, space exploration was a drop in the bucket and one that could very well be crucial to humanity’s survival. Marcellino rejected the idea that there is a dichotomy between space travel and solving needs here on Earth. High-efficiency fuel, he said, was an example of a space technology that could be vital to alleviating the Earth’s climate crisis. Werner and Marcellino also defended private space programs such as SpaceX, arguing that the interest that tech billionaires have taken in space exploration was a mostly positive development. (Elon Musk has contributed money to the Mars Society, which is funded by a mixture of membership dues, individual donations, grants and crowdfunding campaigns. MDRS crews are also charged a fee to help cover the cost of the program.) Public space programs “have as a rule struggled with financing”, Marcellino said. “It’s hard for politicians to justify the funding.” Only tech billionaires such as Musk and Jeff Bezos can afford to test rockets over and over, he said, and they are willing to do it at their own expense. The crew members all told me that they did not expect to participate in a staffed mission to Mars and were just trying to lay some groundwork for whoever does. “I think we need to equip ourselves for the fact that we may not live to see the results of the things we’re working on,” Pokrywka said. The Mars Society has its origins in frustration. In the early 1990s, an American aeronautics engineer and inventor, Robert Zubrin, became convinced that direct exploration of Mars was not only possible but decades overdue. “I was 17 when we landed on the moon, and if anyone had told me then that I’d be 61 and we’d have not landed on Mars – or even that people were not going to the moon any more – I would have thought they were nuts,” Zubrin told Business Insider in 2013. “We were on the brink of opening up space, and we just stopped.” Zubrin has prosecuted his argument in a series of emphatic books – The Case for Space, Entering Space, The Case for Mars, How to Live on Mars – that sketch what a mission to Mars might look like, rebut common political and technological criticisms, and make a philosophical case for space exploration. In 1998, Zubrin and others founded the Mars Society, which has no affiliation with Nasa. “The Mars Society view has always been that there is nothing preventing a human mission” within a decade, a representative told me. “That was the case 10 years ago and it’s the case today.” Based on current technological trends, any journey to Mars would probably take six to nine months. Including the roundtrip voyage, even a short stay on Mars would require a group of human beings ready to spend a long time frighteningly far from home. One dilemma, Robinson told me, is that the kinds of personalities that would be most attracted to a Mars mission – people who are novelty-seeking, thrill-seeking, extremely accepting of risk – are also those who would be most restless during the day-to-day reality. Marcellino added: “I think there’s been an evolution of personality types from extreme type-A people who like to break records” – think Chuck Yeager – “to people with the social and cooperative skills to endure a nine-month space voyage.” Hence the importance of analog space stations. The Mars Society also maintains a base in the Canadian Arctic, though the one in Utah sees more use, for practical and cost reasons. Nasa and other groups have tried similar projects on a Hawaiian volcano and in a cave in Spain. Much of what we know about long-term isolation comes from personnel stationed on submarines or in remote outposts in the Arctic or Antarctic. Space advocates believe that such case studies have limited application. Those sailors “were bored”, Zubrin told Business Insider, regarding US navy personnel stationed in Antarctica. “They didn’t want to be there. They wanted to be in San Diego where they can go out on the pier on Friday night and pick up girls.” By contrast, he argued, scientists and engineers who volunteered for long-term space missions would be highly motivated. Overwork, not boredom, would be a greater risk. The crew members I met at the MDRS seemed to partly bear out that observation; they worked hours each day and told me they were anxious about not finishing their research before leaving. Either way, however, there’s a huge difference between a few weeks in small-group isolation and, say, two years. A study completed in 2013 – which confined six men at a facility in Russia, under simulated Mars conditions, for 520 days – found that the men became lethargic and seemed to be tired even as they slept more. In 1991, members of an experimental theater troupe undertook an audacious project to create a completely self-sustained ecosystem. At the Biosphere 2 facility in Arizona, a mixed-gender group of eight volunteers were enclosed in a giant terrarium, with water, plants and animals, for two years. Tensions ran high; food, and eventually oxygen, ran low. The mission was only completed with the aid of emergency supplies smuggled in. In 1994 a second group tried, but were forced to end their mission early because of a power struggle in the Biosphere’s ownership. Astronauts to Mars will live with the danger of fires, meteor impacts, radiation poisoning and solar storms. Air will need to be expertly managed to avoid astronauts choking on the carbon dioxide in their own breath, and months of low gravity will weaken them before they even arrive. Depending on the relative positions of the two planets, communications between Mars and Earth will take as long as 20 minutes. “Think of how stressful Zoom delays are,” Marcellino said. “Your brain starts to fry. Extrapolate that to four to 20 minutes, perhaps in an emergency situation.” If an emergency strikes on Mars, help or extra supplies will take months to arrive. Humans there will need to prioritize collective survival above all else, a principle that the MDRS emphasizes in emergency simulations. In a common scenario, some astronauts are contaminated by radiation while outside the station; their comrades inside have to decide whether to let them in. During one such simulation, a contaminated woman pleaded to be let inside, but another crew member – who was also her actual husband – voted to let her die, arguing that it was necessary to protect the rest of the crew. The simulation supervisor praised the husband’s choice. (No word on whether the marriage survived.) And even the most rigorous training can’t always prevent human error or mechanical failure. During Crew 238’s simulated emergency, Pokrywka, who was designated to play possum, was “saved”, but afterward Turner admitted that his suit kept malfunctioning during the rescue operation. “I think I died,” he said, casually. “My airflow collapsed.”",News/Science,"Inside the Mars simulation project, where volunteers put their bodies on the line",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/17/mars-utah-simulation-volunteers
2/17/2022,"The Rodgers Saga rolls into a third offseason. Prior to the Super Bowl, ESPN reported that the Green Bay Packers were now willing to go “all in” to keep the quarterback, pushing up to the limit of the salary cap for next season and beyond. The Packers are, the report suggested, looking to mirror the latter days of the Saints’ Drew Brees era, pushing cap pain down the line in order to squeeze extra juice out of the roster now.  It feels like 10 years too late. The Packers’ plan doesn’t hold much water, either. OverTheCap.com chronicles each team’s ‘effective’ salary cap, which looks at how much cap room a team is able to finagle by redistributing the money in the current contracts on its books. For instance: the Saints are currently $70m(!) over the cap. But New Orleans structure contracts in a way that they’re able to activate triggers that kick the money down the line. Their ‘effective’ cap, once they shuffle their options and renegotiate deals, will be closer to $30m under the cap by the time free-agency rolls around. Things are different in Green Bay. The Packers don’t have the same flexibility. Even with the potential to rework contracts, their effective cap comes out right around dead even – and that’s before they work out deals with their upcoming free agents. We should know Rodgers’ answer soon. He has set the upcoming franchise tag deadline as his limit for making a decision. By then, Rodgers and the Packers will know the future of Davante Adams, Rodgers’ top receiver and an impending free agent. Coming off back-to-back MVPs, the Packers quarterback steps into the offseason with an unusual amount of power. He has teased that he could walk away from the game altogether. While, over in Denver, the Broncos have hired anyone and everyone with a connection to Rodgers – his former offensive coordinator, a former college coach, his gardener – in a bid to tempt the quarterback to request a trade. The most likely outcome: Rodgers demands a move. After 72 hours of will-he-won’t-he speculation, Tom Brady formally announced he was walking away from the game after his 22nd season … or is he? Speculation continues that Brady could return for one last dance. “I’m super content and happy [with the decision],” Brady said on the latest edition of his Let’s Go! podcast. “All you can do is take it day by day, nothing’s promised for us.” Brady could return to the Bucs for one final season. But the team’s salary cap constraints mean they will have to retool the roster with or without Brady. If he does return, Brady may jump to another title contender. San Francisco – the team Brady tried to join during his lone round of free agency – have been rumored as a potential spot, or he could return to the AFC East with Miami, where he has set up his post-retirement home. Brady isn’t the only future Hall of Famer who could be set to step away. Reports swirled prior to the Super Bowl that Aaron Donald would retire if the Rams won the title, something the team duly achieved. Donald may have to hang around for an extra three or four years to compile the kind of numbers and hardware that puts him among the most accomplished players ever. But his peak years – which is all of his years – already put him among the best to ever play on his side of the ball. Donald walked into the league with the potential to be its most dominant defender, and, if he walks away, he will leave at the height of his powers. In eight seasons, Donald: Won defensive rookie of the year in 2014 Won three Defensive Player of the Year crowns Made the 2010s all-decade team Was named a first-team All-Pro seven times, and a Pro Bowler in all eight seasons Missed only two games in eight years, neither of which were injury related Forced 48 fumbles, and totaled 150 tackles for loss Registered 98 sacks, a total that matches Von Miller. Was the decisive force in swinging a Super Bowl with a two-play sequence for the ages. If you are carving the Mt Rushmore of defensive players alone, it starts with Lawrence Taylor, Reggie White, and Donald. Feel free to argue over the fourth spot. What else is there left to achieve? As one season closes, another begins: Draft season! In a down year for quarterback prospects, the race to be the No 1 overall pick is wide open. Jacksonville could look at any number of options: selecting one of college football’s preeminent pass-rushers (Aidan Hutchinson, Michigan; Kayvon Thibodeaux, Oregon), adding an offensive lineman (Evan Neal, Alabama; Ikem Ekwonu, NC State; Charles Cross, Mississippi State), or trading the pick for extra assets. There is no sure-fire top prospect. It’s a pick-your-flavor year. If the Jags do not fall in love with one of the top edge-rushers or linemen, then they will auction the pick to the highest bidder. The question is whether or not anyone else loves one of the iffy quarterback prospects enough to pay the price required to leap all the way to the top of the draft. Nestled within the Super Bowl extravaganza was a report of mounting consequence: The league is investigating Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross after former head coach Brian Flores alleged in a lawsuit that Ross had offered him $100,000 a game to lose. If the NFL finds conclusive evidence that Ross did indeed offer Flores money to throw games, it’s expected that the other owners will force Ross to sell his team. Ross has denied the allegations and his defense is expected to be that he was joking. You know the classic joke, right? The one about a multibillionaire owner who offered his employee $100,000 a game to throw them. Speaking of incompetence and arrogance, over in the capital Daniel Snyder, the owner of the freshly-titled Washington Commanders, could finally be on his way out, too. The league has spent the better part of two years trying to shadow box allegations that Snyder presided over a corrosive workplace culture, one of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and other forms of workplace misconduct; an investigation that Snyder did his utmost to block and manipulate. The league commissioned an ‘independent’ report on the allegations. The number of pages released from Robert Mueller’s report into Deflategate: 243. The number of pages released following the investigation into the Ray Rice scandal: 96. The number of pages of the Wilkinson report into Washington and Snyder: Zero. Zilch. Nada. Still: The recommendations from the report led to Snyder handing off day-to-day operation of the team to his wife and the team to pay a $10m fine. New allegations in front of a congressional hearing have forced the league back into action. Initially, Snyder announced that he had launched a further investigation into himself. Roger Goodell and the league’s owners called Snyder’s bluff, squashing Snyder’s investigation and firing up another investigation of their own. The league’s rumor mill has long believed that Snyder – the NFL’s great embarrassment in a crucial market – will, at some point, be ousted by the league’s other owners. But Snyder is infamously litigious and has deep enough pockets (and enough of a motive) to tie the league and its owners up in litigation for years, with the potential of embarrassing the league and its owners publicly. Now, however, with the government involvement, the league may be able to force Snyder to sell. After years of stability in the ownership ranks, the Dolphins, Commanders, and Broncos could all change hands over the course of the next six months.",Sport/Sport,"NFL offseason storylines: Aaron Rodgers, retirements and the No 1 overall pick",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/nfl-offseason-storylines-aaron-rodgers-retirements-and-the-no-1-overall-pick
2/17/2022,"Antonio Conte has said Tottenham’s squad may have been technically weakened in the January window and that the club’s transfer policy will slow the rate at which he can make the team competitive. The manager was desperate for reinforcements but the club missed out on Adama Traoré and Luis Díaz and brought in only Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus on deadline day.  On the same day Tottenham’s two most expensive players – Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso – left on loan, Dele Alli joined Everton on an initial free transfer and Bryan Gil went to Valencia less than six months after his £25m arrival from Sevilla. In an interview with Sky Sport Italia, Conte said: “I saw some situations from the outside that could be developed, but when you get into it, you realise something ... What happened in January is not easy. Four players left in January. Four important players for Tottenham, two have arrived. So even numerically instead of reinforcing yourself you may have, on paper, weakened.” Conte said the 21-year-old Kulusevski and 24-year-old Bentancur were perfect signings in the framework of Tottenham’s transfer philosophy but believes the approach will require patience. “It is inevitable that in January it is very difficult to get two players like Bentancur and Kulusevski to sign who, I repeat, are the ideal prospects for Tottenham,” he said. “Because Tottenham is looking for young players, players to be developed, not ready players. That is the issue. “The vision, the philosophy of the club is this. It is inevitable that if you want to grow faster and if you want to be competitive more quickly you need players with a lot of experience because they also lead to an increase in experience in your team. But then again, the vision of the club I realised is this and will continue to be this.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte fears Tottenham squad is weaker after January transfers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/antonio-conte-fears-tottenham-squad-weaker-after-january-transfers

What is the right dose of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin? When should it be taken? Should it be combined with hydroxychloroquine? With the antibiotic azithromycin? What about Pepcid, hydrogen peroxide, colloidal silver? Vitamin C? Take it all, one user tells people. And chew a lemon peel, says another.  Two years into the pandemic and we now have a range of safe and effective vaccines and treatments that are readily available in much of the world. Yet millions of people have chosen to reject vaccines and rigorous medical research in favour of unproven treatments and pseudoscientific home remedies. There’s no single reason that explains why people from varied backgrounds in numerous countries have latched on to these treatments with such fervour. But there is clearly a desperate demand for a quick fix to the pandemic. There is also a near limitless supply of medical misinformation telling people that such a solution is available but nefarious forces are intent on keeping it from the public. The mass belief in unproven treatments is often spurred on by a vast ecosystem of medical hucksters profiting from unsound treatments, and media influencers ready to insert their dubious claims into pre-existing political battles. In the US, for instance, Republican lawmakers and conservative media have attacked public health officials advising lockdowns while championing unproven drugs as miracle cures. One of the first times hydroxychloroquine appeared in mainstream media was on Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s primetime show, where a cryptocurrency investor falsely claiming to be affiliated with Stanford Medical University announced the drug as “the second cure to a virus of all time”. The show did not run a correction. Although they are often presented as secret cures, hidden away by mainstream medicine and media, some of these drugs are well known and commonly consumed for other conditions. Many are even the subject of numerous clinical trials. Take ivermectin, which is approved for use to treat parasites in both animals and humans. Ivermectin was extremely widely used in Latin America during the first months of the pandemic as regional health agencies recommended it as a potential Covid treatment, but misinformation claiming that the drug was a cure-all led people to clear out supplies and resort to taking unsafe versions of ivermectin formulated for animals. Health officials stopped recommending ivermectin after scrutiny over the science behind it, and frontline evidence cast doubts on its effectiveness. But instead of falling by the wayside in favour of more promising drugs, a combination of US culture war politics and pundits caused ivermectin use to explode across North America and the United Kingdom. A fringe doctor whose medical activist group has affiliated with anti-vaccine organisations appeared in a viral YouTube video touting the drug, then months later sat for a sympathetic interview on Joe Rogan’s top-rated podcast. In September, as the ivermectin craze was in full swing, Dr Patricia Garcia, Peru’s former health minister, told me that she watched in disbelief as the rest of the world appeared to be replicating her country’s mistakes. None of this would have been possible without social media platforms allowing medical misinformation to spread at an unprecedented speed and scale, while influential media figures such as Carlson and Rogan act as megaphones for fringe actors and junk science. It’s an ecosystem that fosters deep distrust, both of traditional media outlets and public health officials. But the supply of medical misinformation is only one side of the equation. Within groups dedicated to unproven Covid treatments, believing in these drugs has become its own form of identity. In addition to asking for dosage recommendations or links to telehealth sites for prescriptions, people develop echo chambers that provide a sense of community while attacking outsiders as brainwashed or part of a vast conspiracy. They talk about how they can’t trust doctors, or the media, or family members. All they have left is each other. The online communities promoting ivermectin and other unproven Covid treatments are filled with what appear to be average people misguidedly trying to help one another, giving medical advice or offering comfort. When someone posts that they are sick, they’re met with a flurry of well wishes, and also pseudoscience remedies. In one recent post, two men promised they would pray for each other’s loved ones who had been intubated after contracting Covid. “Alternative medicine” communities are certainly full of scam artists with financial incentives to spread medical misinformation, and far-right extremists attempting to radicalise others, but many people in these unproven treatment groups simply appear desperate for someone to tell them that things are going to be OK. Conspiracy movements tend to consume people who are at their most vulnerable, in times of great distress, often regardless of their intelligence or profession. The pandemic has taken a deep emotional toll on millions of people, and similarly appears to have left many distrusting of public health officials and susceptible to misinformation. One study published last month in the Journal of American Medical Association found that people experiencing symptoms of depression were more than twice as likely to express opinions that contained medical misinformation. There’s little reason to think that the demand for unproven treatments and pseudoscience cures will go away soon. The anti-vaccine movement has become more militant. Covid-19 will not be eradicated. The financial and political incentives for pushing medical misinformation will remain. There will still be people whose deep distrust and belief in conspiracies means that they will reach for whatever paste or pill or placebo they have been told will work. Some will recover and praise these unproven treatments as lifesavers. Others won’t get the chance. Nick Robins-Early is a journalist based in New York.

2/17/2022,"The fate of three key government MPs remains in the balance after the New South Wales Liberal party again rejected their endorsements, while the federal executive considers a request to intervene in the fractious state division. On Thursday the state executive of the NSW Liberal party again rejected a proposal to endorse the preselection of federal ministers Sussan Ley and Alex Hawke, as well as key moderate Trent Zimmerman, amid an ongoing factional war within the party.  The proposal, which required the support of 90% of the 27-member executive to pass, was put forward despite having been previously rejected, and again raised suspicions of a looming federal intervention in NSW. But amid an increasingly bitter internal dispute over the nomination of candidates for key seats at the federal election, the NSW division agreed on Thursday to request a limited federal intervention that would see the existing state executive reappointed to avoid a breach of its constitution. The federal executive was meeting on Thursday night to consider the request. The move comes after the state division held an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday to advise that the federal executive needed to intervene to ensure that it was not in breach of its constitution. Legal advice presented to the meeting said it would have been in breach of its constitution if it continued to operate beyond the end of February without holding an annual general meeting. The suggestion had been bitterly opposed by members of the party’s right faction, with the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells warning party members that any bid to invite federal intervention was part of a “manufactured controversy” designed to install candidates against the will of members. On Thursday the state executive came to a form of compromise, voting to allow the federal executive to intervene only to reappoint the existing state delegates until the end of March when it is scheduled to hold the annual meeting. The wording of the motion, which passed by 18 votes to four, was specifically aimed at limiting the scope of intervention amid a growing suspicion among the moderate and right factions that the move is aimed at giving the federal body the power to install candidates. Those suspicions were further solidified when the proposal to endorse the three MPs was again put forward on Thursday, despite having previously been rejected. One party figure said there remained a possibility the federal executive could still intervene beyond what Thursday’s motion called for, to take over the branch and install candidates, but a member would need to give 14 days notice for this to be considered. In the event that federal intervention was agreed to, a legal challenge would be likely. The failure of the motion to re-endorse Ley, Hawke and Zimmerman – which is understood to have been supported by the prime minister, Scott Morrison – comes amid frustration from the moderate and conservative factions that a compromise deal has not been presented to state executive for a vote. This deal would give Morrison the pick of candidates in Dobell and Eden Monaro, allow plebiscites in the Senate, Bennelong and Parramatta, endorse sitting members and install Alex Dore into Hughes. Although the deal was negotiated more than three weeks ago, it remains in limbo because the centre right and the moderate-controlled branches are concerned about Dore being parachuted into Hughes. Party sources suggested that regardless of the outcome of Thursday’s ballot, federal intervention was now increasingly likely, with the state division also preparing for the likelihood of a supreme court challenge against such a move. At Wednesday’s meeting, the right’s Matthew Camenzuli presented legal advice suggesting the federal takeover was unnecessary. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ability of the federal executive to intervene may also be legally contestable, with an unwillingness of some members of the federal body to get involved. In an email sent to members late on Wednesday, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who is fighting for a ballot of members to go ahead which she believes would secure her senate position, said the move was “intended to advance the position of a handful of factional players”. “There is a very small group within our party who want to deliver certain seats to their preferred candidates, trampling on the rights of the membership and thereby obstructing the constitution,” Fierravanti-Wells said in the letter. “By failing/refusing to carry out their obligations these few people are creating such delay in NSW preselections that they can then mount an argument that the NSW division is dysfunctional and that plebiscite preselections be substituted with automatic endorsements. They create the dysfunction, and then use it as an excuse to get what they want. “These few people are working hard to create a situation where preselection of candidates by plebiscite of members is destroyed. They are afraid that your opinion will be different from theirs, and their preferred candidate or even themselves, will not get endorsement.” She singled out the prime minister’s representative on state executive, the immigration minister Alex Hawke, for failing to “carry out his party functions as a member of the nomination review committee in a timely manner.” Hawke was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberals reject another push to endorse sitting MPs as federal intervention considered,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/nsw-liberals-reject-another-push-to-endorse-sitting-mps-as-federal-intervention-considered
2/17/2022,"Thousands have been left without power as Storm Dudley brought chaos to roads and rail and ferry services across Scotland and northern England, with warnings of even more severe weather to come as Storm Eunice sweeps across the UK on Friday. The Met Office issued “stay indoors” advice, warning of winds of up to 100mph in places and further disruption to transport, as a clean-up operation was in progress after Storm Dudley.  As Storm Eunice moves in on Friday, an amber warning for wind from 3am until 9pm was issued for much of England and Wales, and for wind and snow in central and southern Scotland from 3am until 6pm. Thousands of homes were left without power in the north-east of England, Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Lancashire as heavy rain and strong winds, gusting to more than 80mph in places hit on Wednesday, uprooting trees and bringing down power lines. Northern Powergrid, which maintains electricity networks across northern England, said it had reconnected 10,000 homes within hours, but it could not say when 4,000 more would have power restored. Hundreds more households were left without power across Northern Ireland and Scotland. Gusts of 81mph were recorded in Capel Curig, north Wales, while Emley Moor in West Yorkshire recorded 74mph. Safety checks were being carried out on railway lines on Thursday morning as Network Rail said it was inspecting more than 1,400 miles of track. Most ScotRail services were withdrawn until around 10am on Thursday. Network Rail’s route director for Scotland, Liam Sumpter, told the BBC: “It was a really tough evening and night for us last night. Storm Dudley hit us really hard. We have numerous reports of trees on the tracks and also damage to overhead lines and even some damage to signalling systems.” As Storm Dudley moves away through Thursday, giving brief respite, more severe weather is expected to hit as Storm Eunice, described as “quite a potent storm” by BBC Weather, moves across Scotland and the rest of the UK on Friday. The Met Office said conditions could be even more damaging, with stronger winds, heavy snow in parts and possible blizzards in Scotland. People across Cornwall have been urged to only travel if absolutely necessary when Storm Eunice hits on Friday. Cornwall council said the storm was likely to be as powerful as those that affected the south-west in 2014. There was widespread flooding and the rail line in Dawlish, Devon, was badly damaged. The council said the whole of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly – but in particular the north Cornish coast – could expect winds up to 100mph, structural damage, mobile homes being overturned, communications and power outages and fallen trees. The worst of the winds are set to coincide with high spring tides along the Cornish coastline at around 6am, leading to possible flooding. People are urged to stay back from cliffs and seafronts owing to the danger of large waves. The areas expected to be worst affected include St Ives harbour, Port Isaac and Polzeath. Scotland’s deputy first minister, John Swinney, warned that the coming days would be “very challenging”. He said: “High winds may cause issues on roads and bridges, disruption to power supplies and danger from falling trees. “We would urge everyone to plan their journeys in advance, exercise caution on the roads, and follow the latest travel advice.” As ferry services in Scotland were disrupted, Robert Morrison, CalMac’s director of operations, said: “This will be the fourth week of extreme and unprecedented weather disruptions.” Train services were also disrupted by fallen trees and debris caught in overhead wires. Northern, TransPennine Express, West Midlands Railway and the Tyne and Wear Metro were among those reporting delays and cancellations. In Cardiff, a train named after fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore hit a trampoline. Coastal areas including Blackpool also saw choppy seas and large waves, with authorities warning people not to take risks to get a dramatic selfie. In England, the Environment Agency had two flood warnings in place on Thursday morning at Keswick Campsite and along the Cumbrian coastline from St Bees Head to Millom, along the coast from North Head to Haverigg, and 42 flood alerts, where flooding is possible.",News/UK news,Thousands left without power as Storm Dudley wreaks havoc across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/thousands-left-without-power-as-storm-dudley-wreak-havoc-across-uk
2/17/2022,"The murder trial of constable Zachary Rolfe has heard evidence for the first time from a direct witness to the shooting of Kumanjayi Walker. Rolfe, 30, shot Walker, 19, during a deployment to Yuendumu, a remote community about 300km from Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019.  The court has heard Walker was shot three times by Rolfe, but the first shot is not subject to any charges. It occurred only moments after Walker stabbed Rolfe with a pair of surgical scissors. The crown prosecutor, Philip Strickland SC, has previously told the Northern Territory supreme court that after the first shot had been fired, another officer struggled with Walker and eventually gained control of him, pinning the arm that had been holding the scissors under Walker’s body. Rolfe then placed his left hand on his colleague’s back and pressed his right hand, holding his Glock semi-automatic handgun, against the left side of Walker’s body, Strickland said, before pulling the trigger twice in quick succession, in what Strickland said was known as a “double-tap” designed to ensure maximum damage. It is the second and third shots that are subject to the murder charge. If a jury finds Rolfe not guilty of murder, he faces a charge of manslaughter, and if he is found not guilty of that charge, a further charge of engaging in a violent act causing death. The police officer has pleaded not guilty to all charges. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said he would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and his colleague, constable Adam Eberl. Edwardson said Rolfe was acting in self-defence, and to defend the life of Eberl, when he fired the second and third shots, and his training had emphasised that “edged weapon equals gun”. Walker had a propensity for violence and had attacked Rolfe in a dark and confined space, he said, with the police officers having to make decisions without the “luxury” of being about to consider tactical options “frame-by-frame”. On Thursday, senior constable Anthony Hawkings told the Northern Territory supreme court he saw Rolfe holding his police-issued Glock handgun “very close” to Walker’s body before he shot him for the second and third time. He had not seen the first shot fired by Rolfe, but when he looked through the doorway of a Yuendumu property known as House 511 he noticed that Walker was on his side, Eberl was struggling with him, and Rolfe was crouching over the pair with his gun in his right hand. Soon after, Rolfe fired two shots, Hawkings said, clarifying that he had only looked into the doorway for a “matter of seconds”. He did not see Walker holding the scissors, nor go into the room. After the shooting he kept watch over the doorway to prevent other people entering, he said. While extensive body-worn camera footage of the shooting has been played to the court, it is the first time someone who witnessed the shots has given evidence. The court has previously heard that Rolfe fired the second shot 2.6 seconds after the first shot, and that there was 0.53 seconds between Rolfe’s second and third shots. Hawkings, Rolfe and Eberl were part of a team deployed to Yuendumu from Alice Springs to deal with several community issues, including the arrest of Walker, a fugitive who had threatened other officers with an axe three days earlier. Like other officers who have given evidence during the trial, Hawkings was asked extensively about any briefing or information he received before deploying at Yuendumu. Conflicting accounts have emerged about what information was provided to the officers, the extent of planning before their deployment, and the purpose of their duties on the night of the shooting. The shooting during an attempted arrest occurred only 15 minutes after the officers left the station, which the prosecution alleges was inconsistent with a plan which the officer in charge of the station said she had emailed to officers to arrest Walker early the following morning. Hawkings said he could not remember seeing any email relating to his deployment to Yuendumu, or having an extensive briefing. He said he believed the only notes he had made in his police notebook about the deployment related to the time he arrived at the station from Alice Springs, but he could not be sure as he had misplaced the notebook. He did recall seeing a map of Yuendumu at the station, but could not recall who gave it to him. When shown CCTV footage of some of the officers at Yuendumu station picking up a document prior to leaving, he could not recall what the document was. Strickland has previously told the court that the case against Rolfe relied not only on his actions during the shooting, but the “context” and the “steps leading up” to it, including the plan. On Thursday, the court also heard from a family member of Walker who said the Warlpiri man had planned to surrender to police. Louanna Williams, Walker’s auntie, said he visited her after he had threatened officers with an axe and told her he planned to hand himself in after the funeral of a family member. The funeral was held on the day Walker was killed. Williams said Walker also told her he was “comfortable” having her brother, senior Aboriginal community police officer Derek Williams (who was not involved in the events around Walker’s death), arrest him, and denied any involvement in a series of break-ins in Yuendumu. Local police suspected Walker had been involved in the break-ins, which had prompted medical staff to evacuate from the town – one of several reasons used to justify the deployment of Rolfe and other officers from Alice Springs. Leanne Oldfield, Walker’s adopted mother, said the funeral was for her uncle. Walker had been close to her uncle, she said. Minutes before the shooting, she had been sitting outside 511, the house where she lived with her partner and Walker, she said. Walker had been looking at a family photo of his cousins and an aunt in a swimming pool, and laughing, she said, before he went inside the property. “He was looking at the photo, then after – then he went inside,” Oldfield said. “Soon as he went inside, I seen the police coming through the gate.” The trial continues.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe trial: witness saw officer holding gun ‘very close’ to Kumanjayi Walker before fatal shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/zachary-rolfe-trial-witness-saw-officer-holding-gun-very-close-to-kumanjayi-walker-before-fatal-shooting
