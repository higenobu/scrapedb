1/15/2022,"First they came for the multi-millionaire tennis players with pictures of border form infractions on their Instagram page. And I did not speak out. Actually, no, it’s not quite that. The decision to re-cancel Novak Djokovic’s visa, thereby imperilling his ability to compete at next week’s Australian Open is not an act of war on the Serbian people, or an executive order from the lizard-lords of Project Deplete The Sheeple. Or indeed anything to be celebrated with any real relish, unless the spectacle of enforced deportations rings your bell.  Perhaps the people most directly concerned by the intervention of the Australian government on Friday are those detained in the kind of migrant hostel from which Djokovic escaped last week. Those same harsh border policies will remain once the current celebrity edition has faded out of the news cycle. And none of those unfortunates still resident in Melbourne’s Park Hotel will be cheering with any great warmth. For now it is worth noting that the court decision on the procedural fairness of Djokovic’s summary visa-justice at Melbourne airport has not been overturned. Immigration minister Alex Hawke has used a separate statutory power to rule that Djokovic is not entitled to stay, whether on grounds of the public good, or for reasons of bad character and bad conduct. That decision will be reviewed on appeal over the weekend, but only with regard to its procedural correctnesses, not the content of the minister’s views. And so we go again. For all the noise, the scarcely credible cut-through as a global news event of one Serbian tennis player’s weirdness about mainstream medicine, there was something reassuring on Friday evening in the sight of this inferno coming to rest on the agreeably furrowed brow of Judge Anthony Kelly of the Melbourne federal court. Slumped in his high-backed chair, tie askew, Judge Kelly had the look of a man who finds himself routinely appalled, without favour or exception, by every single object in his eyeline. As petitions were made and timings wrangled over he listened with an expression of weary suffering, as though doggedly sitting out a violent bout of sciatica. At one point he batted away an interruption from Djokovic’s lawyer with the words “I will finish because it’s the last thing I wish to say”, and you wondered, what, like … ever? The end result was not the one Djokovic’s lawyers had been seeking, the re-inflicting of their case on Judge Kelly’s court over the weekend. Instead it has been referred to the next step up the judicial ladder. And whatever the ultimate outcome, this has been another bewilderingly strange step in a bewilderingly strange interlude. Here we have the real-time intersection of humanity’s polarised response to a global plague, and the irreconcilable career ambitions of the world’s best male tennis player and the prime minister of Australia. But a few things have at least become a little clearer. First it is all excellent news for Scott Morrison, who is no doubt hugely grateful to have been granted this lever on public opinion during an election year. No, don’t look over there at the inferno of Covid cases. Watch instead while I windmill Novak Djokovic around my head like a super-healthy vegan celery juice Action Man. Is it possible to trim away the emotive edges here? Djokovic may be a maddening figure. He may deserve it all for the basic shithousery of entering the country via a medical loophole while ticking the wrong box on his border forms. But he is still basically being deported for the crime of making the prime minister look bad, for holding weird views, for giving out an unpleasant vibe. And this at a time when it might do more harm than good to what remains of the public discourse. This seems to be what his lawyers will seek to establish. It was put to Judge Kelly that the government had considered the effects of Djokovic’s presence on anti-vaccine sentiment, while not also considering the effects of its own decision to deport on the same people. Have a poke around the internet, Your Honour. It’s absolutely nuts out there. The word binary was thrown around the courtroom. And it is perhaps the most interesting point to arise, because if Australia v Djokovic tells us anything it is that this is our world now. At one extreme the Australian people can be invited to focus their anxiety on a single, slightly ludicrous hate figure. On the other Djokovic has already been enthroned as a hero by people who think #Australiahasfallen – to melts, wokies, Bill Gates, whatever – while Djokovic Sr tells us his son, who is undoubtedly very good at tennis, is “a Spartacus of the new world” here to fight against injustice, hypocrisy and (for some reason) colonialism. Naturally the 24-hour multi-camera circus of big sport is on hand to project this stuff, to take us into that place where only these polarised - and indeed incorrect – versions of reality can exist. In the shadow of all this there are two things worth remembering. Djokovic is a highly unusual person, out there in his sealed bubble of celebrity sport entitlement, surrounded by acolytes and supplicants. And Australia is also a pretty weird place right now, a vast, dusty, atomised island nation, two years in isolation, gruellingly dutiful, fatigued by outbreak-anxiety. Just as Covid really does start to let rip, it finds itself presented with this absurd, dunderheaded Djoker, skating in through customs with his wonky forms and his belief in detoxifying mind-power. Take a step back and the arrival of Djokovic is the most absurdly provocative single event imaginable on those shores right now, something that might have been staged just to press Australia’s already quivering buttons. What were we expecting? It is hard to see how Djokovic gets to play in Melbourne, or indeed to picture any kind of happy ending. Apart from the obvious one. Frankly the only sensible option would be to fold and leave now, to offer that rarest of things, a hand across the net-divide. No? Me neither. See you back in court.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic v Australia is a grudge match for our polarised age | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/novak-djokovic-v-australia-is-a-grudge-match-for-our-polarised-age
1/15/2022,"Just under a year ago, as Tennis Australia attempted to pull off the seemingly impossible feat of successfully beckoning the world of tennis through the country’s closed borders in order to hold the 2021 Australian Open, numerous leading figures framed the necessity of holding the tournament in existential terms. Craig Tiley, Tennis Australia’s CEO, warned of the possibility of the event being bought out by other entities if it was not held. Daniel Andrews, the Victorian Premier, mentioned imaginary potential bids from China and Japan. Ultimately, Tiley offered the most confusing assessment: “The only reason we get the players here is because we offer a lot of prize money and we spend a lot of time pursuing them to come.”  Such claims were always absurd and likely a negotiation tactic by Tiley. There was certainly a time when the Australian Open was the ugly duckling of the grand slam tennis tournaments, held at the end of the year and an event that many of the top players routinely skipped. But in recent years, it has risen to join the other three major tournaments as an essential part of the calendar. What it may lack in historic prestige, it has more than made up for in the manner that it has remained ahead of the curve, constantly looking to modernise, expanding its vast tournament grounds while becoming one of the players’ favourite destinations in the process. While its improved standing in the tennis world should have enabled the tournament to stand confidently in its success, the efforts Tiley and Tennis Australia evidently went through to provide a pathway for Novak Djokovic into the country so that he could compete for his 21st grand slam title despite being unvaccinated has spectacularly backfired. Instead of being a tournament that does not rely on its stars, this year’s Australian Open is already bound to be remembered as the event that allowed itself to be defined and commanded by one single player who has completely overshadowed the rest of the field. That was already clear over the past week in which Djokovic’s detention and continuing legal battles have led international news cycles around the world. And it was even more evident on Friday as Alex Hawke, the Immigration minister, finally made his decision on Djokovic’s visa after days of deliberation. Hawke predictably opted to use his personal ministerial powers in order to revoke Djokovic’s visa for a second time. Before this week, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia did not even use YouTube to broadcast its hearings, yet on Friday more than 50,000 people watched the directions hearing live online, many onlookers returning to watch round two of proceedings despite how dry and often incomprehensible Djokovic’s initial hearing was last week. Djokovic’s presence now looms over the Australian Open in many ways. In practical terms, many things are uncertain in the men’s singles draw until his status is clear. Under normal circumstances, aside from last-minute withdrawals, every player in the draw would now know their first-round opponent and would be able to prepare accordingly. But here numerous players involved will have clarity about who they face only once Djokovic’s court case is resolved. As things stand, should Djokovic fail to reinstate his visa before Tennis Australia issues the opening day’s order of play, his withdrawal would cause a last-minute reshuffle of the draw. The fifth seed, Andrey Rublev, would move into Djokovic’s spot at the top of the draw, Gaël Monfils, the 17th seed, would take Rublev’s spot, Alexander Bublik would become the 33rd seed in Monfils’s spot and a lucky loser would be added. What seems increasingly likely, however, is that a final decision will not be made until after the order of play is released on Sunday. If Djokovic is deported, a lucky loser would replace him at the top of the draw, leading to an extremely lopsided men’s singles tournament. The days before a grand slam event are supposed to be a time of rising hype and excitement, yet it is already clear that Djokovic’s court proceedings will command all attention throughout the weekend. As the news broke about Djokovic’s visa being cancelled for a second time, Andy Murray was in the midst of a masterful performance, defeating Reilly Opelka to reach the final in Sydney, just his second ATP Final since 2017, three years after he had seemingly announced his retirement in Australia. Murray has been one of Djokovic’s closest rivals and his opinion on Djokovic’s predicament is important. However, his visible exasperation after being asked about the Serb following victory was understandable: “Hence why I say [Djokovic’s detention is] not great for tennis, because we are talking about other stuff and politics and all of those things. I would rather be talking about how delighted and happy I am that I’m back in the final of a tournament again.” He still gave a full and considered answer on the subject. This has been a common sentiment throughout this week. Rublev, who was himself initially sceptical about vaccination last year, said as much. “I can only shrug my shoulders and regret that instead of tennis, everyone is discussing these things,” he told Russia’s Tass news agency. Whether Djokovic’s visa is reinstated by the start of the tournament or if his deportation is confirmed, his shadow will linger over this tournament until the end. Tennis Australia will likely be changed by their own role in this debacle, but however they come out of this, the governing body will be better served understanding that one no player should ever be bigger than a grand slam tournament. Doing so only undermines the rest.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic saga leaves Australian Open in tatters with draw in turmoil | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/novak-djokovic-saga-leaves-australian-open-tatters-draw-in-turmoil-tennis
1/15/2022,"Actor Anthony Taufa was heading out for sushi last Saturday when he got the call. A member of the cast of the Sydney Theatre Company’s production of Triple X had been pinged as a close contact of a Covid case. Would Taufa be ready to take his place? Tonight? “My wife said she could tell how stressed I was by the way my hands rose slowly from my hips to my armpits during the call,” Taufa says.  Taufa is one of four actors on standby should any member of the advertised cast of Triple X be ruled out of the show. Even so, he wasn’t expecting to end up on stage. “I lost my appetite and went straight into the theatre to cram-rehearse my scenes.” As the Omicron wave builds to a peak, major Australian stage productions have been forced to reschedule performances as the virus impacts casts and crew. To prevent the outright cancellation of entire seasons, theatre companies are now relying on understudies to make sure the show goes on: a strategy that’s been described as “unsustainable”, as it can add tens of thousands to a budget. Taufa is a familiar face to STC audiences for his roles in productions including Home, I’m Darling and Black is the New White. He had eight hours to prepare for a preview performance of Triple X, after Elijah Williams tested positive during isolation: his first time on the set opposite the show’s stars Glace Chase and Josh McConville. “It was really tense,” he says. “But Josh is a brilliant actor and he knows the show back to front, so when I skipped a couple of lines, he was able to wind the scene back and have me say them – because there was information the audience needed. “It was good to have someone who knew what they were doing while I was fluffing about thinking about when to pick up a bottle, and how to take a charcuterie board off the stage without bumping into the actor coming out of the bathroom. My head was exploding with it all.” With barely enough time to draw breath, Taufa was then called in for the opening night show in front of an audience packed with VIPs, fellow actors and critics. “It was exciting,” Taufa admits. “But yeah, I was pretty anxious.” Taufa will remain in the cast until at least 18 January, when Williams is due back; he’ll be joined by a second understudy, Cheree Cassidey, after another cast-member, Cristen O’Leary, tested positive. In musical theatre, it’s standard practice to have a number of alternates (“swings”) in the ensemble cast who can cover leading roles should a performer fall ill or need to take a break. Earlier this week on Broadway, for instance, understudy Kathy Voytko suddenly found herself opposite Hugh Jackman starring in the Music Man; she found out at midday, had her first rehearsal at 1pm, and went on stage that night. Up until very recently, however, Australian theatre has mostly got by without them. If an actor falls sick or is injured, they often go on anyway, relying on adrenaline, painkillers and “Dr Footlights” to get them through. Covid has changed all that. Even with casts and crew living and working in Covid-safe “bubbles”, the highly transmissible Omicron strain makes it likely that someone involved in a production could be ruled out of a number of performances. The understudy is now central to a show’s survival. “It’s a new paradigm,” says Mitchell Butel, artistic director of the State Theatre Company of South Australia, which is presenting Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at the Sydney Opera House as part of Sydney festival. The production has two understudies covering all four roles. “The challenge is in the funding,” he explains. “Employing understudies adds tens of thousands of dollars to a budget. It eats into your ability to pay for other things. But cancelling is far worse, and so in terms of risk mitigation, understudies are really important now.” Kip Williams, artistic director of Sydney Theatre Company, agrees. “It’s incredibly new for us. Prior to Covid we never had understudies. We couldn’t afford them. But now, if we have to cancel a performance in the Roslyn Packer theatre due to Covid, that’s 900 seats gone. If we cancel a Wharf 1 show [such as Triple X] that’s about 350 seats.” The STC’s recent production of Julius Caesar had three understudies, none of whom were used. Neither were the understudies for its Death of a Salesman. But the extra money is worth it for peace of mind, says Williams – at least for now. “It’s a kind of insurance policy but financially, it is unsustainable. It’s not even something we can commit to a long way in advance.” In order to keep costs down, understudies don’t rehearse in the same way as the main cast. It’s a seat-of-the-pants gig, says Taufa. “For Triple X, we watched a run of the play twice through, took notes and asked the other actors about the technical things to do with entrances and props. We have to do exactly what they do in order to maintain the integrity of the show.” There’s no training in how to understudy, Taufa adds. “It’s a different set of tools and you’ve got to be much more self-reliant. You don’t have much contact with the director or the other actors. You are just slotting in the best you can and it can be very tough.” Different productions use understudies in different ways. If understudies Benjin Maza and Isabel Vahakartano go on during Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, it’s likely they will have Edward Albee’s script in their hand. “Martha and George are two of the biggest roles in theatre and it’s a three-and-a-half hour play,” Butel says, adding that, in his experience, audiences are very accepting when someone has to perform “on-book”. “I still think it’s good to offer the audience the opportunity for a refund if they really didn’t enjoy the show with an understudy in place, but a lot of people find it fun – something different.” For understudies, particularly those who are up-and-coming in their careers, the gig can be a great experience, says Butel (who once stepped up to play Iago in a Bell Shakespeare production of Othello, with no rehearsal in the role at all). “Understudying is invaluable in terms of exposure, and the access to professional rehearsal rooms is pretty great as well,” Butel says. “It’s not like you don’t get noticed.” Triple X plays at the Sydney Theatre Company Wharf 1 until 26 February. Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? plays at the Sydney Opera House until 23 January; at the Dunstan Playhouse, Adelaide, 27 January-6 February; and at QPAC Playhouse, Brisbane, 12-16 February.",Arts/Stage,‘My head was exploding with it all’: understudies suddenly thrust into the spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/15/my-head-was-exploding-with-it-all-understudies-suddenly-thrust-into-the-spotlight
1/15/2022,"Before moving overseas six years ago, I sold my car and have been living without one ever since. Life in New York for the first two years was a breeze, but being car-free in Sydney? Not so much. Private cars have always been integral to getting from A to B in Australia. While I caught the bus to school, afternoon and weekend activities usually required a lift from my parents or those of a friend. I got my own licence as soon as I was eligible and a few years later bought my first car, which I used most days.  The past four years have felt like a struggle against the inertia of an environment built for cars – especially now that I’m carless in a beachside suburb with no train station and only a couple of bus services. I have lucked upon a single bus that takes me door-to-office in about 30 minutes, making travelling to work via public transport a simple choice. But travelling 5km across a couple of suburbs to visit a bar or restaurant isn’t as easy. In one example it requires a minimum of two buses and a 40-minute journey, or 53 minutes on foot, according to Google maps. Driving would take just 13 minutes. Before giving in and buying a car, I decided to spend 12 months using the car-sharing app GoGet, taking stock of the costs and experience in an effort to avoid the significant outlay and carbon emissions a personal car entails. In that time I learned that car-sharing is both liberating and a big hassle. GoGet offers a network of 3,400 vehicles spread across five Australian cities that you can rent through an app for an hourly rate, and access via a smart card. There are starter, occasional or frequent plans, depending on your usage. I paid $30 a month for a minimum hire rate of $6.70 per hour, plus $0.40 per kilometre, which included petrol and insurance. The app shows you a map of nearby vehicles that you can book in advance, and cancel right up until the last minute. With several cars located within 500m of my apartment, including an SUV with a baby seat, I only once had an issue finding a conveniently located free car. Over the course of 12 months I took 80 trips, travelled 1,690km and spent $2,246.15 on GoGet – an average of $187 a month. I used a friend’s car to calculate the rough equivalent cost of a private car, which came in slightly higher at $2,406 ($477 for mandatory “green slip” liability insurance, $381 for registration, $1,248 for optional comprehensive car insurance and $300 on petrol). At face value, these costs are similar, but there are some qualifications. For the first six months of the year, I had a friend living around the corner whose car I borrowed at least once a week for small trips. I also sometimes found it was cheaper to pay for an Uber than to pay for time the GoGet car would spend parked near the venue (you can extend the booking in 30-minute intervals). And, crucially, this experiment took place during the pandemic, with at least a quarter of that time spent in lockdown. In normal times, which I hope are coming, I would expect to drive more often, and further afield – particularly to see my parents who live 27km away (50 minutes by car, more than twice that via public transport, or $60 via GoGet for a three-hour visit). Using a car-sharing service made me more aware of both my spending on transport and my environmental footprint. Every time I went to book, I would ask: “Do you really need a car for this? Do you really need to make this trip?” – something I never did when I had my own car. Usually the answer was yes, but that didn’t assuage the nagging sense of guilt I felt knowing I was contributing to CO2 in the atmosphere and spending money I could ostensibly be saving. I suspect the guilt I felt booking cars was more financial than environmental, but I did become more aware of my carbon footprint in the process, and it has become more of a factor in my decision on whether to buy again. Since I’m near the coast, parking in my area tends to become tricky on sunny days. Jennifer Kent, a senior research fellow in urbanism at the University of Sydney, says lack of access to parking is “a huge motivator” for car sharing. “People are moving into inner city areas where parking is extremely constrained and they’ve simply got nowhere to put a car. But you’ve got to put that in the context that to be able to [give up having their own car] they need to have access to good public transport, good walking and good cycling for all the other trips that make up their lives. “Car-sharing is not for regular journeys, it’s too expensive, so car-sharing only works as part of that network. And that’s half the problem we’re facing with getting car-sharing to work out in the suburbs.” In my case, GoGet only somewhat alleviated this problem, with its own reserved parking, since I would often find a Porsche or similar luxury car taking up the spot on my return anyway. Kent says Australian cities “kind of grew up at the time of the private car”. “We just assumed that everybody would have access to a car, so that’s how we planned our suburbs. They’re really low density, they’re really difficult to retrofit with public transport, the distances that people travel are fairly long, so very difficult to satisfy with walking and cycling – and it’s very hard to change that around once it’s been established.” As a result, Australians are used to the independence a private car provides: the ability to go where we want, whenever we want, to carry a load, the feeling of safety a car provides – and also the sense of privacy. And we’re unwilling to give this up. “Australians are not typically all that great at sharing stuff,” Kent says. “If you think about the great Aussie dream, it’s all about private spaces, private backyards ... and that extends to cars … A lot of people actually see [their] car as an extension of their living room. You hear stories about people storing heaps of stuff in their car, a change of clothes etc. We can’t make that jump towards sharing because it’s not only that we’re sharing the mobility of the car, we’re also giving up that sense of space.” At times during the past year, for a week here and there, I had access to the cars of friends or family who were travelling, and I definitely noticed the extra convenience of knowing the car was there whenever I needed it. That convenience isn’t a deciding factor in whether to buy a car, but it’s certainly a nice-to-have at times. On the other hand, I also enjoy the feeling of being part of a sharing culture, it feels more communal and is something I miss about the New York subway, for instance. One of the main outcomes of this experiment has been to make me more aware that my decisions are primarily based on self-interest. I’m not alone. “We’re more of an individualistic society than societies in Europe, for example, where car-sharing is a bit more popular,” Kent says. “We have this understanding that in society there is inequality, and we’re OK with that inequality existing. Whereas other countries where sharing might be more popular see more of a defence of a more equal society, and more equal access, which is better suited to things like public transport, and car sharing.” Kent says Australia’s attachment to private cars is a vicious circle. In order to give up our cars, we need to know that the public transport infrastructure exists for us to get where we need to go in a timely manner. But for public transport to improve, there needs to be a strong constituency voting for it in the first place. Without that, she says, a stick might help. “I think we actually need for things to get a little bit dire. So looking at the snapback, post-Covid, for example, all the modelling suggests that traffic is going to increase … because people are not wanting to use public transport. And the only thing that’s going to stop that from happening is increased congestion – people just getting sick of being stuck in traffic and shrugging their shoulders and saying, ‘OK, I’ll get back on the bus’. “We’re a bit like surly teenagers, you know? Like, if you make me I’ll do it, but I’ll do it begrudgingly.” I still haven’t decided whether to buy a car, but I’m leaning in that direction. While this experience has made me reflect on the role of private cars in our society and think deeply about what kind of city I want to live in, I suspect the practical need to keep travel time and costs down will tip the scales in favour of ownership in the long run.",News/Technology,Do you really need your own private vehicle?

1/15/2022,"An exemption issued to a South Australian meatworks to allow Covid-positive staff to continue working creates a dangerous precedent for other firms eager to operate even as case numbers soar, the head of Australia’s unions says. Teys Australia abattoir near Naracoorte, which supplies beef to supermarket giant Woolworths, operated for several days before closing on Thursday even after at least 140 of its nearly 400 staff tested positive for Covid.  SA Health issued an exemption to allow infected staff to work if they were asymptomatic, but one employee said some sick staff had worked despite showing symptoms. “I’ve seen unwell people still come to work,” the employee, who also contracted Covid, said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to comment publicly. “They still have a runny nose, they have coughs, they still have sore throats.” Workers who tested negative in daily rapid antigen tests were given yellow hairnets to identify them, while Covid-positive workers wore white ones. That practice was “demeaning and dystopian”, the ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said. All meatworkers continued to use the same toilets and worked in common spaces, such as the boning room, without special air filters. Covid-positive workers wore face masks, balaclavas and gloves, the worker said. “We have taken big risks for our co-workers and then the public,” the worker said, adding he had to isolate at home to minimise the risk of infecting his family. Guardian Australia presented a detailed list of questions to the company and to SA Health and SafeWork SA. “Teys is strictly guided by SA Health and its risk management requirements,” a Teys spokesperson said. “We are satisfied with the strong controls we have in place and continue to RAT test workers daily in accordance with SA Health guidelines.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Earlier in the week, the official said SA Health had “approved a limited return to work for asymptomatic individuals in critical roles, on the condition they are feeling well and are isolated from other workers”. The special exemption appears to have been issued because the abattoir, which slaughters more than 600 cattle a day, had a stockpile of dead animals that needed to be processed. Some 70% of the output is earmarked for export, with a large portion of the domestic supplies going to Woolworths. The employee said the slaughtering is scheduled to resume on Monday and he expects a similar arrangement to continue allowing Covid-positive employees to return to work. About 90% of staff are overseas born, with the majority of them on temporary visas lately from Pacific nations such as Fiji, Vanuatu and Samoa, the worker said.

The exemption, though, set “a bad and dangerous precedent,” she said, because it risked spreading Covid further within the company and the local community. “Woolworths must be held to account here as they are their major customer in Australia,” O’Neil said, adding that Teys’ activity would not sit well with its own Responsible Sourcing Standards. A Woolworths spokesperson said the company expected “all of our suppliers to adhere to the Covid safety protocols set by their relevant state authorities”. “We have been advised by Teys that an exceptional three-day arrangement was approved by SA Health, in response to circumstances at the plant,” the spokesperson said. “We were not involved in the decision to introduce these temporary measures and are looking into the issues raised to ensure the labour standards we set for our suppliers have been met,” she said.

1/15/2022,"Double-dose vaccination rates among people with disability may be as low as 50% in some regional and remote local government areas, according to leaked federal Department of Health data. It comes as new figures, which have not been released publicly but have been obtained by Guardian Australia, reveal 20% of the approximately 25,000 people living in disability group homes have received a booster shot of Covid-19 vaccine.  That cohort was initially included in phase 1a of the vaccine rollout along with the aged care sector but then “de-prioritised”, according to a royal commission report.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The leaked health department document, obtained by Guardian Australia and marked “committee in confidence”, outlines jab rates by local government area among the 450,000 national disability insurance scheme participants (NDIS) and 750,000 disability support pension recipients. It also provides the first insight into vaccination rates by disability, confirming people with intellectual disability, psychosocial disability and autism were less likely to be vaccinated at the time the figures were extracted on 5 December. Nationally, the latest figures from 9 January show 83.4% of all national disability insurance scheme participants had been double-dose vaccinated. However, the leaked document indicates that while vaccination rates are very high in New South Wales and Victoria, the Department of Health has identified several local government areas of concern where rates among NDIS participants and disability pensioners are much lower. Double-dose rates will have improved since the data was collated but how much is unclear. The data is particularly stark in Queensland, where Covid cases have soared in recent weeks, and Western Australia, which has embraced a fortress approach to border policy that has so far kept cases low. The WA border is slated to open on 5 February, a move that will likely usher in significant community transmission. The health department document outlines dozens of local government areas where vaccine rates among people with disability (PWD) are a concern. Local government areas with NDIS vaccination rates below 60% at 5 December included: Mount Isa, Queensland, 55% double-dosed, NDIS population: 129 Gympie, Queensland, 59.3%, NDIS population: 725 Kalgoorlie, WA, 57.2%, NDIS population: 166 Karratha, WA, 55.2%, NDIS population: 116 Northam, WA, 58.7%, NDIS population: 104 Among disability support pensioners (DSP), some of whom will be on the NDIS, local government areas with rates below 60% at 5 December included: Byron, NSW, 58.3% double-dosed, DSP population: 1,264 Cook, Queensland, 55%, DSP population: 131 Mareeba, Queensland, 56%, DSP population: 702 Mount Isa, Queensland, 51.6%, DSP population: 347 South Burnett, Queensland, 59.7%, DSP population: 2,262 Tablelands, Queensland, 55.7%, DSP population: 870 Goyder, South Australia, 57.5%, DSP population: 219 Port Lincoln, SA, 58.2%, DSP population: 567 Barkly, Northern Territory, 45.2%%, DSP population: 188 MacDonnell, NT, 58%, DSP population: 169 Broome, WA, 48%, DSP population: 467 Carnarvon, WA, 45.7%, DSP population: 173 Denmark, WA, 54.5%, DSP population: 200 Derby-West Kimberley, WA, 45.5%, DSP population: 121 Esperance, WA, 58.2%, DSP population: 328 Gingin, WA, 55.6%, DSP population: 126 Kalgoorlie/Boulder, WA, 45.6%, DSP population: 518 Karratha, WA, 40.5%, DSP population: 195 Northam, WA, 54.6%, DSP population: 388 Perth, WA, 58.9%, DSP population: 545 Port Hedland, WA, 34.6%, DSP population: 237 Waroona, WA, 53.8%, DSP population: 119 Wyndham-East Kimberley, WA, 51.3%, DSP population: 160 York, WA, 55.4%, DSP population: 121 The data suggests that despite priority access given to NDIS participants in group homes, and then people with disability more broadly, some individuals identified as vulnerable in the vaccine rollout have fallen through the cracks. A source with knowledge of the data said it showed “people with disability are in trouble, especially in states with geographic and distance challenges, like Queensland and WA”. “Lower vaccination rates in regional and remote Australia is also a concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, who are many times more likely to experience chronic disease or disability,” the source said. “Regional Australia does not have health or other essential infrastructure to match that of the cities.” The document also indicates that authorities are aware people with particular disabilities remain unprotected, particularly in WA and Queensland. Among the 8,000 autistic people on the NDIS in Queensland, only 66% were double-dose vaccinated, according to the leaked figures. The state’s overall vaccination rate at the time was 78.7%. For those with a psychosocial disability, the figure was 69.1%, while it was 67.6% for those with a spinal injury. In WA, double-dose vaccination rates were also low for people with intellectual disability (71.1%), psychosocial disability (64.8%), autism (66.3%) and stroke (69.8%). Vaccination rates were between 80-95% across disability cohorts in NSW and Victoria. The Department of Health document noted: “Consistent with previous reports, [people with disability] lag the general population rates, but there are high coverage rates among PWD in the ACT, NSW and VIC, i.e. where there have been outbreaks.” This week, the government rebuffed requests from Guardian Australia to release data showing booster vaccination rates for people with disability. On Friday, a spokesperson said “data on booster doses within these cohorts is not currently available”. However, Guardian Australia has obtained the data, which was provided to disability groups in a private meeting with the Department of Health this week. It shows that at 9 January, 20.4% of NDIS participants living in group homes had received a booster. Among NDIS participants overall, 14.8% have received a booster. The figures refer to the proportion of each cohort who’ve gotten a booster, rather than those eligible for a booster. The Department of Health did not provide a response to questions on the leaked document, despite repeated requests from Guardian Australia. On boosters, the spokesperson said: “The commonwealth booster in-reach program for people with disability in residential accommodation settings commenced on Monday 8 November. “All residential accommodation settings that were part of the disability in-reach program for dose one and dose two have been allocated to commonwealth vaccine providers for the booster in-reach program – more than 9,020 residential accommodation settings.”",News/Australia news,"Vaccine rate for people with disability at about 50% in some regional areas, leaked data reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/15/vaccine-rate-for-people-with-disability-at-about-50-in-some-regional-areas-leaked-data-reveals
1/15/2022,"When the cops arrested scammer Evan Leslie McMahon in March 2019 they found a lot more than just the bootleg Netflix logins that enabled his clients to watch The Witcher on the cheap. Also in the possession of the early-20s hacker were nine electronic wallets containing an alphabet soup of cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, digibyte, XRP, stratis, bitcoin gold and litecoin – that he bought with the proceeds of his crimes.  McMahon escaped jail when he was sentenced in April last year for “providing a circumvention service” and “dealing with the proceeds of crime”, receiving an intensive correction order that allowed him to serve his two-and-a-half-month sentence in the community. But he forfeited the crypto, which was initially worth $460,000, but by the time of his sentencing had risen to an estimated value of $1.2m, making it the biggest stash of tokens seized by the commonwealth to date. To collect fees from customers of his websites, HyperGen, WickedGen, Autoflix and AccountBot, McMahon used 175 PayPal accounts held in fake names – aliases included Zac Kentish, Izabella Sjogren and Samuel Binns, according to court documents. He then converted some of the proceeds into crypto, federal police said. PayPal declined to comment when asked how McMahon had managed to open 175 accounts with the company and what this said about its anti-money laundering systems. “We devote significant resources to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity on PayPal,” a spokesman said. Australia’s financial security agency, Austrac, says the criminal use of cryptocurrency is no longer confined to online scammers like McMahon, who ran a series of websites selling logins to Netflix, Spotify and other subscription sites that he bootlegged using software that automatically generated the keys. “As legitimate use of cryptocurrency increases, we’re seeing a sort of comparable increase in abuse,” says Austrac’s national manager of intelligence operations, Michael Tink, who runs teams at the agency concentrating on cybercrime, national security and money laundering. “As an example, where a crime group might have previously been sending money offshore using the banking sector or a remittance dealer, in some cases – not a lot – we might see them trying to deposit criminal proceeds through a digital currency exchange provider and send money to a counterpart offshore using cryptocurrency itself,” he says. Tink is keen to point out that using cryptocurrency to launder the proceeds of crime is still “fairly” niche – but it is on the rise. While the seizure of McMahon’s wallets was the biggest crypto bust in Australia at the time, larger amounts have since been frozen by regulators investigating possible fraud. In October last year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission obtained federal court orders freezing bitcoin estimated to be worth between $7m and $22m that were allegedly related to what the corporate watchdog claims was an unlicensed superannuation investment scheme run by Gold Coast couple Aryn Hala and Heidi Walters. Asic alleged in court documents that at least $2.4m of investor money had been used to purchase crypto-assets. Asic’s investigation is continuing and no charges have been laid. Overseas enforcement agencies have also seized large amounts of crypto. Last month, the US FBI seized 3,879 bitcoin, which it claims in documents filed in the American federal court system are the proceeds of a US$155m ($216m) fraud perpetrated against insurance company Sony Life by employee Rei Ishii. Ishii has been charged with fraud in Japan and is yet to face trial. In another crypto seizure case before the US courts involving 9.881 bitcoin (about $590,000), authorities allege bitcoin was used to launder ill-gotten gains. Between May 2019 and February 2021, suspected money launderer Fernando Berrocal, a businessman in the perfume industry, picked up bulk cash from locations both inside and outside the US of US$2.3m ($3.2m), a Homeland Security agent alleges in an affidavit filed in forfeiture proceedings in the federal court system. This was made up of “$1m in illegal gambling proceeds and $1.3m in narcotics proceeds”, Homeland Security agent James Barden said in the affidavit. In addition, bank accounts owned or controlled by Berrocal received “$1,789,628.40 in proceeds generated by various financial frauds, many targeting elderly US residents,” Barden said. He accused Berrocal of controlling “multiple commercial and personal bank accounts and shell-companies in the United States and elsewhere”, as well as “multiple virtual currency accounts and/or Bitcoin addresses”, which were used to launder dirty money. “Berrocal conducted numerous financial transactions, many involving virtual currency, specifically bitcoin, to launder and transfer criminally derived proceeds from the United States to individuals and organizations outside the United States,” Barden said. The agent said Berrocal admitted that the bitcoin was the proceeds of his criminal activity “during a consensual interview with law enforcement” in March last year. No charges have been laid and the investigation continues. Cryptocurrencies had another of their moments in the sun last year, with the Commonwealth Bank announcing it would allow customers to buy, hold and transfer tokens through its app, ads for trading platforms dominating bus stops and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, talking about bringing exchanges – which are prone to collapse – into Australia’s regulatory system. But sceptics reckon the hype conceals a terrible truth: cryptocurrencies are fantastic for speculators but, despite many attempts, not much use as a means of exchange unless you are buying something you shouldn’t be. “Paying for things the government doesn’t want you to buy was the first actual payment use case for cryptos – the Silk Road drug market – and it’s still about the only one,” says David Gerard, the author of two books on cryptocurrencies and a keen and critical observer of the sector. “People only use crypto for payments when they can’t use good money for some reason, so they use this stuff instead. That’s expanded into large-scale ransomware. Ransomware existed before crypto, but not at this scale – that’s 100% on cryptos.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Meanwhile, dirty cash from crime continues to wash into a crypto ecosystem electrified by speculative investment that, despite frequent crashes, has driven the price of bitcoin up from a few hundred dollars in 2015 to close to $60,000 today. “The crypto system is not, technically, a Ponzi scheme – it just works like one,” Gerard says. “Early buyers can only be paid out with money from later buyers. The whole purpose is to sell magic beans to people for real money, and convince them that these objects are the future of anything other than getting skinned. “The general answer is: there’s no such thing as a get rich quick scheme, magic doesn’t happen, if there’s ever ‘one weird trick’ then it’s one weird trick for picking your pocket.” Austrac has limited visibility of what goes on inside this booming market. Currently, exchanges that register with it only have to report suspicious or large movements of cash into their coffers or payments out – not transfers of crypto that occur between market participants. However, Tink says the idea that transactions occurring on the blockchain – the distributed ledger that records crypto transactions – are completely anonymous is wrong. “Our analysts also have access to other open source commercially available and more classified tools and data sets that help them track transactions as they occur through the blockchain and also link that to other data and criminal intelligence holdings,” Tink says. He points out that one advantage of the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies is that the data is publicly available. “You might not always know who is behind a particular coin address, but it allows you to track transactions through with other data sets. It allows analysts to look at attributing wallet addresses to real world people.”",News/Australia news,Dirty cash and crypto: how the booming cryptocurrency market is open to exploitation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/15/dirty-cash-and-crypto-how-the-booming-cryptocurrency-market-is-open-to-exploitation
1/15/2022,"Scott Morrison kept Novak Djokovic waiting nine days for the ultimate and inevitable decision to tear up his visa, no doubt ensuring the Serb suffered further for causing trouble the government struggled to handle. The Djokovic visa snub was released in time for the main TV news bulletins on Friday and, they had hoped, late enough to limit the tennis champ’s lawyers chances of getting a judge to re-hear his case.  While that hope proved unfounded, the government believes a court could only examine the probity of immigration minister Alex Hawke’s use of his power to withdraw a visa, not whether Djokovic deserved to be punted. However, the damage to Australian tourism and Australian sport caused by a single, stubborn tennis player and a hesitant federal government could require a formal inquiry to sort out. The government might further explain how Djokovic obtained a visa in the first place, and Tennis Australia might tell sport fans why it welcomed a player – admittedly the best in the world – without insisting he comply with vaccination requirements, or without closely examining his claim for an exemption. The long wait for Hawke’s announcement was an indication the government wanted to get the visa matter right, something it might have considered more rigorously several weeks ago when the Djokovic problem poked over the horizon. Morrison has had to juggle complex factors involving big sport, inflamed diplomatic contacts, and his self-burnished record as being untiringly vigilant on Australian borders. The Djokovic furore appeared to overwhelm the government, with as many as four ministers involved in its resolution. They were home affairs minister Karen Andrews, immigration minister Alex Hawke, foreign minister Marise Payne, and Morrison himself. While the decision was almost a certainty, the government’s handling of the circumstances around it was not pretty. Morrison had not seen the bother the world’s best tennis player, and prominent Covid vaccination resister, would cause by coming to the Australian Open in Melbourne without the precautions demanded by the Australian government. When on 5 January the reality of the open secret hit the prime minister’s awareness, Morrison stumbled over who had to deal with the controversy, reverting to his standard practice of blaming others. “Well, that is a matter for the Victorian government. They have provided him with an exemption to come to Australia, and so we then act in accordance with that decision,” he told a press conference that day. The inevitability of Friday’s decision was based on the political and policy priorities the government has placed on “border protection”. This was reinforced by Hawke in the final line in his statement. “The Morrison government is firmly committed to protecting Australia’s borders, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. At a press conference on Wednesday Morrison laid out the grounds for kicking out Djokovic. He didn’t name the tennis star but the nudge-nudge, wink-wink was neon lit. “That individual has to show that they’re double vaccinated or must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. That is the policy. That policy hasn’t changed,” he said in part about a hypothetical overseas visitor since 15 December. The inevitability also was a product of the fact Morrison had the villain he needed to resolve the mess. It was Djokovic himself who on Wednesday self-identified as a wrongdoer – once by accident and once by deliberate neglect – and thus qualified as a candidate for expulsion. Naughty Novak confirmed he had mixed with others, specifically a journalist, when he should have been isolating after a 16 December positive Covid test. And he regretted his support team accidentally ticked the wrong box on Australian entry papers. He has apologised for both mistakes. But he wasn’t prepared to go quietly. And certainly he had no plans to go get vaccinated, despite the demand by Victorian premier Dan Andrews, Senator Jacqui Lambie and a cranky range of talkback radio callers. Morrison will not show gratitude for the admissions, but they have rescued the prime minister from a performance that was testing his talents at a time when the Covid wave was straining those talents in another direction. A small opinion survey by Utting Research found just over 50% of voters wanted Djokovic out, with 31% wanting him to stay. Those anti-Djokovic voices would have been loud and clear to Morrison as he hoped to drown out angry appraisals of his management of Covid testing measures.",Sport/Sport,"It was ugly and embarrassing, and the Djokovic saga only ever had one possible ending",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/15/it-was-ugly-and-embarrassing-and-the-djokovic-saga-only-ever-had-one-possible-ending
1/15/2022,"Australia coach Stacey Marinkovich is netball’s great number-cruncher, someone who pores over complex statistics and makes data-driven decisions. But heading into a four-Test Quad Series in London this weekend – which will bring the Diamonds’ total international preparation for this year’s Commonwealth Games to just eight games in two years – the equation for Marinkovich is simple. She has 240 minutes of pressure cooker match-play against England, New Zealand, and South Africa to get her new-look, relatively inexperienced side firing and at least signalling an intention to reclaim three lost crowns – their Commonwealth and World Cup titles and the Constellation Cup.  Following strict Covid protocols which began with the Australians effectively locking down from Christmas onwards, the Diamonds will take on the world champion Ferns, reigning Commonwealth gold medallist Roses and the Proteas at Copper Box Arena across four days, before play-offs on Thursday morning, Australian time. Liz Watson, who missed the 2021 Super Netball season after foot surgery, will be the solo captain for the first official time, after a controversial rotation system was used in Marinkovich’s only other outing as coach, in last year’s failed Constellation Cup. The woman Watson shared the captaincy with, veteran shooter Caitlin Bassett, did not make this team and looks to be finished at all levels of the game after struggling with knees injuries and failing to get a domestic contract for 2022. The return of Watson, widely regarded as the world’s best midcourter and the absence of Bassett – along with the paucity of Games preparation and the fact Australia have the least experienced squad with a combined 279 Test caps – makes this Quad Series one of the most keenly anticipated on record from a Diamonds perspective. Marinkovich is pragmatic about the situation her side find themselves in, primarily due to Covid. “It is what it is,” she said. “But this is a good chance for us to see where we’re actually at [given the lack of Tests]. I have great confidence that the program, and the way the girls are going about their time together, is really focusing on the way which we want to play. “When we go away, the focus is always to be successful and get results, but we know that there are a number of steps we have to take to do that, and we need to understand what our performance actually looks like win, lose or draw. After these outings against some international teams, we can then forward plan for the Games and bridge any gaps, but also continue to push and grow.” Watson, who Marinkovich described as “ready and raring to go” after close to 12 months on the sidelines, said she has confidence in her young side, despite very few Test minutes together. “We have only had one tour all together, but we all play in such an elite competition in Super Netball every week, so we have the experience, we have leadership,” she said. The Bassett-less shooting line – which includes vice-captain Steph Wood, Gretel Bueta, who is returning to the world stage after giving birth last year, freshly-minted Diamonds Cara Koenan and Sophie Garbin, and potential debutant Sophie Dwyer – is exciting and versatile. Watson said the attackers, along with the rest of the team which includes a mix of the established and unfamiliar, share a common goal. “We do feel the responsibility to get those gold medals back,” she said. Former Rose and current Scotland head coach Tamsin Greenway said while a settled England should go into the series as favourites having beaten the Ferns and world number four Jamacia recently, Australia should not be underestimated. “You look down the list of names and it’s all class,” Greenway said. “They play in the best competition in the world and they’re quality players with real spark. It’s not panic stations for the Diamonds at all. “Stacey has just got to be brave this series, cut out the outside noise and find her starting seven. I think she’s running out of time to not do that. Win or loss – and I know that’s still a strange concept for Aussie fans – the team itself needs to come away from this series with a clear idea of how it’s going to play, its identity.” Former Diamonds captain Liz Ellis, meanwhile, said Marinkovich needs to get buy-in for her game plan and not be blinded by stats. “Internationally, you’ve got to have a feel for the game and go with your instinct. I think this is the time for her to prove that, while yes, she’s excellent at data and numbers and a certain management style, that she’s also got a real gut feel and can make decisions based on what’s happening in front of her.”",Sport/Sport,Australia united in bid to return to former glories in netball Quad Series | Erin Delahunty,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/australia-united-in-bid-to-return-to-former-glories-in-netball-quad-series
1/15/2022,"You never forget the times you really get caught in the rain. “My first night out in Melbourne after the latest lockdown also happened to coincide with a torrential downpour,” says Melbourne designer Emily Nolan. “My best friend and I couldn’t get a table at a restaurant anywhere and I was wearing kitten heels with bows, a velvet suit and a silk shirt. I was dressed for freedom, not a storm, and we ended up completely drenched because outfits don’t always protect us according to plan.”  With unusually incessant rain in many states – and more to come over summer – even people in the world’s driest continent should probably now plan outfits for the ongoing wet weather. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has declared a La Niña weather event is under way, with modelling predicting it “will persist until the late southern hemisphere summer or early autumn 2022”. So, how do we dress for the rainy months ahead? According to Nolan, it begins with the shoes. “Topy your shoes,” she says. Topy’s rubber soles keep leather soles watertight and protected from the elements. “Having your shoes soled is the safest bet for keeping your toes dry and your grip strong,” Nolan says. “No matter how fabulous your outfit is, there is nothing quite like slipping in the rain in front of a bunch of traffic. “It is a little bit of wardrobe admin that will save you a whole lot of discomfort later on.” Parlour X founder Eva Galambos adds “you will want to avoid open shoes, which can be easily damaged by puddles and opt for a sturdier boot or platform sneaker instead”. Once you have your footwear suitably waterproofed, it’s time to consider your clothes. The best place to start is outerwear, which should be lightweight for the Australian climate, yet water-repellent for unseasonal downpours. “Heavier coats are appropriate in colder places but Sydney right now is just wet and humid,” says Sydney tailor Patrick Johnson. “You want something very light that covers whatever you’re wearing entirely, and it should dry quickly. With a light overcoat it also means you don’t have an urgency to take it off when you get indoors.” He recommends sizing up so you can accommodate various layers underneath, and says investing in a quality overcoat “is a great opportunity for dressing stylishly, as they look mature.” Because overcoats tend to be simple, he adds, “they’re very versatile”. Even if you’re not wearing it every day, Melbourne designer Christian Kimber recommends keeping a light and packable waterproof jacket in your bag, or at the office. It’s something he learned the hard way. “Coming from the UK there are so many times I’ve been caught in the rain on the golf course or wearing suede loafers and linen,” Kimber says. To avoid steaming under your overcoat, wear layers of lightweight and breathable natural fibres. “A bamboo singlet, a cotton tee, a breezy open over-shirt and a light knit thrown over your shoulders,” Nolan says. “You can peel them away according to the whims of the weather.” But it’s better to avoid white cotton, “or materials that have a tendency to become more sheer if wet”, Galambos suggests. Suedes, silks and other delicate fabrics are a no-gos too, along with full-length, wide-legged trousers and maxi-skirts, which quickly become mud-magnets in the wet. You might not expect a designer to recommend swimwear for rainy weather, but Kit Willow is emphatic you won’t regret it. She praises the quick-dry qualities of swimmers, and suggests bikini tops and one pieces can be worn under other light layers. To that end, the designer has created her own hybrid of swimwear and lingerie, made of up-cycled marine plastic, which can be worn as bodysuits and bra tops layered under other garments, to accommodate summer swims and summer storms. Of course, when it comes to unseasonal rain, the designer says the more important issue is the impact of climate change. “The bigger question here is what is causing these extreme unprecedented weather patterns,” Willow says. “Acquiring brands that limit their impact on the earth or upcycling your existing wardrobe is … immediate action we can take as consumers to help fight climate change.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Swimmers as tops and a coat that covers everything: dressing for a wet, hot Australian summer",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/15/swimmers-as-tops-and-a-coat-that-covers-everything-dressing-for-a-wet-hot-australian-summer
1/15/2022,"Keir Starmer is promising a “great renewal” for the NHS as he begins to sketch out Labour’s plans for government, capitalising on the scandals engulfing the Tory party. With Labour drawing ahead in the polls, party strategists are keen to point to what a Starmer government would aim to deliver were he to win the next general election.  Setting out his expectations for the NHS in the Guardian, Starmer said: “Our focus will be on the sort of renewal that has only ever been possible under Labour governments. “Just as the Blair government refocused the health service towards outcomes, we would switch focus from simply treating illnesses to preventing them. When I was director of public prosecutions, hardly a case came across my desk where early intervention couldn’t have turned lives around before they unravelled. The same is true in health.” He also stressed the role technology had to play, such as “hospital at home” systems where patients can be monitored remotely, saying the answer to the health service’s challenges was not “simply throwing money at the problem”, but being “forensic with investment”. Starmer, who will address the Fabian Society conference on Saturday, also accused the government of being too preoccupied with the Downing Street party scandal to govern the country. “Precious time is being wasted on the latest internal psychodrama of the Tory party instead of sorting out the mess they have made,” he said. Labour hopes to capitalise on Johnson’s battered reputation to outperform the Conservatives in May’s local elections in England as the next step in Starmer’s plan to revive the party’s fortunes. All London borough councils are up for grabs on 5 May, as well as one-third of seats in a string of metropolitan boroughs. Most were last fought in 2018, when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, a year after the 2017 general election campaign when he deprived Theresa May of her majority. The projected national share of the vote from those May 2018 council results put Labour level pegging with the Conservatives on 35%. This year, Labour hopes to come out ahead. “We’ve never actually won a set of elections, whether that be locals, European or national, since 2014, under three leaders,” said a Labour strategist. “It’s almost certainly the longest losing streak of a political party here in history. We have to break that this year.” Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats hope to make inroads in council elections in “blue wall” areas where they hope to take seats at a future general election. Ed Davey’s party pulled off a stunning victory in the North Shropshire byelection last month, after laying the groundwork with an enthusiastic campaign in last year’s local elections. Conservative MPs are being warned the party could lose Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet in London – though Labour sources are cautious, pointing out that even in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum when Labour was riding high in London, Wandsworth remained out of reach. The elections analyst Robert Hayward said that while the recent change in polling numbers made the May elections more challenging for Johnson, the likely focus on results in London, a Labour stronghold, posed issues for Starmer as well. “Until recently, they were in a pretty strong position as governments go 11 years into power. And clearly, things could change again between now and May,” Hayward said. While boundary changes in Tory-held Wandsworth were likely to help Labour gain that, he said, other Labour targets of Westminster, Barnet and Hillingdon remained too close to call. “The stakes are high for both leaders,” said Hayward, who is also a Conservative peer. “Starmer is perceived as being metropolitan. How would you feel as a Labour MP in a marginal seat in the Midlands or the north if he can’t even sweep the expected London boroughs?” If Johnson’s future remains at stake in May, one key indicator for the prime minister would be results in places such as Sandwell, Rotherham and Doncaster, where the Conservatives gained seats in last year’s local elections, Hayward said. “Has the tide gone back out for the Tories in those sorts of places, has it partially gone out, or has it not gone out at all?” One boost to Johnson could be a poll bounce if Covid restrictions were to be largely abolished, with cases falling, as happened over the vaccination drive last year, he added. “I think that’s very possible, and that will be one of the things No 10 is praying for,” he said.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer vows ‘great renewal’ of NHS in bid to make Labour a vote winner,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/14/starmer-vows-great-renewal-of-nhs-in-bid-to-make-labour-a-vote-winner
1/15/2022,"Markets have plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and meat available and have largely avoided the supply chain crisis that has stripped shelves bare at the big supermarket chains, according to operators and farmers. Supermarket distribution centres have suffered staff shortages caused by the Omicron wave that has forced as many as a quarter of their workers to isolate, prompting Coles and Woolworths to reinstate purchase limits on some products after panic buying emptied shelves.  However, market stall operators don’t suffer from the same problems because they buy directly from wholesale markets, the chief executive of Melbourne’s Victoria Market, Stan Liacos, said. “The way they purchase has far more flexibility in it than the way the far larger multinational supermarket chains do business,” he said. He said the market’s 60 fruit and vegetable operators and 10 fishmongers bought most of their stock daily at Melbourne’s wholesale markets. “They basically pick the stock, and if certain stock isn’t available from certain suppliers, they simply turn around and buy from others. “So they’re not locked into a handful of huge, watertight, contract-style relationships.” The stallholders have also avoided the bottlenecks caused by staff shortages in the logistics sector, where some companies have reported up to half their workers are unavailable. “Most of them, I’d say the vast, vast, vast majority are actually transporting themselves – they drive their own trucks,” Liacos said. “So they’re not at the mercy of transport companies.” He said this also explained why specialist fruit and veg shops also had plenty on offer. “They are also usually only buying probably two or three days and weeks in advance,” he said. “Whereas the supermarkets, generally speaking through their cold storage requirements, they’re accommodating food throughout the year.” Liacos said most of the meat sold at the market is butchered on site by operators, avoiding another bottleneck in supermarket chains – the processing plants where carcasses are chopped up and packed for sale. “The carcasses come down the line in the morning,” he said. “There might be some niche elements that come in pre-cut, in particular the poultry guys – they’re probably not necessarily cutting every chook. The wings could be coming in from a supplier.” The president of NSW Farmers, James Jackson, who is a sheep and cattle farmer, said food markets had a “more robust sort of supply chain”. He said farmers were producing plenty of food despite staff shortages in picking and packing. “There are individual supply chains that are affected, but a lot of us are still operating, so the markets are still full of produce,” he added. However, he said supermarkets were cancelling contracts with meat producers due to force majeure clauses that enable them to pull out when “the shit hits the fan”. “They can’t get any way to kill the animals because the abattoirs are shut down,” he said. “There is some problems with both white and red meat potential supply because in those industries essentially there’s a lot of people off sick and a lot of people waiting for a RAT [rapid antigen] test.” Jackson said the partial breakdown of supply chains bringing food from farms to the shelves of Coles and Woolworths raised the question of whether the federal government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had allowed them to become too big. “You have to ask the question as to whether the ACCC, in allowing the huge dominance of those two supermarkets for fresh food trading, something that we’ve been critical of for some years, whether that’s been prudent, and whether there’s other issues – so far as food security goes – that they didn’t properly consider.” “It’s a mess,” said Jackson, “and the laissez-faire approach to competition policy that the ACCC – well, the government – have taken, so far as the laws go on competition policy, in some way has contributed to this.”",News/Business,How fresh food markets are avoiding Australia’s crippling supply chain crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/how-fresh-food-markets-are-avoiding-australias-crippling-supply-chain-crisis
1/15/2022,"As daily Omicron case numbers skyrocket, and parents anticipate sending children back to school, the federal government has promised enough vaccine supply for all children to access a first dose by early February. Children aged five to 11 are now eligible for the new Pfizer paediatric formula. However, both clinics and families seeking the jab have reported widespread disruptions.  With booking systems glitching across NSW, and some clinics still waiting on deliveries of doses, families have reported a frantic search for vaccine appointments at state government clinics or general practitioners. Guardian Australia asked readers to share their experience of trying to get children vaccinated. Almost 150 reader responses show that, across states, complications in the rollout of first vaccine doses for children is rife. And the families able to access the jab seem aware they are “the lucky ones”. “Both appointments were cancelled. The doctor personally called me to cancel and was upset and said he had been on the phone to the government department “all day”. The pharmacy representative I spoke to, to confirm cancellation, was also upset and said the lack of stock was “a disgrace”. “Although my son doesn’t come under an approved medical condition, he has had a severe illness related to the flu previously and I have kept him at home on doctors advice, thus getting him vaccinated ASAP has been imperative. The appointment I finally made which did not cancel was a 45-minute drive from my home. The government should be ashamed.” “I had a booking with a state vaccination hub on the 11th. Got a message a couple of days beforehand to say that it was cancelled, and that someone from the department of health would contact me within three days to rebook. They did call, told there had been an issue with the online booking system creating non-existent bookings. They told me they could find me another appointment in a week or so – in Melton (1hr 20 away), or in Wodonga (almost four hours away). I said no thanks. “Next I booked through a GP (an hour away from me – the only place I could find that had bookings with less than about two weeks wait time). They cancelled two days later, due to inability to confirm supply. I then rang a local pharmacy on the 10th (they wouldn’t take bookings prior, due to supply issues), got a booking on the 11th, now my son’s just had his first vaccination.” “Our boys are autistic so initially we wanted to get them booked into a low-sensory clinic, but the only one accessible was booked out until April. Next best option was our GP, but they were booked out until March. We were apprehensive about how they would cope but we were able to book appointments for them at a local clinic pretty easily so we went for it. “Had the jabs done today, stretched the boys to their sensory limit but they made it through it. I know they’ll be anxious next time though, it was noisy and busy and a long wait – really not the best environment for people who really get overwhelmed. They are super proud of having got their jabs. Top-notch little citizens.” “Well before Christmas, the day that the rollout for children was announced to be commencing, from the 4th of Jan, we called our local pharmacy and booked for the 10th for our two children, seven and nine years old. “On Monday the pharmacy advised us they had to cancel as they had not received any vaccine and that the next first available appointment was now not until 28 February. “My wife went to four different pharmacies that day. Same story, no supply, no available bookings until late Feb at earliest. “Cannot tell you how much anger this has generated. We did the right thing, booked weeks in advance and if our appointment had been met both kids would have been fully vaxxed within a couple of weeks of school starting. Now we’re looking at March or April at earliest. “Like everything else that the Morrison government has been involved in to do with vaccine rollouts, it has been a complete and utter debacle.” “Had to call around a dozen doctors. Most don’t answer as they’re too busy, goes straight to answer-phone. Finally found somewhere two hours south at chemist. Then a friend put me on to somewhere closer at a GP on the 29th. By the sounds, there are no vaccines yet in Coffs Harbour, or RAT tests. It’s a circus.” “I have tried everywhere to make a booking. Despite appearing on the vaccine finder website, none of my local GPs or pharmacists are doing kids under 12. The two central Brisbane Queensland Health clinics that do that age group require appointments to be made, but there are no appointments available within the next month. “There might be enough stock of the vaccine but there is clearly a shortage of trained staff to put the vaccine into young kids’ arms. There seems to be no way of getting even a first dose before school goes back, unless they change things radically.” “I was telephoned by the surgery on Friday to say they had been expecting delivery that day and it hadn’t arrived. They said they’d be working overtime to fit children in once they received the vaccine and they’d call to rebook as soon as it arrived – they were hopeful it would be early this week (haven’t heard from them yet). “My daughter is only 11 but starts high school in the city this year with a long public transport commute, so I wanted to make sure she was given the earliest opportunity to build some protection before the school term starts (which is why I booked as early as I could). So I called around a number of local(ish) GPs and pharmacies on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning and all said they hadn’t received any of the children’s vaccine. “I turned to the NSW vaccine booking website and tried to grab a spot at any of the vaccine centres. I clicked on an available spot for this Thursday and it was gone by the time I’d filled in the online form. “I managed to secure a booking for today (Tuesday) at a new vaccine hub an hour and a half drive from where I live. My husband’s car broke down on the way to take my daughter for the appointment!!! And I rushed out and collected her and made it to the clinic only a bit past our allotted time. We were not missing this for anything! “The vaccine centre was so quiet. It was accepting walk-in adults and there was a slow but steady stream with no wait time. We saw at most 10 children in the half an hour we were there. Either they had made a decision to make the process as smooth as possible for the young children (which it really was – it was so easy and the staff were wonderful) or they didn’t have the supplies for more.“I remind myself we’re the lucky ones. There are so many families who don’t have the luxury of going to the lengths I did to get their children vaccinated. I hope we start to see some evidence of better planning and decision making from our elected officials.”",News/Society,‘It’s a circus’: Guardian Australia readers on trying to get Covid vaccinations for their children,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/15/its-a-circus-guardian-australia-readers-on-trying-to-get-covid-vaccinations-for-their-children
1/15/2022,"The next Labour government will build a new Britain based on security, prosperity and respect. To do that, we must renew the very foundations of our country. That will begin with renewal of the health service. The NHS must be resilient, able to meet the challenges of the future, and focused on prevention as well as cure. It must be there to protect us in the future, rather than requiring us to protect it in the present.  It is to the country’s great misfortune that at this crucial time we have a Conservative government yet again mired in scandal, led by a prime minister who is out of control, out of touch and out of ideas. Senior cabinet ministers are spending their days plotting how and when to dispose of him. Precious time is being wasted on the latest internal psychodrama of the Tory party instead of sorting out the mess they have made. Nowhere is that mess more profound than in the health service. Twelve years ago, the Tories inherited a strong NHS from Labour. Waiting times were the shortest on record. Today they are the highest since records began. Across the country, people are struggling to see a doctor, get the care they require or have a much needed operation. The claim from the government benches that all the NHS’s ills are down to Covid is simply not true. Waiting times were on the rise long before the virus showed up. Life expectancy had stalled. We went into the pandemic short of 100,000 staff in England and with patients unable to be discharged from beds. Lockdowns were necessary to stop the NHS falling over – but the reason it was in such a perilous state was because the Tories had made it so. Without a great renewal, the NHS will continue to be vulnerable to new variants and new viruses. That, in turn, will leave the country vulnerable. This is unsustainable. Lockdowns come at enormous cost to people’s lives and health, and the country’s economy. Being forced into a hokey-cokey of restrictions will only do more harm in the long term. Instead we must fix the damage the Tories have done, to make the NHS more resilient again. That means investing properly. Labour would get waiting lists down by getting staff numbers up: recruiting, training and – crucially – retaining the staff we need. We would treat care workers with respect by giving them real job security and rewarding them properly. And we would transform social care to give older and disabled people the support they need to live the life they choose. Our focus will be on the sort of renewal that has only ever been possible under Labour governments. Just as the Blair government refocused the health service on outcomes, we would switch the focus from simply treating illnesses to preventing them. When I was director of public prosecutions, hardly a case came across my desk where early intervention couldn’t have turned lives around before they unravelled. The same is true in health. Achieving this sort of change means rethinking how the healthcare system works. It will require us to focus on the patient rather than just the system, the community as much as the community hospital. If we are to keep people well and at home we must strengthen those services that in turn strengthen entire communities, such as adequate mental health provision. The NHS needs to be properly funded but, simply throwing money at the problem isn’t the answer. Instead, we need to think radically about how the NHS can deal with the challenges of the future. We would be forensic with investment. Technology has the potential to transform how we live and manage our lives, while also reducing pressures. It will be possible to get early warnings about diseases we may be vulnerable to. “Hospital at home” systems will allow patients to track and report their conditions, with remote supervision. Tackling the immediate crisis, future-proofing the NHS and shifting our focus to prevention is all part of Labour’s new contract with the British people. It will provide the security that comes with knowing the health service will be there for you and your loved ones when you need it. It will increase our nation’s health and wellbeing, giving us all the chance to prosper. And it will provide people with the dignity and self-respect that come with being able to have control over your own life. The Tories don’t get any of this. They think it’s enough for the NHS to merely survive. Under Labour, the NHS – and Britain – will once again thrive.

1/15/2022,"When the pandemic struck Australia in March 2020, academics began losing their jobs in droves. Within a year, 20% of people employed in tertiary education had lost their jobs. And every day for 18 months, union organiser Frank Gafa would take their calls. “I was day in, day out sitting in my house talking to people on the phone who were losing their jobs,” the Wailwan and Wiradjuri man says. “It was pretty intense and I didn’t really acknowledge it … that’s actually pretty traumatic to sit and listen to people’s trauma.”  For most of that time Melbourne, where Gafa lives, was in lockdown. Social and community activities were restricted – work was all that was left. And, like thousands of others – working from their bedrooms or kitchen tables, or wearing a mask providing a frontline service – he realised it wasn’t enough. Like thousands of others confronting their own work-life balance during the pandemic, he realised he needed to do things differently. By August 2021, Gafa was burned out. He quit his job and started a new one, without taking a break. One month into his new role he realised his mistake: he did not need a change. He needed a holiday. “I had this really unhealthy relationship with work where I had to be forced to go on leave,” he says. “So I had this little crisis of, maybe I could actually just have a break rather than keep pushing on? Maybe I should just stop and enjoy my life.” He returned to the union and cashed in his unused leave to take three months off. The first few weeks were spent without his laptop, his first holiday without a computer for 10 years. His newfound resolution is to take regular breaks once he returns to work. To find a better balance. The hardest part will be keeping it. “Being a union organiser is really central to my identity,” he says. “I don’t know what I would do if I just got a normal, nine-to-five desk job. I think I might be lost.” The pandemic forced many Australians to reevaluate their relationship to work and the central role it plays in our lives and identities. For many, the shift to working from home provided the space and time needed to make big decisions. When Guardian Australia asked readers whether the pandemic had made them reassess their lives, dozens responded by saying they quit or were considering quitting jobs that they did not like or that demanded too much of them. They turned down work in favour of activities they actually enjoyed, scaled back their need for material possessions, and in some cases retired early, choosing to live a more restrained life on the pension than continue in a job they hated. Many said they quit jobs that did not align with their values to take on more meaningful work; others vowed not to let work – any work – dominate their lives any longer. “The pandemic pushed me to make my life become meaningful again,” says Rosie Pavlovic, who quit her job and moved to New Zealand to be with her long-distance girlfriend. “I never want to work for something I don’t believe in.” Some have been able to restructure their lives through remote work, a change of career, or a change of location. But many – because of insecure work or choices restricted by debt, poverty and family obligations – remain stuck. David Thompson* is one of the stuck. Before the pandemic he was aware that he was “bored out of my mind” doing his well-paid office job but “I could distract myself with plans and holidays”. “That’s not really the case any more,” he says. “And once that’s gone you just kind of look around and think, what am I left with?” Thompson never really found his calling. He did all the right things: excelled at school and graduated with a science degree from a good university, with the aim of finding “any job that I can tolerate that earns me enough money to fund the lifestyle that I want”. That lifestyle is not extravagant, but it has expanded to fill his income. He could not afford to maintain it and to pay the mortgage if he were to start over in a different career, and won’t risk his children’s financial security to secure his own happiness. Thompson is determined that his children, facing global existential challenges, will have a different life. “I say to them, if you have something that you can grab onto now, and you really love, then by all means follow that and if you don’t make a lot of money doing it, I don’t care. You can live with us. Because the other way, I don’t think happiness lives there.” Joshua Badge, a Melbourne-based writer and academic, did place meaningful, fulfilling work over financial gain, and it left them close to homelessness. Their teaching contract at a Melbourne university ended and they were left without the bulk of their income. They had been working as a writer on the side – but without teaching, writing became their mainstay. “Partly out of necessity I threw myself into work, working more than I ever had ... often 9am to midnight,” they say. They skated on the edge of financial catastrophe for months. Work – the freelance researching which paid his bills – felt pointless against the backdrop of global catastrophe, and there are more catastrophes on the horizon. “There is a real sense of nihilism about that,” Badge says. “The immediate material needs aside, why should we be working at all? What is the point of it?” But the crisis did lead to a shift in identity: now when Badge is asked, ‘so what do you do?’ they answer: ‘I’m a writer’. “I now tend to answer with what I want to be doing first and what I’m doing for money second,” they say. “[Writing] is not remunerative at all. But it’s what I love to do and what I want to do with my life.” Badge is clear that they are choosing a life of doing what they love over a life of financial stability because the latter does not even feel like an option. Owning a home feels out of reach; many of their peers are living in sharehouses in their 40s. If work was more stable, those same people might be taking long service leave at this point in their careers. Instead, they are burning out. Kristin O’Connell was granted the disability support pension in early 2020, after illness stymied her career in the not-for-profit sector. She spent the last two years working with the Unemployed Workers’ Union to support and advocate for those navigating the pandemic on below-poverty line jobless benefits. It is hard, uncompensated work, and caused her to unpick one of the fundamental tenets of modern society: that work is inherently tied to income. “Lots of extremely valuable labor is unpaid, and lots of totally worthless labor is highly paid,” she says. In a roundabout way, she says, the pandemic exposed more privileged people to the idea of unpaid work: as their office jobs went remote, they suddenly had time to pursue other interests. O’Connell hopes the desire to keep that time “may build into a movement of working less”. “That provides more opportunity for everyone to do more unpaid work that gives them satisfaction in their life and helps them support people who they care about.” But O’Connell is not hopeful the change in attitudes to low-paid and unpaid work will outlast the crisis. She has already watched as the federal government doubled unemployment benefits overnight then shrunk them back a year later, with minimal protest. “None of those changes stuck with people.” While causing some to reconsider the point of work, for many the pandemic fundamentally reshaped how and where they worked. A Productivity Commission report from last September said that up to 40% of Australian workers had worked from home during the pandemic, up from ABS estimates of about 24% doing at least one day a week at home in March 2020. The Productivity Commission found that for some working from home was a welcome and hopefully permanent change, and others an additional stressor as lines between work and personal time became blurred. One reader told Guardian Australia their workplace had become fully flexible and they did not plan to go into the office more than one day a week this year. “This is huge for me as a neurodivergent person and a single parent,” they said. “I am much more committed to my job and have produced more in the last two years than in previous years … I have also become much closer with my children, as I was working full time out of the home previously.” Another said they felt the pandemic had eased the stigma on men working from home, or adopting more caring responsibilities. “I am prioritising myself and my career but not at the detriment of everything else.” Others said working from home made them feel isolated and overwhelmed. The pandemic increased rates of burnout, particularly among women, says Australian researcher Gabriela Tavella. Tavella has spent the past few years researching burnout as a workplace disease alongside Prof Gordon Parker at the University of New South Wales. “The pandemic has seen women disproportionately affected by burnout because of a phenomenon called the second shift, which is when you come home from work and then have to take on primary care and homemaking duties – a second shift of work,” she says. These workloads, during the pandemic, overlapped. But despite the impact it had on women with children, Tavella says working from home during the pandemic allowed some people to reclaim time that would otherwise be spent in long commutes, resulting in a better work-life balance. According to a June 2021 report by the ABS, working from home and spending more time with friends and family were the two elements of life under Covid that people most wanted to retain after the pandemic. Instead of getting on a train at 6am, people could sleep later, go for a walk, and still make their 9am meeting. They could do laundry and other tasks in their lunch break, freeing up their weekends for other pursuits. For many workers, the risk of blurred boundaries between personal and work time is heavily outweighed by the freedom and flexibility of working from home. A report by the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work found that despite concerns about unpaid overtime and so on, 65% of people working from home expected to continue doing so after the pandemic. Major workplaces have responded by introducing more flexible working. The Victorian public service now offers flexible working on all jobs. New South Wales public service, Telstra, and major accounting firms Deloitte and EY all did so prior to the pandemic. A 2021 study by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency found that four out of five workplaces of more than 100 employees had formal flexible workplace policies, and that there was “an overall upward trend” in the number of employers doing so. Flexible work, it said, had the capacity to improve worker satisfaction, productivity and gender equality. But Australian workplaces have been slower to introduce fully remote work, meaning people still need to live close enough to their workplace to go in a few times a week. Employment lawyer Rob Jackson expects that to change. “At the moment people are still trying to recover from the shock of the pandemic and what it all means, and some are defaulting back to what was normal two years ago,” he says. “But I think in 10 years’ time that working from home model will be much more commonplace. Traditional employers will see the cost-benefits of not having an office once they realise that the world hasn’t fallen apart.” Jackson says there are some rational arguments for working from the office. Face-to-face meetings are still believed more effective than those which take place on video conferencing, and it is important for staff morale and workplace cohesion that employees know each other as more than a series of tiles on a group video call at the weekly team meeting, like a workplace game of Guess Who. But there is also a strand of presenteeism among employers who want employers in the office, five days a week, where they can be supervised. That’s a mentality, Jackson says, which is likely to be rejected by workers who have the option to move on. “There will be diehards who will maintain that five days a week, Monday to Friday, in the office, is the only way to operate. But I think they’re going to be in an increasing minority.” *some names have been changed.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Maybe I should just stop and enjoy my life’: how the pandemic is making us rethink work,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/maybe-i-should-just-stop-and-enjoy-my-life-how-the-pandemic-is-making-us-rethink-work
1/15/2022,"One of the cruelties of New Zealand tourism is that international visitors arrive expecting to find a vast, unpeopled land – the sharp peaks, rolling grasslands and roaring rivers of Middle-earth. But when visitors land at Auckland airport they do so on a concrete strip at the edge of a muddy tidal harbour. The airport terminal itself is under perpetual reconstruction, the roads leading to and from it are clogged at most times of the day, and as soon as you escape the city using the main highway the view is more or less the same for the next two hours: dairy farm after dairy farm, unnaturally lush and green as farm owners fertilise and irrigate the land to all hell.  After about two-and-a-half hours of driving, the next human-made landscape unfolds in the distance. The central North Island pine kingdoms. Pinus radiata, or the Monterey pine in its native North America, is an evergreen conifer with emerald needles that are prickly to the touch. The pine is an unlikely commercial species, under threat in its natural range. But in New Zealand the species thrives. It grows quicker here than anywhere else in the world, relishing our different soils. Wildings often grow in coastal sands, heavy clays, gravels and – in the central North Island at least – volcanic ash deposits. As someone who grew up in Kawerau at the kingdom’s north-eastern edge, the smell of the radiata’s mineral-like pollen is the smell of home. In spring yellow clouds blow across the town, coating bonnets and window ledges in tangy powder. But as a hay fever sufferer, I hate it. I resent the forest. As a Māori, doubly so. The area’s first plantations were grown at the turn of the century using prison labour and, after that great success, the next waves were planted in the postwar period using the unemployed. That first detail is unsettling enough, but nothing on actually standing in a pine plantation. They’re unnaturally silent. There are few insects. There are practically no birds. Radiata pines destroy biodiversity. And yet, hidden within these graveyards to native forests past are some of New Zealand’s most magnificent wild places. About 40 minutes’ drive out of Kawerau, on an unsealed forestry road under Pūtauaki’s volcanic peak, is the Tarawera Falls. The falls find their source at Lake Tarawera, at the foot of Mount Tarawera. The rhyolitic dome, painted in white, brown, and maroon, the deposits of a violent eruption in 1886, stands guard alongside Pūtauaki. In the ancient stories the two mountains were lovers. For a million years they were together. But after a million and one years Pūtauaki was unfaithful, stealing furtive glances to the coast where white hot Whakaari blew her steam clouds. The old chief plotted his escape. One night, when the laws of physics permitted mountains to move, Pūtauaki made tracks, abandoning his eternal partner for the possibility of the steaming coast. But halfway through his journey the chief felt a force at his back. Their son, Whatiura, was following his father. He insisted his son return. Whatiura refused. As the two went back and forth daybreak was approaching, threatening to freeze the two giants in place. Pūtauaki, faced with an impossible choice between continuing on to his new lover, Whakaari, or remaining with his quarrelsome son, chose the latter. And so, by the laws of ancient physics, the two were frozen in place. On discovering this treachery at dawn, Tarawera blew her top, flooding the lake – what was Pūtauaki’s old resting place – and the river – Pūtauaki and Whatiura’s escape tracks – with the tears of a million years lost. In their beauty and power the Tarawera Falls are a testament to a partner’s grief. This story is told briefly to tourists who come more for the fall’s hydrological features than the narrative of its genesis. At several points on its course from the lake to the falls the river disappears underground, boring a deep hole in the volcanic rock and then gushing through the earth underneath your feet. In person, the process feels unmistakably violent. Nothing cuts through land like running water and ice. The sound of the water disappearing underground draws your ear to the well, a deep, constant drum that threatens to swallow you whole. After appearing above ground and disappearing again, the river blasts through a cliff face to form the Tarawera Falls itself. A traditional waterfall runs above a cliff and gravity drags it down. This waterfall runs underground and smashes through the middle of the cliff, carving enormous holes in its side to greet gravity. It’s one of New Zealand’s great sights and wild places. Some New Zealanders think of their country as one without a deep past. In Europe and Asia, millennia old villages survive, and ancient castles and keeps and halls and universities still stand. But New Zealand lacks any of that. Its great pā (large settlements) are abandoned, mere terraces and depressions on seemingly random hilltops. But New Zealand does enjoy a deep past. You only need to know where, and how, to look. Before colonisation Māori would march in single file to break in a new track. On steep terrain they would drive wooden pegs into the earth, leaving a guide and a grip for subsequent marchers and wanderers. On modest cliff faces, they would lower wooden ladders. And when they came across a river they would anchor their reed boats for future crossings. The Tarawera Falls forms one part of an ancient track, connecting the people of the lake to their blood relatives on the coast. Pūtauaki never quite made it to the Bay of Plenty coast. But the humans who trace their whakapapa (lineage) to him did, helping reconcile the rupture in time between Tarawera, Pūtauaki, and Whakaari, the ancient volcanoes whose longing, grief, and tempers still flare today.

1/15/2022,"Jam Land, the company part-owned by the energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard, has filed a legal challenge to the validity of a listing designed to protect native grasslands in the New South Wales Monaro region. The challenge to the protections is part of a case filed in the Federal Court on Christmas Eve that is appealing the outcome of a ministerial review. The review affirmed that Jam Land had illegally cleared up to 28.8 hectares of natural temperate grassland on a property in Corrowong in southern NSW and required the company to remediate. It also found the clearing to be in breach of a civil penalty provision of the environmental protection legislation.  Although Angus Taylor’s interest in Jam Land is through an indirect shareholding, it puts him in the unusual position of being connected to a case challenging the decision of one of his government’s own ministers. Guardian Australia has been told the minister is not involved in the court case. However, when the clearing was first investigated, he made representations to the department and the office of the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, about the listing of the grasslands. In 2020, three-and-a-half years after Jam Land sprayed herbicide on the property, an investigation by the department concluded the grasslands had been removed illegally and ordered Jam Land restore 103 hectares of grasslands on another part of the property. The company sought a ministerial review of that determination. In December a delegate for the environment minister affirmed the original findings and the remediation order. In its appeal, the company is challenging the remediation determination and is seeking a declaration that the listing of the grasslands as critically endangered in 2016 by the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, was invalid. The respondent in the case is the current environment minister, Sussan Ley. Angus Taylor is a shareholder in Jam Land, via his family company Gufee, and his brother Richard is one of its directors. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Jam Land investigation has been controversial because Angus Taylor sought meetings with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the investigation was under way. Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws in 2019 revealed Frydenberg’s office subsequently sought advice about whether laws protecting the grasslands could be changed. Angus Taylor has repeatedly stated that he sought the meeting with departmental officials on behalf of constituents in Hume who were concerned about the grasslands listing. He has previously said “I did not make any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to any compliance action being undertaken.” The department has previously said officials did not discuss the compliance matter with Taylor. Both Taylor and Frydenberg have said the meeting was focused on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing. Ley’s department provided a statement saying it was aware Jam Land had commenced legal proceedings. “As this matter is before the Federal Court, we cannot comment further,” a spokesperson said. “We understand the court has not yet set a date for hearing of the proceedings.” Jam Land declined to comment while the proceedings were under way. In December, Richard Taylor said the company believed it had undertaken a best practice environmental assessment when it commissioned an ecologist to assess the property before the clearing in 2016.

1/15/2022,"In the second week of October, as New South Wales was emerging from a winter of stultifying Covid-19 lockdown, new premier Dominic Perrottet quickly set about positioning himself as the optimistic face of post-pandemic Australia. Introducing himself to an electorate which had clung to the cautious leadership of Gladys Berejiklian like a security blanket during the Delta wave, the new premier did not seek to define himself as a business-as-usual replacement.  Instead, at a series of press conferences held in pubs across Sydney, Perrottet arrived as the beer drinking, freedom-loving leader determined to push Covid-19 off the front page by ushering in a new era of living with the virus. The chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, was notably sidelined, while the quarantine requirements for international arrivals, which had been a mainstay of Australia’s Covid response, were quickly scrapped. In November, restrictions were further eased ahead of the scheduled roadmap set by Berejiklian before her departure. “We can’t live here in a hermit kingdom,” Perrottet said on 15 October, announcing that NSW would re-open its borders. “We’ve got to open up.” For a while, the cheerful crash-or-crash-through style worked. From the end of lockdown to early December, Covid cases remained stable in NSW, while the number of hospitalisations actually fell. On 8 December Perrottet gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he pushed for state and commonwealth reform “as we move beyond the pandemic”. By mid-December though, as the highly-contagious Omicron variant led to mounting case numbers, the equation began to change. This week, as the premier marked 100 days in office, he finds himself beset by mounting crises including a failing testing regime, an overwhelmed hospital system, supply chain shortages and a skyrocketing infection rate which ranks among the highest in the world. Questions are now being asked about the government’s direction since Berejiklian was forced to resign. Some senior ministers are increasingly nervous about a barrage of negative headlines facing the government just months after losing its biggest electoral asset, Berejiklian’s personal popularity, and in the face of a series of byelections due in coming months. This week the former NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, who resigned to run for the Liberals in the federal seat of Gilmore, released a video on Facebook in which he called for “empathetic leadership” and urged the government to consider increased business support while “listening to Kerry Chant”. At the heart of the unease is the idea that in breaking away from what some perceived as Berejiklian’s over-cautious approach, Perrottet may have pushed the needle too far in the opposite direction. “The thing about Dom is he is a relentless optimist, he’s a glass half-full person. That’s actually a good thing, but it meant he wanted to charge ahead and be the hero who freed the state without fully thinking about the consequences,” one senior MP told the Guardian this week. “It’s obvious the planning wasn’t there to think about ‘OK, cases aren’t the main game but if cases do start to rise, what happens next?’” That Perrottet had chafed at some of the Delta-era restrictions as treasurer was well-known. In July the Australian Financial Review reported he had suggested that Chant take a pay cut if Sydney was unnecessarily locked down at the beginning of the Delta wave, and multiple sources told the Guardian that throughout that period both he and his new deputy, Stuart Ayres, had been the most vocal proponents of economic considerations throughout the pandemic. “Alarm bells should have been ringing in December and they weren’t and I think that is just based on the personal attitude of Perrottet and Ayres,” another senior NSW Liberal told the Guardian. “They’ve been more focused on the economy throughout the pandemic and I’m not surprised we’re seeing the numbers we are now because it’s almost as if it’s been an ideological approach to handling public health and you can’t have that. “I think the big change, the one that is being noticed in the community, is that Kerry Chant clearly hasn’t been listened to in the way she had been through the first two years of the pandemic.” Indeed in the early days of his leadership Perrottet made no secret of the changing approach. When questioned about Chant’s absence at a press conference in October Perrottet replied: “We’re the elected officials … it’s also an economic crisis as well.” Later, when indoor mask-wearing rules were scrapped on 15 December, Chant pointedly distanced herself from the decision, calling it a “matter for government”. “All I’m saying is from a public health position I am strongly recommending we keep masks and I’m asking the community to do so,” Chant said at the time. Although case numbers have risen rapidly in most nations following the arrival of the Omicron strain, health experts say removing those measures made a difference. Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, told the Guardian a more cautious approach may have helped to delay the Omicron wave. “I think it would have helped to flatten the curve so, you know, the wave still would have occurred but over a longer period of time,” she said. “Some people say, ‘Great, it’s better to get it done faster, it’s like ripping off a Band-Aid’, but in reality when it comes through quicker, more people die.” While there is unease within the government about the need for recent backflips on mask mandates and changes to restrictions on singing and dancing in bars, there is also a feeling that the global experience of booming Covid cases since the arrival of the Omicron variant show there is little Perrottet could have done to stem the tide.The finance minister, Damien Tudehope, a close ally of the premier, believes Perrottet has operated well while enduring a baptism of fire as a new leader, and points to the fact that both Victoria and Queensland have seen an explosion in Covid cases despite holding on to many of the restrictions Perrottet has been criticised for scrapping. Both those states also saw record case numbers and deaths this week. “In the context he’s found himself in a pandemic where you’re making decisions every day of the week and everyone is a commentator; the difficulty any political leader has is you’re under a significant microscope all of the time,” Tudehope told the Guardian. “I think a person who has been in the job a long time gets it a lot easier than someone who comes into it fresh because there is a history of decision making and the community knows what to expect, and you see that with Daniel Andrews or Annastacia Palaszczuk. “Dom had no chance to establish that sort of familiarity with the electorate so he’s being examined very closely.” Indeed, much of the criticism focused on Perrottet comes despite his bullish approach to living with the virus being mimicked by other Australian leaders. Despite previously taking an ultra-cautious approach to Covid, the Labor government in Victoria is now virtually in lockstep with NSW, while Queensland has slowly been cajoled into dropping the border closures that divided the states for long stretches of the pandemic. The commonwealth too has at times found itself scrambling to keep up with the new premier. When Perrottet announced in the middle of October that he would throw the international borders open, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was left playing catch-up on the announcement. “Dom’s leadership has in many respects forced the prime minister and other jurisdictions to come along and join him,” Tudehope said. “In terms of decision making, the way he forced Morrison’s hand in relation to overseas students, in one respect he had no real jurisdiction there but he forced Morrison’s hand because he took the view that we have to reinvigorate the economy and rejoin the world. “He leads the conversation and I think he recognises that not everyone will agree with him, but it shows he’s got some mettle about him.” While there is an acceptance that the emergence of Omicron could not have been foreseen, critics of the government’s response say pressures resulting from rising case numbers were predictable. The ongoing shortage of rapid antigen tests, even as the government seeks to make them a key plank of its Covid response; severe strain on the state’s health system; and pressures on small businesses emanating from staff shortages caused by isolation orders have all added to a sense the government failed to adequately plan for a rise in case numbers. “How can you build a system where you’re turning people away from PCR tests and telling essential workers they must have rapid tests, but they’re either too expensive or unavailable or both,” the NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, told the Guardian. “I mean it’s no wonder people are sitting at home saying ‘what am I supposed to do?’. It seems like all the sacrifices people made at great personal cost are just being lost. No one expects the government to stop Covid but when you only have a few levers to use you have to use them perfectly. To have removed even the modest measures in place and not have organised for those tests to be available, it’s just not enough.” A series of byelections forced by the resignation of a number of MPs following the departure of Berejiklian shapes as an early test. Though personally popular, Perrottet, a conservative, is factionally a minority in the moderate-dominated NSW Liberal party, and the Coalition’s hold on power after 10 years, three elections and four premiers has been slowly whittled away. Add to that Labor’s increasing strength under Minns following a decade in opposition and the stakes appear increasingly high. “Dom’s a really likeable, engaging leader, I don’t think that’s coming across yet but I it’s definitely going to be interesting when he’s in campaign mode,” one Liberal insider said. “People are nervous, and you understand why they’re nervous, but I don’t think anyone is panicking yet. We just have to hold our nerve.”",News/Australia news,‘He wanted to charge ahead and be the hero’: colleagues hope Dominic Perrottet has learned from backflips,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/15/he-wanted-to-charge-ahead-and-be-the-hero-colleagues-hope-dominic-perrottet-has-learned-from-backflips
1/15/2022,"Sometimes you get home after a long day, there are no leftovers in the fridge and you just know you really shouldn’t order out. And that’s when I reach for my handy list of go-to recipes and find something easy to make that I already have the ingredients for in the pantry.Sure, it sounds simple - because it is - but until I bothered to formalise it, actually write recipes down as I made them, I was constantly looking up the same few recipes over and over again, forced to scroll past the mandatory “humorous” anecdotes and irritating pop-up ads every single time. Now, instead, I scribble down a shorthand summary – cooking time, ingredients, clear directions and any notes on how it turned out or possible improvements – on to a recipe card and file it away for later use. As a huge nerd, I keep my cards on a digital Trello board, but any format will do, so long as you can easily add to it, browse it, reorganise it and read it. Tagging recipes based on various attributes – the type of meal it is, common ingredients, what utensils you need to make it, flavour profile, whatever – can also be a great help. Not only does that make it easy to pick a potato dish if you’re craving spuds, for instance, but it makes varied meal planning and ingredient shopping a breeze.So did I stumble backwards into doing basically exactly what my mum did when I was a kid, only in a very slightly more digital way?

1/15/2022,"Morocco proved too strong for Africa Cup of Nations debutants Comoros, winning 2-0 in Yaoundé to book their place in the last 16. Selim Amallah put Morocco in front from close range after 16 minutes at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium, and the Atlas Lions missed a number of chances to take control of the game. Their captain, Romain Saïss, headed a corner against the crossbar before Ayoub El Kaabi missed two good opportunities after the break.  Morocco forward Youssef En-Nesyri came off the bench on his comeback from injury but saw his late penalty saved by Salim Ben Boina. The Comoros keeper, who plays in the French regional leagues, produced an inspired display but could not keep out Zakaria Aboukhlal’s stoppage-time strike, initially disallowed for offside but awarded by the VAR. Vahid Halilhodzic’s side have six points from two matches in Group C and are guaranteed a place in the last 16, with Gabon and Ghana meeting in Friday’s late match. In Group B, Orlando Pirates striker Frank ‘Gabadinho’ Mhango scored twice for Malawi as they stunned southern rivals Zimbabwe with a 2-1 victory, boosting their hopes of a first-ever appearance in the Afcon knockout stages. Ishmael Wadi put Zimbabwe ahead in the first half, but Mhango levelled just before the break in Bafoussam, converting Francisco Madinga’s cross at the far post. Mhango struck again in the 58th minute as he took advantage of some hesitant defending and supplied a poacher’s finish. Victory was the Flames’ second ever win at an Afcon finals, after beating Algeria in 2010. Elsewhere in Group B, pre-tournament favourites Senegal failed to sparkle as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Guinea in the early kick-off. Senegal coach Aliou Cissé was without 10 players due to Covid-19, including centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly, first-choice goalkeeper Édouard Mendy and midfielder Idrissa Gueye. Guinea were missing four players for the derby game in Bafoussam. The Senegal captain, Sadio Mané, had a chance from a close-range free kick early in the game, but struck the wall with his effort. Mané was largely overshadowed in the opening half by his Liverpool teammate Naby Keïta, who split the Senegal defence with a through ball. Seny Dieng did well to deny Ilaix Moriba before Morgan Guilavogui botched the rebound. Bouna Sarr’s searching free kick was close to delivering the first goal as Senegal improved in the second half. Centre-back Abdou Diallo powered a header just over the crossbar before Sarr fired wide after being set up by Mané. The draw means both teams are likely to progress with four points from two games. “It’s been very difficult for us with all of these missing players,” Cisse said after the match. Senegal face Malawi in their final group game on Tuesday, with Guinea taking on bottom side Zimbabwe in Yaoundé.",Sport/Football,"Morocco into Afcon last 16 with win over Comoros, Senegal held by Guinea",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/africa-cup-of-nations-senegal-guinea-morocco-malawi-gabon-ghana
1/15/2022,"Shares in Sensyne Health plummeted after the healthcare technology company run by Paul Drayson, the former UK science and defence minister, said it could run out of money within weeks if it was unable to secure emergency financing. Shares in the Aim-listed company fell 72% – or 54.5p – to 21p, a record low, and far below the flotation price of 175p in August 2018. Trading was briefly suspended by the London Stock Exchange, for five minutes.  After a turbulent time on the market, Lord Drayson, a Labour peer and engineer who founded the data analytics specialist in 2018, wants to take the business private. He and his wife, Elspeth, the daughter of scientist Brian Bellhouse, are the biggest shareholders in Sensyne with a 22.8% stake. The Oxford-based company began a formal process to find a buyer in early November after it was approached by Drayson about a management buyout. The company said on Friday it was holding detailed discussions with a number of parties. It said, however, it could run out of cash before a sale is agreed. Sensyne had £2.8m cash in the bank as of 12 January, and said it was pursuing a “substantial debtor” that owed the company money. It hopes to tap a number of institutional investors for £6.35m (with an additional £5m possibly being provided by mutual consent) to fund the firm over the coming months as it pursues the sale. The funding would be in the form of a loan note. “Whilst the board believes the financing will proceed to completion in the near term, without it the company is unlikely to be able to continue to trade beyond early February 2022 by which time the formal sale process will not have concluded,” Sensyne said. The company has been rocked by controversy in recent months. The company was fined £400,000 by the London Stock Exchange in November after failing to disclose bonus payouts of £850,000 to Drayson and £200,000 to then-chief financial officer Lorimer Headley shortly after its stock market debut. Sensyne uses artificial intelligence algorithms to analyse patient data and help pharmaceutical companies accelerate the development of new medicines. It has developed apps for monitoring blood pressure and diabetes in pregnant women, as well as apps for self-monitoring of coronavirus and blood glucose levels. Through 16 research agreements with NHS trusts and US healthcare systems, it has a database of 48m anonymised patient health records covering diseases including heart failure, stroke and haematological cancers. NHS trusts own 16.2% of the company. In return for providing anonymised patient data, they were given shares in Sensyne as well as a slice of future royalties from any products developed. Other shareholders include Gatemore Capital Management, an activist investor that urged Sensyne’s board last July to pursue a secondary listing on Nasdaq, which never materialised. A spokesperson said that the firm was still at an early stage of development and that it took time for revenues from the partnerships to come through. Sensyne also said it had suffered contract delays as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. It added: “Some competitors claim to offer direct access to patient data, which is counter to Sensyne’s ethical model, or access to data that are inferior to the deep, longitudinal data sets that Sensyne has established. Sensyne continues to believe that patient data should never be sold or shared directly with life science companies.” Drayson has in the past expressed concerns that Google was able to access the NHS’s database for free to develop healthcare apps that it will then roll out around the world.",News/Business,Labour peer’s AI healthcare firm Sensyne says cash is running out,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/labour-peers-ai-healthcare-firm-sensyne-warns-cash-is-running-out
