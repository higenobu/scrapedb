3/15/2022,"Almond Brewer was surrounded by Arizona police after a credit union manager doubted the authenticity of an account holder’s check. Authorities were called on a Black Arizona man attempting to cash a check he received after selling a boat. The man, Almond Brewer, went to Pinal County Federal Credit Union in Apache Junction to cash the $3,200 check only to be surrounded by police after a manager doubted its authenticity. According to a local report from 12 News, the incident occurred in October 2021 when the credit union manager called 911 — while Brewer waited — and told them the personal check was fake. The report notes that Brewer told the teller he had received the check after selling his boat to a woman on Facebook Marketplace, “and she looked kind of surprised.” According to the bank, the check had “red flags” like an old log of the credit union, as well as a routing and checking account number that didn’t match the member’s information. However, after running the check through a third-party verifier, its authenticity was deemed “inconclusive,” a fact the manager did not tell the police. When contacted by the credit union — after the police had been called — the account holder verified she’d signed the check, but police didn’t learn that until 10 minutes into their interaction with a stunned Brewer. “It was just, ‘oh, you know, Black guy locks in his hair, tattoos, came on a Harley, you know?'” Brewer told 12 News. “Let’s assume the worst.” “Why embarrass somebody like that? Why, you know, make them feel less than a man,” he later wondered. In a statement, issued in January, Amy Marshall, president and CEO of the Pinal County Federal Credit Union, said that “at no time did the staff feel threatened or feel Mr. Brewer was trying to rob the credit union.” She noted that police were already en route when the manager got the verbal check verification from its customer and maintained the staff apologized to both the law enforcement officials who responded and to Brewer himself. They had “seen an uptick in fraudulent activity,” Marshall wrote, and their “ultimate responsibility” is to ensure safe and secure accounts. She added that their team undergoes diversity and inclusion training and said they would be reviewing their processes. “Mr. Brewer, on behalf of Pinal County Federal Credit Union,” she concluded, “I would like to formally apologize for this confusing experience while visiting one of our branch locations.” The situation is reminiscent of a recent, now-viral incident involving Black Panther director Ryan Coogler, who was handcuffed by police in Georgia while attempting to withdraw $12,000 from his checking account at a Bank of America branch.

3/15/2022,"At a rally Saturday, Donald Trump said he would expand the president's powers if reelected. He said this would include ""making every executive-branch employee fireable by the president."" Trump also hinted once more that he would be running in the 2024 presidential election. During a rally on Saturday, former President Donald Trump floated an expansion of presidential powers. Speaking to rallygoers in Florence, South Carolina, he suggested that if he were reelected, the president would have the power to fire anyone who works in the government's executive branch. ""We will pass critical reforms making every executive-branch employee fireable by the president of the United States. The deep state must and will be brought to heel,"" he said. Fringe media and the far-right have often used the term ""deep state"" to refer to the ""real power"" in the US government. The president is not allowed to fire elected officials, including the vice president, who is part of the executive branch. The president is also not allowed to fire just anyone in the executive branch. While this power had initially been available to the president, it led to the ""spoils system,"" in which every new president could essentially replace the entire government with their supporters. Under the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, it became unlawful for federal employees to be demoted for political reasons. On Saturday, Trump said he wanted to put a ""big and bold"" plan in place if the GOP retook control of Congress. He also repeated his baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from him. ""I ran twice and won twice, and I did much better the second time than we did the first,"" Trump said, calling the election results ""rigged."" Trump also hinted that he would make another run for president in 2024. ""Now, we may have to run again,"" he said to applause and cheers from the crowd. He added: ""In 2024, we are going to take back that beautiful, beautiful White House."" In January, Trump dropped a big hint that he would run in 2024, calling himself the ""45th and 47th President"" in a video.

3/15/2022,"(Adds comments from U.S. official, background) March 13 (Reuters) - Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most upbeat assessments yet on Sunday of progress in their talks on the war in Ukraine, suggesting there could be positive results within days. Separately, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Russia was showing signs of willingness to engage in substantive negotiations about ending a conflict in which thousands have died. More than 2.5 million people have fled. Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate, but not to surrender or accept any ultimatums. ""We will not concede in principle on any positions. Russia now understands this. Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,"" Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video posted online. ""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days,"" he said. RIA news agency quoted a Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, as saying the talks had made substantial progress. ""According to my personal expectations, this progress may grow in the coming days into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing,"" Slutsky said. Neither side indicated what the scope of any agreement might be. Their public comments were issued almost at the same time. They came on day 18 of the war which began when Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what the Kremlin terms a special military operation. In a tweet, Podolyak said Russia was carefully listening to Ukraine's proposals. ""Our demands are - the end of the war and the withdrawal of (Russian) troops. I see the understanding and there is a dialogue,"" he said. Last Monday, the Kremlin's chief spokesman said Russia was ready to halt military operations ""in a moment"" if Kyiv met a list of conditions. Among the demands were for Ukraine to acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told ABC last week that ""we can discuss and find a compromise on how these territories will live on"" while adding ""we're not ready for capitulation"". Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues and led to the limited opening of some corridors for civilians to escape fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday there had been some ""positive shifts"" in the talks, but did not elaborate. On Saturday the Kremlin said the discussions between Russian and Ukrainian officials had been continuing ""in video format"". Talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers produced no apparent progress towards a ceasefire last Thursday but analysts said the fact they were even meeting left a window open for ending the war.
