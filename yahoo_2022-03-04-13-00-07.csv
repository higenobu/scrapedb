3/4/2022,"Ukrainian defense forces killed Russian Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky in combat earlier this week, according to Ukrainian officials and Russian media. The circumstances of the 47-year-old’s death were not immediately clear, but the Kremlin-backed Pravda said he was killed ""during a special operation in Ukraine."" According to Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Sukhovetsky deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District last year. He was also the head of the 7th Airborne Division, had served in Syria and received two commendations for bravery from the Kremlin. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""The fact is, we killed him,"" Volodymyr Omelyan, Ukraine’s former minister of infrastructure who has joined the militia in Kyiv, told Fox News Digital Thursday. The U.S. could not immediately confirm his death, according to a senior defense official. But multiple reports cited a post on the Russian VKontakte social media platform attributed to Sergei Chipilev, a member of a Russian military officers’ group. RUSSIAN TROOPS CLOSE IN ON UKRAINE'S LARGEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AS AUTHORITIES WARN OF POTENTIAL FOR CATASTROPHE ""With great pain, we learned the tragic news of the death of our friend, Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky, on the territory of Ukraine during the special operation,"" he wrote, according to a translation published by the English-language Russian outlet, Pravda.ru. ""We express our deepest condolences to his family."" The Kremlin maintains that its military presence in Ukraine is a ""special operation"" and not an invasion or war. But Russian troops have attacked targets across the country since entering from the north, east and south last week. Although Ukraine’s defenses are out-manned and outgunned, Western intelligence analysts have said they appear to have put up a stiffer resistance than Putin expected. ""If it’s true, it’s big,"" Dan Hoffman, a former CIA officer and station chief, said of Sukhovetsky’s death. ‘TO THE LAST BULLET’: UKRAINIANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ANSWER THE CALL, TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST RUSSIA It could fortify the Ukrainian military’s steadfast resolve and represents a tactical victory. A massive Russian military convoy appears to have stalled outside Kyiv for days, bogged down by logistical problems and Ukraine’s military. But Putin’s troops have seized Kherson, a port city of almost 300,000. They were also shelling Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and bombarding defense forces in Mariupol, another waterfront hub. Russian troops also said they seized the area around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, near the riverside city of Enerhodar. Reports say the facility is on fire. A successful campaign across Ukraine’s coastal southern region could create a land bridge for Russian forces between the homeland and Crimea, which they have occupied since 2014. It would also cut off Ukraine from maritime shipping. Russia reported Wednesday morning that it had lost 498 troops. Ukrainian officials claim that number to be as high as 9,000 – but they have not released figures of their own casualties.

3/4/2022,"Ukraine's Defense Ministry said its armed forces seized battle plans Russian troops left behind. The ministry said the documents suggested Russia's war with Ukraine would last 15 days. An invasion map, a table of call signs, and a personnel list were in the documents, it said. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its armed forces had seized secret battle plans left behind by Russian soldiers. It said the documents suggested Russia's war with Ukraine would last 15 days. The seized documents were posted on Facebook by the ministry and showed the war plans of one of the units of the battalion tactical group of the 810th Separate Guards Naval Infantry Brigade of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the ministry said. An invasion map, a table of call signs, and a list of personnel were in the documents, according to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. The ministry's Facebook post followed a similar disclosure on the social-media site by Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation. ""Thanks to the successful actions of one of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's units, Russian occupiers are losing not only equipment and manpower,"" the defense ministry said. ""In panic attacks, they are leaving classified documents."" The ministry said that based on the documents, Russia approved its invasion of Ukraine on January 18. The operation was meant to last 15 days from February 20 to March 6, the ministry said based on its review of the documents. Insider could not independently verify this conclusion. One of the documents posted by the ministry appeared to be dated January 18, a full month before Russia attacked — while another planning document of call signs for different units spanned the dates February 20 to March 6, with daily code-name changes for different Russian commands to contact each other without disclosing their identities. The documents did not appear to give any information about Russian forces taking any Ukrainian city. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his country's invasion of Ukraine in the early-morning hours of February 24. The full extent of Putin's plan to assault Ukraine has been unclear, but a former Russian deputy foreign minister told Al Jazeera that he had information that the Russian leader wanted to declare victory within a week — a goal that now appears extremely unlikely, with Russian forces having seized only one major Ukrainian city after six days of fighting. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said the ""final objective"" by these Russian forces who had the planning documents ""was to block and seize"" the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol. ""That is why you should not trust when a prisoner of war is saying again that he or she came to the exercises and got lost! They knew, they planned precisely and they had been preparing,"" the ministry said on Facebook. It added, ""Our response to the Russian occupiers is the following: Keep leaving your vehicles and classified documents, they will be useful for our defenders and The Hague.""

3/4/2022,"It's common for slightly cynical pundits to remark that no one remembers a State of the Union speech 48 hours after it ends. In the case of the State of the Union President Joe Biden delivered Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress, I suspect the afterglow will last barely more than 24. The 2022 State of the Union was a mediocre speech poorly delivered. To say so isn't entirely fair: The elderly Biden's halting manner of speaking, marked by malapropisms and smudged syllables, hasn't been the kind of political liability professional word-slingers like myself always presume it to be. Yet last night was filled with even more flubs than usual, with the lowlight coming early on when the president predicted (no doubt accurately) that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine would ensure the Russian president never wins ""the hearts and souls of the Iranian people."" It's also somewhat churlish to criticize any State of the Union for rhetorical mediocrity. The annual address has long been little more than a laundry list of legislative priorities tied together with bromides and pedestrian civic flattery. (Is the state of the American union ever anything other than ""strong"" or some slight variation of it?) Still, last night's speech was unusual for opening with an extended section about Russia's invasion of Ukraine that could have — and probably should have — stood alone as a primetime Oval Office address to the nation. Instead, the administration opted to combine something resembling George W. Bush's gravely resolute speech to Congress on September 20, 2001, with a standard-issue State of the Union. The result was a substantive mishmash that at once pulled down the foreign policy message and made the litany of domestic policies that followed sound even more trivial than usual. That Biden repeatedly resorted to ""folks"" to accomplish transitions throughout the latter half of the speech only added to its disjointedness. Probably the most politically significant part of the speech came in the middle, when Biden explicitly rejected the activist-driven imperative to ""defund the police."" That was the president's depersonalized Sister Souljah moment, and it was smart. Not only is crime surging around the country, but the slogan is extremely unpopular, with polls showing Black and Hispanic Democrats more likely than white members of the party to favor increasing funding for police. Equally important, though less potent, was Biden's response to inflation, the issue that has risen to the top of voter concerns in recent months. On the plus side, the president at least used the term and acknowledged its reality. Up until now, he's been hesitant to discuss it. That's understandable, given inflation's political toxicity, how little any president can do to fight it, and how painful and slow any serious effort to combat it can be. Yet Biden and his advisers apparently decided the president needed to sound like he would slay the beast of rising prices by … defending economic nationalism. Most economists would call that a non sequitur and perhaps even an outright contradiction. (Won't pulling out of international supply chains and discouraging international trade tend to drive prices even higher?) Yet calls to ""buy American"" poll well, so the administration is apparently gambling that inflation will take care of itself as the COVID-19 pandemic finally recedes, and in the meantime, the nationalist message just might do the trick of insulating the president from popular anger. As for the rest of the speech, it largely consisted of bones thrown to various factions in the Democratic Party. Most of them will go nowhere, given the narrow divides in Congress and the dysfunctional legislative dynamics of a midterm-election year. Such box-checking was no doubt politically necessary, especially given Biden's low approval ratings, but it's an intra-Democratic imperative that likely lulled the rest of the country to sleep. Will Biden see a bounce in his approval coming out of the speech? Maybe. Just don't expect it to last much longer than a day.

3/4/2022,"Ford is splitting into two auto businesses: one for electric cars and one for combustion ones. The electric unit will be called Ford Model e, a name the company barred Tesla from using years ago. Elon Musk wanted to call Tesla's third mass-produced car, the Model 3, the Model E. Ford announced a major restructuring on Wednesday, saying it will create two auto businesses: one focused on traditional combustion engines and another dedicated to the company's burgeoning electric-vehicle efforts. The name Ford chose for the latter should ring a bell for Elon Musk. The gasoline division will be called Ford Blue, while its EV counterpart will be known as Ford Model e, a name the Detroit automaker stopped Tesla from using nearly a decade ago. After the release of Tesla's Model S and Model X, Musk planned to name the company's third major vehicle the Model E. (It spells ""sex,"" get it?) ""A friend asked me at a party, 'What are you going to name the third-generation car?' Well, we have the S and the X, so we might as well make it the E,"" Musk told CNN Money in 2014. But Ford called up Musk threatening to sue if Tesla pursued the Model E trademark, he told the outlet. Tesla and Ford entered a contract in 2010 that prohibited Tesla from using the Model E name, and the companies resolved the dispute amicably, a Ford spokesperson told CNN Money. —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017 Ford has sued to keep companies from using the Model E name, arguing it sounds too similar to the Model T. Ford sold cars including the Model A, B, C, F, and K, but never a Model E. In 2000, Ford sued a car-leasing startup called Model E. Tesla kept with the suggestive theme anyway, coming out with the Model 3 sedan instead, and later the Model Y SUV. Ford says that splitting into two units will help boost profits and streamline operations. The reorganization will allow engineers, designers, and other Ford employees to focus on either EV or gasoline efforts, rather than splitting their time between the two, the company said. Ford said the new structure will help it nearly double profit margins by 2026, the same year it plans to produce more than 2 million electric cars. Shares of Ford surged roughly 7% on the news Wednesday morning. Got a story to share about the auto industry?
