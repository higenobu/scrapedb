3/20/2022,"Kanye West has been barred from performing at the Grammy awards next month due to “concerning online behavior”, a representative for the rapper and designer said. The decision, confirmed to Variety, came a day after West, now legally known as Ye, was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours. The platform said content on the 44-year-old’s account was in violation of its policies on “hate speech and bullying and harassment”. Trevor Noah, the comedian and Daily Show host, criticised posts by West about his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. West responded by using a racial slur. The post was then deleted. West has won 22 Grammys from 75 nominations and is up for five awards this year. But he was not among the first list of performers announced this week. A representative for the singer told the Blast “Kanye’s team isn’t surprised by the decision” to drop him. West has posted numerous messages taunting Kardashian and the comedian Pete Davidson, who is now dating the mother of West’s four children. Last week, West posted that he was “really concerned” Davidson would get Kardashian “hooked on drugs”. “Im [sic] really concerned that [he] will get my kids mom hooked on drugs,” West wrote in an Instagram post. “He’s in rehab every 2 months.” Davidson has acknowledged his use of marijuana. He has also said West should seek help. “Let me help you man. I struggle with mental stuff too,” Davidson reportedly wrote in text messages to West. Noah, who will host the Grammys, shared a nearly 10-minute video detailing his wish for society at large to change how it treats West, Kardashian and Davidson, saying the situation had become “more and more belligerent”. The decision to drop West from the Grammys lineup was not unexpected. But the veteran rapper the Game, who collaborated with West on a recent single with a Davidson-trolling video, Eazy, said: “Time and time again they show us that they only want to STEAL the culture, not allow you to ever be their equals. “In a more than obvious move for reasons of minuscule actions … the Grammys have at the last minute decided to pull [West] from performing on the show as if we didn’t know it was coming.”",Arts/Music,Kanye West barred from Grammys over ‘concerning online behavior’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/19/kanye-west-grammys-performance-barred-online-behavior
3/20/2022,"As Vladimir Putin stood before a sea of tricolour flags and tens of thousands of applauding Russians in the Luzhniki stadium on Friday, it was clear that he wanted to portray his invasion of Ukraine as a people’s war. Never mind the independent media reports that state employees and university students had been bussed in for the rally, as the government employed the same crude tactics to pack the stadium in order to simulate patriotic enthusiasm as it has done for years. There was still some truth to the elaborate theatre of Friday’s rally. Because inside Russia, both polls and anecdotal evidence indicate, a significant portion of the population has chosen to support the invasion of Ukraine, which must now be referred to by law as a “special operation”. “I support it, practically everyone I know, my friends, all are for it,” said Yegor Gusyev, 35, who manages a vehicle parts business in the Moscow region. “I don’t know anyone who went to a protest against it.” What about the scenes of bombing in Mariupol and Kharkiv and the fact – once unthinkable – of Russia launching an all-out war on its neighbour? “Of course it is sad – I don’t want people to die,” he said. “But there wasn’t any other choice [besides the invasion]… mistakes happen. But I also know the other side is using propaganda against us too. It is all propaganda.” There have been efforts from abroad to encourage the Russian people to protest against the war. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week released a nine-minute video in which he recalled his admiration for the Soviet weightlifter Yuri Vlasov and his father’s shame at fighting for the Nazi army at Leningrad. “This is not the Russian people’s war,” he said in an appeal to ordinary Russians. But others in Russia say it is. Many supporters cite the eight-year-old war between Ukraine and Russian proxy forces in Donbas, using words such as genocide and comparisons to the second world war to justify the invasion. As one former diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message, he looks forward to Russia holding a “Nuremberg 2.0” in Ukraine after the war. “Aren’t you sad for the children killed in Donbas?” Elizaveta from Moscow shot back when asked about her views on the invasion. “Why don’t you write about them instead?” Russian society is deeply polarised between supporters and opponents of the Kremlin. Those camps have carried this division over into support for and opposition to the war, experts said. Even simple choices such as whether to call the conflict a “war” or the state-sanctioned “military operation” carry political meaning. “We are seeing that society is divided by a majority that broadly supports the war and a minority that is against it,” said Sergei Belanovsky, a sociologist. “These two groups live in different worlds, and cannot convince each other that their viewpoint is the right one.” According to the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 71% of Russians “support Russia’s decision to hold a special military operation in Ukraine”. Valery Fyodorov, head of the polling centre, said that new data to be published by the centre this week would show an increase in support for the “military operation”. There has been scepticism about those results because they reinforce the Kremlin-backed image of a popular war. But Denis Volkov of the independent Levada Center also endorsed the data, saying that the results from state-run pollsters are “in my opinion entirely credible”.The Levada Centre, which is Russia’s main independent pollster, has not released a poll of public opinion on the war since the conflict began. Plans to publish results of an earlier poll were scrapped by the centre’s employees because of concerns that their results would “in some way promote the intensification of the conflict”. Volkov said the group is now conducting a new poll. Some, however, have questioned the logic of polling public opinion in a country where information about the war is carefully curated by state television. “State propaganda works – it is extremely effective in what it does, presenting the events as a special military operation against the Ukrainian Nazis. A lot of key information is being withheld,” said Belanovsky. Others have said that Russians are simply afraid to tell pollsters they are opposed to the war. “Conducting surveys in authoritarian countries is tricky. Respondents in Russia believe surveys are conducted by the government. Especially during wartime, respondents, they will be less likely to feel open to talk,” said Grigory Yudin, a sociologist. Yudin said that, according to his research, fewer Russians were willing to speak with pollsters since the beginning of the war, with only 25% of those approached now willing to answer questions on Ukraine, compared with 33% when the invasion started. Yudin added: “Based on my own ideas, I believe a much smaller group is actively in favour of war, actively militarised. That group does exist and it is a worrisome group but it is not the majority.” Aggressive efforts to generate support for the invasion have left opponents of the war aghast. When Putin appeared on Friday, a banner calling “For a world without Nazism” bore the letter Z, a tactical marking used on Russian tanks in Ukraine. Anti-war activists have also found the letter graffitied in white paint on their doorways in an effort to intimidate them. “Personally, in my opinion, it’s fascism, something I never imagined would happen … I don’t have any other association than that,” said Daniil Beilinson of the OVD-Info group, which has monitored the arrest of nearly 15,000 protesters and other pressures faced by anti-war activists. There has been little of the organic surge in patriotism that marked Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Until Friday, which marked the eighth anniversary of the annexation, the Kremlin had not held mass rallies in support of its war, and many Russians have started focusing on the growing economic crisis rather than the military conflict itself.“If we try to compare the mood of 2014 and now, then the support has remained but the euphoria has disappeared,” said Volkov. “There is no joy.” But the unprecedented sanctions introduced by the west that could shrink the country’s GDP by as much as 20% have not turned the population against the Kremlin. “For now, sanctions actually have an opposite impact. Pointing to the sanctions, the authorities have been effective in convincing Russians that a ‘hostile’ west is acting against their interest,” explained Belanovsky. While the Russian rouble has already sunk to record lows, experts have argued it will take months before ordinary Russians feel the full force of the sanctions. “But the mood could be totally different in two, three months if the economy does actually crumple as some economists have predicted. Then Russians might start asking questions to Putin,” the sociologist said.",News/World news,Vladimir Putin waves the flag in a polarised country where views are hard to shift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/vladimir-putin-waves-the-flag-in-a-polarised-country-where-views-are-hard-to-shift
3/20/2022,"“Flying by the seat of my pants.” This is how Sydney pop artist Thomas Porter describes the lead-up to his first ever live show. The 24-year-old musician signed with independent label Dew Process just as the pandemic hit, released an EP on Friday and has no idea if he’s going to be able to turn his bedroom music into a live show – or if anyone will come to hear it. “I’m terrified,” Porter says. “There’s been two years of hype at this point. I’ve never performed any of these songs.” Porter is one of the musicians dubbed “Covid babies” by the industry. They were signed or got big during the pandemic, but are lacking that live performance experience most up-and-coming acts have. Some artists – like pop musician Flynn Sant, who goes by Flowerkid – even have millions of plays on Spotify and YouTube and tens of thousands of engaged fans on social media. The Warner Music signed 20-year-old is on the bill for Splendour in the Grass and this week performed his first ever live show at The Great Club in Marrickville. He says it’s weird “being online and being recognised as a musician”, but not having the live music chops to back it up. Flynn was so nervous before going on stage that he threw up. But the butterflies didn’t last. “As soon as I got out there and started, I was like ‘yep, this is where I’m meant to be’ and I just kept going no matter how many little things I stuffed up,” he says. “I didn’t care as much for this silly little details, but rather the vibe and it felt great and everybody was cheering. It was incredible.” Canberra rapper Seaton Rogers, who performs under the name YNG Martyr, also got his first big live moment earlier this month. “It was a 50-50 mix of ‘this is happening’ and then ‘oh shit, this is happening’,” he says, still buzzing from the set days later. After years of making music and practising it at home, the 22-year-old Wiradjuri man is finally getting his chance to see if his success online was going to translate in real life. Rogers had moderate success until right before the first lockdown of 2020 when his song Nike Ticks “literally blew up”. He watched the number of listens tick up from his bedroom and wanted to get out there and perform. “There were points where I tried to launch tours, I was so, so set on it, tickets had been sold. And then it was, ‘nup, borders are closed, everything’s off’,” he says. He tried to make the most of it, knowing the ears and eyes on him online presented an “insane opportunity”. “I had to figure out ways to capitalise on it in my bedroom,” he says. And he did – with about 1.5m listens on Spotify each month and tens of thousands of followers, he worked on his image and marketing, and kept his fingers crossed that when he was able to go on stage, there were people on the other side listening. “It was so hard for me to see that what I’ve done online could translate into real life because I physically never got to see it, never got to play a show or meet up with fans,” he says. “I was sitting there like I have online buzz but where is it? I am still living in the exact same way. I felt like I had this thing but it was just out of reach.” He bought a cheap mic, plugged it into his computer at home and had been practising for whenever the moment came – which it did at This That festival in Queensland. “It didn’t really click in my head until like an hour before I was performing that this was gonna happen, there’s no way out of this now, but it was great,” he says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s a lot different when you’re out there and jumping around and there’s a massive stage. It’s starting to finally feel like a real tangible thing.” For Porter, the wait is still on. He had a show planned for right before Christmas, but it was cancelled – like so many others – as Omicron kicked off. He hopes to book another show to celebrate the release of Manic Pixie Dream Girl. But with two years of postponed shows across the city, finding a spare stage is proving tricky. Dew Process A&R manager Harry Young says it is becoming an issue for lots of the artists in the same boat. “Tours have been postponed so much and there’s lots of smaller acts that are crying for those same venues,” he says. “A lot of venues are talking about how they are already booked the whole year.” Young has always used social media as a way to find new talent but without then being able to go watch people live as well, it has been harder to work out who has what it takes to make it as a performing musician. “You can have millions of streams on a song but some things don’t transfer as well to a live show,” he said. “You can’t see if people can connect to your songs the same way when it’s not live.” And for most artists in Australia, performing live is incredibly important to make it a viable career. “We make music for the passion of it, but I’m in my 20s, I do need a bit of money if I want to pay my rent,” Porter says. “Not having that is really, really scary. It’s the difference between me living a very tenuous life and barely keeping my head above water versus being a proper flourishing creative.” Porter knows he has a tough road ahead but he is excited. “There’s really no substitute for having time in front of crowds,” Porter says. “I want to dance. I want to jump around or roll around. I want to go into the crowd. I want to do everything.”",Arts/Music,‘I’m terrified’: music’s ‘Covid babies’ take to the stage for the first time,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/20/im-terrified-musics-covid-babies-take-to-the-stage-for-the-first-time
3/20/2022,"Sydneysiders are being urged to exercise caution when returning to swim in the city’s beaches and waterways after weeks of torrential rain and flooding. Sediment and debris swept downstream by heavy rain turned Sydney Harbour brown last week, with swimmers warned to avoid the water. With a few sunny days forecast to provide some respite in the coming week, how can you tell whether it’s safe to return for a dip? The New South Wales government’s Beachwatch program advises people avoid swimming at ocean beaches for one day after heavy rainfall, or for as long as storm water is present. For more sheltered harbour areas and bays, the suggested wait time stretches to three days. The most obvious signs of storm water and flood water pollution to look for are discolouration of the water, and debris both floating in the water and washing up on the tide line. A spokesperson for Beachwatch said flood waters were still flowing into the ocean from the Hawkesbury River, Sydney Harbour and Botany Bay, “turning the ocean brown from the Central Coast to Wollongong and up to 8km out to sea”. Forecasts issued on Friday advised of possible pollution at Sydney’s ocean and harbour beaches. Daily forecasts are available on the Beachwatch website. Prof Stuart Khan, a water quality expert and the director of the graduate school of engineering at the University of NSW, said the Beachwatch guidance was based on “more than a decade of water quality monitoring and understanding of how the beaches are impacted by rainfall”. Swimming in polluted water is a health risk due to the pathogens from raw sewage, Khan said. “When it rains in big cities like Sydney, water gets into our sewers, because the sewers are not sealed.” The sewers are designed to overflow in cases of extreme rain, running into storm water pipes that discharge directly into open waterways, instead of being directed to sewage treatment plants. “Therefore you have all of the pathogenic microorganisms that you would associate with raw sewage: bacteria, viruses as well, and protozoan organisms like cryptosporidium and giardia,” Khan said. Exposure to these microorganisms can result in gastroenteritis, and ear and skin infections. “The threat with those sorts of organisms is short term because most of them don’t survive well in the environment,” Khan said. Given how extreme the recent rainfall has been, he suggests exercising caution and waiting for even longer than the guidelines recommend. “For something like this where the whole system is flushed, I think you’d want to be pretty careful and leave a bit of extra time,” agreed Phillip Birtles, the integrated water cycle manager for Sydney Water. “Even as microbial levels return to normal there still may be a large amount of debris or other hazards, such as murky water, which should be considered,” said a Beachwatch spokesperson. Experts have previously warned beachgoers to avoid swimming in murky water due the risk of shark encounters following weeks of heavy rain. Earlier this month, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said turbid water “can make conditions ideal for ambush predators, like sharks, to hunt in”. “Run-off and nutrients from the land run into our waterways and can attract fish and other animals to feed – this can then attract sharks,” a DPI spokesperson said. Storm water can be surprisingly detrimental to both freshwater and saltwater environments, Khan said. During heavy rainfall, organic carbon matter – such as leaves and sticks – is transported through storm water systems into waterways. Once there, bacteria biodegrade these materials, consuming oxygen in the process. “When there are low oxygen concentrations in water, that’s when … fish suffocate,” Khan said. “There have been a number of reports of significant fish kills around NSW following the floods we had a couple of weeks ago.” An increase in dissolved carbon compounds can also darken the water, leading to “blackwater events”. The good news, says Birtles, is that water quality in the tributaries of Sydney Harbour has been improving since the 1970s – the result of stricter regulations and a reduction in industry along the foreshore. “We’ve got a whole lot of mangroves and oysters coming back,” he said. “In general, the biodiversity is improving and we’re seeing dolphins and whales and seals moving back into the harbour.” Modelling shows that as the city’s population density increases, “we could go backwards”, Birtles said. “As we get more development occurring in the catchment, more hard surfaces, there is risk that that will deliver more pollutants more efficiently to the waterway.” He emphasises the need for well-designed storm water systems, and says Sydney Water is working with local councils to open new swimming sites along the Parramatta River.",News/Australia news,After the deluge: is it safe to get back in the water in Sydney?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/after-the-deluge-is-it-safe-to-get-back-in-the-water-in-sydney
3/20/2022,"Planners are calling for a shake-up of their industry and the planning system in the wake of the devastating floods across south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. As flood waters rose across Brisbane, Brent O’Neill, the director of design at Wolter Consulting, logged on to his computer and asked: “As development professionals, what is our responsibility to ensure we do not put people’s lives and property at risk? “I cannot help but reflect on the numerous times that as professional planners and engineers we continually push councils on the development footprint and boundaries, proposing engineered solutions to significant hydrological issues, ultimately rewarded by our developer clients when we achieve higher densities, or development in flood prone areas,” O’Neill wrote on LinkedIn. O’Neill told the Guardian that the aftermath of the floods was an ideal time to question “the ethical obligation of planners and the development industry”. “Ultimately, we’re there to represent community needs and values and if we’re not doing this, we need to do better,” he says. The planner and academic Dr Laurel Johnson says the planning industry needs to return to its roots. “The health of individuals and communities is at the heart of modern planning practice, which grew from a response to the dreadful health outcomes in post–Industrial Revolution European cities,” Johnson says. “But we’ve moved from that really clear mission of planning in the public interest to become facilitators and enablers of development.” Johnson says the planning industry needs to “pause and recalibrate”, given the dire warnings contained in last month’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. The IPCC says unchecked climate change will dramatically increase the frequency of deadly flooding to several times a year and will cause sea levels rise to the point where, in some coastal areas, retreat is the only option. Johnson says if her industry does not advocate for the public interest, communities will lose the chance to decide their future. “What’s happening now is that insurance companies are determining this because there are some areas where it’s not feasible to rebuild.” O’Neill and Johnson say the planning issues that have manifested after the recent floods are reflective of broader problems within the system. Johnson says the planning system is overly complex. “There’s even a Planning Institute of Australia award called the Hard Won Victory, as if beating the planning system is to be awarded,” she says. O’Neill says while the adversarial system could “produce excellent innovation, we do have to be cautious if that it is creating bad outcomes”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “An example is where you have two technical arguments, where one says the site will flood, and another says it won’t. We end up with two experts arguing about flood modelling, which might not produce an ideal outcome.” He says Brisbane city council planning rules introduced after the 2011 floods required development applicants to provide technical reports to show their proposed project won’t flood. However, O’Neill says Queensland’s performance-based Planning Act means developments on flood-prone sites can still be approved with some risk.

However, he says state and local governments need to rethink laws around building on flood plains, as planners alone cannot be moral gatekeepers. The Queensland deputy premier and planning minister, Steven Miles, said at a media conference this month he planned to talk to councils about how they could change their planning schemes to cope with the projections for more frequent and more severe natural disasters: “I have visited flooded areas … that, frankly, should not have been built upon.” Miles said the government and councils needed to work together to “mitigate flooding risks ... but also ensure that going forward we’re not building new homes on locations that are prone to flooding .” Sri says the impact of the floods on the low-lying suburb of Rocklea, where the city’s produce markets were inundated and a major garbage-truck depot was isolated by flood waters, shows council needs to rethink zoning laws . “We’ve got impacts to power, to sewerage, to school facilities, to waste disposal, to the food supply chains,” he says. Sri says governments have to take responsibility for the impact of the floods. A Brisbane city council spokesperson says: “An independent review into Brisbane’s preparedness for floods is being undertaken by former governor Paul de Jersey. We will publish the report and respond to its recommendations once it is finalised.” Sri says new rules need to look “at the cumulative impact of just how much development there has been, not just in low-lying flood areas but in areas higher on the hill”. “We don’t just need to be talking about the amount of development within creek catchments and within creek flood plains, but we actually need to be talking about the amount of development up the hills where the proliferation of concrete and hard-stand surfaces means that water hits those sites and then runs straight down,” Sri says. Sri, Johnson and O’Neill agree governments need to buy back flood-prone land. Sri says: “In suburbs such as Rocklea and Fairfield, the western side of West End, and the low-lying parts of Milton and Auchenflower, the government needs to offer optional buybacks to all residents in low-lying areas around creeks and the river and preserve that as green space or sports fields or other land uses that aren’t as severely affected by flooding.” He says: “The government should also be compulsorily acquiring any sites in these areas where developers are proposing to develop new residential, industrial or commercial buildings.” By promoting development on flood-prone land, O’Neill says governments are increasing the likely risks of flooding, ultimately placing the ongoing costs “back to the private sector, both owners and developers”. He says it is time for the industry to engage with all levels of government to have a hard discussion about priorities. “It’s about saying we’re a river city and we are facing a $1bn bill to rectify the recent damages.”",News/Australia news,"Queensland floods raise questions about the ‘ethical obligation of planners’, industry figures say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/queensland-floods-raise-questions-about-the-ethical-obligation-of-planners-industry-figures-say
3/20/2022,"Residents in Lismore have been left with no choice but to move back into their houses that have been deemed uninhabitable, with some sleeping on swags in mouldy rooms without electricity, as they are unable to find safe accommodation three weeks after floods devastated the town. In South Lismore – a low-lying part of the town that bore the brunt of historic flooding this year and an area well known for attracting residents seeking affordable housing – Guardian Australia spoke with multiple residents who had evacuated town following the floods but had returned to their homes in recent days. The State Emergency Service had deemed more than 3,600 homes across the New South Wales northern rivers region as uninhabitable and on Friday some residents were living in homes that had been as assessed as such. In one case, a homeowner had returned to their property which had been condemned for demolition after being assessed as structurally unsound, and had warning tape erected at its entrance, however they did not want to be interviewed. Some homes in South Lismore were swept off their foundations, but they remained intact, despite needing renovations and structural repairs. Stories of residents living in unsafe housing follow revelations in Guardian Australia that motor homes intended for Lismore residents whose houses were inundated in the floods were lying empty because linen and water sources had not been organised, while housing “pods” promised by the NSW government were yet to materialise. On Crown Street, the Lee family’s home was deemed uninhabitable after flooding rose to about chest height on its elevated top floor. The family of four hosted four neighbours on the Sunday that waters rose, and all eight had to be rescued by a friend who had a boat on Monday 28 February. After evacuating, brothers Ryan and Evan have slept at a variety of places, including at their grandparents’ home and on friends’ couches. Their parents also leaned on family and friends for accommodation. While they were able to rely on people who opened their homes to them, countless other residents also required temporary accommodation. And so on Monday, after weeks of living in cramped conditions with other flood evacuees, the Lee family made the difficult decision to return to their home, despite its status as uninhabitable. “There was nowhere else left to go, that is the only reason why we’re back here,” said Evan, a 20-year-old student, who was sleeping on an old fold-out camping bed made of steel, less than a metre from his mother, who was sleeping on a blow-up mattress. Ryan, a 21-year-old labourer, was sleeping on a swag in the next room, while their father, Andy, was sleeping at his brother’s house due to a back problem. While water was running, the Lees were unsure if it was safe, so were drinking bottled water. The house relied on a portable generator for electricity, and its mountain of flood-ruined possessions in the front yard was yet to be collected. “I’ve got no idea when it will collected, but hopefully it’s within the next week because it’s starting to smell pretty bad,” Ryan said. Outside, the smell of dried dirt and sewage lingered. Inside, water damage and mould was evident. It was hot inside the rooms, and flood damage left it largely unprotected from the elements. The family had been told it would take more than six months for their home to be rebuilt and safe for them to move back in. Despite this, Andy said one benefit of the fact they had returned to the home was that they could protect against looters looking to steal donated goods, such as fridges and washing machines, that had already arrived at some homes. The family were desperate for more secure medium-term accommodation and frustrated at the current options available to them. They had attempted to apply for one of the 40 mobile homes the state government delivered to Lismore for flood-affected victims, but had not heard back from the government. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Regardless, the mobile units were not large enough to accommodate all four of them for multiple months. “We’d prefer to live in a house somewhere together as a family, even if it’s in a different town up the coast. Anywhere really,” Ryan said. Along their street and those intersecting, the story was similar. Piles of possessions remained uncollected at most homes, and stories of families forced to return were common.

However, he counted the family as fortunate, as they had an insurance policy in place. “We really are some of the lucky ones in a way,” he said.",News/Australia news,Flood-affected Lismore residents with nowhere to go return to homes deemed uninhabitable,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/flood-affected-lismore-residents-with-nowhere-to-go-return-to-homes-deemed-uninhabitable
3/20/2022,"Allison Mueller was always interested in ceramics but career and family got in the way. Trained in interior design, she worked as a fashion stylist for 30 years. Mueller says the design industry is her “whole life”. She started playing with clay 10 years ago but it wasn’t until three and a half years ago that she began foundation and intermediate ceramics courses at Tafe. About the same time, her daughters moved out of home. With downsizing on the horizon, she could properly commit herself to clay. She found a place with a “little studio space out the back”. She painted the space white and built a custom table and bench for her pottery wheel, trimming tools and buckets. Her kiln sits near the door for ventilation, and rows of white shelving display test tiles and drying projects. Vicki Grima, executive officer of the Australian Ceramics Association, has noticed the “slow uptake” in pottery transform into a sharp rise over the last two years. She says Mueller’s story is typical. “There has always been a trend of hobbyists in the association pivoting from other industries and jobs in their mid-40s to ceramics, to begin community classes.” In the past four years enrolments in ceramics courses at Tafe New South Wales have doubled, says Chris Casali, head teacher of fine arts and ceramics for Tafe’s Sydney region. Pottery students come “at different times in their lives,” Casali says, with needs that vary. While “some want the qualification”, others want “experimentation with resources”. Despite its newfound popularity, particularly among hobbyists, Casali still says “not enough people see the capacity of what ceramics has to offer as a career”. “You can work as an artist, with artists, as an exhibitionist. Many students want a pathway into an arts health practition, like art therapy where clay is used for a whole range of things like motor skills.” Mueller says fashion, homewares and interiors are “coming into one” with ceramics. She points to the success of the Australian homewares company Mud Ceramics. Since opening in Sydney in 2007, the company has expanded to eight stores globally, from Melbourne to Los Angeles to London. This year it will open a second shop in New York City, along with new stores in Byron Bay and Sydney. Mud’s porcelain clay homewares are still handmade in a studio in Sydney’s Marrickville. “People want homeware that is unique, handmade,” Mueller says. “Mud are doing amazing things in this space.” But consumers are not the only ones driving the demand for handmade ceramics. Casali and Mueller say restaurants are also big customers. “It started with the more exclusive restaurants getting ceramic artists to create their dinner wear,” says Mueller. Now these collaborations have “filtered down to even the local cafes”. Not every person finding a passion for pottery is making a mid-life career pivot. For Nicky Li, a 20-year-old university student in actuarial studies and applied finance, an unexpected lockdown hobby turned into a small business. Feeling “super bored” in lockdown, Li “decided to order clay online” after seeing pottery posts on Instagram. Social media is a common entry-point to the craft; on TikTok, Queensland-based home pottery kit company Crock’d has racked up 7.2m views; while on Instagram, there have been more than 300,000 posts under the hashtag #AustralianCeramics. Li’s projects started small, with air dry clay; but she quickly transitioned into sturdier stoneware, turning her parents’ garage in western Sydney into a makeshift studio. After a while, the garage “became insane”. “Clay gets everywhere, all over the floor and table,” she says. Li stored her ceramics projects in stacked bread crates and crowded her workbench with “buckets and buckets of reclaimed clay”. “I had an excess of things I made, and my parents kept saying, ‘What are you going to do with all of it just sitting here?’” Li decided to start selling. She set up Be Kewl, an online store featuring batch-made ceramics, imprinted with slogans and affirmations. It’s still a steep learning curve for Li. Although she now sells her works, ceramics is “definitely not a cheap hobby”. In addition to the cost of clay, Li must pay to fire her works. “I don’t have a kiln, so I hire someone else’s,” she says. Grima says the Australian Ceramics Association receives inquiries about where to find kilns “all the time”. Access “is a bit problematic, with all the people falling in love with ceramics”. “You can’t just cook it in an oven,” she says. “People need to cook it in a specialised kiln, with a minimum fire of 1,000 degrees Celsius.” For hobbyists learning about ceramics from home, Grima suggests checking websites like Crockd’s Kilns Near You, which functions almost like an Airbnb for kilns, charting studios and independent potters offering shared firing spaces. Pottery suppliers, local artists and community centres can also help. “But the reality is, there are lots of places in Australia where there is no access to kilns.” This was a problem even before the pandemic. Kayde Clemans, owner of Bondi Clay, says a lack of accessible kilns is “why we opened up a studio” three years ago. The studio offers casual classes, take-home projects (which were huge sellers during lockdown) and more intensive workshops, but shared facilities – and the community building that comes from it – is central. “People share facilities, but also their thoughts and ideas,” Clemans says. He has since opened ClayGround, a second studio in Rosebery, which caters to intermediate and advanced potters. Casali likens clay work to visiting the ocean or sitting in the forest. “When you touch clay, there is some sort of weird bond … It just feels like you can slow yourself and your mind down.” Grima admires the material’s “amazing chemical change”, starting from “soft muddy stuff” to hardness after firing. For Li, the impermanence of the craft is its big appeal. “Even if your work is dried – if you haven’t fired it yet – you can put it in a bucket of water. It turns back to mush and you can remould it to what you like.” “Even if I make mistakes, I can redo it and see my progression over time.” For Clemans, it is no surprise that a world-altering pandemic drew people to ceramics. “It made people step outside their work life.” He calls ceramics “almost an antidote to modern-day life … You get your hands in it, and you are doing something tactile again.”",Arts/Art and design,All fired up: Australia’s handmade ceramics boom,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/20/all-fired-up-australias-handmade-ceramics-boom
3/20/2022,"The European Union is under pressure to ban the import of kangaroo products following a push from a Dutch animal rights party, a move that if successful could collapse the kangaroo export market. Europe is the largest market for kangaroo meat and leather products. But animal rights activists say that the trade is incompatible with the EU’s animal welfare requirements, and are building opposition to kangaroo products ahead of the EU-Australia free trade agreement. It follows a push to ban the import of kangaroo leather to the US. Legislation to stop the import of kangaroo products was introduced to congress last year but has not progressed. The push to ban kangaroo imports has been led by the Dutch Party for Animals, which is allied with the Animal Justice party in Australia. In 2018 it hosted a screening of an anti-kangaroo hunting film in The Hague, and also hosted New South Wales Animal Justice party MP Mark Pearson, who addressed a group of about 80 people in the European parliament. Last month the Dutch parliament passed a motion from Party for the Animals MP Frank Wassenberg calling on the government to “address the problem of access to the European market of controversial products such as kangaroo meat and kangaroo products with the European Commission.” Agriculture minister Henk Staghouwer supported the motion, saying that he “shares the concerns expressed” about the commercial kangaroo harvest, but warning that progress on a ban may be slow because it has to comply with trade regulations. The department of foreign affairs defended the commercial kangaroo industry and said Australia was “negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU that will remove barriers to trade, not put more restrictions on exporters”. All animal products imported to the EU from Australia must be produced in a manner that complies with Australian animal welfare standards and EU import requirements. The EU regularly audits the products, most recently in 2019, and found they met all requirements. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning About 1.5m wild kangaroos are killed in commercial harvesting operations in Australia each year, although the number can vary due to demand and drought. The target species are eastern grey, western grey, and red kangaroos and common wallaroos, none of which are listed as threatened species and all of which are considered abundant. States and territories set annual quotas for the number of kangaroos that can be harvested, which can be up to 20% of the kangaroos in a given region, but the actual number taken is much lower. The department of agriculture, water and the environment estimates that 3% of the country’s 50m kangaroos are used in meat production each year. The harvesting is undertaken at night by commercial shooters, who are required to pass accuracy and competency tests and to kill with a single shot to the brain. The carcasses are then eviscerated and prepared for transport, which frequently involves removing the head. They must be delivered to a chiller truck by dawn. Animal welfare advocates say that the removal of the kangaroo heads, which is not done by all shooters and not a requirement, makes it impossible to check the accuracy of kill shots. They have also raised concerns about the lack of on-the-ground audits, which would assess damage to animals left behind. But the biggest animal welfare concern is the treatment of joeys. Most female kangaroos of breeding age will have a joey in their pouch or at foot, and those joeys cannot survive without their mother. They are killed by blunt force trauma. RSPCA Australia’s Di Evans says that dealing with joeys is an “intractable” problem. If carried out skillfully blunt force trauma can provide a swift and humane death. But it’s a task that relies on the skill of the hunter, and the size of the joey. Joeys which flee are predated upon or starve to death. Even if you could address other concerns with the trade, says Evans, “I don’t know how you solve the issue of the joeys”. Pearson is a long-term opponent of the commercial kangaroo harvest. In October, a parliamentary inquiry in NSW, of which he was the deputy chair, found issues with the transparency of the methodology used to estimate kangaroo and wallaby populations, and found there was a lack of monitoring and regulation at the point of kill for both commercial and non-commercial operations. The inquiry also found that the NSW parks and wildlife services did not have adequate systems to monitor compliance with licence conditions for non-commercial culling of kangaroos, usually carried out by landholders. “They don’t know how many kangaroos are out there, they don’t know how many they have killed, they don’t know how they have been killed, and they don’t know how many joeys have been killed,” Pearson told Guardian Australia. He said the trade could not be conducted in a humane manner, because even if all commercial shooters were accurate they must still deal with the joeys. And he said the accuracy of shooters cannot be guaranteed without on-the-ground audits, which are not taking place. “How can we be assured that these animals are being killed with a clean shot to the brain, when their heads are left on the ground for the pigs and foxes to eat?” he said. Evans says the RSPCA’s concern with commercial kangaroo harvesting was that it was being managed as a renewable resource, not as an ecological measure designed to mitigate adverse outcomes like overpopulation, overgrazing and starvation. She said there had been a lack of national leadership on kangaroo harvesting, leaving behind a complex, polarising debate with few agreed-upon truths. The RSPCA’s position is that an independent evidence-based review, conducted by a body like a national commission for animal welfare, should be tasked to determine the ecological and animal welfare concerns around macropod overpopulation and develop a mitigation strategy – which may involve commercial harvesting. “That is what has got to happen first – you need to assess and provide evidence of the ecological and welfare harms that you are seeking to address, and then you can determine mitigation measures and assess whether those mitigation measures have had the desired effect,” she says. “We are never going to address this problem if we do not get serious about bringing the right people together and working through this.” Scientists who support commercial kangaroo harvesting say that if Europe were to ban the import, it would remove the most humane method of kangaroo population management, leading to more animals starving due to overgrazing or more animals being killed through non-commercial culls, which are carried out by less-skilled shooters. But leading ecologists have also called for a national kangaroo strategy, which considers population management through the lens of managing the level of resources available in an ecosystem to support kangaroos, and not a quota based on how many animals the industry will take. In January, a collective of Australian ecologists produced a special issue of the journal of Ecological Management and Restoration, focusing on the management of overabundant macropod species. It contained a joint statement, written by eight wildlife scientists, which said that overabundant kangaroo populations must be managed for reasons of both conservation and animal welfare, and that in the absence of dingoes, “regulated and accredited harvesting” was the preferred management method. The statement was endorsed by 25 groups including Bush Heritage Australia, NSW Farmers, the Australian Veterinary Conservation Biology Group, the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation and the Conservation Council of Australia. Dr John Read, one of the eight authors, told Guardian Australia that commercial kangaroo harvesting was preferable to other outcomes when dealing with overabundant kangaroo populations. He said campaigns by animal rights groups had created a “perverse outcome” for kangaroo welfare. “There would be less kangaroos being harvested, but that doesn’t slow down the reproduction rate of kangaroos. That means there are more kangaroos than the country can sustain, and if they are not being harvested by commercial hunters then they are either being culled, or they are being poisoned or dying of starvation,” he says. “They will die a horrible, horrible death.”",News/World news,Why is the EU under pressure to ban kangaroo products and how will it affect Australia?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/why-is-the-eu-under-pressure-to-ban-kangaroo-products-and-how-will-it-affect-australia
3/20/2022,"Ian Mineall was listening to talkback radio on Tuesday morning when he learned of a fire at a boarding house on Probert Street, Newtown, in Sydney’s inner west. “I know two boarding houses on that street,” he says. He hoped it wasn’t his old place. “It was.” The shocking inferno at the 14-room Vadja House left three people dead. Eight residents managed to escape, including one 80-year-old man who was in a critical condition after jumping out of a window before having a heart attack. Police have since charged a former resident with three counts of murder and one count of destroying or damaging property by fire or explosive. The owner of the property has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not facing charges. Advocates say the tragedy has once again placed the spotlight on the plight of those living in what are often dilapidated, unsafe homes. Boarding house residents share a kitchen and living space, rarely have their own bathroom, and for these reasons are technically considered homeless by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But because rooms cater to individuals who may struggle to gain a lease in a private rental, prices can actually be above market rates. “Boarding houses are at the end of the day only ever an option B,” says the Shelter NSW chief executive, John Engeler. “They’re better than the alternative, rough sleeping, but they’re not an [option] A.” Most residents tend to be older men like Mineall. And like Mineall, about a third are on the disability pension, according to Homelessness NSW chief executive Katherine McKernan, who argues most people are only living in boarding houses due to the “dearth of social housing”. “Sometimes they have an intellectual disability or another disability that makes it difficult for them to advocate for themselves, so they can be exploited,” says McKernan. Paul Adabie, of the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, which provides in-reach social services to many boarding house residents in the area, says boarding houses “vary a great deal in quality”. The centre’s chief executive, Liz Yeo, also underlines this point. “It’s not a sector you can paint with one brush,” says Yeo, whose organisation is widely praised for the work it does with operators to improve conditions. Mineall lived at the Newtown boarding house from 1989 to 2018. He served as the caretaker, meaning he got a “bit off the rent”. He was also responsible for “collecting the rents, doing a bit of cleaning”, and was sometimes required to inform people they were being evicted. He was sometimes threatened when he did so, he says. Mineall says the house had “deteriorated a bit” since he left, though he acknowledged repairs had been done on multiple occasions. Yeo described conditions at the property as “terrible”. One issue Mineall pointed to was “a hole in the kitchen roof”. “Nearly every time it rained the water would build up and go over to the kitchen and a few bits of stuff would come down,” he says. Guardian Australia does not suggest the condition of the home was a factor in the fatal fire. The Inner West council has confirmed the property had a current fire compliance certificate. In 2012, NSW introduced the Boarding Houses Act, which created a compulsory register and laws governing the rights and responsibilities of occupants and proprietors. McKernan says the legislation itself is “relatively good”. “The issue is it is not enforced”. “The register hovers around 1,000 boarding houses but we think a lot are unregistered,” says Yeo. The Newtown property ravaged by fire was registered with the government. Another key problem is there is insufficient incentive for local councils to act as a watchdog, say experts. “Local councils are responsible for regulating but any fines etc go to the state government,” says McKernan. “What that means is local government have to invest a lot to regulate and they don’t get any recompense for that. What we’re then relying on is the goodwill … of the councils.” Chris Martin, a housing policy expert at UNSW, says some are also mindful that closing a place down can mean “making a group of people homeless”. Martin would like to see an accreditation regime to regulate who can operate boarding houses. The idea was floated in an ongoing review of the Boarding Houses Act, which is being overhauled to include other similar settings as the “Shared Accomodation Act”. Martin says it has not been picked up by government. “[Boarding house operators] are involved in managing relations between multiple people in shared space, which calls for a higher order of skill and capability than individual landlords,” Martin says. “And also it is a sector that caters to a relatively vulnerable clientele.” Adabie also backed the idea of a licensing regime, while Engeler, of Shelter NSW, believes only community housing providers should have rights to run boarding houses. Martin also notes the state government discontinued the Boarding House Financial Assistance Program in 2019, which included a specific part of that program on fire safety upgrades. While many outsiders consider boarding houses to be problematic, Newtown Neighbourhood Centre research has found many residents are relatively satisfied. Many judged others as worse off than themselves. “You’d be surprised,” says Adabie. “Even with this fire [in Newtown], people don’t want to go to housing, they want to stay in the boarding house sector because of their history.” Mineall describes his experience as “at times stressful, at times not too bad”. “There was often a sense of community,” he says. But other times it was tough. “Some of the people would leave their homes in a horrific mess,” he says. “The mess is one thing I really do remember. I had the job of cleaning up that mess.” Mineall adds that he had “easily the best room the house” and insisted he got a “pretty good deal”. He still wants to see more regulation of the sector. “I really think boarding houses should be inspected a bit more often,” he says. “There should be more stringent rules applied.” Mineall is now in a home run by Anglicare, which he says he much prefers. It is still a shared property, but there are staff on hand to help the residents. If it weren’t for the social housing shortage, though, he might have his own place. About five years ago he enquired about social housing at an office in Broadway and “was told it was a 15-year wait”. “I looked at the calendar, and I thought, ‘Fifteen years, I’m going to be 75 by the time I get into housing commission,’” he says. “So I pulled the pin on that pretty quick.”",News/Australia news,‘Better than sleeping rough’: Newtown boarding house fire puts spotlight on sector,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/better-than-sleeping-rough-newtown-boarding-house-fire-puts-spotlight-on-sector
3/20/2022,"When Nannette Knapp’s son was 13 years old, he received a kidney transplant. He’d suffered from kidney disease since he was three, and had been on dialysis for years. The transplant was a big deal in the small community of Albany, Western Australia, where the family lives. It featured on the local news, and was even mentioned by then local member, Peter Watson, in the state’s lower house of parliament during a debate on council amalgamations. “Young Cody Knapp received a kidney transplant,” Watson said, while extolling the virtues of his electorate. “He is now living the life of a normal 13-year-old boy.” Except their lives were anything but normal. Soon after the transplant, after the cameras had been put away and the politicians had shifted their focus, things took a sharp turn. The assistance dried up, debts began piling up, and Knapp was eventually forced to leave the public housing property they lived in, before being formally evicted. Knapp’s eviction, and the debt that came with it, triggered nearly a decade of homelessness and despair. Her story is one of hard-won resilience and a desire to fight against tremendous odds: the systemic poverty instigated and perpetuated by what her advocates describe as punitive government policy. For years Knapp was a full-time carer for Cody, managing his dialysis at their home rented from the WA Housing Authority, while also caring for her other four children. When the transplant finally came, it helped his quality of life immensely, but Cody still required ongoing care – including medication and refrigerated dietary supplements. Knapp was subsisting on welfare payments, as she could not work due to a back injury. She had help managing the utility bills while her son was on dialysis, but after his transplant, the help dried up and the debt began compounding. By the time the power was cut off, Knapp had accrued an electricity bill of nearly $7,000. Later, her advocates and the power company would struggle to discern how the bills got so high without any intervention. It was impossible to care for her vulnerable son in a house without power, so Knapp went to stay with her daughter. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Soon afterwards, Knapp was evicted for non-payment of rent. The Housing Authority conducted a post-rental inspection and raised a debt of $26,096.92 against her, predominantly for damage, which Knapp says she did not cause. Until she had paid off the debt, she was told, she would not be eligible for another house. She did not believe she would be able to pay it off, as her only income was Centrelink payments – some of the lowest welfare payments in the OECD. The double burden of eviction and debt triggered a period of extreme distress for Knapp. She left her younger children with her adult daughter and disappeared into despair. “I just mainly gave up,” she says. “I had a drinking problem and anxiety on top of it. As long as the boys were right, I didn’t care. I went down a spiral, right down.” This had not been her first traumatic experience with government authorities. As a child in a Noongar/Yamatji family, she and her siblings were wrenched from their parents and sent to missions and foster carers. Knapp doesn’t speak much about what she endured during that time, only to say: “I was one of the stolen generation children. So I didn’t have time to spend time with my parents. When I got out [of foster care], I had a year or two with them, and then they were gone.” After her mother died, the bailiff came to evict Knapp and her siblings from her mother’s public housing property before the funeral had even been conducted. So years later, when she was evicted again, it took Knapp a long time to pull herself out of her spiral. “I just woke up to myself and thought, I gotta get my kids back and do something about it,” she says. “One thing we didn’t do was give them to welfare. After what we went though, I wouldn’t let that happen to them.” WA housing advocate Betsy Buchanan has known Nannette Knapp for decades, assisting her case with appeals to the WA Department of Communities. There are currently 18,388 households registered on the WA public housing waitlist, but Buchanan believes these figures are a distorted representation of need, because they do not include the number of former tenants who, like Knapp, have accrued debts that prevent them from accessing further public housing. “Aboriginal people can’t compete in the private market. They often have a lot of trauma or they’re looking after extra kids. They’ve got very poor health and hardly have any money,” Buchanan says. “It’s a discriminatory system. It discriminates against Aboriginal people at every turn. You can’t ‘try hard’ against those odds.” In one of many letters to the WA Department of Communities on behalf of Knapp, Buchanan wrote: “It is my belief that the enormous debts raised by the department against the poorest people in our community are an unjust and discriminatory bar to Aboriginal access to housing.” Guardian Australia has separately spoken to numerous Aboriginal people living homeless in Western Australia. Debt to the Housing Authority is a frequent complaint. Those who are barred from access to housing thanks to such debt often lodge with other family members who have existing public housing tenancies, leading to overcrowding. The overcrowding increases the likelihood of damages to the property or neighbour complaints against the tenant, which in turn increases the likelihood of further debt or eviction. Eligibility for public housing is already restricted to those on the lowest of incomes, and repayment plans for these debts – required in many cases for prospective tenants to become eligible again – diminish already meagre incomes even further. The situation of tenants is made even more precarious by the Housing Authority’s controversial disruptive behaviour management policy, known as the “three strikes” policy, which allows them to evict tenants who have had three strike notices issued against them. An audit of the policy in 2018 found that “a more holistic approach to tenancy management is needed if the department is to reduce disruptive behaviour incidents from occurring in the first place.” The WA Department of Communities told Guardian Australia that as of 28 February 2022, there were 15,316 current public housing tenancy accounts in debt to the Housing Authority. Last financial year, there were 35,279 public housing dwellings in WA, which suggests there is debt attached to at least 43% people holding public housing tenancies in the state. At the same time, 8,842 former tenants also have a debt to the Housing Authority. The average debt for a former tenant was $4,936. The primary causes of debt, according to Communities, were non-payment of rent, non-payment of utility bills and costs charged for removal of rubbish following vacation of a tenancy. A spokesperson from Communities says that Knapp was engaged with support programs throughout her tenancy that were aimed to “increase the capacity of a tenant to independently sustain their tenancy”. Last year, with the assistance of advocates, Knapp appealed her debt. On 17 November 2021, that appeal was upheld and vacated tenant liability charges of $20,519.90 were waived. The tribunal’s decision was not made on an empathetic basis; the finding cited only the failure of housing authorities to abide by an administrative obligation in the Tenancies Act. Now 53 years old and a grandmother, Knapp is still swimming against a relentless tide. She still owes the Housing Authority more than $4,000 in rental arrears, utilities and other charges, which her advocates estimate will take her seven years to pay. Her only income is jobkeeper, which is fraught with administrative burdens as she is constantly having to prove that her back injury prevents her from working. Even if she could work, she says, how could she be expected to find a job without a permanent home? “You can’t look for work if you haven’t got a house to go back to. I can’t work for my health reasons and mobility. I was told I could study online but I don’t have a computer. And I am just so poor,” she says. Last year Knapp was advised that she has been allowed back onto the public housing waitlist and has been given a priority listing. So far, though, she has not received a house. “People need to know what they’re doing to us,” she says. “I thought it was just awful when Cody was just sick. Why did they throw us out when Cody still needed home care? The government need to be accountable. Haven’t you guys really got a heart?”",News/Australia news,Aboriginal people in WA’s public housing system are fighting against a relentless tide of ‘punitive policy’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/aboriginal-people-in-was-public-housing-system-are-fighting-against-a-relentless-tide-of-punitive-policy
3/20/2022,"Flying flags in support of aromantic people; an investigation into how to ban nuclear weapons; a plan to grow and sell medicinal cannabis; street signs with anti-racism slogans, and a motion in support of Palestine on the same day that terrorist group Hamas fired more than 150 rockets into Israel. The mantra “roads, rates and rubbish” once defined the purpose of local governments. But in recent years, many of Victoria’s 79 councils have been advocating on issues that – on the surface, at least – are somewhat removed from the core business of councils. Many ratepayers and residents have welcomed this advocacy with open arms, happy that their elected representatives are standing up for their communities and speaking up on issues, especially those that their state and federal counterparts may shy away from. Others disagree, calling it a waste of money and resources that could be better spent on much-needed services, such as libraries, maternal and child health, and support for local small businesses. Kathryn Arndt is chief executive officer of the Victorian Local Governance Association, and is accustomed to this cycle of support and outrage that the increasing politicisation of councils generate. “Any issue that a council does get involved in should be done so only as it is consistent with their own municipal health and wellbeing plan, and consistent with any community sentiment or wish, and that issue is important to their community,” she says. “I think there’s a misunderstanding about what councils actually do.” The Victorian Local Government Act 1989 stated that councils should advocate on issues that were important to their communities. The act was superseded by the 2020 version, which removed this section. “The new act [says] more about the role of the council to provide good governance for the wellbeing and the benefit of the community,” Arndt explains. “This is something that is also not very well understood by a lot of people and that is, unlike any other level of government, a group of councillors are actually required to govern the business of the council.” Local government collectively in Victoria is a $9bn machine, with each council providing on average about 140 services, ranging from roads to aged care facilities. Many services have been delegated to them by the federal and state governments. At the same time, both levels of government have cut funding to councils for more than a decade, through cost-shifting and a drop in grants. This has placed increasing financial pressure on local governments, which they have – in part – counteracted with hiking up rates, which are calculated based on property prices. And despite an Andrews government cap on rates to CPI – which this year will be 1.75% – some ratepayers continue to be faced with whopping increases of up to 18%. Verity Webb, spokeswoman for the Victorian Ratepayers Association, says that given the financial pressures many councils face, they should focus on their core business and reining in costs, rather than speaking out on political issues that have little to do with their day-to-day activities. “Most councils are broke. Wage bills are outrageous and while ratepayers were losing jobs and income, some councils were hiring staff and [providing] pay rises,” Webb says. “The reason councils get involved in politics is because we have councillors who have nothing better to do than waste time and money dabbling in pet projects.” She added that too many councillors “waste time and money trying to catch the attention of state and federal power brokers by jumping on popular bandwagons”. But Stephen Jolly, a five-term Socialist councillor with Yarra City Council, says there isn’t a “Berlin Wall” between what is a local, state or federal issue. “One of the big issues I deal with is public housing; 13% of Yarra’s population live in public housing and they are overwhelmingly low-income and non-white,” he says. “Now, that’s a state issue, but they have burning life-and-death issues every day, so we openly campaign to improve and extend public housing and social housing. “You could technically say, ‘well, that’s not a council issue’, and you’d be right. But we’d be writing off the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community. It’s just not as clean-cut as some people argue.” Jolly points out that Yarra was the first Victorian council to cease acknowledging or celebrating Australia Day, in 2017, for which it received a significant backlash in the media. And while the cause remains controversial, it has unquestionably garnered further momentum in recent years. The right likes to rail against what the Institute of Public Affairs director of policy Gideon Rozner called the “loopy rules” and “virtue signalling” of councils. “From foreign policy, to climate, to dictating what food people are allowed to sell at food trucks, local councils are increasingly becoming fiefdoms where power-hungry local representatives are taking on responsibilities that should be reserved for state or federal governments,’ he said. But Arndt says issues like LGBTIQ+, reconciliation and the climate crisis are important ones for councils to focus on. “There are demographics within municipality communities that are at risk and that do require support to ensure their health and wellbeing,” she says. “Those who are criticising don’t understand the responsibilities of councils and are looking at councils in a very narrow way.”",News/Australia news,"Council of war: how much should local government stray from roads, rates and rubbish?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/council-of-war-how-much-should-local-government-stray-from-roads-rates-and-rubbish
3/20/2022,"Geography may allow Australia to avoid the direct human costs of the Ukraine conflict but not its fallout. Commodity market disruptions, supply chain breakdowns, sanctions and geopolitical realignments will affect Australians. Russia is the world’s second largest gas producer (17% of global output) and the third largest oil producer (12%). It is a key supplier of aluminium, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium and titanium. Russia and Ukraine supply up to 80 to 90% of neon gas used in lasers to make semiconductors. They produce large quantities of cereals, including almost 25% of the world’s wheat, and oilseeds for human and livestock consumption. Loss of all or part of this supply will affect production and prices. Oil, gas, wheat, palladium and nickel prices have gone parabolic. Without rapid de-escalation, sustained high commodity prices may reduce global growth by 1% and add up to 3% to inflation. Australian energy producers and farmers may benefit, although supply constraints limit opportunities and higher transport costs will reduce gains. Farmers face shortages and higher prices for fertiliser because Russia is responsible for around 20% of each global potash and ammonia supply. For consumers, as the Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Philip Lowe, has warned, the conflict could trigger new waves of inflation and higher interest rates. If wage rises do not match price increases, then Australians will see a diminution of purchasing power. Trade restrictions and sanctions targeting Russia may be ineffective. They assume US and western dominance of global commerce, but Russia and its ally China are important suppliers of energy, raw materials and many manufactured and intermediate goods. China and Russia have technological and financial workarounds which allow them to somewhat mitigate the effect of sanctions. There could be economic blowback from retaliatory measures. Restricting Russian access to the global banking system may rebound. Foreign investors are owed at least US$150bn (AU$208bn): around US$20bn (AU$28bn) of Russia’s dollar debt, US$41bn (AU$57bn) in rouble-denominated sovereign bonds and US$86bn (AU$119bn) of shares. With Russia unable or unwilling to make payments, much of this could be lost. Businesses forced to close operations or divest will not recover their investment. For example, BP’s disposal of its stake in Rosneft may result in a write-down of up to US$14bn (AU$19bn). Russia might also seize foreign business assets or not return about 500 aircraft, valued at US$10bn (AU$14bn), leased from western firms. Western automobile, aerospace and technology firms face loss of income from reduced access to the Russian market. Australian savings, via investment funds, are exposed modestly to Russian shares and debt but more significantly to firms directly or indirectly affected by developments. Volatile share markets are pricing in losses and the broader dislocation. The larger exposure is through the banking system, which has extended credit to Russia as well as businesses that are affected by sanctions, volatile commodity prices and a slowing economy. Banks, mainly European and American, have already foreshadowed multi-billion dollar write-downs. Problems may cascade through the hyper-connected financial system creating a daisy chain of losses setting off a financial crisis. The inevitable geopolitical realignment will have significant costs. There is the loss of the “peace dividend” which allowed lower defence spending. Alongside the US and EU, Australia plans to substantially increase defence spending. While benefiting defence contractors, higher military expenditure will divert resources from more productive uses, such as health, education, social services, infrastructure and strategic investments. It will place additional stress on already fragile public finances in many countries battered by the pandemic. Since 1989, the dissolution of cold war alliances and improved security allowed increased global trade and capital flows. The trend is now to closed economies, economic nationalism and self-sufficiency. A fragmented global economy and rising barriers to trade and cross-border investment may result in lower incomes and more expensive goods and services. Sanctions and the seizure of central bank assets can set dangerous precedents. The weaponisation of trade and financial relationships between nations will slow long-term growth and development. It will also produce lasting suspicions and tensions which will prevent cooperation on global issues like the environment and pandemics. Australia, as an open economy, is especially vulnerable. Closer Sino-Russian ties may decrease Australia’s export opportunities. “You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.” The aphorism attributed to Leon Trotsky captures the far-reaching consequences of conflicts. Trapped by historical alliances, Australia is not immune to a fracturing global economic and political order.

3/20/2022,"‘Iam not some agent of Russia,” wrote a pained Evgeny Lebedev in one of the newspapers he owns with his father, Alexander, the former Russian spy. “I am not a security risk to this country, which I love.” And for once, the sheer preposterousness of Lord Evgeny, the most elaborately costumed proprietor in press history, is on his side. Perhaps it’s reading too much John le Carré, but are serious security risks also likely to be party-mad showoffs, enthralled by celebrities, with titles that sound – “Baron Lebedev, of Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond on Thames and of Siberia in the Russian Federation” – as if they were dreamed up by a rather worrying 10-year-old? Though in that respect it might shed some light on an affinity sometimes considered suspect between Lord Siberia and the no less preposterous world king, Boris Johnson, whose determination to ennoble Lebedev has now embarrassed both. Is it impossible that Tuscan parties featuring celebrities and (Rory Stewart was told) “girls”, might, for such men, represent the pinnacle of human achievement? The similarities don’t stop there. Johnson thinks it stylish to flourish the classics; Lebedev was accessorised with De Profundis and Areopagitica for an appearance at the Leveson inquiry, an early signal of his claim, now endorsed by a Russian winner of the Nobel peace prize, to be called a press “freedom fighter”. Back in 2012 Lebedev tweeted: “Forgot to tell Leveson that it’s unreasonable to expect individuals to spend £millions on newspapers and not have access to politicians.” Both men like posing with their dogs, have fathers who hit people, and with their shared weakness for costly furnishings we can picture them pricing whatnots with the same fervour they bring to discussing Putin’s annexation of Crimea (in 2016 Johnson blamed the EU). Lebedev is said by one editor to have “exquisite taste”; a supporter said the exact same thing about Carrie Johnson, when her taste for neo-colonial polychrome was attacked. Still, for a Russian peer attempting to convince us of the innocent trajectory of his ambitions, “Siberia” is strange. Why allude to the gulags? At once silly (if he wasn’t always on about Russia) and sinister (if he wasn’t always on about Elton John), the title pretty much encapsulates the difficulties with Evgeny Lebedev. Can a person who invariably looks in his countlessclose-ups as if he’s auditioning for the Bullingdon Club really represent a security threat? Unless this fairly crude caricature of Etonian affectations, added to the Lebedevs’ past efforts to detoxify Putin, should only intensify doubts about Johnson’s judgment? Supposing, picking the first option, that Lebedev is guilty of nothing more than absurdity, social mountaineering and, like some valued Tory donors, living on a fortune gained by an occasional endorser of a murderous tyrant, there are many distinguished party guests who could testify to, if nothing else, his generosity. Although to date, we have heard more from Keir Starmer and Rory Stewart, both refusers of Lebedev invites, it’s too soon to conclude that smarter guests have, in the manner of the friends who once enjoyed Philip Green’s toga parties, scented disgrace and fled. It can’t be long, anyway, until we hear from much better informed intimates, from former editors qualified to endorse Johnson’s view of Lord Siberia as a blameless victim of “Russophobia”. Or alternatively, from former editors who, unless they endorse various Lebedevian equivocations on, say, the Litvinenko and novichok poisonings, support the contention that he isn’t. There would be no shame, you could argue, in the admission that without any actual instructions, they would naturally work, as Harold Evans once said of Murdoch’s system, “towards the Fuhrer”. “He doesn’t have to give direct orders. His executives act like courtiers, working towards what they perceive to be his wishes or might be construed as his wishes.” Some executives might be more embarrassed to recall what was always plain: that even editors with journalistic talent effectively doubled – given the pressure to cram Lebedev’s newspaper campaigns with scaleable heaps of politicians, royals and celebrities – as his diary secretaries. In Sasha Swire’s excellent memoirs, George Osborne is reportedly “concerned” that “Evgeny Lebedev is going to use him to arrange his social life”. Pending personal contributions from Osborne and fellow editors including Geordie Greig, Amol Rajan, Sarah Sands, Emily Sheffield and Chris Blackhurst, her account remains, in fact, the closest you can get to squaring Rachel Johnson’s tribute to Lebedev, “much smarter and funnier than people think”, with a tweet he once addressed to some Guardian journalists: “Up yours.” For Swire, when they were David Cameron’s guests at Chequers, Lebedev was “a charisma-free zone”. It was “extraordinary”, she noted in 2015, that the son of a KGB operative had penetrated “the very core of the British establishment by buying a newspaper”. Lebedev senior, she noted, even before junior embarked on some informal diplomacy, “is still pally with Putin”. How was it done? Did journalists serve, in this instance, with the same uncritical alacrity that is now condemned in the politicians, lawyers, estate agents, PRs and other enablers who made London so agreeable for oligarchs? Or was Lebedev smart enough, with Dad, to perform this feat solo? Rajan, once Lebedev’s media adviser, then his Independent editor, has stressed his old boss’s “terrifyingly good memory”, how he was “terrifyingly sharp”. By great good fortune, Rajan is now the BBC’s media editor, star interviewer and Today presenter, thus uniquely placed and equipped to offer insight on this important story. Presumably he’s simply been too busy to comment, to date, on whether Johnson’s passion for Evgeny’s elevation was understandable, or, when you factor in the ex-KGB father and his Crimean investments, fully as reckless as Cameron’s earlier infatuation with the Murdochs. There are those, you hear, who feel the BBC is overly dazzled by the ubiquitous Rajan: what a way this would be for him to prove them wrong.

3/20/2022,"Bila Tserkva’s No2 hospital was emptied of patients and its cold-war-era bomb shelter filled with beds to prepare for the horror its doctors have watched overwhelm medics in other cities. The few dozen patients they have taken in since war broke out are harbingers of the storm to come. One lost an eye to an explosion as he chatted with friends. Another faces months of recovery after a sniper bullet shattered his thigh bone. A third interviewed by the Observer was so badly wounded by a shell that forming a short sentence leaves him breathless with exhaustion. Several were injured when a rocket hit an apartment block in the town, about 50 miles south-west of the capital, but most were hit in regions where fighting rages to the north and east of Kyiv. They were brought here because treating their injuries was extremely complicated, or because the hospitals treating them closer to the front line were under fire. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been marked by intense attacks on civilian infrastructure. The World Health Organization says it has verified at least “43 attacks on healthcare” – hospitals, patients, or other infrastructure – since the war began. Nina Vasilivna, director of the hospital, says staff are getting ready for the war to arrive not just on their doorstep but in the hospital, if Russia renews its now-stalled assault on the capital. With 425 beds, it is one of the biggest in the Kyiv region, and effectively on standby. “We only take emergency patients and war injured – all scheduled operations have been cancelled since the start of the war,” she said. “There is no escape, so we have no option except to be ready.” The charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is helping it and other clinics to get ready, bringing years of war zone experience, including areas in Syria that were also attacked by Russian airstrikes. Natalie Roberts, a British doctor working for MSF in Ukraine, said: “Like everyone else, we can’t get in to besieged cities [such as Mariupol], but at least we can help prepare other places to handle these events, if and when [fighting] gets to them. “They aren’t asking us for staff the way they were in Syria. Here they are asking for knowledge – how to manage war wounded, how to manage when you get 100 patients at once, with heavy trauma injuries.” The country is well prepared in some ways, she said. It has a lot of doctors and other medical staff, most of whom want to stay in their posts. Tania Kotsiuk, one of the nurses treating injured civilians in Bila Tserkva, said: “We can’t leave because we are key workers, and we don’t want to leave because we are Ukrainians.” In large cities there are several hospitals, some for civilians, others set up in a parallel military medical network. But even for the most experienced medics, being on the front line can prove overwhelming. In Ukraine’s most intense conflict areas, doctors used to having the latest diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging and laboratories, have found themselves trying to treat patients under fire with no electricity and dwindling supplies of drugs. During a major battle, hospitals can be flooded with patients for days. Sometimes surgery must be aimed simply at keeping people alive so they can move on to other victims, rather than treating every aspect of injuries. Roberts said: “Adapting to war is hard. In the UK you have mass casualty events like a bus crash, but it would be one or two intense days handling patients. This could go on for weeks, months, years. “How do you deal with the fact that you don’t know how long it will last? You can’t use all your supplies on day one. Surgeons are used to doing full operations, but now they have to just stabilise people and hope they recover for full surgery later.” All this when their own lives are on the line; even maternity hospitals have not been spared bombing attacks, and cancer wards for children put under siege. Apart from emptying beds and stocking up on supplies, tasks include preparing a bomb shelter that has its own power supply, ventilation and even makeshift operating theatres. Its doors, nearly half a metre thick, can be operated by a single strong man. “We have one and he has been practising all the time,” Vasilivna says. The hospital is ready; many of its medics have some experience of war after eight years fighting Russian-backed separatist forces in the country’s east, but they are also aware that the scale of that conflict is dwarfed by the current attacks. “Doctors have experience of this kind of injury because we have been fighting since 2014,” Vasilivna said, on a tour of the hospital’s preparations. “But this is a different war from the one we have had up to now.”",News/World news,‘There is no escape’: inside a hospital in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/there-is-no-escape-inside-a-hospital-in-ukraine
3/20/2022,"Intense street fighting hampered attempts to free hundreds of survivors trapped inside a bombed theatre on Saturdayas Ukrainian forces held out against a larger Russian force inside the strategically important southern port city of Mariupol. In a day of scant battlefield gains for Vladimir Putin, Ukraine did admit that following fierce fighting in Mariupol it had lost access to the Sea of Azov for the first time, a potentially significant prize for Russia. Street fighting raged on Saturday in the port, much of it flattened after weeks of bombardment by Russian forces. The most notable target remains Mariupol’s main municipal theatre, bombed on Wednesday despite doubling as a shelter for women and children. Hundreds were still unaccounted for with more than 1,000 survivors believed to be trapped in the building. The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) became the latest humanitarian agency to voice frustration that it was being prevented from reaching tens of thousands of people trapped in the city, now completely encircled by Russian forces. Jakob Kern, the WFP’s emergency coordinator, described Russia’s tactic of preventing emergency food supplies to Mariupol as “unacceptable in the 21st century”. Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin described conditions in the city as “medieval”. Ukraine’s rearguard action in Mariupol is, according to experts, increasingly symbolic of the wider conflict, with the Russian offensive seemingly stalled across much of the country. A UK defence assessment described the Kremlin as being “surprised by the scale and ferocity of the Ukrainian resistance”. Updates throughout Ukraine indicated little change in frontline positions, with hotspots in the southern cities of Kherson and Mykolaiv – where scores of bodies were still being pulled from the rubble after a missile strike on a Ukrainian barracks – as well as Mariupol. Capturing the port would grant the Russians the entire northern coast of the Sea of Azov, cutting Ukraine off from a conduit to the Black Sea, while allowing the Kremlin to build a land corridor to Crimea, the peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. In the capital Kyiv, Russian plans to surround the capital were still seemingly far from being realised. Latest Ukrainian defence assessments indicated that 35 markets and 635 shops remained open, with the city looking to withstand a possible siege. However, some Russian elements have managed to breach its defences. Ukrainian forces in Kyiv announced they had so far detained 127 “saboteurs”, including 14 infiltration groups, since the Russian invasion began. One alarming development was Russia’s use of sophisticated hypersonic missiles – capable of avoiding air defences – to strike an underground weapons storage unit in western Ukraine. Defence experts warned this had “the means to escalate” the conflict further as the Ukrainian army would be unable to defend itself against attacks by such missiles.The use of these weapons preceded new attempts to resolve the fighting. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “meaningful and fair” talks with Moscow. Appearing to try to use Putin’s sluggish military progress as a reason for talks, Zelenskiy warned it would take Russia “several generations” to recover from its losses in the war. But Putin accused Ukraine of stalling by submitting unrealistic proposals, in a call with the German chancellor Olaf Scholz. Elsewhere, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the US of dissuading Kyiv from agreeing to Russia’s demands, although he did not provide any evidence to support the claim. Most western analysts believe the Russian forces have already suffered significant losses. Western officials claim to have evidence of dwindling morale among Russian fighters, as well as of severe logistical issues. Ukrainian forces claim that they have killed a fifth Russian general, Lieutenant General Andrei Mordvichev. If this is true, he would be the most senior Russian commander killed in the conflict so far.",News/World news,Battle for control of Mariupol hinders rescue of civilians trapped in theatre,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/battle-for-control-of-mariupol-hinders-rescue-of-civilians-trapped-in-theatre
3/20/2022,"An entrepreneur and investor on BBC programme Dragons’ Den has announced he has signed up to offer his home to a Ukrainian family fleeing the war as part of the UK government’s sponsorship scheme. Steven Bartlett, the 29-year-old author and podcaster, said he had applied to the initiative and hoped to house refugees in the spare room of his home in London. Under the scheme, which was announced on Monday, individual sponsors will be asked to provide homes or a spare room rent-free for as long as they are able, with a minimum stay of six months. In return, they will receive £350 a month. Bartlett, the founder and former CEO of social media marketing agency The Social Chain, said he would donate the money to the Disasters Emergency Committee, which is carrying out work in Ukraine. The entrepreneur, who was born in Botswana to a Nigerian mother and a British father, wrote on Twitter: “I have a spare room at my home here in London so I’ve signed up to offer it to a Ukrainian family. “The 350 monthly fee for housing a refugee family will be donated to decappeal who [fellow Dragons’ Den investor] Deborah Meaden recommended for their ongoing work in Ukraine.” Bartlett, who hosts The Diary of a CEO podcast and set up The Social Chain from his bedroom in Manchester, urged his followers to join him in applying to the scheme and shared a link. He becomes the latest celebrity after Cher and Benedict Cumberbatch to express an interest in housing Ukrainians who have left their country after the Russian invasion.
