2/25/2022,"A trucker told police he had pulled over at Love’s Travel Stop in Georgia on Feb. 17 when he noticed something was wrong. Blood was seeping out a door of another truck tucked into the back parking lot of the travel center, police told McClatchy News. Officers from the Madison Police Department were called to the Monticello Highway stop around 5:30 p.m. When officers arrived, there was a foul stench and the truck’s key was turned to the on position, but the truck had run out of fuel by the time police were notified, Detective Andre Johnson told the Morgan County Citizen. Police opened the truck to find the body of a 32-year-old man inside, Johnson told McClatchy News. The man was identified as Adam Walker of Columbus, who had been driving the truck to deliver tractor or lawn mower parts from Chicago to Jacksonville, the Lake Oconee News reported. Johnson couldn’t tell McClatchy News if Walker suffered any injures. He said that the blood and fluids oozing from the truck were likely due to decomposition since Walker’s body had been there for an estimated several days. Madison Police Department Chief Bill Ashburn said that there was a gun found, but it did not appear to have been fired, according to the Morgan County Citizen. Johnson told McClatchy News that police won’t know more until an autopsy is completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. “There is an ongoing investigation to determine events leading up to the discovery of the body. At this time, no foul play is suspected; however, we will await the completion of the autopsy before making any final determinations,” Ashburn said. Madison is about 59 miles east of Atlanta.

2/25/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Convicted killer Scott Peterson's chance for a new trial in the murders of his pregnant wife and unborn son 20 years ago hinges on whether a California juror who helped send him to prison in 2004 amid worldwide publicity was biased because she was a domestic violence victim. Though she is identified in court documents only as Juror 7, Richelle Nice used her name when she co-authored a book about the case with six other jurors. During the trial, her dyed red hair made her recognizable and earned her the nickname “Strawberry Shortcake.” She is expected to testify Friday under a grant of immunity from prosecution. Her appearance will come at the start of a weeklong hearing centered on whether she lied about her history with domestic violence to get on a jury so she could vote to convict Peterson. “This hearing is critical,"" said Pat Harris, one of Peterson's attorneys. “This is his chance to show that she did commit misconduct and to have the whole thing thrown out.” Nice failed to disclose during jury selection that she sought a restraining order while pregnant in 2000, saying she “really fears for her unborn child” because of threats from her boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend. She also failed to disclose that her boyfriend beat her in 2001 while she was pregnant with another child. Laci Peterson, 27, was killed when she was eight months pregnant with a son, whom the Petersons planned to name Conner. Investigators said that on Christmas Eve 2002, Scott Peterson dumped his wife's body from his fishing boat into San Francisco Bay. Peterson was eventually arrested after Amber Frey, a massage therapist living in Fresno, told police they had begun dating a month before Laci Peterson's death. She said he had told her his wife was dead. Peterson has maintained his innocence throughout. Although the state Supreme Court threw out Peterson’s death sentence in December and ordered Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo to decide if Nice tainted his trial, it said “there was considerable other circumstantial evidence incriminating Peterson.” If Peterson gets a new trial, Harris said they can present new evidence that burglars were nearby on the day Laci Peterson disappeared, that witnesses saw her alive that day, and that her fetus was “alive for at least another five to six days” based on an examination of the fetal remains. However, prosecutors said Peterson’s attorneys have presented no evidence to support their assertions that he deserves a new trial because Nice had a “darker motive” to be on the jury “and was in essence a stealth juror.” Depending on Nice’s testimony Friday, Peterson’s attorneys plan to put on witnesses including fellow jurors and co-authors of their book, “We, the Jury.” They also want People magazine reporter Johnny Dodd to testify about the “extraordinary” 17 letters Nice wrote to Peterson after his conviction and the eight letters Peterson wrote to Nice. Two filmmakers who worked on the post-trial television documentary “The Murder of Laci Peterson” are to testify that they noticed on Nice’s wall a photograph of a child wearing pajamas that said “Little-man.” Justin Falconer, a fellow juror before he was discharged, could testify that Nice talked a lot about Conner, referring to him as “little man.” Peterson’s attorneys say he would also testify that Nice said she was having financial problems and that they joked about post-trial book and movie deals. To have his conviction thrown out, Peterson’s attorneys must show Massullo that Nice committed misconduct and did so “based on a bias toward convicting Scott,” Harris said. Nice answered “no” on a juror questionnaire when she was asked if she had ever been a crime victim or involved in a lawsuit. She said in a sworn declaration last year that she didn't “feel ‘victimized’ the way the law might define that term,” and didn’t think the restraining order was a lawsuit. Her new attorney has told both prosecutors and defense attorneys that she will cite her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination until she is granted immunity from any prosecution for perjury. The attorney, Geoffrey Carr, said he insisted on immunity to protect his client from things that are stated with certainty in last year's sworn statement but where she might hedge on the witness stand. “Most of the substance of it is correct, but not all, and some of it is a matter of how you interpret stuff,” he told The Associated Press. Sometimes “the language is more assertive” in the sworn declaration than it was in reality. “I’m not anticipating bombshells” or “any surprises about what she's going to say,” Carr said. He said he's telling Nice that “her only obligation at this point is to tell the stone bloody truth.” Stanislaus County prosecutors are sparring with Peterson's attorneys over the significance of Nice's refusal to testify without immunity. “A juror’s refusal to cooperate in an investigation of her own misconduct may well evidence her bias,” Peterson's attorneys said in a court filing, adding that ""a witness has lied under oath is certainly relevant to credibility.” But prosecutors said that “should Juror No. 7 exercise her privilege against self-incrimination ... no inference be drawn as to the witness’s credibility.”",U.S./Associated Press,Scott Peterson's new trial rests on 'Strawberry Shortcake',https://news.yahoo.com/scott-petersons-trial-rests-strawberry-181437311.html
2/25/2022,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The government of economically-battered Syria decided Thursday to cut spending in an effort to reduce the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, concerned that oil and wheat prices could sharply increase, the state-owned news agency said. SANA reported that after an extraordinary Cabinet meeting, officials decided to manage reserves of main staples such as wheat, sugar, cooking oil and rice for the next two months, closely watch the distribution of the commodities and ration them. Syria’s economic minister, Mohammed Samer Khalil, said Crimea offered to export wheat to Syria. He said the Syrian government is considering the offer. SANA said the government also decided to closely monitor the exchange rate and to “ration public spending in a way that only covers priorities during this period.” Syria, struggling after more than a decade of war, relies mostly on wheat imports from Russia and oil shipments from its other ally, Iran. As Russia pounded Ukraine Thursday, Syrian authorities saw danger signs in rising oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic and wholesale prices jumped for heating oil, wheat and other commodities. Russia is a main backer of President Bashar Assad’s government and its military intervention in 2015 helped tip the balance of power in his favor. The Syrian government described the attacks on Ukraine as a “military operation by the Russian allies to preserve their national security and stability.” Russia's war effort turned Syria's government toward managing its own resources. SANA, the state news agency, said the issue was discussed during an extraordinary Cabinet meeting on Thursday about the path forward given the Russian invasion. The decision came as oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped toward or above $100 per barrel to their highest levels since 2014, up more than 6%. Syria's conflict that began in March 2011 has left nearly half a million people dead and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of 23 million people. The war has also led to severe shortages in fuel and wheat. The dollar today is worth about 3,600 Syrian pounds compared with 47 pounds at the start of the conflict. The country's largest oil wells are under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighter in the country’s east, depriving the government access to them. The country’s fertile agricultural areas, where wheat is planted, are also out of government control. Earlier on Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a “full-scale war” that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout already reverberated around the world. The Syrian government move came hours after the U.N. warned that 14.6 million people are in need of aid in war-torn Syria, an increase of 1.2 million people compared with last year. The report by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs was released late Wednesday. The U.N. and its partners are reaching 7 million people every month, “but more support is required,” tweeted Mark Cutts, the U.N.

2/25/2022,"During a broadcast minutes after Russia began invading Ukraine, Fox News host Laura Ingraham derided Ukraine’s leader for trying earlier to broker peace with the Russian president. “We had kind of a really pathetic display from the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, earlier today ... where he in Russian ― he didn’t like to speak Russian ― but in Russian, he was essentially imploring Vladimir Putin not to invade his country,” Ingraham said during a call with former President Donald Trump. “And now, we basically have the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations looking like a defeated man,” she added. Zelenskyy hours earlier warned that a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. “The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” he said in an emotional address to his nation in Russian. “But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.” Zelenskyy said he tried to arrange a call with his Russian counterpart late Wednesday, but the Kremlin didn’t respond. In the early hours of Thursday, Putin announced that he was launching a military operation in Ukraine. Reporters in Ukrainian cities began reporting explosions shortly afterward. Ingraham and Trump both also absurdly sought to blame President Joe Biden for Russia’s incursion, with Trump declaring that it “all happened because of a rigged election.” Ingraham’s spin of the situation rivaled that of her colleague, Pete Hegseth, who announced earlier this week that Trump was just trying to “troll” the media when he praised Putin’s invasion strategy as a work of “genius.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
