3/13/2022,"Before, my wife and I hardly ever ate bread. At least, if we weren’t in the village where we sometimes spend weekends away from our home in Kyiv. The bread we bought in the village was always tastier than the city stuff. In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow’s milk was also given to little kids and they loved it. Since arriving in western Ukraine, where like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before. Our boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf – a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery which is 20km from our village. Occasionally, you could find this bread in Kyiv, but only in small corner shops, not supermarkets. I have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight. The fact is Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack. In an instant, 13 bakery staff were killed and nine were injured. And the bakery is no more – “Makariv bread” is a thing of the past. Ihave long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Putin to Ukrainian soil. Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat. Even in Egypt, bread and cakes are baked using Ukrainian flour. It’s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done. The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal – fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters. And it’s all covered in blood. The blood of Russian soldiers who do not understand what they are fighting for, and the blood of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians who know that if they do not fight, Ukraine will no longer exist. In its place there will be a cemetery with a caretaker’s hut and some kind of governor general sent from Russia will sit and guard it. Bread was mixed with blood in Chernihiv as well when Russian bombers dropped “dumb” unguided bombs on a square next to a bread shop. People had lined up outside, waiting to buy some fresh, warm bread. Someone was just leaving the store with a bag of it. Many people died in this bombing raid. Amnesty International has documented this crime committed by the Russian army. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin’s actions are added to it – the shooting of young volunteers who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of postmen who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an attack on the Kyiv television tower. The list goes on and on. We certainly don’t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn’t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged. International lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army. They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms – the latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that in case of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows. The people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world. The metro is no longer a form of transport – it is a haven, like something from an apocalyptic movie. It is covered with signs of permanent presence of non-travelling “passengers” and there is living space everywhere. The station platforms are being turned into cinemas where films are shown for free – children’s films in the morning and films for a wider audience later in the day. Large screens have already been hung or are being hung right now at 14 Kyiv metro stations. There is a constant supply of tea, the internet is already there, but the connection is poor. There are not enough toilets, but people don’t complain about queuing for 40 minutes or more. Everyone waits patiently. They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial – a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg. And, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don’t think about it at all. They are now busy buying dollars and euros. Sanctions targeting the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic. Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now trying to leave their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin. Some captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good. “Jail awaits us if we return!” they say. On the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It’s said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports. These are those who don’t want to fight either. I won’t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other. Mobilisation has been announced, but no one is forcibly taken into the army. Those who themselves want to defend their homeland come to the military registration and enlistment offices and get registered. Most often, they are asked to leave a phone number and to wait for a call. There are many who want to fight the invaders, but not all of those who want to fight are really ready to participate in military action. In the last couple of days, I’ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the news feed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears. But I can’t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country. I know that in the occupied Melitopol, in the south of Ukraine, arrests of Crimean Tatar activists and other active citizens have begun. I know that the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been kept inside the station by the Russian invaders, that their mobile phones were taken away and that they have not been allowed to leave the station for more than a week now. Moscow television propagandists have gone there under the protection of the Russian military to make news stories. I don’t know what they are saying in Russia about this war, about the captured Chernobyl nuclear power plant, about the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is still in operation. Why do they need this non-military atomic installation? Are they planning to blackmail Ukraine and the world? Why are they bombing children’s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don’t have answers to these questions. “You can’t understand Russia with your mind!” wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev. I agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?",News/World news,I have run out of words for the horror of Putin’s crimes in Ukraine | Andrey Kurkov,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/ukraine-russia-war-putin-crimes-justice
3/13/2022,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces demands from economists across the political spectrum to increase benefits and the state pension by about 8% in his spring statement next week, in order to help alleviate the worst cost-of-living crisis for decades. A Resolution Foundation report on the state of the economy on Monday shows that only such drastic action will allow millions of people on low incomes to maintain their living standards at current levels. Economists from other leading thinktanks – including the right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies – are also urging the chancellor to increase benefits by far above the 3.1% currently planned. This figure was determined last September by the rate of inflation at the time. While the Bank of England has predicted that inflation will rise above 7% next month, the war in Ukraine and its effect on energy and food prices has led many economists to predict even more pain, with price rises hitting 8%, and affecting the poorest households most. The Resolution Foundation’s new modelling shows that a single parent living in rented accommodation with one child, doing 20 hours of work a week supplemented by universal credit, will see the effects of all the recently announced government help with energy bills and benefits more than wiped out by the soaring cost of living, leaving them hundreds of pounds a year worse off. It says, however, that if benefits were to be raised by a further 5% – taking the total uplift to the staggering level of 8.1% – the difference would be made up and living standards for many of those on low incomes would not decline. The thinktank predicted last week that typical household incomes would fall by 4% in 2022-23, a cut of £1,000 per household, the sharpest annual income fall since the mid-1970s. Under current plans the state pension will also rise by just 3.1%, meaning an increase of £5.55 a week. If inflation rises to 7.25% in April, as predicted by the Bank of England, this would amount to a real terms cut of more than £7 a week. Recent analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that increasing benefits by 3.1% at a time of soaring inflation would mean that 9 million low-incomes households entitled to means-tested benefits, both in and out of work, would experience an average real-terms cut of £500 a year. The foundation is calling on the government to increase benefits in line with the Bank of England’s February 2022 monetary policy report forecast of 7% inflation by April as an immediate first step to help keep up with the rising cost of living. The demands to help those on benefits and state pensions is another headache for Sunak, who is already under intense pressure from Tory MPs to drop or postpone a 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance due to come into effect in April. The Treasury has indicated it is not willing to move on the increase, which was planned to pay for the NHS and improvements in social care. If Sunak resists this, most Tories expect he will bring in extra help for low-income families, to help them cope with energy and fuel costs. Clare Moriarty, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “Rising costs are simply swallowing what’s left of people’s budgets. One of our advisers spoke to a parent last week who was having to choose between giving their kids a hot bath at bedtime, or putting on the heating for an hour while they got ready for school. “These stark choices are only going to get worse from April when energy bills rise again. “The government must do more. We’d urge them to immediately increase benefits in line with inflation to help people keep pace with costs. And when bills soar further in the autumn they must bring in a support package to stop more households being pushed into hardship.” James Heywood, head of welfare and opportunity at the Centre for Policy Studies, said benefits should be raised this year by more than the 3.1% planned, and that the increase should be reversed next year. “Benefits are uprated annually by the September measure of inflation, but ministers should consider uprating benefits by more this April to cushion the impact of the cost of living crisis for the poorest households. This should then be offset by reducing next year’s increases. This way the government can help blunt the edges of the cost-of-living hike, without incurring sustained pressure on the public purse.”",News/Society,Sunak urged to raise benefits by left- and rightwing economists,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/13/sunak-urged-to-raise-benefits-by-left-and-right
3/13/2022,"The chair of a board advising on the legalisation of psychedelic mushrooms in Oregon has resigned after being accused of standing to profit financially from the potentially $1bn industry he is helping to shape. In 2020, after a landmark US-first vote, Oregon legalized the therapeutic use of psilocybin. But the ructions at the board could throw the whole industry into disarray. The state governor appointed an advisory board to help implement the trailblazing reforms, for rollout in January next year. According to local media reports, however, some members of the board have allegedly announced or indicated their plans to invest in the industry. Former chair Tom Eckert, who led the campaign to pass the psilocybin ballot, has created a company to train magic mushroom therapy facilitators. Other members also admitted recently that they were intending to pursue business ventures, after it was agreed personal and financial conflicts of interest would be formally disclosed. The board makes non-binding recommendations to health authorities. Responding to questions from the Guardian ahead of his resignation, Eckert – whose wife, Sheri, with whom he had campaigned for years, died in late 2020 of cardiac arrest, defended his actions. “In many cases, our perspectives and experiences relate to industry involvement, which was known when we were appointed and is known, through our disclosures, by the board, the public, and the [Oregon health authority]. I have disclosed my projects, as have others on the board. I supported the updated policy and will continue to comply with that policy.” He argued that individual board members use their contacts to help connect “useful people and resources’” to the board. “It is in the board’s interest to seek out and integrate the best information out there, from multiple perspectives, so that we can optimally support the Oregon health authority in building the best statewide program possible.” But as the risk of bringing the reputation of the board into disrepute grew, he resigned. “As my life continues to change, with more relationships taking shape, I am mindful of appearances. I do not want anything to distract from the earnest work of this advisory board,” he said in a statement first reported by Marijuana Moment. “It feels like the right time to orient my energies to the next stage of the journey. I look forward to supporting the development of Oregon’s psilocybin infrastructure in new and different rules.” Oregon’s cautious experimentation comes as evidence grows of the beneficial effect of magic mushrooms on mental health. A handful of other US states have since moved towards rolling back psychedelic drug prohibitions and providing a legal framework for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. Campaigners, experts and business people in Oregon – many of whom are passionate about the potential of psilocybin to address the country’s mental health crisis – have been tasked with helping to create the rules. Potential conflicts of interest are, in that sense, unsurprising, say some industry sources. “This volunteer advisory board was specifically chosen because folks are involved in populating the eventual [psilocybin therapy] ecosystem with organizations,” said one company insider. “It’s a trade board in that sense.” But David Nickles, an expert on the nascent psychedelic industry, said the “personal and professional conflicts of interest” of the chair raise significant questions. As well as founding the firm Innertrek to train psilocybin therapists, it emerged that Eckert has also been in a personal relationship with the CEO of a company investing in the Oregon psychedelic industry. The firm, Synthesis Institute, recently bought a 124-acre property in Oregon, to host future retreats that are likely to cost thousands of dollars, as well as facilitator training. The board has commended Synthesis for the expertise provided to them by its staff. It said Synthesis “has supported nearly 20% of our inaugural psychedelic practitioner training cohort participants” with financial scholarships. “The chairman’s personal and professional conflicts of interest raise significant questions,” said David Nickles, an expert on the nascent psychedelic industry. “In what situation is it appropriate for people who are crafting regulations to also profit off of the industry they are regulating? What does it mean to forge undisclosed romantic relationships across lines of industry and regulation? And, even if it’s happened before, do such practices generate or maintain a world in which we want to live?.” Eckert told a recent board meeting that where there are potential conflicts of interest, “it makes sense for thinking of not voting on those issues”. Oregon department of justice rules state that appointed public officials serving on a board should publicly announce any conflicts of interest, not participate in any debate on the issue and refrain from voting on it. Eckert went on to tell the board: “There’s so many grey areas. The expertise is coming in on a lot of those subcommittees because we’re working on stuff, and I’ve been transparent about working on a training programme for example. “Therefore, I’m interested in understanding how that can happen in all kinds of ways. So [deciding] where that line is is going to be tricky, and I’m very open to defining that a little bit more. We kind of did this on the fly early on.” Some cannabis regulators have been accused of helping enrich friends who are already established in the industry, by raising barriers to market entry amid the so-called “green rush”. Last year in Florida, John Burnette, a developer who is married to a cannabis company CEO, was jailed for conspiring for former state representative Halsey Beshears “to keep out competitors”. Critics have argued that there is a revolving door between decision-makers and the cannabis industry. Oregon is under particular pressure to ensure that low-income and ethnic minority communities are not shut out of the potential psilocybin economy. A state senate committee voted last week to establish a taskforce including representatives of the indigenous community to examine barriers faced by people of colour in starting psilocybin-related businesses. “We cannot continue the cycle of shutting out the future of medicine to certain communities and we have a rare opportunity here to prevent these inequities from being built into this system in the first place,” said state senator Wlnsvey Campos.",News/US news,Oregon’s psychedelic mushroom regulators accused of conflict of interest,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/oregon-psilocybin-psychedelic-mushrooms-advisory-board
3/13/2022,"The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the United States hard, sparing no region, race or ethnicity, though some groups have suffered more than others. The virus has caused more than 965,000 US deaths; strained healthcare systems; changed companies and employees’ expectations of one another; and sparked political battles over vaccine mandates and controls. As we reach the second anniversary of the pandemic being declared a national emergency in the US, infectious disease experts suggest – with caveats – that the worst could be over and that we could soon see something like life before Covid-19, at least in terms of gathering with others indoors. We’ve had multiple false dawns that the worst is over and now hopes are growing again, with controls easing, but experts have cautioned we must remain vigilant for new variants and prepare for an endemic phase of the disease. During the first half of 2021, people regained a sense of hope after an extraordinary year filled with death, job loss and isolation from family and friends. Vaccines became widely available; the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations decreased; and the weather warmed, which allowed people to more easily gather and worry less about contracting the virus. Then that summer, the Delta variant, which was twice as contagious as previous variants, arrived in the US, causing a new wave of infections and worries. During the peak of the third wave of the pandemic in winter 2020-21, there was a seven-day average of more than 130,000 hospitalizations. At the height of the Delta wave, that number was 100,000. Once that wave ebbed, talk of a return to normal again emerged, only to be interrupted by another even more contagious variant – Omicron – though the symptoms from this one were less severe, particularly for people who were vaccinated against the virus. That wave caused the highest number of hospitalizations throughout the entire pandemic, at one point leading to a seven-day average of almost 160,000 hospitalizations. “There were two occasions, just before Delta and just before Omicron, where as a society and public health community, we thought we were on the verge of some variation of success,” said William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Now that the number of Omicron cases and hospitalizations have plummeted, elected officials and business leaders again feel confident in their reading of the waves – but Schaffner does not necessarily share their assessment. That’s in part because even if we declare Covid to be endemic in the United States, meaning that it’s a regular part of life here and more manageable, rather than a pandemic, meaning an ongoing global outbreak, a new variant could crop up in a different part of the world that evades existing vaccines. “We would have to create new vaccines and start vaccinating all over again, which would have all the impact of the proverbial lead balloon,” said Schaffner. “We are a very large and diverse country” so the end of the pandemic “won’t happen simultaneously … but maybe by the end of March and the beginning of April, we can be there over most of the country”. The US is a large and diverse country. Its rifts and inequities were laid bare and worsened by the virus. Democratic governors instituted stricter lockdown measures than their Republican counterparts. Red states had significantly lower rates of vaccination against Covid than blue states. People of lower income were less likely to get vaccinated. Black Americans were significantly more likely to die of Covid, even though the Black population is younger than the nationwide average. “You name the illness, whether it’s a communicable disease or it’s diabetes,” minority populations “are disadvantaged in terms of the impact of disease”, said Schaffner. “This has been true of the impact of Covid.” While Black people were less likely than white and Hispanic people to get vaccinated, they overcame their vaccine hesitancy more quickly than white people, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “When the vaccines were touted as having been created at ‘warp speed’, well, we in science were very proud of that, but the way that was heard by a lot of people was, ‘Ooo, they probably cut corners,’” Schaffner said. But “vaccine acceptance has really grown in the Black community because at the local level, health departments and others have really worked hard to reach out, provide information and have people of color go out and be the messengers”. More than 965,000 people have died from Covid during the pandemic. Such a toll is equivalent to the 15th most populous city in the country, more than San Francisco, Washington DC or Boston. But Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, suspects that is an undercount. There have been more than 1 million excess deaths from Covid and other health issues in the US during the pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Lessler attributes the difference between the official Covid death tally and the CDC excess death count to Covid “deaths that did not get attributed to Sars-CoV-2, but that being said, I think detailed analysis will be needed before we can say that with 100% certainty”. Whatever the actual number is, it could have been significantly lower had more people decided to get vaccinated against the virus, Lessler said. “I think it’s played a big role because being vaccinated decreases your mortality so much, and a pretty high percentage of deaths have been among the unvaccinated,” he said. Even though many Black people have managed to overcome their vaccine hesitancy, it’s unlikely that many more unvaccinated people in that demographic and others will opt to get the shots, said Schaffner. Over the last two months, the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated has only increased by about three percentage points, from 61% of the US population to 64%. Schaffner is also discouraged by the fact that only 43% of the people in the US who were fully vaccinated have received a booster dose, according to CDC data. “There has been an avalanche of new stories … that says boosters are good things, and they haven’t taken advantage of it, so I think we have pretty much reached a maximum, and if going forward, an annual booster may be required, that will be a hard sell,” said Schaffner. “We don’t do terribly well with our influenza vaccine campaigns – we do OK but not great – and I think we would have a hard time telling people to roll up both sleeves.” It’s hard to imagine that there was a time when Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms were not a part of daily life for white-collar workers in the United States. But when the pandemic forced business leaders to temporarily – or permanently – close their buildings, the world changed. By April 2020, 22m jobs in the United States were lost, and employment numbers still haven’t returned to their pre-pandemic levels. “It was not just an unemployment increase, but also a lot of people left the labor force,” said Iwan Barankay, an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. US labor force participation in January was also only about 62%, which remained more than a percentage point less than before the pandemic, said Barankay. It had dipped as low as 60%. In part because of school closures, “lots of women left the labor force, and now we are starting to see a trickle back into the labor force,” said Barankay. Some industries, however, still have far fewer jobs, particularly those that necessitate people working in person, such as mining and logging, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. A major story during the pandemic has been the global supply crisis, which has been attributed to the various shocks that the world’s economies have undergone since the outbreak. Off the coast of Los Angeles a record-breaking flotilla of container ships has been waiting to unload goods. The US has also experienced a giant labor shortage, especially in the leisure and entertainment sector; and there were a record 10m job openings in the country at the end of June. Changes to the way we shop have been exacerbated by the crisis with a rise in “one-click ordering” being served by an expansion of warehousing by multiple firms including Amazon, which has had environmental costs for some communities. Workers’ expectations of their employers also changed significantly during the pandemic. “How companies coped during the pandemic and their ability to transition back depended on the extent their work can be done from home,” said the University of Pennsylvania’s Barankay. As workers slowly return to offices, will work life snap back to how it was in 2019? Cristina Banks, director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces at the University of California, Berkeley, said the forced changes of the crisis have opened up possibilities. “Some people are starting to think about how could we design work that will really benefit people and businesses,” Banks said. “There are no answers yet, but I think instead of following blindly a leader” in an industry, “some people are engaging in conversations” and saying: “Why can’t we have people working worldwide and all different hours?”",News/US news,How Covid shook the US: eight charts that capture the last two years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/how-covid-shook-the-us-charts-graphs
3/13/2022,"Anakedly corrupt and evidently narcissistic leader, surrounded by a phalanx of accommodating acolytes, enriched his supporters with liquidised public assets and spurious government schemes, flagrantly broke international treaties, trashed domestic political standards, systematically flooded social media with fake news, used his power over the press to spread disinformation over many decades, sought to destabilise the EU, had fruitful meetings with far right figures in Europe and America, weaponised nostalgic nationalism, and allowed refugees to be used as cannon fodder in an ongoing border dispute. But now is not the time for Keir Starmer to call for Boris Johnson’s resignation. (Did you see what I did there? I’m here all week!! Try the fish!!!) Britain shamefully allowed Russian oligarchs to pay their way into the upper echelons of society, and is internationally despised for it. It is probably the only area of the current conflict in which we do genuinely “lead the world”. Did the wealthy interlopers’ presence protect Putin from meaningful criticism? Kill a British citizen in a Salisbury park, and then sarcastically maintain your trained assassins were tourists, of an ecclesiastical bent, keen to see the cathedral en plein soleil? Step right this way, sir! And would you like to play tennis with the prime minister too? Stick your head in between them and go “Blubby blubby blubby”. Swathes of the home counties are now populated by oligarchs who look like they saw a Jack Vettriano painting of a woman putting on some stockings while a smoking man masturbates through a French window, and instead of just vomiting, decided that was the lifestyle for them! The Intelligence and Security Committee report on Russia, from July 2020, warned, as cautiously as possible, about their influence on British media and politics, but played down the danger of an oligarch-fuelled Jack Vettriano suspenders and sports car aesthetic dominating the fine art market for decades. Instead, the report suggested “the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money”, pinpointing visas for cash, the reputation laundering power of British institutions, and the danger of British lawyers, financiers and PR professionals, such as Tory party chairman and oligarch enabler Ben Elliot, presumably, becoming de facto Russian state actors. Having learned at the Telegraph that the best way to belittle anything is to tie it into Brussels, Turds Johnson dismissed its concerns as those of “Islington remoaners”. But the people being shelled in Ukrainian cellars don’t seem too keen on Russian influence either. And they love the EU. Is it possible to be an Islington remoaner if you live 2,500 miles away from Islington and spend all day pouring petrol into milk bottles or hiding? Just asking for a fellow comedian. Fifteen months prior to the report, while still foreign secretary, Turds evaded his bodyguards for an unapproved jaunt to a party in Italy held by an ex-KGB agent’s playboy son, Evgeny Lebedev, whose name sounds like someone trying to say “Have you any liver please?” underwater (I have checked with Alexa and this joke is officially “not racist”). Turds was then spotted admitting to fellow passengers he’d “had a heavy night”, in San Francesco d’Assisi airport, on the way home. One onlooker observed of the future PM: “He was such a mess. He was quite dishevelled and his trousers were twisted and creased. He looked like he had slept in his clothes.” To be fair, Turds always looks like that, but the fact that his trousers were “twisted” is uniquely disturbing. What horrendous act could Turds’s host have perpetrated on him that left the future PM’s trousers tangled so, and could it have any relation to Lebedev’s accession to the House of Lords two years later, at Turds’s request, despite the security agencies briefing Turds against it? Suddenly, the suggestion of Russian interference is taken more seriously, and the systematically maligned Carole Cadwalladr is quietly transforming from Andrew Neil’s “mad cat woman” into the Oracle of All Knowledge from The Golden Voyage of Sinbad. The Tories’ own use of disinformation in the last election, where 88% of their online communications were false, showed us the approach can work, and it was always obvious to me that I was being targeted by Russian trolls. Whenever I wrote about Russia around the time of the EU referendum, patriotic counterattacks would appear in the newspaper’s below-the-line comment section in not quite right English. In the end I took to goading the writers of these clearly targeted contributions by including deliberately incomprehensible comments about Russia in my satires, peaking, in June 2015, with the following paragraph (apologies if I have quoted it before). “To me, Vladimir Putin is a giant, prolapsed female worker bee that sucks hot ridicule out of langoustines’ cephalothoraxes. Let’s see what crunchy, expansionist lavatory honey this notion causes the parthenogenetic Russian keyboard wendigos to inflate for us this week, in the shadow of Paul McGann and his art gnome.” But I suspect the author of the subsequent comment, “Even if Putin bee, he struggle for better colony much better for world than western wasp colonialist Lee tries to flag wave”, was an Observer reader joining in. Did the Kremlin trolls’ cost-effective cyber campaign finally run out of steam? Trump surrendered the White House, eventually; the anticipated EU exit domino effect was headed off by the reality of Brexit; all over Europe, oligarchs’ assets are being seized; even in Britain, Roman Abramovich’s assets were finally frozen and stored in the ice compartment of the Downing Street lockdown party wine fridge. Putin has unplugged the wifi and sent in the tanks. Russia entangled British trousers, as surely as Lebedev tangled Turds’s on that fateful Italian evening. First we must hold the Home Office to account, neutralise the anti-refugee aftertaste of the Brexit campaign, and match European hospitality for the displaced victims of war. Then we must disentangle our trousers. Permanently.

3/13/2022,"Jon Barton spent his days reading scripts, advising costuming departments and thinking through fight choreography for top military movies. The retired US marine took his expertise after four tours in the Middle East to Hollywood, consulting and providing military equipment to film sets – a mission to help the entertainment industry better depict military life. Until late February, when Russia’s President Vladamir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Duty called again, Barton said. Barton, owner of Night-Fire Media, a military consulting and rental company, is sending most of his company’s tactical gear to Ukrainians fighting Russian troops – backing a David-versus-Goliath fight for democracy that has the whole world watching. “There is this inherent belief that something is wrong,” he said. “And if you’re someone who’s been trained to fight wrong and to stand up in the face of evil, you inherently get drawn into it.” Earlier this week, Barton hurried around the Ukrainian Orthodox church in Echo Park, balancing two cellphones and juggling boxes of rifle slings, boots and camouflage uniforms. The supplies were to be boxed and flown to the border between Ukraine and Poland and distributed by volunteers. He said he hadn’t slept for two days. “It’s super cold, so imagine fighting in those conditions,” Alex Dubov, a professor at Loma Linda University, who has family in Ukraine, said outside the church. “The boots that Jon was just bringing in is like, sent by heaven.” Barton is not sending weapons or ammo – by law, he can’t – but this is crucial gear civilians often forget, he said. Many are everyday Ukrainians suddenly facing relentless shelling. He’s donating about 80% of his inventory, including about 620 uniforms of various camouflage colors, 118 boots of different vintage and 300 pairs of gloves. “Sometimes we forget the details – the slings, the canteens, the belts, the shoelaces. All that’s important,” Barton said. The idea emerged after a friend asked if he had extra camouflage uniforms. Barton had already been stirred by an image of young Ukrainian men, clad in knee pads to fight Russian troops, and videos of Russians firing at the press. “I said hold on, not just that, could you guys use knee pads? Could you guys use belts?” he said. “I have tactical gear, and I have it by the bucket-full.” Barton was soon heading to Ventura county, where his company houses its inventory of gear from military base stores and third-party contractors, including phased-out colors and equipment for each branch of the military. “My neighbors kept coming by like, ‘Are you planning for war?’ I’m like, ‘I’m giving it to Ukraine.’ They flipped out,” Barton said. Barton has made a living advising Hollywood since he first worked as a set extra and realized the uniforms weren’t authentic. He’s worked with actors including Aaron Eckhart and Chris Hemsworth, and his credits include NCIS and Criminal Minds. “When you’ve got a character using weapons … you want them to have adequate training, and the really important thing that Jon brings to table is that he understands it’s not the military – these actors are playing a role and you can’t treat each one the same way,” said producer Gale Ann Hurd, who first met Barton on the set of Punisher: War Zone. It’s not about putting a gun in someone’s hand, he said – it’s about authentically bridging fantasy and reality. “You could tune in Friday night at 9pm and watch JAG, but it didn’t look like CBS News at 7. What fantasy world are you living in?” he said. Now, fantasy and reality are colliding again, and the threat of world war, or nuclear fallout, usually reserved for the big screen, feels close to home, he said. “A lot of people don’t get too scared about this, but the marine in me used to sit through classified briefings and seeing satellite imagery,” he said. There’s a part of him, too, that wishes he were there. “My kneejerk reaction is always, let’s go in there, kick some ass,” Barton said. “And then I think about it and [realize], we can’t do that because this and this, and then the politics come into play and I totally get that.” He also knows his involvement isn’t without professional risk. Barton has noticed some clients aren’t returning his phone calls. “I’m less desirable to be hired on to a show where they try to take an apolitical stance, even though I’m not doing anything political,” he said. “I’m just trying to help humans.” Still, Barton hopes larger film studios will follow his lead and donate their fleet of gear. “Some of these prop companies have acres and acres of equipment, especially just uniforms and boots, something that we wouldn’t even bat an eye at in the film industry,” he said. “Oh, it’s just costumes.” They say costumes, he said. “I say uniforms.”",News/World news,US veteran ships Hollywood military gear for real-life use in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/us-veteran-ships-film-set-military-equipment-ukraine
3/13/2022,"Look, I don’t want to appear mean, but I really feel that I must call out Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister. He was being interviewed by Matt Frei on Channel 4 News last week about events in Ukraine and he began nearly all his replies to a question with the word “look”. It became so annoying that I failed fully to listen to his answers, which could of course have been his intention. It was only marginally less irritating than those who respond to a question with “so”. Talking of Ukraine, I was reading Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in the Telegraph last week and he dropped this one in my lap: “Will Russia’s patriotic generals agree to devastate the Varangian cradle of Kievan Mother Rus with cluster bombs? I doubt it.” Varangian cradle? Completely new to me. Further research unearthed the following: “The principality of Kyiv was founded on the location of contemporary Kyiv in the ninth century by Viking warrior-traders from Scandinavia (also called Varangians or Rus) who mixed with the local east Slavic population.” Fascinating stuff and I’m grateful to Evans-Pritchard for pointing it out. And as a mere aside to Ukraine, a friend pointed out an interesting development in pub talk. Had I, he asked, noticed how, a year ago, every bar bore was a world-leading epidemiologist or immunologist, but now they are some of the foremost military tacticians? And it’s true. I listened to a couple of men last week who would have given Carl von Clausewitz or Sun Tzu a run for their money. I wrote last week about great jobs I have missed out on, in that case “scenic ager” (someone who makes set scenes look older). Now another one has popped up – dark sky officer. This is a person who monitors light pollution, especially, it seems, in national parks. As I often have trouble sleeping, I think this could be just the job for me. When I’m not monitoring Dominic Raab’s speech patterns, that is.

3/13/2022,"Night had fallen, and so had inches of snow. It was 21 December 2009 and Deborah Strazza, managing director of the John Lewis department store in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, had just realised what she had to do. The now 56-year-old made her way to the store’s Tannoy system and broadcast an announcement: could the customers and staff remaining in the building please gather in the restaurant? Outside, the roads were frozen and gridlocked and a supermarket delivery lorry had jack-knifed across the car park, trapping the parked cars within. About 50 customers and 50 members of staff were now snowed in at the department store – and they were going to have to stay the night. In front of the sports section and underneath the thrum of the yellow ceiling lights, employees set to work pulling sheets on to duvets and fluffing pillows on back-to-back rows of display beds. Someone from the electronics department set up a PlayStation to entertain the children as soft animals made their way over from the toy section into the loving arms of younger kids. Deborah made toast and coffee while a few customers popped to a nearby supermarket for toothbrushes and toothpaste (and a bottle of whisky). It was an idle fantasy made real – for many of the children, a dream come true. Except the heating was off. Who among us hasn’t traipsed the aisles of a big supermarket and fantasised about spending the night? Your survival instincts would leave you with no choice other than to tear open giant bags of crisps. You’d have to pull down games and magazines to pass the time, and it would only be right to sit in a trolley and launch yourself across the squeaky floor. The same is true, of course, of department stores and sweet shops and theme parks… The question of what it would be like to be trapped in a public space has been answered by various pieces of pop culture (from romcom Career Opportunities in 1991, to an episode of the sitcom Superstore in 2019). But come on, what’s it really, truly, actually like? Is it as good as it seems? Bizarrely, there were multiple such lock-ins in November and December 2021. On 1 November, 30,000 visitors were held inside Shanghai Disneyland after one guest tested positive for Covid and fireworks lit up the sky as workers in hazmat suits handed out swabs. A month later, customers and staff were snowed inside a Danish Ikea and hunkered down on showroom beds. A week after that, 61 pub-goers spent a long weekend in the Tan Hill Inn in Yorkshire after a snowstorm. Yet Deborah Strazza did it first, more than a decade ago. “Your brain naturally, over the years, gets rid of all the bad stuff; you only remember the good stuff,” says Deborah, who lives in St Albans and now runs her own company, Galyna HR. One of her fondest memories is of a little boy who didn’t want to part with the teddy he’d been given the next morning – she let him take it home. Deborah was also proud to see her staff come together in a crisis. And then there were the two total strangers who’d volunteered to walk to the supermarket for supplies – they phoned a couple of days later and revealed that they were now boyfriend and girlfriend (yes, they were the ones who bought the whisky). But actually – on second thoughts – Deborah can remember a lot of bad stuff, too. “At the time, I didn’t think it was fun at all, because you were just thinking, ‘Am I doing the right thing?’” Deborah says, explaining she was worried about health and safety. Though she lay down on one of the beds, she quickly realised she couldn’t sleep and instead spent the night in the restaurant. The store’s heating had automatically switched off, so the building was freezing. Then news crews arrived at 6am and Deborah balked when a presenter fretted about her makeup. “You just think, ‘I’ve been up all night and you’re worried about your lipstick!’” Plus, as cute as wide-eyed babes with teddy bears are, Deborah wanted to get home to her own daughter, who was worried about her mum. Almost 12 years later, Ikea manager Peter Elmose had a parallel experience when heavy snowfall trapped six customers and 25 staff in his store in Aalborg, Demark. He called his regional manager and made the decision to host the impromptu sleepover. But unlike Deborah, Peter didn’t have to shiver in the cold – workers were already scheduled to work in the warehouse overnight, so overall things were less daunting. Looking back, the 53-year-old says he has no complaints. “I think it’s better than fantasy, actually,” Peter says when asked if the experience lived up to our daydreams. “I think we fulfilled the imagination of how it would be to sleep in an Ikea store – there was no disappointment in that.” Everyone gathered in the staff canteen for cinnamon buns, hot chocolate and coffee, before playing card games, listening to music and watching football on TV. “Everybody went to bed between 11pm and 1am,” Peter says, describing the whole thing as “cosy” with “a good mood and atmosphere”. The night was such a success that co- workers who were safe at home later expressed their jealousy that they had missed out. Yet Deborah and Peter and their charges were all lucky. The snow cleared overnight and everyone made an early morning escape. Becky Longthorp, one of the customers trapped in the Tan Hill Inn last December, was not so fortunate. For a fateful Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, she slept on the pub’s floor alongside her partner Gary, dog Charlie, and tens of other punters. “Oh God, it was cramped,” recalls the 36-year-old east Yorkshire beauty therapist. “We had Charlie on a tight leash, but he was licking somebody else’s face who was lying next to us in the morning.” The Tan Hill is Britain’s highest pub, and revellers who’d gone to see an Oasis tribute band were trapped in the aftermath of Storm Arwen. After a night spent on the floor using the inn’s spare sheets and blankets, everyone was hungover but “giddy”. Becky says some customers ordered double Bloody Marys, downing four each by 8.30am. The staff called a meeting in their wedding venue barn and implemented a “no alcohol before lunch” rule. Night fell again and it was still too dangerous to leave. Becky and Gary were dressed in winterwear and had a change of clothes because they had originally intended to camp outside the pub so, unlike others in their high heels and stylish jackets, they were able to go for short walks. A routine started: in the mornings, people seemed anxious but, by lunch, the mood improved. In the evenings, people played dominos, drank and took turns on two guitars. “We just embraced it,” she says. But as the days wore on, the novelty wore off. “It’s like being at a party and then you’re stuck at the party,” Becky explains. “You have no space. We couldn’t get any privacy. The panic, I suppose, came on Sunday.” In four days, Becky managed to have just one shower – and convinced her boyfriend to give her his spare pants. Both frequently struggled to sleep as revellers drank until 4am. But by far the worse bit was the cost – combined, Becky and Gary spent £700. “They did a buffet one night and they did discount the food, but we still spent so much. On night one, I spent more than £100 because we got there at 4pm. We had dinner, we had loads of drinks. And the menu isn’t cheap,” Becky explains. Three more days of alcohol, soft drinks, regular meals and snacks added up – when the fresh food started to deplete, staff began serving freezer foods, such as scampi and chips. Seeing “Tan Hill Inn” over and over on her bank statements still makes Becky want to cry, but overall she’s happy she had the once-in-a-lifetime experience. “I think it depends on who you are as a person,” she says. “Our personalities suited it.” By his own admission, Dan Davis did not suit getting locked inside a Kmart supermarket one Sunday last August. Dan – a 29-year-old who reviews tech on his YouTube channel DansTube.TV – was trapped in the Brisbane store after closing. He’d forgotten it was Sunday and had arrived just after the closing announcements. Dan was picking up candles and pyjamas for his girlfriend when suddenly it went dark. “I put my phone light on and turned the corner and saw the gates were down,” he says. “I started to panic and began shouting out to anyone in the store.” No one was there. Dan began jogging through the shop and met a security guard on the other side of the gates. “He didn’t reassure me. That was kind of terrifying,” Dan says, explaining the man said he’d be clocking off soon. When Dan later shared the story of his ordeal on social media, people said he should have ridden a bike down the aisles. But, says Dan, “I really didn’t even have any moment of, ‘What can I do? What can I check out?’ I just wanted to get out.” The creaking and clicking air conditioning unit started to make him feel he was in a horror film. Eventually, motion sensors alerted the manager of his presence and she returned to let Dan out. His imprisonment had lasted just 40 minutes. In reality, it seems, being locked somewhere isn’t an invitation to do whatever you like and mobile phones mean that “Sorry, I ate the entire biscuit aisle to survive” no longer cuts it as an excuse. Yet Erin Westgate, a psychology professor at the University of Florida who studies boredom and daydreams, says we continue to have lock-in fantasies because it’s fundamentally escapist to imagine “experiencing familiar environments in unfamiliar ways”. “We tend to daydream about the things we already do in everyday life,” Westgate explains. “One study found that about 54% of daydreams were linked to something about the environment people were in at the time.” But research into “affective forecasting” has found that nothing is quite as good as we expect, while “construal level theory” posits that we think of distant things in theoretical ways. “When we imagine events in the far-off future (or the imaginary future, in the case of daydreaming) we tend to focus on abstract high-level aspects of the experience – for example, ‘It would be so freeing!’ – and neglect the concrete details – ‘It’s very cold in this supermarket and I don’t have a coat’,” Westgate says. Still, our fantasies aren’t going anywhere, and businesses now play into them, selling sleepovers in museums and aquariums. On social media, faked “trapped in a supermarket for 24 hours!” videos rack up millions of views. But for those who’ve made fantasy a reality, once was enough. “We had a lot of people the following year saying, ‘Are you going to do a sleepover?’” Deborah says, “and I was thinking, ‘You have no idea! We are never going to do this again!’”",News/Business,Living the dream: what’s a sleepover inside a supermarket really like?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/13/living-the-dream-what-is-a-sleepover-inside-a-supermarket-really-like
3/13/2022,"It was freezing cold the day Neil Laybourn saw a man in a T-shirt sitting on a high ledge on Waterloo Bridge and made a split-second decision that would change both their lives for ever. “It’s hard to pin down what it was that made me stop… but it would have played on my mind if I hadn’t,” he said. “That’s not how you live your life is it? You don’t just walk past when you see someone in need.” On that January morning in London’s rush hour, hundreds of other people were doing exactly that. But Laybourn didn’t and – it turned out the man, Jonny Benjamin, was contemplating suicide. Six years later he would launch a campaign to find and thank Laybourn for persuading him down off that ledge. The two of them now give talks on mental health issues and suicide prevention together. Looking back now on that day, Laybourn says: “It’s made me much more aware of how important it is to put the amount of kindness you have in you, out into the world.” But what is it, exactly, that makes us kind? Why are some of us kinder than others – and what stops us from being kinder? The Kindness Test, a major new study involving more than 60,000 people from 144 different countries, has been looking into these and other questions. Launched on BBC Radio 4 and devised by the University of Sussex, it is believed to be the largest public study of kindness ever carried out in the world. The results, which are currently the subject of a three-part Radio 4 documentary The Anatomy of Kindness, suggest that people who receive, give or even just notice more acts of kindness tend to experience higher levels of wellbeing and life satisfaction. Other encouraging findings are that as many as two-thirds of people think the pandemic has made people kinder and nearly 60% of participants in the study claimed to have received an act of kindness in the previous 24 hours. “It is a big part of human nature, to be kind – because it’s such a big part of how we connect with people and how we have relationships,” says Claudia Hammond, visiting professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Sussex and presenter of the documentary. “It’s a win-win situation, because we like receiving kindness, but we also like being kind.” Our desire to be kind is actually quite selfish, on one level, she explains. Because we have evolved to have empathy, we have all sorts of “ulterior motives” for being kind – the chief one being that it makes us feel good. “We know from brain research, there is a warm fuzzy feeling that people feel straight away. But also, it gives you the sense that you are a kind person who cares about other people. And we want to be good, we want to feel good about ourselves and what we are like.” Your religious beliefs and your values system also help to determine how kind you are, the study shows. “We found those who believed benevolence was important were more likely to give than those who believed power and achievement were more important.” People who have been told they should be kind are naturally more likely to notice opportunities to be kind: “They have expectations, which might be the expectations of their religious teachings or it might be the expectations of those around them,” Hammond says. This may be one of the reasons why women who filled in the study’s online questionnaire were more likely to report being kind, receiving kindness and seeing kindness. Women may feel that they ought to report performing acts of kindness, because caring for people and comforting them is traditionally seen as a more “feminine” activity, she says. For this reason, Hammond is concerned about the use of the hashtag #BeKind on social media. “It’s sometimes used to shut women down from talking, to suggest they can’t hold an opinion, because they’ve got to ‘be kind’. And obviously we want social media to be a kinder place. But if kindness then gets weaponised and used to stop people talking, then I think that’s a worry.” While boys wear slogans like ‘born to win’, messages like ‘be kind’ and ‘kindness always wins’ litter young girls’ clothing . Hammond questions how much girls are stereotypically being taught, at a young age, to be caring – and whether that puts an unequal amount of pressure on girls to be kind as they grow up. “What I would hope is that boys are being taught to be nurturing too.” Overall, the study suggests the greatest predictor of how kind you are to others – and how kind they are to you – is not your gender, but your personality. People who scored high on extraversion, openness to new experiences and agreeableness self-reported giving and receiving more kindness, as did people who talk to strangers. The reason for this may simply be that these people have more confidence to be kind, Hammond says. The most common barrier to kindness reported by British people in the study was a fear that their behaviour would be misinterpreted. “You need confidence to be able to offer kindness and to face the possibility that your offer of kindness may be rejected. And people may be happier to do that, and talk to strangers, if they are extroverted.” To get over this fear of misinterpretation, Hammond recommends you remind yourself how amazing it can feel to receive an act of kindness. “When we asked people how they felt, they said warm and happy and grateful and loved and pleased.” Luke Cameron, dubbed the “nicest man in Britain”, once spent a year doing a good deed every day to raise money for 45 different charities. It taught him that sometimes offering some help, reassurance or a kind word can make a huge difference to strangers. “It’s made me more aware of things that happen in front of me. If someone falls over in the street, there’s always going to be people who go and help and others who stand back. It’s made me one of those people who go and help. Consciously, I now just do it.” He became that person, he says, after a “mindset shift” where he realised: “Actually, if it was me, I’d want somebody to help me. That makes you think differently about how you are with people.” Like Laybourn and Hammond, Cameron says that you have a choice when you interact with people – and the more you try to find opportunities to be kind, the easier it gets. “It was actually the small things that I found were the most impactful,” he says. For example, he once bought coffee for a woman who looked sad in a Costa Coffee shop and invited her to sit with him. She thanked him, saying no one had been kind to her like that in a while, and then poured her heart out to him about her friend, who was really struggling with cancer. As she left, he realised she was wearing a wig and her eyebrows had been drawn on. “It dawned on me, she was the one going through cancer and she needed somebody to talk to about what she was going through. So she spoke to a complete stranger.” He will never forget their conversation and its impact on him. “That will always stay with me.” Talking to strangers makes us feel more connected with each other, says Hammond: “People often think that conversations with strangers are quick and shallow and saying hello to someone in a shop doesn’t really matter. But actually it does. All of these things are received kindly by other people because they connect us. And connection is everything.”",News/Science,Cool to be kind: being nice is good for us – so why don’t we all do it?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/13/cool-to-be-kind-being-nice-is-good-for-us-so-why-dont-we-all-do-it
3/13/2022,"The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has defended the Evening Standard proprietor, Evgeny Lebedev, after fresh questions were raised about the prime minister’s decision to nominate him for a peerage. The Sunday Times reported that the security services had concerns about Lebedev, whose father was a KGB agent, as far back as 2013, with the then head of MI6, John Sawers, refusing to meet him. Boris Johnson has been accused of brushing off security concerns, raised by the House of Lords appointments commission, to press ahead with nominating Lebedev as a Tory peer. He had developed a close relationship with Lebedev, attending parties at his Italian castle, including when he was foreign secretary. Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Gove appeared to suggest to reopen the question of the peerage would be to play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. “I think one of the things that Vladimir Putin would like us to do, is to have an approach in the UK that said that everyone of Russian ancestry was somehow persona non grata,” he said. He added that no one had previously raised concerns with him about Lebedev. “I have met Lord Lebedev, in public, and nobody has ever suggested to me that that was wrong,” Gove said. “He’s made clear through the pages of the Evening Standard, the newspaper of which he is a proprietor, that he wholeheartedly disapproves of this conflict. He’s been critical of Vladimir Putin’s actions.” Johnson rejected the idea he had overruled security concerns to push through Lebedev’s nomination last week, calling it “simply incorrect”. However, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has written to the House of Lords appointments commission to ask what advice it provided when Johnson sought to nominate Lebedev. Starmer wrote: “I understand that the role of the commission has never been to publicise the advice it provides on political nominees but reports of the political views, personal links, and financial interests of Lord Lebedev are deeply troubling.” In the aftermath of the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, Lebedev approvingly tweeted a Daily Mail article asking whether MI6 had some involvement, saying: “Was Litvinenko murdered by MI6?… Certainly more to it than the generally accepted Putin link.” Starmer wrote: “The accusations made by Lord Lebedev that the British security services had any involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is insulting. I have seen first-hand the real impact of Russian interference in Britain and the difficulties prosecutors encounter when dealing with those who act on behalf of Putin. This is clearly a matter for national security.” Lebedev robustly defended his record on Friday, saying he was “not some agent of Russia”, and suggested the fresh scrutiny of his situation amounted to “Russophobia”. “Being Russian does not automatically make one an enemy of the state, and it is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,” he said.",News/Media,Gove defends Evgeny Lebedev after new questions raised about peerage,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/13/michael-gove-defends-evgeny-lebedev-new-questions-raised-about-peerage
3/13/2022,"A massive expansion of wind farms across the UK is now needed for national security reasons, the business secretary has declared, as, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the government considers sweeping changes to planning laws to improve Britain’s energy independence. Boris Johnson is planning to unveil a radical new “energy strategy” within a fortnight to ensure the UK can meet its domestic needs from a mix of renewables and nuclear. The war in Ukraine has brought further huge rises in global fossil fuel prices and exposed countries’ dependence on overseas supplies. Remarkably, the need for more on- and offshore windfarms – traditionally a highly controversial subject in the Conservative party – is now being talked about within government as a matter of security, rather than a way of fighting climate change. Renewables such as wind and solar power are expected to be part of the new government strategy to free Britain from dependence on imported oil and gas and spare households and businesses from the effects of wild fluctuations on global energy markets. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said last week on Twitter: “This is no longer about tackling climate change or reaching net-zero targets. Ensuring the UK’s clean energy independence is a matter of national security. Putin can set the price of gas, but he can’t directly control the price of renewables and nuclear we generate in the UK.” Official figures show that meeting net-zero targets would lead to a drop in gas use of 65% by 2035 in the UK, and almost 100% by 2050. While some Tory MPs also want the moratorium on fracking for shale gas to be lifted to help reduce dependence on imports, cabinet sources said there was no realistic prospect of doing so in the short term, until the process had been proved to be demonstrably safe. Instead a majority of cabinet ministers back a big push for more renewables and an expansion of nuclear. Johnson said last week that all oil imports from Russia would be phased out by the end of this year. In the UK, 4% of gas and 8% of oil currently comes from Russia. The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil. Sources said changes to planning rules that would make it easier to build windfarms are likely to be announced as part of the new energy strategy. Construction has tailed off since David Cameron tightened regulations when he was prime minister: at the moment local residents can easily block such plans. It is also understood that the government may ease the way for more offshore wind farms, in the teeth of opposition from the fishing industry. Other countries are also using security issues raised by the Ukraine crisis to push urgently for more green and clean energy. Germany’s government announced last week an additional €30bn for its clean energy transition in response to the invasion. Christian Lindner, the finance minister, described renewables as “freedom energies” that could allow Germany a greater degree of energy independence and transform “the economy, society and the state”. Labour has called for an urgent “national sprint” to build a clean, green, secure energy future including more renewables. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said last week: “Energy security is national security. Homegrown, clean power is the cheaper, more secure route to energy security and sovereignty.” In 2020 renewables generated 43 per cent of Britain’s electricity while gas, oil and coal contributed about 40 per cent. The remaining capacity was filled by nuclear. In October last year Johnson announced that all of Britain’s electricity will come from clean energy sources by 2035. The plan now is to bring that date forward. While many Conservative MPs and party members have opposed windfarms, there are signs of growing support. Kevin Hollinrake, Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton, said: “England’s planning system has blocked nearly all new onshore wind developments in the past five years, despite this being the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Reforming these rules, while ensuring communities still get a meaningful say, will spur investment in homegrown clean energy and accelerate our transition away from expensive fossil fuels.” Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, an independent forum for Tories who back decarbonisation, commented: “Streamlining planning approvals and regulations would unleash more wind and solar projects to provide cheap, clean, homegrown power. Now is the time to accelerate the drive towards net zero and away from volatile fossil fuels.”",News/Environment,Tories plan big expansion of wind farms ‘to protect national security’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/13/tories-plan-big-expansion-of-wind-farms-to-protect-national-security
3/13/2022,"The Ipcress File (ITV) | ITV HubThe Witchfinder (BBC Two / iPlayerServant of the People (Channel 4) | All 4Storyville: Writing With Fire (BBC Four) | iPlayer With remakes, the question has to be: has anything inspiring been achieved or are we just being served reheated dinner with a sprig of limp parsley on top? I kept this in mind while watching ITV’s The Ipcress File, the six-part cold war spy thriller adapted from Len Deighton’s 1962 novel, directed by James Watkins, scripted by John Hodge (Trainspotting). It stars Joe Cole (Peaky Blinders) as Harry Palmer, the working-class, culturally literate, culinary minded intelligence agent, a role first inhabited, with textured brilliance, by Michael Caine in the 1965 film. Now, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this new TV take on a story about nuclear threat arrives imbued with disturbing resonance. I don’t know about you, but, personally, lines such as: “It seems more and more likely every day that we’re all very shortly going to be blown to smithereens” aren’t landing as period-piece fancy. The challenge facing The Ipcress File is to nod to the film without becoming so drenched in homage it starts reeking of cheap aftershave. Palmer keeps the signature nerd-core spectacles and mac, and, as in the film, camera angles tilt, peep and crouch with arty abandon. The basic plot – a nuclear scientist is kidnapped – is retained, with tweaks. Palmer’s military grifter backstory is given airtime, while other characters gain prominence: fellow agent Jean Courtney (Lucy Boynton) becomes a proto-feminist It girl with a splash of Lady Penelope. A black CIA operative (Ashley Thomas) doesn’t shy from referring to the rarity of his appointment. As arch-spook Dalby, Tom Hollander delivers the best kind of uber-establishment human bowler hat, giving a clipped masterclass in received pronunciation and wry smackdowns. Still, it all hangs on the leading man. First thought on Cole: he’s just too young looking, too choirboy-pretty; you keep expecting him to sweetly burst into the Hallelujah Chorus. However, a couple of episodes in, I’m finding that he’s sneaking into the role, like a cat through a side window. It’s all in the cocky backchat, the crackles of masked intelligence, the wary glints; the acknowledgment that whatever else is going on in cold war Britain, for Palmer, surfing the class system is part of it. I watched all six episodes of new BBC Two comedy The Witchfinder, as if I could somehow magic up an improvement, to no avail. Written and directed by Neil and Rob Gibbons, who did the cracking This Time With Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan acts as script consultant on The Witchfinder), and starring Tim Key (Partridge’s sidekick) and Daisy May Cooper (This Country), it’s set in East Anglia in 1645, during the murderous persecution of women as witches. Which, obviously, is no laughing matter, and yet, in black comedy terms, there is no reason why it shouldn’t be. There aren’t nearly enough jokes in The Witchfinder, and Key and Cooper struggle to find comic chemistry. Key’s Gideon, a small-time witchfinder, trying to scale the career ladder, is (deliberately) low wattage, while Cooper’s Thomasine – a local woman accused of sorcery, taken to be tried in Chelmsford – is a raging bonfire. Both are talented performers, but every scene they do together leaves Key reduced to cinders. Elsewhere, it’s teeming with talent (Daniel Rigby, Jessica Hynes, Julian Barratt, to name a few), but the whole thing is scuppered by the dated timidity of the approach. The Witchfinder could have been The Crucible restyled with a British eye-roll – a pithy, backdated skewering of 17th-century misogyny. Instead, it’s a basic odd couple yarn played out against a backdrop of weirdly half-hearted femicide. As the nightmare in Ukraine continues, an unmissable television curio emerges. Most will know of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s showbiz past: the comedy troupe; dubbing the voice of Paddington Bear; winning Ukraine’s Dancing With the Stars. Now Channel 4 is airing the opening episodes of Servant of the People, the 2015 comedy that paved the way for Zelenskiy’s election, taking the series name for his political party. Zelenskiy plays Vasiliy, a put-upon teacher whose diatribe against political corruption – “These bastards come to power and steal and steal” – is filmed by a student and goes viral, leading to him becoming president. From there, it’s all pointed satire as he and his family adjust to riches and power. In the main, Servant… is clever and witty, with surreal flashes (Abraham Lincoln appears in a vision), but there are also sobering meta-moments. When Vasiliy practises meeting world leaders with lookalikes, he snaps at the Vladimir Putin doppelganger: “Get lost, move it!” On the night it aired, Channel 4 also showed Zelenskiy: The Man Who Took on Putin, a short, punchy documentary exploring Zelenskiy’s origins and mindset. Arguably, this also comes through in Servant of the People’s comic fiction, such as when Vasiliy tells the nation sombrely: “What you do must never make you feel ashamed as you look in your kids’ eyes.” With Zelenskiy and his fellow Ukrainians still imperilled, Servant of the People is uneasy viewing. At the same time it feels important: a valuable hint at the unchanging core of the Ukrainian president. BBC Four’s Storyville: Writing With Fire, the directorial debut of couple Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh, is a feature-length documentary that won the audience award for world cinema documentary at the 2021 Sundance film festival and has been nominated for an Oscar. It focuses on Khabar Lahariya (meaning: waves of news), the only Indian newspaper run by Dalit women, who are considered so untouchable they’re not even part of the caste system. The film follows the reporters – including Meera Devi, Suneeta Prajapati and Shyamkali Devi – as Khabar Lahariya develops a digital platform that rises to 150m views. The trio cover rape, illegal mine collapses, political corruption, and much more, and are often the only reporters people trust. This is a stunning multilayered documentary, giving a true sense of the women, the dangers of their work, and the sights and sounds of India.

3/13/2022,"Henrik Larsson has spoken about the chaotic 15 months he spent at Barcelona as assistant manager, criticising the club president Joan Laporta for a lack of leadership over the handling of Ronald Koeman. The Swede, who made two assists as Barcelona came from behind to beat Arsenal in the 2006 Champions League, joined the club’s coaching staff in August 2020 and was there for a period that included the pandemic, a change of president and the departure of Lionel Messi. “Of course it was turbulent,” he told Swedish website fotbollskanalen. “During the first season it was all good until March when we lost to Granada at home. After that we felt that there was less support from upstairs, after Laporta become president. And that is how it continued until the summer. We went on our summer holidays and I didn’t know whether I would carry on the following season. “We got a decision on that very late. That’s a shame. For me it doesn’t matter too much but to treat Ronald Koeman like that, he did not deserve that. After all the work we had done, the clean out that Ronald had done to make things possible, then I don’t think he deserved not being told [about his future].” Larsson, who helped look after the young players coming through, as well as all the forwards, says that Messi leaving the club obviously had a big effect on everyone at the club, but that it could have been handled better. “You never thought that Messi would leave the club and it had an effect on the whole squad. It was a tough time but as a coach you have to try to turn off the outside noise and know that you are there to work. There were days when [we] went there and didn’t know whether it was our last or whether we would continue. That could have been easily avoided but that would have demanded much better leadership than what Laporta showed.” Several young players came through under Koeman and Larsson is confident that the work he and the Dutchman did has given Barcelona something to develop. “There were a lot of players Koeman and I promoted to the first team, players who will be great for Barcelona in the future. Ronald did a fantastic job in giving young players a chance. He has given Barcelona a good foundation to build on.”",Sport/Football,Henrik Larsson hits out at Barcelona over treatment of Ronald Koeman,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/henrik-larsson-hits-out-at-barcelona-over-treatment-of-ronald-koeman
3/13/2022,"Our lives are shaped by the genes, and increasingly the wealth, we inherit from our parents. But there’s also a lot of research showing that parents pass something else on to us – politics. Why did it take the convulsions of Brexit to make older homeowners in the “red wall” – identical to Tory voters elsewhere – vote Conservative? In part because their parents voted Labour. Now, fascinating new research focusing on Germany and Switzerland adds a great twist to this well-known story: the passing on of ideological political preferences is different between sons and daughters. Sons are equally likely to inherit political preferences from their parents whether leftwing or rightwing. But daughters are much less likely to take on their parents’ rightwing tendencies. So women’s politics are being developed outside the home. In the UK, far more women go to university (45% of 18-year-old women went in 2021 as against 32% of men); while in Germany and Switzerland the research author notes the left’s growing focus on gender equality. Behind this sits a trend across rich democracies: women used to be more conservative than men, but that has changed – particularly for younger women: in 2019, the Conservative lead in the UK among men was three times that among women. Now this might not seem fair, since conservatives normally care a lot more about passing things on to the next generation; at least, judging by attitudes to inheritance tax. But it looks as though they’re destined to be outfoxed by lefty parents who have an advantage in terms of passing on their political preferences. Yes, the Conservatives have been in power in the UK for 30 of the past 43 years, but progressives of an optimistic bent can hold on to this thought: politics is a long game.

3/13/2022,"Before I go any further, I want to say I love reading. My son loves reading. And World Book Day is, I presume, meant to promote reading, which is an unassailable good. That said, the practice of manifesting this love of reading through a fancy-dress costume is not one I cherish. Last week, like millions of other parents, I had to do precisely this. I’m not a naturally arts ’n’ crafts- type person and, unlike seemingly every other parent, I don’t have a hamper filled with fancy- dress outfits, any of which could be repurposed into a literary allusion. Whenever I see other people posting their kids’ laboriously constructed outfits, I wonder how long they’ve been planning this and what support they’ve received from the estate of famous authors to do so. I, on the other hand, get a text about World Book Day two days before it arrives, and immediately forget what books are, and how clothes work. Luckily, his favourite new book is a retelling of Rudyard Kipling’s How The Rhinoceros Got His Skin, with illustrations by Miles Kelly. My son likes it because its central message is: ‘Rhinos have no manners’ and, because he also has no manners, this allows him to do unmannerly things while screaming: ‘I have no mannnnnnners!’ We were glad to have a creature to aim for, since it’s hard to dress up as a book character. A lot of the more recognisable characters are very difficult to recreate. I’m not against just buying a Gruffalo or spaceman costume, but we didn’t have the time. Also, most protagonists in books are just regular people, which you can’t do. It’s all well and good to know I’m within my rights to send him off as the spitting image of the little boy in There’s a House In Mummy’s Tummy, but I can’t help feeling it’s against the spirit of the thing. I did entertain ideas of using the entire enterprise as a way to flog my own book by making a cutesy costume out of its premise; I dunno, maybe 10 dolls’ heads stuck to his jumper to represent my siblings, or an elaborately devised tableau of the Troubles stitched into a jaunty hat. This I could package in a jokey tweet, which would be cute, funny and an entirely mercenary bit of book promo, but my wife vetoed it, since she has a lot more class but, it should be remembered, fewer Twitter followers than I do. Turning him into a rhino meant my wife painting a party hat grey so it would resemble an improvised horn. His thick rhino hide was recreated by off-white chinos and an inside-out jumper (with the labels snipped off, thankyouverymuch). Finally, I painted a little watercolour of a rhino which he stuck to his chest, just like rhinos do in the wild. He didn’t look like a rhino so much as someone very much hoping you’d notice he’s dressed like a rhino, but we’d be happy if you didn’t mention it. Have you no manners?

3/13/2022,"Google is profiting from ads promoting “instant” cash and loans delivered “faster than pizza” despite a pledge to ​protect users from “deceptive and harmful” financial products. The ads were served to people in the UK who searched terms like “quick money now” and “need money help”​ and directed users to ​firms offering high-interest loans. One, listed in Google search results above links to the government website and debt charities, promised “cash in ten minutes guaranteed” for people with “very bad credit”. The Advertising Standards Authority said last night that it was assessing​ 24 ads identified by the Observer​, paid for by 12 advertisers including loan firms and credit brokers as well as suspected scam artists. ​The regulator said many ​of the promotions w​ere likely to break ​rules on socially responsible advertising which say ads must not “trivialise” taking out loans. “A disproportionate emphasis on speed and ease of access compared to interest rates is likely to be considered problematic,” its guidance says. ​Google said the ads flagged with it violated its policies and had been removed. It previously pledged to tackle “predatory” lending promotions​, banning ​ads for payday and high-interest loans in 2016. The promotions appeared to clearly breach its policy, referring explicitly to “payday loans” and linking to websites offering​ ultra-high interest rates of up to 1721%. Many of the ads Google removed on Friday had been replaced by similar promotions within hours, some from the same advertisers flagged by the Observer. This comes in the midst of a growing cost of living crisis, described by the Institute for Fiscal Studies as the worst financial squeeze in 60 years.​Households are battling price rises on several fronts, including surging energy bills, grocery costs and petrol and diesel prices, compounded by disruption and supply chain issues caused by the pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukraine. Charities and anti-debt campaigners said such loans could trap people struggling financially, who might apply on impulse and become “trapped in a spiral”. Adam Butler, policy manager at the debt charity StepChange, said financially vulnerable people were most likely to be drawn in “due to a total lack of borrowing alternatives”. “Repeated use of these kinds of products to make ends meet – often the reason people turn to this kind of borrowing – can trap people in a spiral it’s very difficult to get out of,” ​he said. “With the cost of living crisis set to escalate further in the coming months, there’s every chance we will see a rise in the number of people forced to turn to this kind of borrowing just to get by.” Many of the promotions appeared to be targeted deliberately at people in financial trouble, with messages like “bad credit welcome”. They suggested there would be little scrutiny with messages such as “no credit check” and “no call”. One ad​ said: “Instant payday loans paid in 10 minutes. Bad credit OK, credit history irrelevant.” Another firm​ described available loans as suitable for “little emergencies”. Another website, Tendo Loan – one of the most prolific advertisers – claimed to be offering: “Cash in 10 minutes guaranteed. 3-36 months. No credit check!” It added: “Loan delivered faster than pizza! 2 mins to apply and 10 mins to deposit to your account. Apply 24/7.” Tendo Loan did not respond to requests for comment​. ​The Financial Conduct Authority ​said​ ads suggesting loans were “guaranteed” or involved “no credit checks” were misleading. It said firms should not make claims that were “not true, such as suggesting credit is available regardless of a customer’s financial circumstances or status”, and that they could face enforcement action. In some cases, ads appeared to be linked to scam websites, taking users to websites where they entered their personal details, including their bank information, phone number, date of birth and address. Yvonne Fovargue, chair of the ​A​ll-​P​arty ​Parliamentary​ Group on ​Debt and Personal Finance, described the ads as an “online harm” and called on Google and the government to tackle them. “It’s an obvious targeting ploy for people at the end of their tether ​who, instead of taking out a loan, should be seeking debt advice​,” she said. The ASA has previously ruled against payday lenders and said it was assessing the evidence of potential breaches. It added that while the “buck ultimately stops with the advertiser”, media platforms such as Google also “bear some responsibility for ensuring content complies with the rules”. “Platforms should and do take measures to ensure misleading and irresponsible ads are not published,” a spokesperson said. Google​ said: “We have strict ads policies in place regarding financial services products and prohibit ads for payday loans. We have a dedicated team working to protect users from malicious actors who try to evade detection. In 2020, we blocked or removed more than 123 million ads for violating our financial services policies.” Stella Creasy, an anti-payday loan campaigner and Labour MP for Walthamstow, described the firms offering ultrahigh interest, short-term loans as “legal loan sharks” who seek to “exploit” people’s financial difficulties. “​We need the government and the regulators to constantly remain vigilant and act to stop these companies before they make a bad situation worse for so man​y,” she said.",News/Technology,Google profiting from ‘predatory’ loan adverts promising instant cash,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/13/google-profiting-from-predatory-loan-adverts-promising-instant-cash
