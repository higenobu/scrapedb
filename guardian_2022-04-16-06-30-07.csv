4/16/2022,"Sale hit hard, hit often, and occasionally hit high. Their reward, having soaked up the self-inflicted damage caused by one red card and two yellows, is progress to the last eight of the Champions Cup. Arron Reed was sent off in the first half, Faf de Klerk and Nick Schonert were shown yellow cards either side of half-time, but the Sharks’ physicality and a late try by the captain, Jono Ross, proved enough to edge them past Bristol. An opening flurry of box kicking had suggested both teams would opt to eliminate risk as far as possible, but Sale’s scrummaging strength – combined with the incessant prompting of De Klerk – began to punch holes in Bristol’s defence. The Springboks scrum-half, rumoured to be heading for Japan when he leaves Sale in the summer, stole down the blindside with an opportunistic run before the Sharks hooker Akker van der Merwe sprinted on to kick ahead, straight down the middle, only to be kept out by some desperate Bristol defending. A smart 50-22 kick by the England No 9, Harry Randall, helped to arrest Sale’s momentum and, although the hosts spurned that opportunity, which was the first time they had threatened the opposing try-line, Jake Kerr soon bundled over thanks to a pop pass by the Bears wing Luke Morahan. The try was chalked off for a knock-on after a TMO check but, at the same time, De Klerk was sent to the sin bin for an early tackle on Fitz Harding. Callum Sheedy knocked over the conversion to open the scoring. Some lightning-fast competition at the breakdown by the prop Bevan Rodd allowed Rob du Preez to level it with a penalty at 3-3 and, when De Klerk emerged from the sin bin a few minutes later, it was Sale and their fearsome set of forwards in the ascendancy. Nathan Hughes was fortunate to avoid a yellow card himself as a Sale maul rolled towards the line. But Lood de Jager, another Sale Springbok, forced his way over for the first try of the night. The Sharks had taken a grip on the game but another card would soon interrupt their progress. After Reed’s reckless shoulder into the face of Bristol’s Morahan, cutting in off the right wing, the referee Frank Murphy adjourned to a big screen to assess the appropriate sanction. With every replay that appeared on screen, the wails and jeers grew louder from the Bristol fans, but regardless of the pressure that may have exerted, it was a clear sending off. A red card was duly produced from Murphy’s pocket. The score stood at 10-3 to Sale on the night and, in view of the ease with which the visitors had managed De Klerk’s yellow-card absence, there was reason to believe they would deal with a permanent one-man disadvantage. That was even more apparent when another beefy driving maul allowed Van der Merwe to peel off the side and dot down to make it 17-3 at half-time. When Bristol failed to gather the second-half restart, Manu Tuilagi and Jean-Luc du Preez combined to send Tom Roebuck over and gave the Sharks a 20-point lead in the tie. Schonert’s shoulder barge on Joe Joyce led to Sale’s second yellow card and Harry Thacker, the replacement hooker, narrowed the gap with Bristol’s first try. Down to 13, Sale began to look ragged – with Semi Radrada appearing from the bench for Bristol. Morahan stole over on the right thanks to a brilliant pass by Randall and Bristol, for the first time, believed, even more so when Joyce barrelled over as the match moved into the final quarter. Du Preez’s penalty edged Sale back in front, John Hawkins of Bristol was sent to the sin bin for a high hit, and Bristol’s spirited recovery was finally ended when a cross-kick went right and Ross’s try concluded a chaotic tie.",Sport/Sport,Late Jono Ross try helps Sale progress past Bristol in epic encounter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/late-jono-ross-try-helps-sale-progress-past-bristol-in-epic-encounter
4/16/2022,"Let us be honest, the Champions Cup tie between Leicester and Clermont is in effect over. The Premiership leaders produced one of the more remarkable away performances in European rugby last week, thrashing the Top 14 side 29-10, scoring five tries to one and maintaining their supremacy despite playing with 14 men for the final 20 minutes. Based on those events in the Auvergne, something spectacular and calamitous in equal measure would need to transpire at Welford Road on Saturday to prevent Leicester’s march into the next round. That is exactly what Clermont are banking on. “We believe we can do it. Why not?” asks JJ Hanrahan, Clermont’s Irish utility back. “We know no one outside the group gives us a chance. But you know what, that’s liberating in a way. We just want to go out there and give it our all. We owe it to the fans to give a better account of ourselves.” Their “below average” display, as Hanrahan describes it, stunned their usually boisterous home support at the Stade Marcel-Michelin. “Before the last 10 minutes, it was the best atmosphere I’ve seen since we beat Toulouse,” Hanrahan says, referencing a 16-13 win on New Year’s Day. “But that last 10 was chilling. You could see it hurt them. That’s affected us. We take ownership of that.” Leicester’s triumph was the first time a Premiership team had beaten Clermont on their own patch since Sale’s 32-15 win in 2008. It was achieved through simple rugby perfectly executed. A well-drilled lineout, a brutally efficient driving maul, well-worked clearing kicks and an insatiable hunger around the breakdown strangled the home side into submission. “They’re so clinical,” Hanrahan says. “They’re clearly coached very well. They’re so hard to play against. Even if we wanted to be more attacking, play more rugby, we couldn’t. We were not at our best but they put so much pressure on us. That’s not making excuses. We have to be better.” Hanrahan would not divulge trade secrets but intimated that they will look to close down Leicester’s relieving kickers and force their heavy forwards into a more open game. “That’s easier said than done,” Hanrahan admits, not least because of the man pulling the strings for the Tigers. George Ford is leaving for Sale at the end of the season but if this Leicester squad manage to win a trophy this year and if they go on to become a dynastic force under Steve Borthwick, they will for ever be imprinted by Ford’s legacy. Not that he is outwardly reflecting on that at this moment. “We’re fully focused on the now,” he says, parroting Borthwick’s strict doctrine. “We are energised for this week. Steve is very explicit in what he says. We don’t look any further than what the challenge is ahead of us, that will always remain the same under Steve, that is the way good teams go about their business.” Before Borthwick’s arrival in 2020, Leicester were an empire in ruin. The most successful club in the country, with 10 league titles, had finished 11th for two consecutive seasons. In his first year, Borthwick took them to sixth as well as to the Challenge Cup final. Now they are pushing for a rare continental and domestic double. What has changed? “A lot of hard work, there is no secret formula, I wish I could tell you there was,” Ford says. “It is doing the basics brilliantly well, working hard day in, day out, week in, week out. I wish I could tell you it is something else but it is not.” Ford, who has built a career on his consistency, defended those who prefer substance over style: “I think what’s gone out of the game, and is now a bit unfashionable, is if you do your job as a team of individuals unbelievably well and you dominate the game, it’s not exciting enough for people sometimes. “We want to play the most efficient way. We want to build pressure, score points and stop the opposition from scoring points. For this group of players, we believe this way is the best way.” Expect few alterations, then, from Leicester as they look to reach the last eight of Europe’s premier club competition for the first time since 2014. If Clermont and Hanrahan have any designs on a bewildering upset, they will need a dramatic change from last week.",Sport/Sport,Leicester and Ford’s focus on basics leaves Clermont seeking miracle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/george-ford-leicester-clermont-champions-cup-rugby-union
