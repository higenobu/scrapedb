12/23/2021,"There were at least 16 Salernitana fans at the Dacia Arena on Tuesday. It is no small commitment to make a 1,000-mile roundtrip to support a team that sits bottom of the standings on a weeknight in December. The group came knowing they would not have a team to support at all. Salernitana had been barred from travelling after two players tested positive for Covid, together with a third member of staff. The decision was made by the local health authority in Salerno, not the Italian Football Federation, meaning that their fixture away to Udinese was not officially cancelled.  And so, we had a repeat of the surreal theatre that surrounded unplayed games between Juventus and Napoli last October, as well as Lazio and Torino this March. The home team showed up, submitted a starting lineup and even posted it on social media. Then they waited around. Finally, 45 minutes after the game was scheduled to kick-off, the referee Giacomo Campione blew his whistle three times to bring the charade to a close. Starting XI 👇#UdineseSalernitana pic.twitter.com/je5fJNCfaW Everyone was doing what they should, following the rules as written, but these scenes provoked a wearying sense of déjà vu. Both the Juventus-Napoli and Lazio-Torino games were eventually played at later dates, but only after lengthy appeals processes and arguments over why some teams had been forced to carry on with squads decimated by the virus while others got a reprieve. TheLega Serie A justice department has so far declined to make a ruling on whether this game should be awarded as a walkover win for Udinese or rescheduled for a later date. There is little point in doing so until they know whether Salernitana will play any more matches at all. The club has until 31 December to find a new owner or be thrown out of the league. Their promotion to the top-flight last spring created a conflict of interest, as they are co-owned by Claudio Lotito, also the owner of Lazio. This is a mess 10 years in the making. Lotito relaunched Salernitana together with another businessman, Marco Mezzaroma, after the club went bankrupt in 2011 and oversaw their rise from Serie D, with Lazio frequently sending them young players on loan to gain experience. The Italian Football Federation’s rules at the time prohibited individuals from owning more than one club within the professional divisions – from Lega Pro upwards. But when Salernitana were promoted to that level in 2012, Lotito was granted an exemption. Potential clashes with Lazio in the Coppa Italia were clumsily avoided by drawing the teams on opposite sides of the bracket and trusting in the probability that they would not both make the final. Even the federation’s own president, Gabriele Gravina, has acknowledged that “everyone knew what would happen” when Salernitana finally made it up to Serie A. There could be no more bending of rules to allow one man to own two teams in the same division. Lotito was permitted to surrender the club to a blind trust on the condition that they be sold by the end of December. The question of how things were allowed to go this far remains a vexing one. Rules have since been amended to prevent a repeat. In Salernitana’s case, Gravina has been clear that there can be no further extensions. If no buyer is found, the team will be thrown out of Serie A. He remained defiantly optimistic on Tuesday, saying “I bet that a buyer will be found in the next 10 days” and declaring it as unthinkable that nobody would be willing to invest in such a “healthy club”. Those fans who travelled to the Dacia Arena that same evening would love to believe him. They unfurled a banner outside with a plea to “Free Salernitana”. The rest of the league can only watch and wait. There would be a knock-on impact for everyone if Salernitana are thrown out, with their results so far set to be scrubbed from the record, even if the impact on the standings would be modest. The club has struggled badly on its return to the top-flight after 23 years away – collecting eight points from 19 games despite signing Franck Ribéry this September. It is a situation everyone would prefer to avoid. There is anxiety enough over Salernitana’s Covid cases, and the potential implications of the Omicron variant. Up until this week, the hope in Italy had been that a high vaccination rate could keep the league running smoothly. La Repubblica reported in October that 98% of Serie A players had received two jabs – the biggest uptake across Europe’s top five leagues. As of Tuesday, only 19 had tested positive all season. Half of teams were yet to experience a single case. But rising infection numbers across the country were sparking concern even before Salernitana were ordered to stay home. Earlier this month the government tightened restrictions for fans attending games, requiring them to meet the ‘Super Green Pass’ criteria of having received two jabs or recovered from Covid in the preceding six months. Further government measures may be introduced before Christmas, though Serie A is on break now until 6 January. Attendances at Serie A games have been limited to 75% of stadium capacity since October, up from 50% at the start of the campaign. In practice, many clubs are not hitting their upper limits. These worries did not overshadow Serie A’s final games of 2021 entirely. Inter signed off on a brilliant year by beating Torino 1-0 at San Siro. They had already tied up the title of ‘Winter Champion’ over the weekend and look ever more likely to retain the actual Scudetto in the spring. Simone Inzaghi was justified in his observation that: “It suits everyone now to say that Inter are a dreadnought, but that was not what people were saying in the summer.” He has taken the team to new heights since succeeding Antonio Conte, even finding ways in recent ways to reintegrate and get the most from players who had fallen to the fringes: Alexis Sánchez and Arturo Vidal. Milan rebounded from their weekend defeat to Napoli with an impressive 4-2 win over Empoli, Franck Kessié thriving as a makeshift no 10. The Partenopei, by contrast, undid all their good work by losing at home to a Spezia side that sat 17th in the table, easily the biggest shock of the round. Sassuolo 0-3 Bologna, Venezia 1-3 Lazio, Inter 1-0 Torino, Roma 1-1 Sampdoria, Verona 1-1 Fiorentina, Empoli 2-4 Milan, Napoli 0-1 Spezia, Juventus 2-0 Cagliari, Genoa 0-0 Atalanta And then there were Roma, who delivered their best performance of José Mourinho’s tenure as they thumped Atalanta 4-1 at the weekend, but threw away a lead as they drew 1-1 on Wednesday with Sampdoria. “It was a horrible match,” said Mourinho. “If I was at home I would have changed the channel.” At least it was a match. Those Salernitana fans who made the trip to Udine could only head home afterward to anxious Christmases, not knowing if they would have excuses to return to a Serie A stadium in 2022.",Sport/Sport,Salernitana’s ghost game could be a farcical end to their Serie A journey | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/23/salernitanas-ghost-game-could-be-a-farcical-end-to-their-serie-a-journey
12/23/2021,"Nearly two years into the pandemic, Angela Rasmussen was looking forward to a more typical Christmas with her family. She was planning to fly from Canada back to the US, hoping that preventative measures would be enough to keep everyone safe. And then Omicron hit.  Rassmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, isn’t worried about herself. She’s vaccinated and boosted, and she knows if she got sick, it’s very unlikely to be severe. But she has a two-year-old niece who is too young to get the vaccine, and older people in her family who could be vulnerable. Like many people at this moment, she faced a tough choice. So she canceled her flight, and she plans to spend Christmas with friends nearby. “I don’t want to contribute to further transmission of omicron,” said Rasmussen. “You really have to take that into consideration – not just your own individual risk, but their individual risk as well and the risk to others within your community.” Americans were looking forward to the return of a more typical holiday season when the omicron variant turned everything on its head. Now many are scrambling to make new plans in light of the more transmissible and immune-evasive variant. “Omicron is a game-changer,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “As much as Covid has been an immense challenge, omicron takes it to a whole new level.” He called the new variant a “viral Uzi” for its rapid spread. “Before omicron, I was very optimistic that this was fading away, but it threw us another curveball,” said Katelyn Jetelina, assistant professor of epidemiology with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Yet more than 109 million Americans are expected to travel this holiday season, up 34% from last year and nearly at pre-pandemic levels, according to AAA. While some people are scaling back or canceling holiday plans altogether, others are trying to make existing plans a little safer. As scientists scramble to understand the new variant, holiday celebrants are making decisions with limited information. “This is not going to be just a scientific question,” Osterholm said. “Because we don’t have enough science to answer this with any clarity. This is going to be one’s personal choice of what’s the risk picture, and what can people tolerate?” To be as safe as possible, experts recommend keeping gatherings small, limiting travel, getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing high-quality masks, getting tested, improving ventilation, and quarantining if possible. “What people really should be thinking about here is putting as many layers of protection between themselves and the virus as possible,” Rasmussen said. Communication is key. “The biggest thing is having a conversation and a plan before getting together,” Jetelina said. That way you’re not pulling into your grandparents’ driveway only to learn they ran out of rapid tests last month. One rule of thumb is to plan for the most vulnerable person in the room, whether they are older, immune-compromised, or unable to be vaccinated. “I would take out all layers of protection if an immunocompromised family member was with us,” Jetelina said. Osterholm thinks of it like this: “Who do we put at risk if we’re infected?” Getting vaccinated and boosted is one important measure, even if it only provides partial protection in the next few days. “The booster shot works much faster in terms of producing those high neutralizing antibody responses, and it really does significantly increase your neutralizing antibody titers within a couple of days of getting it,” Rasmussen said. But keep in mind that children under 5 aren’t eligible for the shots yet. Kids under the age of one are at particularly high risk for developing serious illness. “As parents, we are our kids’ only advocate, and so there are hard stops for my family if other family members aren’t willing to do public health mitigation measures,” Jetelina said. Masks are another important tool – especially high-quality, well-fitting masks, like an N95 or KF94. Rasmussen recommends wearing a pair of sunglasses or glasses with the mask; if they fog up, the mask is leaking around the edges too much. Double-masking can help stop some of that leaking. Wearing masks is particularly important if you’re traveling by plane or train. “You should still keep the mask on the entire time,” Rasmussen said. But not just on the plane itself, she said – during “that Uber ride to the airport, hanging out in the airport waiting for your flight, especially when people are all gathering and clustering around at the gate.” This may be particularly true for your flight back, when rates of Covid may be higher. At the get-together itself, ventilation is another key tool. “Crack the windows, get an air purifier that has either HEPA or MERV-13 filtration,” Rasmussen said. PCR and rapid tests can also help, if you can find and afford them. The home tests should be used immediately before getting together, since infectiousness can change within hours. And keep in mind that “no test is perfect or infinitely sensitive,” Rasmussen said. “Just because you tested negative for a rapid test, that doesn’t mean you’re 100% safe.” With the rise of the omicron variant, there have been preliminary reports of symptomatic people initially testing negative on rapid tests, Osterholm said – and they may still be transmitting the virus. “I don’t know how frequently that occurs,” he said, but “that’s a huge challenge” for understanding how infectious you may be. If you don’t feel safe gathering, especially if your family or friends aren’t willing to take precautions, “don’t feel shy about telling people that you just can’t make it,” Rasmussen said. “Don’t feel ashamed or uncomfortable setting firm boundaries about what you’re comfortable with and what risks you will tolerate.” Every expert said they are going through the same risk calculations and trying to figure out the best plans for them and their families. “If you’re all vaccinated, and use rapid tests and masks and put other mitigations into effect such as increasing ventilation and air filtration, then you’re safer, but it’s not completely safe,” Rasmussen said. “That said, we’re human beings, and we need to be around other human beings. So most people are willing to assume some level of risk.” Prioritizing what is important can help you decide the level of risk you’re willing to accept, Jetelina said. “For me, [sitting on] Santa’s lap isn’t important – my girls are too young for that. But seeing great-grandma is, so we’re gonna be extra careful before we see great-grandma.”",News/US news,‘A viral Uzi’: experts on how Omicron affects the holidays for Americans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/omicron-christmas-holidays-coronavirus-covid
12/23/2021,"Boris Johnson has decided to allow 25 December celebrations go ahead this year, narrowly avoiding becoming the prime minister who cancelled Christmas for the second year in a row. Another man who knows how it feels to be accused of cancelling Christmas is Michael Chubb, the former head of events at Birmingham city council – and the legacy has not been short-lived.  In 1998 Chubb inadvertently gave birth to one of the most pervasive media myths in the UK when he found himself at the centre of claims that the council rebranded its traditional December events programme to avoid offending non-Christians. Looking back 23 years on, Chubb is amazed that his team’s suggestion to promote two months of events in Birmingham city centre under the banner of “Winterval” continues to resonate. “We put it to the council, they liked the idea, and it didn’t seem necessary to explain to anyone why we did it,” he says, explaining that the programme covered everything from BBC Children in Need events to Diwali celebrations and Christmas parties. “That’s why the furore that happened afterwards was a surprise – maybe we were a little naive.” The story began when the Anglican bishop of Birmingham made some mildly critical comments about the Winterval branding in a message to local churches, suggesting Christianity was being downplayed by a council that was “embarrassed by faith”. These comments were picked up by a news agency, and almost every national newspaper – including the Guardian – subsequently ran short stories on the bishop’s intervention. What could have been a swiftly forgotten tale then took a life of its own. “The council that banned Christmas” became a regular reference in right-leaning outlets, popping up in columns and news stories about attacks on traditional British values for years to come. “It stunned me at first,” says Chubb. He insists he was so busy putting together the event that it was only the following year that he became aware of how far the story had spread. “It is because it was reported by so many people that it became a fact.” Chubb says he always attempted to promote events from different religions and cultures in one of the most diverse cities of the UK. “Everyone’s got their own festival – Diwali, Eid, Vaisakhi, Chinese new year – they’re each celebrated in their own way by their own community. No one festival should overpower the other. Each festival deserved its own communication strategy.” The Telegraph has run 61 stories referencing the term Winterval, the Mail has used it 78 times and the Sun 67. The saga also provided the basis for further claims about Birmingham, with the Mail claiming the following year that the city council wanted to “scrap Easter”. By 2004 the then Sun columnist Richard Littlejohn was stating that the city had banned Father Christmas from the Bull Ring shopping centre “in case he offends non-Christians” – something denied by all those involved. The news story about pen-pushing officials trying to erase Christmas has now become an annual event. Last month the Mail on Sunday ran a front-page story claiming civil servants were trying to “ban Christmas” by changing the language of a Covid vaccination advert because it would “offend minorities”. The term of attack has changed: in the 1990s these plots were blamed on “political correctness”, but now the word “woke” serves much the same purpose. Chubb, now 66 and living in Cardiff, says: “Ask yourself the question: why? What was the reason for falling on this one, what were they trying to achieve by putting thoughts into people’s minds? It’s to rile people, to make people take a stance and choose a team. It’s a bit like what’s happening at the moment in terms of politics.” But in terms of branding, Chubb is proud that the Winterval name is still talked about almost a quarter of a century later. “It bloody worked in terms of marketing.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Meet the man who created the ‘Christmas is cancelled’ myth,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/23/winterval-man-who-created-christmas-is-cancelled-myth
12/23/2021,"After grappling with volcanic eruptions that dragged on for three months, piling on to the tourism woes brought by the coronavirus pandemic, a bit of luck has landed in the Canary Island of La Palma. Spain’s Christmas lottery – the two-century-old tradition that on Wednesday showered €2.4bn in prize money across the country – included a nugget of good news for the hard-hit island as two local kiosks said they had sold winning tickets worth a total of €400,000.  While the amount fell far short of that paid out for the top winning number, worth a total of €516m in prizes, news that a small piece of El Gordo – or the Fat One, as the world’s richest lottery is known – had landed in La Palma sparked jubilation. “We really needed this,” said Ricardo Cobiella, who uncorked a bottle of champagne after finding out his kiosk had sold €200,000 worth of winning tickets. “People here were in need of a bit of good news.” One day after the closely followed draw, the identity of the winners remained shrouded in mystery. “If the winner is someone from here, that’s great,” said Cobiella. “And if it’s someone from outside the island, then come to La Palma and spend the money here because we need people to invest in the island’s economic recovery.” Since mid-September much of life on the island has been dictated by the whims of the Cumbre Vieja volcano. It first erupted on 19 September, spewing ash and rivers of lava that swallowed nearly 3,000 buildings, decimated the lush banana plantations that drive the island’s economy, and forced thousands of people from their homes. The seismic activity came to a halt last week, leaving the 80,000 residents cautiously optimistic that another piece of good news may be on the way in the coming days, with scientists expected to declare the eruption officially over. From there the focus will shift to the tremendous task of rebuilding the affected areas. The lava buried parts of key highways and blanketed some areas in a thick layer of ash, leaving parts of the island cut off and without potable water or electricity. While no injuries or deaths have been directly linked to the eruption, many people continue to reel from the mental toll of living through months of roaring eruptions, tremors and sudden evacuations. “There’s a lot of work to do,” said Cobiella. “And that’s why we’re asking people not to forget La Palma. They need to keep supporting La Palma.”",News/World news,Volcano-hit La Palma gets a piece of Spain’s biggest lotto,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/volcano-hit-la-palma-gets-a-piece-of-spains-biggest-lotto
12/23/2021,"“Chasse à la glu has ended, but the fight to save other birds is not over,” says campaigner Yves Verilhac. “We are now battling to stop other cruel hunting methods that lead to the killing of skylarks, lapwings, golden plovers, thrushes and blackbirds.” Two years ago, Verilhac, of France’s Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux (LPO), was fighting to stop the French tradition of chasse à la glu – hunting songbirds with twigs and branches covered in adhesive.  La chasse à la glu had been banned in the EU by a 1979 bird directive, except in special circumstances where it had to be “controlled, selective and [done] in limited quantities”. Since 1989, France had invoked these circumstances to permit glue-trapping in five south-east departments on the grounds that it was traditional. Today, Verilhac and other campaigners are celebrating a rare victory. This year, facing legal action initiated by the European Commission and possible fines, the French government announced glue-trap hunting would be definitively banned. The fight to save endangered bird species goes on, however. “Of the 64 species of bird hunted in France, at least 20 are on the danger list,” says Verilhac. “We have succeeded in suspending hunting of only three species: turtledoves, curlews and the black-tailed godwit.” The LPO says France continues to kill millions of birds every year. Some of the “traditional” methods used involve huge nets, wire nooses that strangle the birds, or traps that crush the birds with stones. As it did for decades with chasse à la glu, the French government has allowed exemptions from the EU directive. However, after a legal challenge by conservationists, the state council, France’s highest court, suspended these methods temporarily, despite protests by the country’s powerful hunting lobby and an attempt by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to reinstate licences. The LPO wants a permanent ban on these hunting methods and so, it appears, does Europe; Verilhac produced a letter from EU commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius advising the French government it is on its last warning over this issue before being hauled before the European court of justice. France is not the only country in Europe that sees hunters decimate bird populations. It is estimated that between 11 million and 36 million birds are illegally killed or taken in Mediterranean countries every year, many of them while migrating. More than 5 million birds are believed to be illegally hunted every year in Italy; in October, Italian hunters were found in Norway with 2,000 dead thrushes. Verilhac says French hunters are now travelling to Morocco to hunt turtledoves, where each hunter is allowed to kill 50 a day. The battle over France’s love of hunting, in all its forms, is proving to be a key issue in the run-up to next April’s presidential election. There are up to 1.2 million hunters in France who, along with their supporters and families, could make up a pool of 5 million voters. Willy Schraen, president of the French Fédération Nationale des Chasseurs (national hunters’ federation), has been doing the rounds of television studios to explain the “passion” involved in hunting. Schraen readily admits he does not hunt to control animal numbers – farmers frequently lament wild boar destroying their crops, for example – but for pleasure. He has said he would not turn down a ministerial job in charge of “rurality and agriculture”. But after a spate of shooting accidents in recent years – about 20 people have been killed and dozens more injured – a recent Ifop poll revealed that 70% of those surveyed would at least like to see hunting banned at weekends and during school holidays. Recent accidents have involved walkers, cyclists and drivers shot as they passed hunting areas, though most deaths each season are among the hunters themselves. “It is scandalous that a candidate so pro-Europe as Macron has done everything possible to try to get round the European birds directive,” Verilhac says. “They’ve been fighting this to the end. We have won on glue trapping, but have wasted time and energy fighting this. We have lost a year and the numbers of species are falling. “So the fight goes on.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,‘The fight goes on’: the struggle to save Europe’s songbirds,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/23/struggle-to-save-europe-songbirds-aoe
12/23/2021,"The developer of one of the world’s tallest towers has responded to a multi-million dollar lawsuit from the building’s condominium board over construction and alleged design defects that have resulted in floods, elevator malfunctions and electric explosions. The response, filed on Wednesday in New York state supreme court by an entity managed by Los Angeles-based CIM Group, said that the complaints against 432 Park Avenue in New York’s so-called Billionaire Row are “vastly exaggerated.” The developer also called the lawsuit “ill-advised” and argued that it was “an effort to wrest unwarranted payments”.  In September, the condo board sued the tower’s developers, CIM Group and Macklowe Properties, for $125m in damages. The lawsuit includes costs to repair over 1,500 construction and design defects that were identified by an engineering firm hired by the board, along with other breakdowns and safety issues. “This case presents one of the worst examples of sponsor malfeasance in the development of a luxury condominium in the history of New York City,” said the complaint. The board complained about “horrible and obtrusive noise and vibrations” including creaking and clicking sounds in the building, which has 102 floors. It also said that trash that went through the trash chute sounded like a bomb detonation. According to the suit, the issues for certain residents were so serious that they were displaced from their units for as long as 19 months. The suit also detailed one incident in which a worker who tried to fix water infiltration issues allegedly drilled through concrete and into the tower’s electric wiring, resulting in an arc-flash explosion. The worker was allegedly thrown back several feet as a result of the explosion. Jonathan Adelsberg, a partner at the law firm Herrick Feinstein that is representing the board, described the defects as “peeling an onion”, referring to ones that may yet be discovered. “This is a work in progress in ascertaining what’s wrong,” he told the New York Times in September. In its response to the lawsuit, the building’s developer said the building is “without a doubt, safe.” “Like any other skyscraper, 432 Park’s sophisticated symphony of systems needed to be fine-tuned when residents began to move into the building,” it said. “But the board repeatedly and unlawfully prevented sponsor from accessing the building and finishing the job, all while manufacturing an ever-increasing list of demands,” the developer added in Wednesday’s court filing. Adelsberg responded to the developer’s filing, saying, according to the Wall Street Journal: “This is yet another attempt by the sponsor to shirk responsibility by rewriting the record of its malfeasance. We will continue to ensure that the sponsor is held accountable for their persistent failures.”",News/US news,"New York mega-skyscraper ‘without a doubt safe’, developer says in response to lawsuit",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/new-york-432-park-avenue-skyscraper-lawsuit
12/23/2021,"Ministers will not be making any announcements about future Covid restrictions in England before Christmas, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has said. On Tuesday Boris Johnson said no new rules would come into force before Christmas Day, but there had been speculation that a post-Christmas tightening of rules might be announced this week, before a recall of parliament next week.  Javid’s comment on Thursday may be an indication that fresh regulations are becoming less likely, but he stressed that ministers were still tracking the Covid data very closely and that new research suggesting the Omicron variant is less severe than feared did not lift the threat to the NHS. Speaking to broadcasters, Javid said: “We are not planning any further announcements this week. Despite the caution that we are all taking, people should enjoy their Christmases with their families and their friends – of course, remain cautious. “We will keep the situation under review. We are learning more all the time as we have done from this new data … and if we need to do anything more we will, but nothing more is going to happen before Christmas.” Javid said two reports published on Wednesday suggesting people infected with Omicron are at less risk of being hospitalised than people infected with Delta, the last dominant variant, were “of course good, encouraging news”. But he said the studies were “not very clear yet … by how much that risk is reduced”. He went on: “We do know with Omicron that it does spread a lot more quickly, it is a lot more infectious than Delta, so any advantage gained from reduced risk of hospitalisation needs to be set against that. If a much smaller percentage of people are at risk of hospitalisation, if that is a smaller percentage of a much larger number, there could still be significant hospitalisation.” Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also cautioned about placing too much reliance on the new data at the final session of first minister’s questions before the Christmas recess. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, asked why she was not following the example of the UK government and allowing people to isolate for just seven days, not 10, after testing positive, if lateral flow tests later showed they were no longer infectious. Ross said a reduction in days was necessary to protect essential services and the economy from a rise in isolation-related absences, adding: “These rules are forcing whole families to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they have tested negative.” Sturgeon said sector-based exemptions to self-isolation rules had been published earlier in Scotland, but she would not make wider changes until the public health benefits outweighed the risks. “If we allow this spread of Omicron to get too far ahead of us, then even if it is significantly less severe, that is going to overwhelm us,” she said. “So anything we do right now that risks increasing spreads, such as removing self-isolation rules, or weakening self-isolation rules too quickly, actually could be seriously counterproductive. “If we act rashly right now, then what we risk is a counterproductive effect … These studies are really positive but they are also early data. When even the authors are saying ‘don’t get carried away yet with what these studies are telling you’, then I think we should listen.”",News/Politics,"No further updates on England Covid rules before Christmas, says Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/23/no-further-covid-rules-in-england-before-christmas-says-sajid-javid
12/23/2021,"The celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury has repaid £3.2m in furlough money after sales soared during the pandemic as shoppers switched to buying online. Accounts filed at Companies House also reveal that Tilbury sold her business for £1.3bn – considerably more than the up to £1bn previously thought – to the Spanish cosmetics and fragrance group Puig last year.  The scale of the deal means that Tilbury, who personally held a controlling stake in the business of between 50% and 75%, is likely to have received hundreds of millions from the takeover of the company in which she remains a minority shareholder. The London-born makeup artist, who grew up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, also received a consultancy fee of £1.55m from one of the group’s parent companies, Islestarr Holdings, last year, according to Companies House filings. Global sales for Charlotte Tilbury Limited Group rose 11.3% to £258.5m in the year to 31 December 2020, according to figures released by the company, driven by strong performances in key markets including the UK, mainland Europe and Asia. While its stores were forced to close for long periods, the cosmetics group said online sales doubled to account for two-thirds of total sales. Sales were underpinned by online video beauty consultations and a virtual store featuring an avatar of Tilbury, and the firm also continued with new product launches when some rivals held back. Tilbury’s tips learned from years in the trade, with celebrity clients thought to include Amal Clooney and Penélope Cruz, have helped her build a big social media presence with about 10m followers over various platforms enabling the company to continue to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic. The group fell to a £9.9m loss before tax for the year, after more than £29m in one-off costs related to its buyout by Puig. However, a spokesperson said the company had repaid furlough cash as underlying profits, before one-off costs, interest payments and other adjustments, rose almost 44% to £32m. “We would like to thank the UK government for its support,” the spokesperson said.

And in 2020 he legally changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Boss, internationally embarrassing the luxury German fashion brand after it sent cease and desist letters to small businesses, including a Swansea-based brewery, Boss Brewing, and charities that used the word “Boss” in their branding. Next, he was meant to be taking on Christmas, albeit not in a way that involves exposing the dodgy practices of the baby Jesus. Instead, Lycett was meant to be hosting his own festive special, Joe Lycett: Mummy’s Big Christmas Do, a live TV event that hoped to recapture the anarchic spirit of shows such as TFI Friday, the Big Breakfast and SM:TV Live. It was going to be a celebration of LGBTQ+ culture and, most importantly, filmed in his home city of Birmingham, where Lycett still lives now. Unfortunately, because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, that special was cancelled less than a week before it was meant to air. It was so last minute that the Guardian printed a version of this interview telling the world the show was running. “Loads of people from the team started testing positive and it was all over very quick, really,” Lycett says just after the show’s cancellation. “Also, with Boris and all his parties, the sentiment wasn’t really there to be hosting what is, essentially, a party. Everyone else is having to cancel their parties, and it just became more and more apparent that if we went ahead, we wouldn’t be reading the room.” However, the cancellation doesn’t mean that Lycett will be absent from our screens. Describing himself as “very much flavour of the month at Channel 4 at the moment”, he recently took over from Richard Ayoade as the host of Travel Man. The first episode, a festive special that sees Lycett and fellow comedian Bill Bailey exploring Iceland, is set to air just after Christmas. “I’ve really enjoyed doing it,” Lycett says. “I love comics and I love spending time with them. But normally when I’m working with comics, it’s in quite a heightened environment. You’re working with people when they are full of adrenaline, maybe even boozed up. Whereas with this show, it’s so much more relaxed. With Bill, I sat on the flight with him the whole way there and back. We talked about his memories of Sean Lock, as they were great friends, and his family. You do really get to immerse yourself in a person in a way you wouldn’t if you were just doing a gig with them.” Iceland wasn’t at all what Lycett was expecting. “I thought it was going to be really miserable and cold, and that we’d eat terrible salted food,” he says. “If I’m going to go on holiday, I want to go somewhere hot. But that trip changed my mind: the food was great and the people were hysterical. It’s such a happy place.” The episode sees the comedians knitting their own trolls, boiling eggs in natural hot springs and making a traditional Icelandic bread called laufabrauð, which is made with a thin dough that is decorated then fried in lamb fat. Are these activities Lycett chose himself? “No, I leave that entirely up to the production company,” he says. “If I was in control it would be catastrophic. You wouldn’t see any activities. You would just be watching Joe and someone else get pissed.” One thing he has done in every place he’s visited for the show is enquire about local politics, especially when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights. Iceland was progressive, but Lycett says he could feel the encroaching anti-LGBTQ sentiment making its way through Europe. “We went to Vilnius in Lithuania and a lot of eastern Europe are starting to have dangerous curbs on LGBT rights, which is really concerning,” he says. “The local fixers who helped us seemed really embarrassed by it. But there are lots of things to be embarrassed about by our politics, so we can’t throw stones.” Lycett’s own queerness is part of why he’s so keen to challenge authority figures, big companies and establishments. “I think I have a disrespect for authority because authority, both when I was growing up and now, is quite a straight, cisgender thing,” he says. “It doesn’t respond well to camp, flamboyance and people being silly. I think comedy is almost part of that rebellion; I use it as a way of making authority figures look silly. It all comes from a place of wanting to piss off boring grey people, basically.” He did this most recently in a documentary about Shell, where he attempted to confront the fossil fuel mega-corp about their advertising, which shows them as eco-friendly but is actually an egregious example of greenwashing. Nevertheless, he was aware while filming that there might be accusations of hypocrisy levied at him, especially as it turned out that Shell advertised with Channel 4, something that did come up. “But everyone is a hypocrite when it comes to climate change,” he argues. “We are all going to produce emissions. Even if you become homeless, you’d still be producing emissions. You can’t avoid it.” He played with this concept during a segment on Got Your Back where he successfully got yoghurt drink brand Yop to stop using white PET plastic for its packaging. Appearing on daytime TV to talk about the issue, Lycett stormed off set when a photo of him with one of the bottles appeared on screen. It was all staged, though it still led to him “getting cancelled” online. “It was an interesting and quite useful exercise in understanding the speed at which the public can change their opinion of you,” he says. “There was definitely a sense of people going: ‘Aha! We’ve got him. He’s a prick.’ People were really relishing that. Now I don’t think I can be cancelled because I’d just pretend it was a stunt. I’d just be like: ‘No, no, I was trying to see what would happen if I saw lots of sex workers for my show.’” One adversary he still can’t topple, though, is Peppa Pig – whose Heinz pasta shapes are marketed as one of your five a day, despite being full of salt and sugar. “I’m sick to the back teeth of her,” he sighs. “It’s not a healthy meal. But Peppa Pig should be worried about what Heinz does, because sometimes they put little sausages in those tins. Be careful who you get into bed with, Peppa!” The battle with that anthropomorphic pig might have to wait, though. Along with the upcoming series of Travel Man, he also kicks off his next tour, Joe Lycett: More, More, More! How Do You Lycett? How Do You Lycett?. It’s set to include his biggest stunt yet. “I wondered if there was a way of doing a show that calls back to something in the world outside: that you’ve seen, but you didn’t know you were seeing until later,” he says. “It’s slightly Derren Brown-like.” While he’s vague about the details, the show is about how he attempted to raise the price of his house in Birmingham. “It’s ended up becoming this huge, long-form stunt – which some may call madness – that I’ve been doing for about three years,” he says. “Purely by chance, I ended up making something a lot more moving than I anticipated.” It is, of all the things he’s done in his career, the thing he’s most proud of. So much so that touring it seems bittersweet. “I’m a bit sad to let it go because it’s been such a fun project to work on and it’s not something you can tell twice,” he says. “It’s bigger than I could have ever anticipated. I’m very proud.” Hopefully after this Christmas, he’ll be saying the same about his roast potatoes, too. Travel Man: 96 Hours in Iceland is on Channel 4 at 8pm on Monday 27 December.
