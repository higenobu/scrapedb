3/2/2022,"After a negative experience at work, a woman discovered that a certain word is only ever used to describe female employees. Katrina Palanca uses her TikTok account to share stories that empower AAPI women in their career journeys. The influencer recounted a time at work when a male co-worker labeled her “abrasive.” After feeling upset about the comment, Palanca did some research of her own on the term. What she learned was enlightening. “There’s a word that’s almost always used to describe women and hardly ever used to describe men,” Palanca said. “I’m going to tell you about the time I was called that word.” When Palanca was preparing for a new hire at work, she ran into an issue with her co-worker “Steve” from the IT department. She had requested the IT department set up the new hire’s computer before their first day. After a few days, Palanca went to follow up on the request. She spoke in a “matter-of-fact” tone that was the “equivalent of not putting exclamation points in an email.” But Steve didn’t take it too well. “A couple of hours later, my boss comes to my cubicle, he grabs a chair, sits down next to me,” Palanca recalled. “And [he] says, ‘Hey, you’re not in trouble. I just want you to know that Steve from IT came into my office and said that you were being abrasive.’“ Although Palanca didn’t get in trouble at work, the word “abrasive” left her feeling unsettled. She discovered a study by linguist Kieran Snyder, who reviewed 248 performance reviews from 28 small and large companies. Snyder found the word “abrasive” was used 17 times to describe 13 women, but men were never called the word once. In fact, the study found that such character critiques appeared in 71 of 94 women’s reviews but were totally absent from men’s reviews altogether. So as it turns out, Palanca’s experience was just one example of the much broader double standards women face at work.

3/2/2022,"Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council chief Oleksiy Danilov announced during a briefing Tuesday that Ukrainian forces had foiled an assassination plot against President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a Telegram post from Ukrainian authorities. Why it matters: Zelensky has said since the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine that he would be a prime target for assassination. Last Thursday, he warned that Russian ""sabotage groups"" had entered Kyiv and were hunting for him and his family. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free.

3/2/2022,"By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Human rights groups and Ukraine's ambassador to the United States on Monday accused Russia of attacking Ukrainians with cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that have been condemned by a variety of international organizations. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both said that Russian forces appeared to have used widely banned cluster munitions, with Amnesty accusing them of attacking a preschool in northeastern Ukraine while civilians took shelter inside. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, told reporters after meeting with members of the U.S. Congress that Russia had used a thermobaric weapon, known as a vacuum bomb, in its invasion of her country. ""They used the vacuum bomb today,"" Markarova said after a meeting with lawmakers. ""...The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large."" A vacuum bomb, or thermobaric weapon, sucks in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, typically producing a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional explosive and is capable of vaporizing human bodies. There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. CNN reported that one of its teams had spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rocket launcher near the Ukrainian border early on Saturday afternoon. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she had seen reports but did not have confirmation that Russia had used such weapons. ""If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,"" she told a press briefing, noting that there are international organizations that would assess that and President Joe Biden's administration ""would look to be a part of that conversation."" The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Markarova said Ukraine was working actively with the Biden administration and Congress to obtain more weapons and tougher sanctions. ""They should pay, they should pay a heavy price,"" she told reporters after leaving the meeting. One lawmaker who attended the meeting, Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, said the Ukrainians had asked for a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine but that he felt that was too dangerous because it could provoke conflict with Russia. Amnesty International said international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions. Launching indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitutes a war crime.

3/2/2022,"STORY: As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to the European Parliament Tuesday, appealing for help as his country faced a withering bombardment from Russia, at least one man was audibly moved by his speech: His interpreter. ""We're fighting just for our land and for our freedom despite the fact that all our cities of our country are now blocked."" Ukrainian-Canadian interpreter Victor Shevchenko, who was in charge of translating the Ukrainian leader's speech into English, said Zelenskiy struck a chord when he mentioned an attack on Kharkiv's Freedom Square. ""I saw 10 minutes before the speech by President Zelenskiy, I saw a video with these two explosions on Freedom Square in Kharkiv and you know when he started talking about this, I guess it was more than just a dry presentation of interpretation, it was getting through."" Shevchenko, who has lived in Brussels for 18 years and who also speaks German, Polish, French, Russian, and Croatian, said his job usually requires him to use a neutral tone when translating. ""Today, though, it was different because the message was so powerful and it's also very personal for me. It's a message that comes not from a far away land or faraway city. It's a message coming from the city that is very, very much a place close to my heart. That's why it resonated with every, every fiber of my soul."" Footage on Tuesday showed the aftermath in the center of Kharkiv after Russia rained rockets on the city on Tuesday. Kharkiv residents helped emergency service workers take dead bodies out of damaged buildings. Bodies were left on the ground, with people passing by them in shock.",Politics/Reuters Videos,'Very personal for me' -Zelenskiy's EU interpreter chokes up,https://news.yahoo.com/very-personal-zelenskiys-eu-interpreter-232456857.html
