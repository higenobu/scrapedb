3/8/2022,"Former child star Ricky Schroder, last seen harassing Costco workers who asked him to wear a mask in the store, had another public meltdown over rules intended to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This time, Schroeder flipped out on security guards who asked him to wear a mask before entering the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum in Abilene, Kansas, calling them Nazis and telling them they should only enforce “God’s law.” The video, shared on Instagram by Schroder and on Twitter by Patriot Takes, which monitors right-wing media, showed Schroder berating the guards. “Evil federal government, right?” he asked the guards. “That’s your opinion,” one of the guards replied. “That is my opinion,” Schroder said. “God’s laws are higher than the federal government’s, but you’re going to enforce man’s laws?” After a brief exchange, he told the security guards they “don’t know God,” called them Nazis and stormed out: Patriot Takes also posted other videos of Schroder. “We’re not gonna live as slaves,” he declared in one clip. Schroder made his name as a child actor in the 1980s sitcom “Silver Spoons.” As an adult, he is best known for his three seasons on “NYPD Blue.” But it’s Schroder’s right-wing politics that caused his name to trend on Twitter on Sunday: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Former Child Star Ricky Schroder Has Public Meltdown Over Museum Mask Rule,https://news.yahoo.com/former-child-star-ricky-schroder-074342594.html

China has refused to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine or call it an invasion while asking Western countries to respect Russia's ""legitimate security concerns.""

""Solving complex problems requires calmness and rationality, rather than adding fuel to the fire and intensifying contradictions,"" he told a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's parliament. China has already done ""some work"" to promote peace talks and has all along been in contact with all sides, he added. ""China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in pushing for peace and promoting talks, and is willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed."" China is willing to continue to make its own efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis and the country's Red Cross will ""as soon as possible"" provide a batch of aid to Ukraine, Wang said, without giving details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met Chinese President Xi Jinping hours before the start of last month's Winter Olympics in Beijing and they signed a wide-ranging strategic partnership aimed at countering U.S. influence and said they would have ""no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation"". Wang said the friendship between China and Russia was ""rock solid"" and prospects for cooperation bright.

3/8/2022,"IRPIN, Ukraine — The bridge was just a shell of its old self, blown up days earlier by Ukrainian soldiers intent on slowing the Russian advance on the capital, Kyiv, but battered as it was, it offered a lifeline to civilians desperate to flee the fighting. On Sunday, as Ukrainian refugees were milling near the entrance to the structure, calculating their odds of making it safely over the Irpin River, a family laden with backpacks and a blue roller suitcase decided to chance it. The Russian mortar hit just as they made it across into Kyiv. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times A cloud of concrete dust lofted into the morning air. When it settled, Ukrainians could be seen running madly from the scene. But not the family. A mother and her two children lay still on the roadway, along with a family friend. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied that his forces are targeting civilians fleeing battle zones. He did so again on Sunday, a day after a railroad track used to evacuate Ukrainians came under fire. But only a handful of Ukrainian troops were near the bridge when mortar shells began raining down. The soldiers there were not engaged in combat but in helping refugees carry their children and luggage toward the capital. “The military is the military and that is one thing,” one soldier said bitterly. “But these are civilians, people who waited until the last moment.” The attack at the bridge was witnessed by a New York Times team, including photojournalist Lynsey Addario, a security adviser and Andriy Dubchak, a freelance journalist who filmed the scene. Since Saturday, hundreds of Ukrainians fleeing the fighting in three towns on Kyiv’s western rim have clustered around the bridge to make their way to the capital — which is also in Moscow’s cross hairs. Civilians who cross the bridge into Kyiv form small groups and together run about 100 yards while potentially exposed to Russian fire. Ukrainian soldiers run alongside the civilians to help them and then return to take cover behind a cinder block wall. But early Sunday morning, the regional governor announced that the routes out of Irpin were so unsafe as to be effectively blocked. “Unfortunately, unless there is a cease-fire,” he said, no one could get out. But people kept trying, scrambling over the debris of the damaged bridge and dashing across the exposed street. When the mortar shells hit, Ukrainian forces were engaged in clashes nearby, but not where the civilians were moving along the street on the Kyiv side of the bridge. Outgoing mortar rounds could be heard from a Ukrainian position about 200 yards away, far enough from the bridge to suggest that the Russians were either purposefully targeting the evacuation route or disregarding the risk of civilian casualties. The mortar shells fell first 100 or so yards from the bridge, then shifted in a series of thunderous blasts into a section of street where people were fleeing. As the mortars got closer to the stream of civilians, people ran, pulling children, and trying to find a safe spot. But there was nothing behind which to hide. When the family — a mother, her teenage son and a daughter who appeared to be about 8 — was spotted sprawled on the ground, soldiers rushed to help, but could do little for them or a man described as a family friend who had been helping them escape. The group’s luggage was scattered about them. A small green pet carrier lay nearby, too. A dog could be heard barking. © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,Ukrainian Family's Dash for Safety Ends in Death,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-familys-dash-safety-ends-123002433.html
