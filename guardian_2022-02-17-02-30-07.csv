Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday Below is a photo of me in 2017, crowded around the TV at the climate publication I worked for, looking resigned as then president Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.I couldn’t have imagined the wild ride I was in for. Over four years, Trump agencies gutted more than 100 environmental protections for air and water pollution, biodiversity and climate change. And they did so with dramatic flair.  The interior secretary rode into his first day on a horse. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency spent exorbitantly on sound-proof telephone booths and private planes. By the end of Trump’s chaotic presidency, I was exhausted. The incoming Biden administration felt like a much-needed reprieve. Biden vowed to reinstate the regulations Trump gutted and make the climate crisis a top priority.I was skeptical of what he could achieve, but I tried to muster some hope. Now, a year into Biden’s presidency, it’s clear that what little optimism I had was misguided.Biden’s climate legacy is starting to take shape, and it doesn’t look good.So far, his administration has:1. Held the biggest-ever offshore oil drilling lease sale in the Gulf of MexicoIn November, Biden offered up 80m acres of water to oil drillers. For years, the US government has regularly leased portions of the Gulf of Mexico for offshore exploration and drilling. But environmental and public health advocates had hoped that the president who campaigned on climate action would at least scale back the practice. Last month, a judge struck down the auction – ruling that the administration didn’t properly disclose and consider how the leases would contribute to the climate crisis. That court decision is one of the biggest climate victories of Biden’s administration. And it came in spite of the administration’s efforts – not because of them. Now more than 300 groups have signed on to an emergency petition to halt all new drilling in the Gulf.2. Permitted more drilling on public lands in the West and in Alaska than Trump did in his first yearBiden has approved nearly 900 more permits to drill on public land in 2021 than Trump did in 2017, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. That’s despite his campaign pledges to end new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. In November, Biden also urged drillers to produce more oil, in an effort to lower gasoline prices.3. Failed to advance a climate legislative agendaOn the campaign trail, Biden promised to cut US climate emissions in half by 2030, including by investing significantly in renewable power. But his legislative package to do so – Build Back Better – has stalled. Two Democrats – Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema – may be the main culprits for this failure, but convincing them to get on board with his agenda was always going to be one of Biden’s biggest challenges, and he hasn’t managed to do it.4. Faltered in quickly reinstating rulesUnder Biden, even minor regulations that mandate more energy efficient furnaces, freezers, and lightbulbs are stuck in regulatory limbo. And he could face a significant blow this month if the conservative-tilted supreme court decides the federal government can’t write rules to curb climate pollution from power plants.Biden hasn’t followed through on the basics. And he certainly hasn’t brought the kind of sweeping and aggressive action the world’s scientists say is necessary to avoid catastrophic global heating.As the US gears up for midterm elections in November, it remains to be seen whether Biden will go any harder on environmental efforts.This isn’t the first massive failure of climate efforts at the federal level, and it won’t be the last. The lesson: policymakers and industries won’t do the right thing unless they are forced, by our decisions with our ballots and our wallets.

2/17/2022,"I would like to lend my support to Polly Toynbee in her call for state funding of political parties (Without state funding, Britain’s politics will always stink, 15 February). It is surely straight corruption that money can buy you privileged access to ministers and policymakers, preferment in appointments to public bodies and even a peerage. Why are those engaged in these activities not charged with corruption in public office? All big money must be taken out of politics. No business, bank or financial institution should be allowed to donate to a party, and that includes trade unions. All thinktanks and policy institutions should be required by law to name all their sources of finance, however small.  I suggest that at all elections that have political parties on the ballot paper, voters are given a voucher that they can donate to any of the parties. This would have two enormously beneficial effects. First, it would encourage voting, as there would be a real incentive with the feeling of having some power over the democratic process. Second, it would make political parties engage with large sections of the electorate that they usually ignore and hopefully be more responsive to public concerns. Democracy is for all the people, not just the rich and well-connected.Dr Peter EstcourtSouth Chailey, East Sussex  I disagree with Polly Toynbee – backroom deals will not be eliminated by nationalising the funding of political parties. The real issue is strengthening the rules relating to party donations, and then ensuring that they are properly enforced so that we can all see who gives what to whom, and with what end in mind. We should not be surprised that in past times Unite gave money in the hope and expectation that, for example, a national minimum wage or health and safety legislation would be introduced. And equally predictably, hedge fund managers might be attracted to a party planning to reduce the burden of regulation on financial markets. Where it becomes murkier is when money changes hands off the record, breaking the chain between donors and desired outcomes.Les BrightExeter, Devon  Polly Toynbee raises an important issue, but it is marred when she says that “Labour was always over-reliant on power-wielding union leaders” and talks of them “wielding their money bags”. The Labour party came into existence as the voice of the trade union movement, and trade union funding has always been the main source of its finances, supplemented by donations from individual socialists and socialist societies. Labour party policy was and is decided by its annual conferences. There was little occasion until after 1945 for there to be major differences between the policies supported by the trade unions at the TUC and those supported by the Labour conference. However, the 1918 Labour constitution had provided a second route for conference delegates by creating local constituency branches. It also committed Labour to socialist objectives that became a cause of conflict between the left and right of the party. Labour party history since 1945 is complicated, but the implication that the trade union movement has no right to use its financial contributions to influence Labour policy ignores the fact that the party was founded to promote the interests of the working class, and the trade unions are still its voice.Margaret MorrisLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/17/2022,"The recent Human Rights Watch report on the harm done to Cameroonian asylum seekers, both while they were trying to make their claims in the US and when repatriated in a blaze of publicity, should be required reading for all asylum decision-makers (African migrants deported in Trump era suffered abuse on return, 10 February). From my experience of helping Cameroonian torture survivors over the past 14 years, I have noted that Home Office decision-makers, and many judges, can fatally underestimate the degree of risk attached to the forcible return process, particularly as failed asylum seekers are viewed as having brought the country into disrepute and can be punished with imprisonment.  Police have to be notified in advance of impending arrivals; incriminating items might be handed over as forms of identification (eg showing the last known address as one of the country’s prisons); asylum papers can end up in their luggage, which are then handed over to immigration officers; and many returnees will have no way of getting a national ID card. They are in constant danger of being caught without a card by the police or soldiers, and are unable to get a job, accommodation, pick up money transfers or obtain a phone card. A decision to repatriate can be a matter of life or death, resulting in a return to detention and torture, or a decision being taken to go into hiding or to leave the country again. No country, realising its mistake, can magically extract asylum seekers who have been wrongly sent back and who could well be in prison. Their only hope is to leave the country in a clandestine manner, but with less likelihood of access to funds or support and with more danger of being apprehended.Jackie FearnleyGoathland, North Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/17/2022,"In her article (The Parthenon marbles belong in Greece – so why is restitution so hard to swallow?, 5 February), Charlotte Higgins acknowledges that transferring the British Museum’s Parthenon sculptures to the Acropolis Museum in Athens “would not complete anything at all, since half of the stonework is destroyed, and they will never be intact again”, and that a former director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, had said in 2006 that “repatriation is yesterday’s question”. That view was right and remains so. The Institute for Digital Archaeology’s offer to make marble facsimiles for the British Museum is shortsighted (Letters, 8 February). Facsimiles do indeed offer extraordinary cultural possibilities, but they should not be pressed as a stratagem in an already highly politicised restitution dispute.  It would be much more beneficial to make two sets of facsimiles of all the surviving Parthenon sculptures and install one on the Parthenon building itself and another in the Acropolis Museum in Athens (which was unwisely constructed on stilts above a major archaeological site in an earthquake zone). Such a project would retain the inestimable benefits of large culturally comparative museums like the British Museum and the Louvre, and help deflate regressive nationalistic calls for a kind of cultural cleansing in which all works of art are returned to their (geographical) countries of origin.Michael DaleyDirector, ArtWatch UK  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/17/2022,"The American humorist PJ O’Rourke, who has died aged 74 of lung cancer, was a writer of sharp wit that ranged from dry to lusciously over the top, but was always leavened by a measure of self deprecation that stopped it from being cruel or harsh. In the political satire that dominated his later writing, he became that rarest of things, a funny conservative. His political writing was based on his early change of tack from 1960s lefty to what he could call the libertarian right, libertarian being the escape hatch for those trapped within the Republican party. His changing stance mirrored the course of his career, from the satire of the National Lampoon and hipness of Rolling Stone to more earnest outlets such as the Atlantic Monthly and the rightwing Cato Institute.  He had been instrumental in making the Atlantic Monthly Press a success; its editor Morgan Entrekin called him “one the major voices of his generation”. The recurrent theme in his writing was his place in his generation – the baby boomers. “My generation spoiled everything for you,” he told younger readers. “It has always been the prerogative of young people to look and act weird and shock grownups. But my generation exhausted the earth’s resources of the weird ... all you had left was to tattoo your faces and pierce your tongues. Ouch. That must have hurt. I apologise.” He was born in Toledo, Ohio, to Delfine (nee Loy), a housewife and later a school administrator, and Clifford O’Rourke, a car salesman. He went to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio – “the one where you can’t major in windsurfing” – and took a master’s in English (1970) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where he began writing for a local underground paper, Harry, and the Rip-Off Review of Western Culture, which got him a gig with the National Lampoon magazine in 1973. He made his mark quickly, working on the stage show Lemmings, which made stars of John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, and co-writing with the Lampoon founder Doug Kenney The National Lampoon High School Yearbook, based on a piece by Michael O’Donoghue. There was a strong Irish-American wise-guys at the back of the class vibe at the Lampoon. Kenney also hailed from Ohio, but had attended a private school; the record of the fictional class of 1964 at a high school in Dacron (the name a cross between Ohio cities Dayton and Akron, but also a popular brand of cheap polyester cloth) was based squarely on O’Rourke’s days at Toledo’s DeVilbiss high. The yearbook itself was purportedly the property of one Larry Kroger, who would reappear in 1978 as the naive protagonist of the film National Lampoon’s Animal House. By the time Animal House became a hit, O’Rourke was the editor-in-chief of the Lampoon, charged with “the Squaresville task of making the magazine show a profit”. In the 2018 biopic of Kenney, A Futile and Stupid Gesture, O’Rourke is portrayed in just that light – but his empathy with squares was crucial to the yearbook’s success. Now he found himself out of place in a “clubby and snitty” atmosphere which remained as the creative core of the Lampoon moved on to Hollywood and Saturday Night Live. He turned the magazine, according to one critic, into “comedy you can jack off to”. In 1981 he went freelance, writing for the top-payers such as Vanity Fair and Playboy. His key Lampoon essay “How To Drive Fast on Drugs While Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink”, was reprinted in his first book, Republican Party Reptile (1987), a homage to Hunter Thompson, the chief exponent of gonzo journalism, that saw him appointed “foreign desk chief” at Rolling Stone, the ultimate hip boomer journal. His writing moved from social satire to politics and he reported from war zones, where his knack for satirising the absurd found its true metier. His 1988 collection, Holidays in Hell, is perhaps the best of his 20 books. He became a celebrity, without slowing down in the least, but as I can attest after surviving a London evening with him and my then ABC television colleague Charles Glass, O’Rourke was one of those rare people who was nicer in private, going beyond his public affability, which often surprised those expecting combative wit. In 1991 O’Rourke interviewed Bill Clinton, along with his Rolling Stone colleagues Thompson and William Greider, and its publisher, Jann Wenner. He quickly slid Clinton into identity politics via the Lampoon yearbook template. Clinton’s favourite Beatle was Paul McCartney: Clinton was the “band geek” who paid attention in class. For a short time O’Rourke held down the right side of Point/Counterpoint on CBS’s flagship news show 60 Minutes, opposite the equally funny and acerbic Molly Ivins, but they were too brilliant a mix to last on network TV. As he once wrote, “no humorist is under any obligation to provide answers”. That voice could lose its affability when writing for the Cato Institute, but the new millennium presented new problems, which his work for the Atlantic laid out clearly. A 2004 essay on listening to the radio host Rush Limbaugh shouting to his echo chamber of “ditto heads” led him to search for a leftwing equivalent, but when he could not find one he wound up blaming the entire media landscape. He complained in another essay you could not tell the “liberals who once led Vietnam protests in clown pants from the car ads”, ironically putting his young self and his father into the same boat. His libertarian conservatism reached its apotheosis with Donald Trump’s taking over the Republican party, reflected in his 2016 book of election coverage How the Hell Did This Happen? He endorsed Hillary Clinton, because “she’s wrong about absolutely everything, but she’s wrong within normal parameters”. Although he claimed in 1992 he had “given up” the 60s, Trump was exactly the sort of spoiled preppy boomer O’Rourke could despise. But he might have looked back to his childhood, and Walt Kelly’s comic strip Pogo. It was Pogo who said: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” In 1990 O’Rourke married Amy Lumet, daughter of the film director Sidney and granddaughter of the entertainer Lena Horne. They divorced three years later, and in 1995 he married Tina Mallon. She and their children, Olivia, Clifford and Elizabeth, survive him.

2/17/2022,"Children aged between five and 11 in England will be offered a Covid vaccine, the UK government has confirmed, after similar announcements from Wales and Scotland this week. The move was recommended by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which decided that the vaccination programme should be extended to younger children after lengthy discussions on the benefits and risks.  The vaccinations, described as a “non-urgent” offer by the health secretary, will be Pfizer/BioNTech. Stormont’s health minister, Robin Swann, also confirmed that Northern Ireland will mirror the move. Sajid Javid said: “The NHS will prepare to extend this non-urgent offer to all children during April so parents can, if they want, take up the offer to increase protection against potential future waves of Covid-19 as we learn to live with this virus.” While the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for five- to 11-year-olds in December, with the body concluding the jabs were is safe and effective for this group, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) previously announced that only vulnerable children in this age group would be offered a Covid jab. However, the pace of that rollout has been slow – despite the JCVI making the announcement in December, many vulnerable younger children have yet to receive their vaccination. A lack of paediatric doses has meant availability tended to initially be limited to settings with the capacity to use fractionated adult doses off-label. The latest decision extends the Covid vaccination programme to all children aged between five and 11. As with the vulnerable cohort, this wider group will be offered 10-microgram doses of the Covid jabs – a third of the amount used for adults. The decision to extend Covid jabs to younger children has involved lengthy discussions. While some scientists have argued they are necessary – citing concerns over high infection rates in schools, rising Covid-related hospitalisations in children and long Covid – others have stressed that the risk-benefit equation becomes finely balanced in younger age groups because Covid is generally a mild disease in childhood, long Covid is rarer, milder and less long-lasting than in adults, and Covid jabs are unable to prevent all transmission in any case. It was announced in September last year that children aged between 12 and 15 would be offered a Covid jab. The programme was later extended to offer a second dose with some eligible for a booster, such as those in a clinical risk group. All 16- and 17-year-olds are eligible for two doses of a Covid jab and a booster. Prof Azeem Majeed, head of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, welcomed the announcement. “The benefits of vaccination are much greater for older people than young children because of the higher risks from Covid-19 in the elderly. Nonetheless, the evidence does suggest a benefit in children also and it’s good to see the UK finally approve vaccines in five to 11-year olds, even if it has lagged behind many other countries in making this decision.” However, he added that he predicted roll out would be slow. “Many parents will have been deterred by the previous messages from the JCVI and some UK paediatricians that vaccination is only of marginal benefit in younger children, in contrast to the much stronger endorsement in the USA for example,” he said. Prof Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that the latest evidence showed that vaccination in younger age groups is safe, but that the benefits were unlikely to be great. “The risk of severe disease and long Covid in this age group was always much lower than older age groups and given the high rate of prior infections these risks are probably even lower now,” he said. “So personally I would not advise vaccination in this age group but I would not stand in the way of any parent who wants their child vaccinated.”",News/World news,Five- to 11-year-old children in England to be offered Covid vaccine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/five--to-11-year-old-children-in-england-to-be-offered-covid-vaccine
2/17/2022,"In 1953, when Norma Young was seven, her family became the first in their Glasgow tenement to get a TV set. It was a big deal – the Youngs had had to choose between a car or a TV. They opted for a 14in Ekco TV as deep as it was wide – and Norma was opened up to the world of The Woodentops and Andy Pandy, two shows that rapidly became her favourites. But at 6pm every evening the screen went blank, and Norma’s viewing was at an end. This wasn’t her parents regulating her TV time – it was the state. Abolished 65 years ago on Wednesday, the break in programming between 6pm and 7pm every night was a government policy, known colloquially as the toddlers’ truce.  Most readers under the age of 70 will probably never have heard of this peculiar artefact, but those of Norma’s vintage certainly remember it. This paternalistic approach to broadcasting was seen at the time as being socially responsible, with the idea being that a TV-free hour would, as Time magazine put it, allow parents to “wring out their moppets and put them to bed”. It was also in place to ensure that children didn’t accidentally stray into the dangerous world of adult television, where their fragile minds could be corrupted by the unutterable filth of Dixon of Dock Green or This Is Your Life. To modern parents, struggling to combat their children’s unfettered access to social media at 11pm on a school night, the idea of the toddlers’ truce might seem a trifle quaint. But in the early 1950s, it was simply accepted as part of life. “We didn’t think about it really,” says Norma. “You just got on with it. The TV stopped broadcasting at six o’clock, and that was my cue to have a bath and get into my jammies.” Admittedly, this was against a backdrop of TV that was broadcast for less than 12 hours every day. The rules (as laid out by the postmaster general, of all people) stated that the BBC (and later ITV) could broadcast between 9am and 11pm, but with only two hours shown before 1pm. The rules were even more draconian at weekends. Only eight hours of broadcasting was permitted on Saturdays, and only seven and three-quarter hours on Sundays. And on Sundays, no children’s programmes were permitted between 2pm and 4pm, lest it prevent youngsters from studying the Bible. Try getting your kid off TikTok to go and read Deuteronomy this weekend and see what happens. LP Hartley famously opened his novel The Go-Between with the line: “The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.” That was true nowhere more than television in the 1950s, and, viewed through the prism of modern sensibilities, some of the programming appears positively antediluvian. There was a children’s TV segment called Watch With Mother, the implicit message being that good mothers stayed at home while fathers went out and worked. But by the mid-50s, in spite of the prevailing conservatism of the age, the toddlers’ truce was under threat, thanks to the booming popularity of TV as a medium. In 1950, only 350,000 homes in the UK had televisions. By 1960, the figure had risen to almost three-quarters of homes. When only a handful of the population were affected by the hour’s break, it seemed an irrelevance, but when tens of millions had their entertainment interrupted, it became an issue. The second front that opened up against the toddlers’ truce came with the formation of ITV in 1955. (With Ant and Dec’s births still decades away, you wonder how they filled the airtime.) The BBC had always been rather in favour of the hour’s break. Funded by the licence fee, fewer hours of broadcast meant lower costs. But ITV was funded by advertising revenue. Having to shut down for an hour every day at 6pm denied it access to a lucrative teatime audience. And so the Independent Television Authority (ITA) began to lobby for the truce to be dropped. In the early 50s, the postmaster general had been Herbrand Sackville, the first ever hereditary peer to join the Labour party, and a cabinet minister by the age of 23. In spite of his seemingly progressive politics, he broadly agreed with the evening break in transmission. But in April 1955, he was replaced by Charles Hill, who took a rather different tack. Hill later recalled: “This restriction seemed to me absurd and I said so. It was the responsibility of parents, not the state, to put their children to bed at the right time … I invited the BBC and the ITA to agree to its abolition.” The BBC definitively did not agree to it – or even to a proposed compromise of a 30-minute break. But a groundswell of opposition was building, characterised by an editorial in the Daily Mirror that stated: “If parents can’t drag their children away from the TV screen, there is something wrong with the parents, not the TV programme.” With the BBC resolutely intransigent on the issue, Hill asked parliament to intervene, and on 31 October 1956, the abolition of the toddlers’ truce was agreed. Even then, the BBC and the ITA couldn’t agree on a date for it to finish, so Hill decided himself: Saturday 16 February 1957. The first programme the BBC broadcast in the slot was called Six-Five Special, an entertainment show with a heavy leaning towards rock’n’roll. On weekdays, the vacancy was filled by the news and current affairs show Tonight. With its informal approach, and willingness to embrace both the serious and the trivial (one early segment involved a dog that smoked a pipe), it was a precursor to The One Show, if The One Show was exclusively presented by white men in suits. The show’s presenter, Cliff Michelmore, ended each night’s broadcast with the phrase: “That’s all for tonight, the next Tonight will be tomorrow night. Until then, goodnight.” Years later, the great Alan Whicker, who cut his broadcasting teeth on Tonight, commented: “The BBC was still embedded in its civil service ethos, which took broadcasting off the air every night between 6pm and 7pm, in case viewing parents had trouble getting their children to bed. Can you imagine? We were then writing the grammar of television, so that quaint, hour-long toddlers’ truce of 1957 did not long survive Tonight’s arrival. [In fact, it preceded it by two days.] Soon, viewers were being treated as grownups, where the next Tonight was always tomorrow night and you could make your own house rules in your own home.” The toddlers’ truce was at an end. At least, almost at an end. A vestige of it survived for another year. On Sundays, transmission stopped between 6.15pm and 7.25pm, to allow viewers to attend church. By 1958, however, religious programming was allowed in what became known as the God slot. In 1961, Songs of Praise was launched. Remarkably, the fabric of the nation remained intact in spite of TV now transmitting between 6pm and 7pm at night. Indeed, an expected backlash from parents unable to get their square-eyed small people into bed never materialised. The BBC received a grand total of six complaints on the subject. Norma Young’s family were not among those who complained. While she admits that “they didn’t really enjoy us watching too much telly”, her dad was delighted. “My father loved television. He would watch any old rubbish.” When the adult programmes kicked in, Norma was sent to her bed to read – although she was occasionally allowed to stay up later to watch nature programmes presented by a nice young chap called Attenborough, still going strong 65 years later, with the toddlers’ truce now merely a strange footnote in TV history.",Arts/Television & radio,‘At 6pm every evening the screen went blank’: the outlandish tale of the UK’s TV blackout,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/16/at-6pm-every-evening-the-screen-went-blank-the-outlandish-tale-of-the-uks-tv-blackout
2/17/2022,"Thousands of baptisms at a Catholic church in Arizona have been invalidated because a priest used the wrong words in performing the ceremony. Father Andres Arango resigned from the St Gregory parish church in Phoenix earlier this month after diocese leaders discovered he had mistakenly used the phrase “we baptize you” instead of “I baptize you” for years.  His error means that countless baptisms – an irrevocable requirement for salvation in Catholic theology – will have to be performed again. And some churchgoers could find their marriages are not recognized. “An invalid baptism … invalidates any subsequent sacraments, especially confirmation, marriage, and holy orders,” the diocese of Phoenix said in a webpage intended to answer parishioners’ questions. In announcing the priest’s resignation, the bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, urged churchgoers to “join me in praying for Fr Andres and for all of those who are going to be impacted by this unfortunate situation”. The contrite Father Arango, meanwhile, has sought forgiveness in his own message to the faithful. “It saddens me to learn that I have performed invalid baptisms throughout my ministry as a priest by regularly using an incorrect formula,” he wrote. “I deeply regret my error and how this has affected numerous people in your parish and elsewhere,” adding that he would remain a priest and “dedicate my energy and full time ministry to help remedy this and heal those affected”. The fount of knowledge on the matter is the Vatican’s 2020 congregation for the doctrine of the faith, which along with declaring Covid-19 vaccines “morally acceptable” also spelled out the correct words that needed to be used during baptisms. The congregation “affirms that baptisms administered with modified formulas are invalid, including: ‘We baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’,” the Vatican announced. The declaration was deemed necessary following questions over whether such phrasing meant that three separate holy entities were involved in the baptisms, or only one. “The issue with using ‘We’ is that it is not the community that baptizes a person, rather, it is Christ, and Him alone, who presides at all of the sacraments, and so it is Christ Jesus who baptizes,” Olmsted wrote in a message posted to the Diocese of Phoenix website. “I do not believe Fr Andres had any intentions to harm the faithful or deprive them of the grace of baptism and the sacraments. On behalf of our local church, I too am sincerely sorry that this error has resulted in disruption to the sacramental lives of a number of the faithful.” He said the determination was made “after careful study by diocesan officials” and consultation with Catholic leaders in Rome. Arango, who was born in Brazil, became a priest in 1995 and moved to the US in 2001, working at one church in California, then three in the Phoenix area, most recently at St Gregory.

2/17/2022,"It was a fairly instructive evening in Paris last night. Leo Messi wandered around the Parc des Princes with a scribble of comic-strip-cloud misery constantly hovering above his head. With a faint but unmistakable air of hopelessness and ennui enveloping the poor little chap, the Fiver couldn’t help but notice his increasing resemblance to Charlie Brown. When he missed that penalty, we found ourselves hitting rewind, just to double check whether Lucy had moved the ball just before he kicked it. Good grief.  Fortunately for Paris Saint-Germain, just as Messi was working through his existential crises, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé combined in the last minute of injury time to give the French side a slender first-leg advantage against Real Madrid and dig their teammate out of his penalty-hell hole. It felt epochal, though there was less a sense of the simple passing of a torch, more of one being cheekily back-flicked down the wing then confidently swept through someone’s legs in the circus-troupe style. Fortunately the torch handed over by Messi had nearly gone out, so there was never any real danger of Thibaut Courtois’ low-hanging fruit being accidentally flambéed. There was also the sense that if Manchester City ever get a shot at either of these otherwise ponderous teams, things could get ugly at warp speed. City utterly eviscerated Sporting in Lisbon, the tie as good as over in half an hour. Bernardo Silva in particular enjoyed himself, his two goals silencing the boos of fans who simply can’t forget his legendary stint at arch-rivals Benfica, for whom he made three appearances as a 19-year-old. Only a fool – or Thomas Tuchel, who has their number – would want to draw City in the next round. Big Cup continues!

The Real Madrid head honcho is “very clear that the Italian is not the right person to rebuild” the club, according to Sport. Pep Guardiola insists Manchester City have plenty of room for improvement after their Big Cup thrashing of Sporting. “The result is a dream, but the performance – we can do better,” bragged Guardiola. City are also in early talks with Bernardo Silva to extend his contract, with the midfielder absolutely running things in Lisbon.

Dundee have sent manager James McPake skidding through the Door Marked Do One, despite back-to-back recent victories. The good news for McPake is that, with Tannadice just 200 yards down the road, he might end up at Dundee United if his former club threw him hard enough.

2/17/2022,"In a reversal of its previous policy, the Coachella music festival will not require Covid-19 vaccination, testing or masking when it resumes this April in southern California, the organizers said. The hugely popular festival saw up to 125,000 attendees leading up to the start of pandemic, during which it was cancelled three times.  On Tuesday, Coachella and its sister festival, Stagecoach, due to take place the following week, announced the lifted restrictions on their websites. “As we prepare to spend an incredible weekend in the desert together we are announcing that there will be no vaccination, testing or masking requirements at Stagecoach 2022, in accordance with local guidelines,” the festival organizer said on its Twitter account. Similarly, Coachella updated the health and safety section of its website, and added: “There is no guarantee, express or implied, that those attending the festival will not be exposed to Covid-19”. It emphasized that Covid-19 is “an extremely contagious disease” and went on to recommend face coverings for concert-goers – though claiming it was doing so to help them protect themselves against desert dust. Both festivals are run by Goldenvoice, a division of the international concert organizer AEG Live, and are held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, within weeks of each other. California’s department of public health strongly recommends that outdoor mega-events, such as music festivals or marathons, require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. It also asks attendees to “consider better fit and filtration for masks”, and recommends more effective alternatives to cloth masks, including N95, KN95 and KF94 surgical masks. The new decision marks a reversal of policy. Last October, the festivals’ organizers said they would require attendees to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a negative test. This year’s incarnation of Coachella, which is scheduled to run on the weekends of 15-17 and 22-24 April , will be headlined by Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and Ye, while Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Luke Combs will headline Stagecoach, which runs from 29 April to May 1. Last summer the Chicago-based musical festival Lollapalooza operated at full capacity, ushering in more than 400,000 concertgoers who were required to show either vaccination proof or a negative Covid-19 test. Lollapalooza organizers subsequently released data that it claimed showed infection rates were low among attendees, and declared that the festival was not a “super-spreader event”.",Arts/Music,Coachella and sister festival Stagecoach lift Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/16/coachella-covid-restrictions-lifted-stagecoach-music-festivals
2/17/2022,"The price that Prince Andrew will pay for settling the Virginia Giuffre civil lawsuit will go far beyond the reported millions it has cost him financially. As he celebrates his 62nd birthday on Saturday, the duke will undoubtedly contemplate what a future without the red carpet and royal trappings he has enjoyed since birth will actually look like.  “He has been de-royaled. He has now got to live a private life, and any suggestion he could return to public life is delusional,” said Robert Lacey, a royal historian. Once called the “playboy prince”, who was feted for the part he played in the Falklands War, Andrew was part of the international jet-set. Photographs of him aboard luxury yachts surrounded by beautiful women earned him the soubriquet “Randy Andy”. He swapped that for “Air Miles Andy” when, as a roving business ambassador for brand UK, royal accounts revealed a life of first-class travel, private jets and helicopters to golf courses. His connections with controversial foreign figures – including politicians in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tunisia, Libya and Turkmenistan – also raised concerns. His relations with Timur Kulibayev, a son-in-law of the then-president of Kazakhstan, were also scrutinised after Kulibayev bought the duke’s Sunninghill Park home for £3m more than its £12m asking price in 2007. Simon Wilson, Britain’s deputy head of mission in Bahrain from 2001 to 2005, wrote in the Daily Mail that the duke was “more commonly known among the British diplomatic community in the Gulf as HBH: His Buffoon Highness”. “The problem has been his judgments and his friendships,” said Lacey. “The price is total obscurity. If you are looking outside the royal family for a parallel, John Profumo, who suffered abject disgrace at the time of the Profumo affair, actually through totally private quiet charity work eventually redeemed himself in the eyes of himself, his friends and in due course the world. “It’s an existential challenge for Andrew. He’s got to reinvent himself.” He added: “The problem with Andrew is he is a dreadful reminder of the distinction between the family and the institution, and a reminder that the institution is ultimately more valuable than the family, and the family are only custodians of the institution.” Andrew may attend next month’s thanksgiving service for his father, Prince Philip. “He has a right as a family member and the family has a duty to accept him on family occasions,” said Lacey. “And the challenge for the royal family is those occasion are public.” Andrew has always denied Giuffre’s allegations. The settlement statement does not dispute them, nor admit them. Lacey believes Andrew is unlikely to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the platinum jubilee. “That’s the occasion when the institution outweigh the family”. Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, said of Andrew’s future: “My guess is he will do now what he’s been doing for the last two years, seemingly not very much, certainly not in public. We would occasionally see him out riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle and driving in and out of Royal Lodge. And that was pretty much it.” The riding was to improve his performance in his role as colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a position he has since lost, so he would be able to take part in the trooping the colour birthday parade. “Well, clearly, there is no longer a need to do that,” said Little. Golf has always been Andrew’s passion. He was captain of the Royal and Ancient, but has been forced to give membership of that up, too. Little said: “He can continue to play golf, but in a private capacity. There is a golf course at Windsor Castle so he could do that in total privacy. But that is no more than a pastime for him nowadays, whereas it previously had a wider meaning. His positions meant he could travel around the country to use the various golf courses.” Of Andrew’s promise to support victims’ right, Little added: “How will that manifest itself? Will he attach himself to a charity for that purpose? Given that he has a very tarnished reputation, do charities want the Queen’s second son these days? I am inclined to think that they won’t. “Will it help to rehabilitate him? I’m not sure it will. I think we are past that point now, and I think he’s reputation is so badly dented there is no coming back, certainly in any public role.” Without a trial to totally clear his name, and unable to speak about details of the settlement, “there will always people who wonder about his guilt or innocence, and he can’t do a darn thing about it. It will be with him for the rest of his life”. Hugo Vickers, a royal historian, said: “I think it’s been established he is not going to do any more royal duties. One, it’s been said, and secondly, unfortunately innocent or guilty, they don’t want him any more. He’s tarnished.” “I don’t think he is going to do anything more in the royal world, or the world of regiments or charities, because he is not a help to them, so he has to do something else. “He would be well advised to buy himself a house in his own name, because as far as I know Royal Lodge doesn’t actually belong to him and it’s not impossible he might be asked to move by somebody in the future. “And I’ve always said he ought to open an animal sanctuary, or do something with animals, because that’s what the British public love. It will be interesting to see where he is in five years’ time.”",News/UK news,‘De-royaled’ Prince Andrew unlikely to return to public life,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/de-royaled-prince-andrew-unlikely-to-return-to-public-life
2/17/2022,"Private rents in the UK are rising at the fastest rate in five years, ratcheting up the cost of living burden on millions of households. The average cost of renting for UK tenants rose by 2% in 2021 – the largest annual increase since 2017, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Soaring rental prices, coupled with inflation hitting 5.5% in January, will pile further pressure on the government to increase support for vulnerable families.  The east Midlands had the biggest increase in average rental prices, with tenants paying 3.6% more than a year earlier, while London had the smallest, 0.1%, as demand for city flats dwindled during lockdown and people favoured working remotely outside the capital. Renters including office workers and students are now flocking back to cities, pushing up rental prices. Demand has outpaced supply and 71% fewer homes were available on London’s rental market in December compared with typical levels a year earlier. Osama Bhutta, campaign director at the housing charity Shelter, said: “Our services are already hearing from people who are struggling to pay their rent and keep the lights on. Covid-era protections are now gone, and if you struggle to pay your rent you face eviction and homelessness. The government should reverse the damaging welfare cuts that are pushing people into impossible choices.” Calls for government action came after the insurer Legal & General announced it would spend an extra £2.5bn on its “build to rent” schemes over the next five years. The company is aiming to provide more than 7,000 purpose-built rental homes in UK towns and cities in a move to cash in on the booming market. Dan Batterton, the head of build to rent at L&G, said while the £2.5bn would not “solve the housing crisis”, it was part of the solution, funnelling new investment from pension funds into creating well-managed homes. “We’re looking at 40-year cashflow for these assets, so we are incentivised to build homes that will keep people happy in the long term. We want to make renting an aspirational option,” he added. Rent increases on L&G blocks are capped at 5% for five years. “Our bulk buying power can bring down costs: from building workspaces so people can run businesses from their homes to offering car-sharing schemes,” said Batterton. The property website Zoopla found newly advertised rental prices were rising much faster across the UK. It said the average rent jumped 8.3% in the final three months of 2021 to £969 a month. House prices across the country also hit record highs, ONS data showed. The average price of a UK home was £275,000 in December, 10.8% higher than a year earlier. The increase was the biggest in almost two decades. Darren Baxter, policy manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Something is not right when the average house price in the UK has increased during the pandemic by more than the average full-time worker earned last year. “Renters searching for a new tenancy will struggle as rents in some areas have risen as much as 8%. Despite this, housing benefit has been frozen for two years. To address this, the government must urgently relink housing benefit to the real cost of renting.”",Lifestyle/Money,Fastest rent rise in five years adds to concerns over UK cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/16/fastest-rent-rise-in-five-years-uk-cost-of-living-crisis-house-price
2/17/2022,"Tax cuts planned to take effect in 2024-25 are highly regressive and would pay male beneficiaries twice as much as women, separate analyses by the Australia Institute, the Greens and the Australian Council of Social Service have found. The so-called stage-three tax cuts will remove the 37 cents in the dollar tax bracket, lower the 32.5 cent bracket to 30 cents, and raise the top tax bracket to start at $200,000 compared with $180,000 now. All up, the cuts will cost about $184bn over the first decade, the groups said.  According to the Australia Institute’s analysis of tax office data, someone earning $200,000 a year would receive $174 a week in tax relief, or 73 times the benefit of those earning $50,000 who would save just $2.40 a week. Since men dominate the highest income tallies, with twice as many in the top bracket as women, they also end up grabbing the lion’s share of the tax relief. “This means that for every $1 of the tax cut that women get men get $2,” the Australia Institute said. “We can see those men in the top 10% of taxpayers get almost 40% of the tax cut,” it said. “Women in the top 10% of taxpayers get only 15% of the tax cut because there are much fewer women in the top 10%.” The bottom 40% of taxpayers – a group in which women outnumber men – receive just 2% of the tax cut. “The stage-three tax cuts will only serve to further entrench wealth inequality between men and women,” Matt Grudnoff, a researcher at the Australia Institute, said. Analysis done for the Greens by the parliamentary budget office delivered similar findings, with the average annual tax cut for a man assessed to be $1,430, or almost twice as much as for a woman at $730. Currently 3.5% of taxpayers occupy the top tax bracket for those earning more than $180,000 a year. This group stands to gain 45% of the tax savings. In 2024-25, the first year of operation, the top 1% of income earners would save $1.3bn in taxes, or almost twice the $700m saved by the entire bottom 60% of earners. Over the first decade, that top 1% would pocket $11.8bn compared with $12.7bn for those lower 60% of earners, the PBO assessment found. The $184bn cost to the budget over the decade amounts to more than triple the sum spent by the Rudd-Gillard Labor government to shield Australia during the global financial crisis, Greens leader Adam Bandt said. “Liberal and Labor have agreed to kill Australia’s progressive tax system,” Bandt said. “This great leap rightwards is a trickle-down disaster for the country.” If the Greens secure the balance of power after this year’s election, they would “push the next government to keep Australia’s progressive tax system and make billionaires pay more tax”, he said. Guardian Australia approached treasurer Josh Frydenberg for comment. Earlier this month, Frydenberg’s office circulated “unpublished” treasury data showing the government’s personal income tax plan had already delivered more than $14.4bn in tax relief to more than 5.2m women since the 2018-19 fiscal year to the end of 2021. “On average each Australian woman was $3,130 better off as a result of our tax cuts, with younger women the greater beneficiaries. Those under 24 had seen the amount of tax paid decline by more than 20%, the largest proportion of any cohort,” Frydenberg’s office said. Labor MPs used Senate estimates on Wednesday to seek access to Treasury’s calculations on those changes to assess their accuracy. Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) CEO Cassandra Goldie said the use of percentage changes gave “the impression that women and young people gain a lot more from tax cuts than they actually do”. “People on lower incomes don’t pay much income tax because their wages are already so low,” Goldie said. For instance, a woman working part-time on $600 a week pays $40 in tax. A $10 weekly tax cut amounted to a quarter reduction in tax but just 1.6% of her income. The stage-three tax cuts would only reinforce gender income inequities because they advantage people already in paid work and those with higher incomes, Goldie said. “Over three-quarters [78%] of the value of stage three of the tax cuts starting in 2024 will go to the top 20% by income on $102,000 or more, and only one-third will go women,” she said, citing analysis provided to Acoss by the PBO. Acoss wants the major parties to drop the “damaging, unfair and unaffordable tax cuts” and guarantee essential services instead.",News/Australia news,"Men on high incomes to take lion’s share of Coalition’s $184bn tax cuts, analyses find",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/men-on-high-incomes-to-take-lions-share-of-coalitions-184bn-tax-cuts-analyses-find
2/17/2022,"The outgoing Liberal MP, John Alexander, says he would “seriously consider” supporting Helen Haines’s bill for a federal integrity commission if the independent member for Indi again attempts to have the draft legislation debated by parliament before the election. On Tuesday, the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, confirmed the government was “not progressing” its proposed commonwealth integrity commission until at least after the election, saying the government could not pass it without Labor support.  This means the government will go to the election having broken its 2019 election commitment for an integrity commission, despite first releasing a bill for such a body in November 2020 and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, indicating last week there was still time to introduce it. Alexander, who has called for a bipartisan approach to establishing a federal anti-corruption body, told Guardian Australia he had “missed his chance” when Haines moved to debate her bill last month and the Tasmanian MP Bridget Archer crossed the floor in support. “I thought she was very, very brave. I think we’ve seen a lot of brave women lately, and maybe not enough brave men,” Alexander said. “At that point [of the vote], in this strange world without our advisers here, I wasn’t actually aware when that happened … so I wasn’t prepared and I missed my chance. But I think what she did was very, very brave and it was a statement that we want to move this forward.” Were it not for the Covid restrictions governing parliament, Haines would have secured the absolute majority required to suspend standing orders and debate her anti-corruption bill, which was also supported by the cross-bench, Labor and the Greens. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While saying he thought it was a “moot point” and it was unlikely Haines would have another chance to debate her bill with only one sitting week of parliament left before the election, Alexander said he reserved his right to cross the floor. “We on our side have the right to do that, but I think at this time, it’s unlikely to happen,” he said. “I won’t tell you what I would do [if Haines tried again], that’s between me, myself and I. “I certainly would think about it, but I really do dislike playing politics with things. It’s something to be seriously considered, but I’ve got to seriously consider also that we have put a bill forward and it’s been redrafted several times, and there’s been serious effort put in.” Alexander said he was disappointed the government’s bill had not been introduced, saying he believed leaders of both parties needed to “put their heads together” and come up with a proposal that could be sustained “for generations”. “Probably the most fundamental thing you expect of your elected leaders is honesty and integrity, and so it is absolutely fundamental,” he said. “Get together, instead of having a war and then having a peace treaty afterwards – get together, work things out and at least get something we can start with. “And then that can get added to as one party gets into power, they might add a little change, and it will evolve into something that is serviceable. The endless debate and then the just personal attacks that continue every day are not productive.” Haines said on Wednesday the government’s failure to introduce a bill indicated its fear of transparency. “We have a Coalition government who are dead scared of having an integrity commission and they’re doing everything they can to make sure we don’t have one,” Haines told ABC radio. “The bill has never been introduced … what they’ve put out is an exposure draft. People have come to this in good faith trying to improve what was a very flimsy proposition. The government didn’t engage.” In question time, Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, asked about Morrison’s claim last week that a the national anticorruption commission could be legislated before the election. “Now the attorney general has confirmed the government will not put legislation to parliament this term. Why won’t the prime minister do his job and deliver an anticorruption commission?” Dreyfus asked. Morrison said: “We’ve tabled our legislation for that integrity commission. The Labor Party don’t support it, and that’s why it’s not proceeding.”",News/Australia news,Liberal John Alexander ‘would think about’ supporting independent’s federal anti-corruption bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/liberal-john-alexander-would-think-about-supporting-independents-federal-anti-corruption-bill
2/17/2022,"The ABC is an unbiased and “independent source of truth” and must not be undermined by political or commercial forces, the ABC managing director, David Anderson, has declared in a passionate defence of the public broadcaster. In a book published on Thursday, Now More Than Ever: Australia’s ABC, Anderson outlined the breadth and depth of the ABC’s output and its “overwhelming” influence on Australian life, saying “the critics don’t deter us”.  “We know that for democracy to flourish, a nation’s citizens must have an independent source of truth they can turn to – one that is unwavering, unbiased, and committed to providing the accurate, relevant information they need,” Anderson wrote. “This is the core role played by the ABC. And any attempts to interfere with, or undermine, the independence of the ABC, by either political or commercial players, must and will be resisted at all costs.” Any attacks on the ABC’s legitimacy, or interference in its operations, will always be resisted by the vast majority of Australians who love the institution, he said. Anderson’s heartfelt defence of the ABC’s value and its independence comes a week after the Morrison government demanded that the ABC and SBS add a new layer of accountability, so-called statements of expectations, on top of the broadcasters’ already rigorous reporting requirements to parliament. Anderson told Senate estimates on Wednesday that some of the information the Coalition has demanded will not be handed over because of commercial in confidence and privacy concerns. In the book, the ABC veteran said support comes from a wide range of people who use the services: Australians who rely on the broadcaster’s Covid-10 information; those in regional and rural areas who rely on news reports for their safety during extreme weather events; and those who value the public-interest journalism that leads to royal commissions and changes in legislation. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The ABC matters to Indigenous Australians, who for so long did not see their own stories in our national narrative, but who now proudly declare and stand by their contributions and drive the conversations on reconciliation and better lives for their communities,” he said. Although the government has restored the ABC’s indexation – which reduced the budget by $84m over 3 years – in real terms ABC funding is 30% lower than it was in the mid-1980s. “This year, the ABC’s operational funding is more than 10% lower in real terms compared [with] 2013–14,” he said. “Meanwhile, our regular critics in the Australian media continue their campaign to try to discredit the ABC as an institution.” There is a dangerous right wing agenda internationally to “defund” public broadcasters, including in Canada and the United Kingdom, which is fuelled by social media, Anderson said. While it is often under attack, the ABC has a lot to be positive about, including being the country’s leading digital news source, No 1 national radio network and No 1 daytime channel for Australian children as well as being the country’s most trusted source of news and analysis.

2/17/2022,"Australians eager to travel overseas and reunite with loved ones after two years of pandemic border restrictions are facing expensive international air fares, with a new analysis showing prices have surged by an average of more than 50% across all destinations compared with pre-pandemic travel. Many airlines cut all services and closed down local offices at the peak of strict quarantine arrival caps in 2021 As they slowly rebuild and resume services to the country, the cost of international travel to and from Australia is expected to remain high.  International airlines are operating about a fifth of the number of passenger services into Australia compared to pre-pandemic levels – not factoring in Western Australia, where traffic is 1% – according to the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia. Prices for economy seats are on average 54% above pre-pandemic levels, according to data from travel website KAYAK provided to Guardian Australia. The data was based on searches for flights between 1 February and 13 February that were departing within 180 days of the search date. New Delhi was the most searched for international destination in early February by Australians looking to book holidays, with airline tickets to the Indian capital among the most overpriced when compared with pre pandemic costs, the data shows. The average price of a return economy flight to New Delhi is currently $1,584, up from an average of $1,025 in February 2020. Bali is the second most sought-after international destination among Australians, with return flights to Denpasar costing an average of $622. Air fares to Bali are among the closest to pre-pandemic costs, just 13% more expensive than in February 2020 on average. Flights to London – the third most searched destination by Australians in February so far – cost an average of $1,832 for a return ticket. In February 2020, the average cost was $1,477. Manila is the fourth most searched for destination, with a return average air fare costing $1,352. This is up 81% on pre-pandemic prices, when an average fare cost $746 in February 2020. Australians are also eager to travel to New Zealand – which still has tight Covid entry rules in place but has announced it will accept Australian tourists from 27 February – with flights to Auckland the sixth most sought-after destination. Return tickets cost an average of $674, up 46% on pre-pandemic levels The average cost of a return ticket to Los Angeles costs $1,666, up from $1,074 in February 2020. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Many international airlines have announced the resumption of some Australian routes and increased frequency on others since the Morrison government announced it would reopen the country’s borders to allow all remaining visa holders, including tourists, to enter from 21 February. In the days following the announcement searches for flights to Australia increased by 80%, with most searches originating in the UK, the US and South Korea. People hoping to travel to Australia face slightly cheaper air fares, with KAYAK data showing prices of return fares with an inbound first leg are on average about 40% higher than pre-pandemic costs. Dr Tony Webber, of the University of New South Wales’ aviation school, said he expects air fares to remain high for “at least four or five years”. Webber, who is also the chief executive of the Airline Intelligence and Research group and a former chief economist at Qantas, said this is partly due to the huge financial hit that airlines have taken throughout Covid. “The airlines are still repairing their balance sheets, they’ve had no profits the past few years, so they need to charge more on tickets, they need to squeeze more revenue out of customers.” “If you’ve got 80% fewer seats available, but much more demand for seats, then the prices have to be higher,” Webber said. “The airlines won’t immediately ramp up services to match demand, because it’s still so uncertain and risky, they’ll be conservative in returning supply.” Webber added that fuel costs – which plummeted at the beginning of the pandemic – have risen again and are now about 20% above pre-pandemic levels, contributing to higher air fares. Webber predicted that the high cost of international flying would drive more Australian tourists to take domestic flights – which have resumed at a much faster rate than international levels – with increased demand potentially driving up local air fares too. Meanwhile, Qantas has angered some local travellers, with a recent booking glitch resulting in a holding charge for the cost of some flights being placed on some customers’ credit cards, despite already deducting the cost of the fare at the time of purchase. One affected customer, who did not want to named, told Guardian Australia “as a result, we are overdrawn on our credit card and unable to make purchases until the three-to-seven days it takes to fix”. It is understood the glitch affected a small number of customers, with Qantas aiming to clear the holding costs within a week. A Qantas spokesperson has defended recent criticism from customers with flight credit vouchers who claimed their credits were not sufficient to cover the cost of a new fare on an identical route. She said that the issue affected customers who, from 1 October, booked a flight but chose not to go on it despite the service going ahead. She explained that while the airline made its traditional fare rules more flexible earlier in the pandemic, it has since “put some of those rules back”, which meant customers who asked for a flight credit could only rebook on services of an equal cost.",News/Business,Australian travellers facing expensive international air fares for at least ‘four or five years’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/australian-travellers-facing-expensive-international-air-fares-for-at-least-four-or-five-years
2/17/2022,"On Wednesday morning, the Treasury secretary, Dr Steven Kennedy, appeared before the Senate estimates economics committee. It became very clear from the shadow finance minister, Senator Katy Gallagher, and her opposite, Senator Simon Birmingham, that interest rates are going to be a big factor in the election campaign. To an extent you can understand why – the latest market expectations for rate rises have increased sharply over the past month.  At the start of January, the market expected at most the cash rate getting raised to 0.75% by the end of the year. Now the market expects the Reserve Bank to raise the cash rate five times by the end of the year up to 1.25% and to 2.0% by June next year: If the graph does not display please click here Even worse for the government, the market rates it a 50:50 chance that the RBA will increase rates on 2 May – right in the middle of the election campaign. I actually think this is unlikely, because I suspect the Reserve Bank will wait to see the March quarter wages figures, which only come out on 18 May. But even if interest rate don’t go up in May, Gallagher’s question of whether interest rates will go up before the election and the awkward rebuttals by Birmingham demonstrate that this remains a potent political issue. Which, to be honest, is quite weird. Has anyone noticed that the cash rate is at 0.1% and that if it remains there that means not only is inflation not rising, but neither are wages? Shouldn’t we want wages to rise by more than 3%? Questions about interest rates always go to the issue of the budget deficit and government debt – and the belief that deficits and growing debt levels lead to increased interest rates. And yet what we have seen since the global financial crisis and especially through the pandemic is that government spending has been the big driver of economic growth. The Grattan Institute asserts that the combination of fiscal spending and the extraordinary monetary policy of buying bonds and cutting the cash rate to 0.1% added over $5,000 to Australia’s GDP per capita. My colleagues at the Centre for Future Work, Jim Stanford and Alison Pennington, sagely note that this spending not just “stabilised macroeconomic conditions” but also demonstrated that “governments were not restrained (at least initially) by conventional concerns about the impacts of these enormous interventions on either fiscal balances or on the purported ‘incentive to work’.” The jobkeeper program and increased jobseeker rate showed that not only is poverty largely a government choice but so too is the unemployment rate, while programs like “work for the dole” are more about politics than economics. On Wednesday, the Treasury secretary talked of the generational opportunity to reach full employment, which given we are in a pandemic should have us wondering what we have been doing over the past decade. Because what we had been doing was worrying too much about the debt and deficit. After the GFC, the ALP government sought to get back to a budget surplus and slowed public demand: If the graph does not display please click here This desire was shared with the following Coalition government. And so the view that a budget surplus equals better economic managers saw Australia’s domestic economy falter. In 11 out of the 14 years before the GFC, Australia’s gross national expenditure grew by more than 4%; in the 12 years since, it has happened just once – back in 2011-12. No doubt in the election campaign we will hear about how the Coalition government has increased net debt from $156bn in 2012-13 to a forecast of $915bn in 2024-25. But would we wish it otherwise? That spending has prevented a long recession and has alleviated poverty at a time when, had the labour market been left to itself, the unemployment rate would have hit 14% rather than peaking at 7.4%: If the graph does not display please click here If you were still wondering if Keynes was right when it came to how governments should act during economic downturns, the Covid pandemic was the biggest economic mic drop. But what about all that debt? Here in Australia, government debt is expected to reach over 37% of GDP, and yet the interest repayments are expected to be a mere 0.7% of GDP – the same level they were in the Coalition government’s first year of office in 2013-14: If the graph does not display please click here Ahh yes, but wait till interest rates go up, I hear. Except, well, they are not really going up all that much. Given the recent surge in inflation, it’s not surprising that both here and in the US, government bond yields (ie interest rates) have risen since the pandemic nadir: If the graph does not display please click here And yet both are still around 2.0% for a 10-year loan – historically low and below long-term inflation targets. The Treasury secretary is right to suggest that full employment is within our grasp. And yet without continued government support and investment, hopes for productivity gains that will lead to improved economic and wages growth will dissipate. When in 2007 interest rates were rising, Kevin Rudd was right to suggest “this reckless spending must stop”. And the Morrison government certainly has shown a knack for reckless spending. But stopping reckless spending does not mean stopping government stimulus, and it would be a sad thing if the economic debate in the election is stoked by fears about rising interest rates and about which party will have lower debt levels.",News/Business,Interest rate rises will drive Australia’s election campaign – and may come bang in the middle of it | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/feb/17/interest-rate-rises-will-drive-australias-election-campaign-and-may-come-bang-in-the-middle-of-it
2/17/2022,"On the night Bob Hawke died, the John Curtin hotel in Melbourne’s inner north was packed – its usual crowd of trendy twentysomethings rubbing shoulders with old trade unionists and ex-journos. Armed with cans of lager named in his honour, the Curtin was the natural place for mourners to remember Hawke, who in the heyday of the 1970s when he was ACTU president, would roll into the pub every Friday evening.  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, was there, as was the former Labor premier Steve Bracks and the then federal Labor leader Bill Shorten. A photo of the three of them drinking their Hawke lagers under a black-and-white portrait of the former prime minister is now proudly displayed on the pub’s website. Now, the 150-year-old building is being sold to developers, and though its future is uncertain, the music venue’s operators have confirmed its time as a pub has come to an end. “It’s with an agonisingly sad heart, that The John Curtin hotel’s time on this earth will come to an end,” the hotel published to its Facebook page on Tuesday evening. “The owners … have decided to sell, making way, most likely for apartments.” “We have a lease until the end of November this year. Beyond that, we have no idea what the developers will have planned for us.” This place can’t be made into appartments.It’s a Melb. Labour Movement institution.We must save it! pic.twitter.com/xLJ0A7lC1O Located across the road from Victoria’s Trades Hall in Carlton and named after another former Labor prime minister, the John Curtin hotel has always been a favourite for party members. Students, unionists and journos have downed Coopers green at its shadowed booths for decades, though it was in the 70s the pub made its name as the preferred watering hole of Bob Hawke. Hawke’s daughter, Sue Pieters-Hawke, remembers as a child “sitting up at the old wooden bar with all these blokes”. “It was Dad’s watering hole, his second home,” she says. “It was a source of a lot of joy for Dad and a lot of joy, and occasional grief, for his family.” “Dad’s drinking was a source of trouble at times … but it was also how he got to know the trade union movement and form connections. He made amazing friendships at the Curtin, often across factional lines.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Barry Donovan worked as industrial relations reporter for the Age and the Herald Sun during Hawke’s tenure as ACTU president. The back bar was where journalists sourced their stories, and the front bar was for the builders and labourers. “The most important part of the Curtin was the people involved,” Donovan says. “The geography of it – opposite the Trades Hall, in the increasingly vibrant Carlton at the beginning of Lygon Street, with restaurants, theatre, drama. The Curtin was the starting point.” Donovan remembers one Friday evening when Hawke was considering his future at the bar. Many wanted him to continue as a union advocate while others thought he should move on to Canberra. “He asked me privately what I thought. I said, ‘Bob, you should go as far as you think you can go’. He looked at me, nodded and said ‘OK’. Subsequent to that, he ran for the seat of Wills and got endorsed.” Shorten came on the scene in the late 80s. While he may have missed out on the pub’s “wildest adventures”, the Curtin remained a vibrant hub in the Victorian trade union movement up until the early 90s. “You’re brought up on legends of arguments and beers had,” he says. “The dispersion of unions from around Trades Hall meant its political connections ebbed, but there were fights, arguments, tears, and many pots of beer consumed there.” More recently, the Curtin has cemented its legacy as one of Melbourne’s best live music venues, with its curtained band room home to sweaty punk gigs, electronic nights and folk ballads. The Victorian Trades Hall Council on Wednesday flagged its intention to raise the more than $6m required to save the hotel. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me overnight to say how important it is. I know some people are talking about ‘could we crowdfund it?’,” the Trades Hall secretary, Luke Hilakari, told ABC radio. “We’ll need some large people investing, but this is something we just can’t let go.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app A spokesperson says the Curtin means a lot to generations of unionists who have fond memories of returning to the pub after large rallies. “The old guard still come down and reminisce about the bad old days, mingling with kids who just love the Curtin’s music scene,” they say. “It’s a place for plotting industrial mischief and celebrating wins – the road between John Curtin and Trades Hall was the scene of a seriously great party after the marriage equality vote.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Wednesday he could not comment on the future of the site but would like to see an “optimistic future” given the history of the “first-class establishment”. Current band booker Paris Martine says staff will keep fighting for the Curtin and other live music venues in Melbourne. “These are our community meeting places … the places we danced half-naked on the bar til the wee hours of the morning to celebrate the legalisation of same-sex marriage,” Martine posted on Facebook. “The place we met partners and made friendships … places for debate, for politics … places of arts and culture where you saw an act you came to love.” For Pieters-Hawke, the heyday of the Curtin in the 70s may have long since passed, the blokey, male culture no longer as dominant, the influence of the union movement on national politics lessened. But the memories of such “a rich time” remain strong. “It was a home away from home for Dad,” she says. “A place of not just drinking and bullshit but ideas, real debate, formulations of policy and action.”",News/Australia news,"‘We just can’t let go’: sadness as Bob Hawke’s watering hole, the Curtin hotel, set to close",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/we-just-cant-let-go-sadness-as-bob-hawkes-watering-hole-the-curtin-hotel-set-to-close
2/17/2022,"The ratio of gnarly infections and guts-splaying mayhem per screen minute is an important metric for zombie movies. While I am yet to analyse the data in a scientifically sound way, I can confidently declare that, on these merits, Wyrmwood: Apocalypse is a resounding success. The film is a perversely colourful, visually energetic and proudly splatterific sequel to its 2015 predecessor, a lean and mean midnight movie that, while stuffed with familiar genre elements, had a couple of rare or rare-ish distinguishing features.  The first is simply that it was an Australian zombie movie. There have been few others, including Cargo, which saw a freshly bitten Martin Freeman stumbling around the Australian outback, desperately looking to find somebody to care for his baby before he turned into a flesh-muncher. And the 2003 film Undead included perhaps the funniest line ever spoken in a zombie film: “When I was a kid we respected our parents, we didn’t fuckin’ eat them!” The second rare element in Wyrmwood was more about how it was created, rather than the film itself. It arrived with an inspiring behind-the-scenes story of go-for-broke young artists and siblings Kiah and Tristan Roache-Turner, who self-financed the production and shot it on weekends. The film eventually found an audience – including many people who pirated it online (a bit of a mixed blessing). Now we have a sequel, which has a bigger budget, more impressive inventions, better sets and bad-arse vehicles that continue a long line of bizarro Australian movie cars à la The Cars that Ate Paris and Mad Max. Wyrmwood: Apocalypse throws us headfirst into the action, with gnarly, blood-red opening credits accompanied by a variety of awful sounds. Rhys (Luke McKenzie) – the twin of a character who died in the first movie – emerges from a ramshackle hideout, surrounded by the undead, many of whom he has imprisoned to use as lab rats, pets and even a boxing sparring partner. He is clearly a self-sufficient loner, until he must grudgingly team up with others to rescue a half-human, half-zombie Indigenous girl, Grace (Tasia Zalar). Rhys had delivered Grace to the wicked “Surgeon General” (Nicholas Boshier), who he believes is working on a cure to the virus. But Grace’s sister Maxi (Shantae Barnes Cowan) throws cold water on Rhys’s assumption that the people he’s mingling with – despite looking as evil as they come – are working for the betterment of (an admittedly pulverised) society. The Roache-Turners (with Kiah directing, writing and editing, and Tristan writing and producing) wear their genre influences on their sleeves and seem almost proud of their film’s unoriginality. There are bitumen-licking Mad Maxian road shots and laboratory scenes informed by Romero’s Day of the Dead, among others. In the latter scenes, Boshier (whose work in front and behind the camera includes Bondi Hipsters and Beached Az) carves it up as the scene-stealing Surgeon General, bringing manic, eye-bulging intensity to his mad scientist character, with enjoyably crazy results. One especially entertaining scene involves this evil bastard donning a VR-esque device that allows him to operate a dead body remotely. McKenzie delivers the kind of lead performance that doesn’t tend to get many plaudits – mostly because we’ve seen this character so many times before – but he brings a commanding presence. As does Barnes Cowan, delivering a kick-arse performance as Maxi: tough, gritty and zero tolerance for bullshit. Maxi and Grace would make good choices for the subjects of a spin-off movie. Kiah Roache-Turner keeps the camera moving and the cuts regular, setting a cracking energy that’s particularly important for midnight movies like this, concerned more with relishing carnage than telling a story. What matters most in Ozploitation films, of which this production is a spiritual descendent, is atmosphere and energy: watching them feels like sticking your head out the window of a fast-moving car. Film-makers find a true sweet spot when combining this feel with a great narrative – which Wyrmwood: Apocalypse doesn’t have, though it’s a bit of fun nonetheless.

2/17/2022,"Few Australians would realise just how close the recent bushfires came to destroying one of the most valuable art collections in the country. During Australia’s devastating black summer of 2020, the flames came within 1km of Arthur Boyd’s historic place of residence, threatening a collection of the artist’s works along with those of Sidney Nolan, John Perceval, Charles Blackman and others – including many created by the prodigious Boyd clan – estimated to be worth in excess of $40m.  Some 3,800 works of art, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics and archival photographs, were evacuated from Bundanon – in New South Wales’ Shoalhaven region – between November 2019 and January 2020. They have remained in a secure Sydney location ever since. Now, over coming weeks, the collection will be quietly repatriated. But it will be returning to a dramatically different habitat. On 5 March the new Bundanon art museum officially opens its doors to the public: a $36m gallery that becomes one of just eight National Collecting Institutions (NCIs) recognised by the federal government. Six of those eight institutions are located in the nation’s capital, including the Australian National Gallery and the Australian National Museum. Bundanon is the only NCI in regional Australia. Perched on the shores of the Shoalhaven River, with Morton national park as a backdrop, there are high hopes from both the federal government (which contributed $22.5m) and NSW ($10.3m) that Bundanon will become a regional tourism destination. (Visitors travelling to Bundanon via Sydney can take advantage of another new regional gallery on the way: the Ben Quilty-established Ngununggula, a converted heritage-listed dairy which opened in Bowral in the Southern Highlands last October.) Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Rachel Kent left her position as the Museum of Contemporary Art’s long-serving head curator to lead the Bundanon venture. “I think this makes a really bold statement about this particular area; it is a serious investment in the south coast and the Shoalhaven Illawarra region,” she said. “What it will do is offer a new vision around destination tourism.” Kent draws an ambitious comparison between Bundanon and world-renowned art destinations such as the Dia Beacon in upstate New York and Japan’s cluster of art islands in the Seto Inland Sea, where art and architecture are embedded into the landscape. In the case of Bundanon, it is an art space embedded quite literally: a part-subterranean gallery carved in concrete into a hillock on the 1,000-hectare Boyd bushland estate, which the artist and his wife Yvonne bequeathed to the Australian people in 1993. The bequest includes the 1866 Bundanon Homestead 9km from the art museum, home to the artist and his family from the early 1980s. In keeping with Boyd’s desire to ensure Bundanon “be accessible to any Australian whose life can be enriched by interaction with Australian creative artists”, the homestead – along with the studio the artist painted in during the last two decades of his life – is open to the public every Sunday. Only the facade of the Kerstin Thompson Architects-designed building is visible, a key to its ability to not only withstand extreme weather, floods and fire, but also to provide thermal stability. Thermo cooling rods embedded 150 metres into the ground add to the comparatively low carbon footprint of the building, whose air conditioning needs claim to be 60% less than those of a standard art museum. “Art museums are some of the worst environmental offenders,” says Kent. “Of course you have to have temperature control to protect the collection, but it does mean that they crunch through a lot of fossil fuels.” The adjacent 165-metre Bridge structure – which includes upscale accommodation for 64 guests in 32 rooms, several dining spaces and a flexible learning and meeting space – has eschewed air conditioning altogether. (Packages, which include two nights’ accommodation, fine dining and a full tour, start from $1,320 for one person and $1,650 for two.) Constructed out of locally sourced blackbutt timber, the Bridge makes use of a cross-ventilation roof system, sliding louvres and shutters, natural breezeways and ceiling fans. Solar panels stretch the entire length of the structure’s roof, which is also deeply grooved to capture enough rain water to service the entire building. Boyd himself, an environmentalist ahead of his time, would have approved of Bundanon’s net zero energy target. The artist famously said that no man can ever own a landscape, and his mission was to foster an understanding and appreciation of the landscape in relationship to art. The art museum’s first exhibition, however, will not include any of Boyd’s famous Shoalhaven paintings. From Impulse to Action delves into the artist’s creative period in the 1960s, including his set and costume designs for a Robert Helpmann production of Elektra, which attracted critical acclaim when staged at London’s Sadler’s Wells Theatre in 1963. “[The works] look like they were made yesterday,” says Kent. “We’ve already had a few people come in who are real Boyd fans and they are quite blown away to see this quite different dimension of the artist’s practice.” The exhibition – the first of what is expected to be a total of three in any given year – also includes contemporary works from other Australian artists, including Shan Turner-Carroll and Dean Cross, in collaboration with local Shoalhaven elders Uncle Steve Russell and Aunty Phyllis Stewarts. Spaciously hung in four wide spaces flooded with natural light, curator Sophie O’Brien has delivered an exhibition that appears to make a seamless transition between the contemporary works and those of Boyd from more than five decades ago. Dance artist Jo Lloyd, for instance, used a seven-metre-high reproduction of Boyd’s central backdrop for Elektra as her own backdrop for video installation Death Role, while Rochelle Haley’s installation Dance on a Couch by an Open Window (After Boyd) was inspired by the vibrant colours Boyd used in his ink drawings from the 1960s. From Impulse to Action runs until 12 June.  Bundanon art museum opens to the public on 5 March.

2/17/2022,"You are forced to “swallow your screams”, says an anguished father about the loss of his son. It is one of the many piercing moments in this moving drama about grief, mental illness and the harmful culture of silence that surrounds them within the British Caribbean community. An inter-generational drama that reveals the emotional landmines that this silence has left in one family’s life, we are taken from an opening scene of bonding between siblings, Joshua (Nickcolia King-N’da) and Gloria (Velile Tshabalala), to a flash-forward in which he has died – his death never openly spoken of again – and she has suffered from “bipolar disorder” for years, which is hidden from the wider community.  Sian Carter’s debut play showcases her ample talent and places her squarely as a star in the making. It is gratifying too that this co-production with Talawa Theatre Company finds a home on a large stage, which it fills with power and pain but also sparks of joy. Directed by Michael Buffong, its pace is initially slow but it finds its feet in the second half and there are some incredibly poignant scenes. Gloria’s 16-year-old daughter, Imani (Ruby Barker, understatedly brilliant) speaks about the psychological legacy of her mother’s mental illness – she is often left in the care of her grandparents, Shirley (Suzette Llewellyn) and Maxwell (Wil Johnson), in a charged exchange, and there are bristling mother-daughter battles between Gloria and Shirley too. The role of the church in this family’s life features in complicated ways. Maxwell, a pastor, tells a silently sceptical Gloria that the “gospel can heal you”, but in another scene he himself rails against his faith’s inability to lessen his grief after his son’s death. Alongside this there is joy: in music, dance and in family love which is palpable and heartfelt in both the writing and performances. Imani’s relationship with her grandparents is particularly tender, while the cuddly Maxwell and indomitable Shirley are so charismatic a double act that their story threatens to eclipse other elements of the plot. The script only needs tightening to raise it to greater heights but the jumbled set – a living room with revolving staircase and stars overhead – looks incoherent and is not helped by sometimes clunky lighting. Those niggles aside, this is a potent piece of theatre which, curiously, also has the episodic pace and rhythm of a TV drama.

2/17/2022,"We first got “the Internet” on our family computer in 1996. I recall staring at the thick CRT monitor for about 15 minutes as images on the Thomas the Tank Engine homepage appeared line by line and thinking this was pretty tedious.  Skip forward to 1999 when a friend and I realised we could use our modem to make prank phone calls. The recipient – typically a classmate we didn’t like or, more often, their parent – would pick up the phone and hear something akin to a fax machine trying to establish a connection. We, on the other end, would hear confused voices coming out of the modem’s internal speaker. This gave me my first Friday detention; we did get a bit carried away. It also gave me my first fit of internet-spurred laughter – though certainly not my last. I love everything about TV gameshows: the music, the sound effects, the fabulous prizes rotating slowly. I’ve written questions for a few. I even hosted my own on Channel 31. But I could never dream of matching this infamous 1994 moment from the UK’s non-Burgo version of Catchphrase. The way everything comes together is just magic. Mr Bankrupt was an Adelaide institution, much like Glenside. The discount retailer was known for its loud and annoying ads with probably the most over-the-top voiceover on Australian television. I love making fun of advertising but I don’t think it’s possible to make them more ridiculous than the real thing. And if you thought that ad was irritating, imagine a whole classroom full of 13-year-old boys doing their own renditions. As a rule, I hate all comedy and comedians. But the first time I saw Aunty Donna talking about crisps and tea towels on a Channel 31 Melbourne show called Lost Dog TV back in 2012, I snapped my finger, pointed at the TV and said “yes”, then went online and watched their entire back catalogue. They are quite simply the greatest sketch group in Australian history and it was evident right from their earliest work. The original and the best of SNL’s “The Californians” sketches. Depicting Los Angelenos as blond valley girls and beige surfer dudes who can only communicate using freeway routes is brilliant satire but what makes the dress rehearsal version so great is the actors cracking each other up. As soon as Fred Armisen (who rarely corpses) says “whattayoudoinhere?” you can see in Bill Hader’s eyes that he’s gone. And once he’s gone, they’re all gone. I’ve been obsessed with the Democracy Manifest video for more than a decade. There are literally 15 killer lines in those 60 seconds. I quote at least one daily, even going so far as to shoot a shot-for-shot parody just for fun. Over the last couple of years more and more of the story behind that 1991 incident have trickled out, but this brilliant ABC podcast from Lawrence Bull is the definitive explanation of Mr Democracy Manifest, Jack Karlson. It’s not all laughs, but one particular anecdote 12 minutes in about his first time in prison in the 1950s had me rolling. And kudos to sound engineer John Jacobs. Can’t wait for the Jack Karlson biopic: A Succulent Life. I first discovered the joy of Simpsons shitposting in 2015 when Malcolm Turnbull challenged Tony Abbott and some hilarious memes from a page called Simpsons Against the Liberals appeared in my feed. There are now scores of Facebook groups where people mash up images from The Simpsons, paste other people’s heads on to the characters and add captions for satirical effect. It’s an incredibly versatile format. I reckon the best is Compuglobalhypermeganet Australia & New Zealand – no doubt because so many Aussies were effectively brainwashed by 20 years of The Simpsons every night at 6pm on Channel Ten. And since the launch of the website Frinkiac in 2016, it’s never been easier to get a Simpsons screenshot and make your own meme. The guys who created that website deserve the Nobel prize for literature. This is one of my favourite early sketches from my good friends and fellow Mad as Hell writers Alasdair Tremblay-Birchall and Andy Matthews. They do fine work. wow things really haven't changed since i was in school (from r/melbourne) pic.twitter.com/8gmmqHhryt I saw this prank some Melbourne high school kids played a couple of years ago and thought it was hilarious. They’d gotten the pedantic language and formatting of the school letter spot on. It was especially funny because I went to an all-boys middle school and I was pretty gullible so I couldn’t help but imagine what my own reaction would have been. I suspect I would have been quite freaked out. Kids have been pulling this one all around the world since at least 2010. Guess that makes it a classic. It’s been 15 years since Australia’s funniest and therefore best radio show – Get This with Tony Martin, Ed Kavalee and Richard Marsland – went off the air but every now and then I’ll be driving and suddenly, a random line like “this box of sand isn’t compatible with my printer!” pops into my head.

They’re pretty funny on their own but I came across this video on Instagram recently where someone has mashed up the intro to his ABC cooking show Come & Get It with the bloopers.

2/17/2022,"The New South Wales government has admitted land clearing has increased threefold over the past decade, woodlands and grasslands are deteriorating and 62% of vegetation in the state is now under pressure from too much fire. The NSW State of the Environment 2021 report, released every three years, paints a grim picture for land and freshwater ecosystems, which are under increasing threat from habitat destruction, invasive species and the climate crisis.  The report provides an overview of the environmental issues facing the state including for biodiversity, waterways and the climate. The number of species in NSW threatened with extinction has grown by 18 (to 1,043) since the previous report in 2018 and 64% of mammals are now considered to have suffered long-term reductions in their habitat range. Clearing of woody vegetation increased to an annual average of 35,000 hectares between 2017 and 2019, up from 13,000 hectares between 2009 and 2015. The rate of clearing for non-woody vegetation such as shrubs and grasses was even higher. Bird populations are declining, so too are freshwater fish populations, which were singled out as being in “very poor condition” across the state. More than 70% of endangered plants, animals and habitats in the state are threatened by invasive species, with pest animals and weeds costing the state’s economy $170m and $1.8bn respectively each year. The report, released on Wednesday by the NSW Environment Protection Authority, notes that although 62% of land-based species in the state are currently not considered to be threatened, the number of endangered species is expected to continue to grow. Although habitat restoration and revegetation programs are in place these are “not restoring native vegetation at the rate of permanent clearing”, the report states. “Management and conservation efforts will not be enough to save many species without addressing key threats such as habitat removal and climate change.” The report highlights the devastating effects of the 2019-20 bushfires disaster, which affected 62% of the state’s vegetation communities, which are now under pressure from too much burning. It finds that although native vegetation covers 69% of NSW, the ecological carrying capacity of this vegetation is estimated to be just 31% of natural levels in the aftermath of fires. The state’s mean temperature from 2011-2020 was 1.1C higher than late last century and the period covered by the report included the warmest years on record (2018 and 2019). The report states emissions in NSW were now 17% lower than in 2005. Eighty-one per cent of electricity in NSW in 2019-20 was generated from fossil fuels, a decline of 7% since the previous report in 2018. Energy consumption had fallen overall but energy use for transport, along with transport emissions, was increasing. The report also finds the amount of waste generated per person has increased by 9% and total waste was up 17%. It states 64% of all waste was diverted for recycling and the volume of litter decreased by 43% between 2013 and 2020. The state’s new environment minister, James Griffin, said the report shone a light on the environmental issues the state was facing and “challenges us to do more”. He said in the three years covered by the report the state had experienced its worst bushfire season and one of its worst droughts. “I fundamentally believe that nature underpins everything on this planet, and for that reason, this report should matter to business leaders, it should matter to environmental advocates, it should matter to academics, and to every citizen in the state,” Griffin said. “Protecting and conserving the environment requires a concerted effort from all of us, and I’m eager to work collaboratively to achieve that goal.” Penny Sharpe, the opposition’s environment spokesperson, said the state’s environment was in serious trouble. “For all the talk from the previous minister [Matt Kean], this report is an indictment on his tenure as minister,” she said. “The report is so bad that he refused to put his name to it.” Sharpe said the new minister’s tenure would “mean nothing” without serious action to protect habitat, reduce clearing and allow landscapes to recover from the fire disaster. Comment was sought from Kean.

2/17/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal party has been told a federal intervention is needed to prevent it becoming in breach of its constitution, raising concerns that such a move would allow Scott Morrison’s preferred candidates to be installed for the federal election. In an extraordinary meeting of the NSW division held on Wednesday, the state director, Chris Stone, presented legal advice suggesting federal party intervention was required to reappoint members of the state executive until the party’s postponed annual general meeting was held in March.  However, amid a fractious standoff over preselections in NSW, the prospect of federal intervention was met with fierce resistance, with some members of the state executive threatening a supreme court challenge. The right faction’s Matthew Camenzuli is understood to have presented competing legal advice at the meeting that suggested the federal intervention was not necessary. Moderate members of the state executive are also understood to hold concerns the move could result in an effective federal takeover of the division, which could allow Morrison’s centre right faction, represented by Alex Hawke, to install their preferred candidates before the election. The latest twist in the long-running feud over preselections, which affects a number of key federal seats including Warringah, Hughes and Dobell, comes as factional chiefs had been negotiating for a ballot that would allow plebiscites to take place in certain seats, while protecting incumbents. According to multiple sources, members at Wednesday’s meeting were presented with legal advice claiming the executive could risk becoming in breach of the division’s constitution because an annual general meeting that was due to happen by the end of February had been delayed. To avoid the breach, it was suggested that the party’s federal executive be asked to step in to reappoint current state executives. But that suggestion led to an escalation in the already deep hostilities between the rival factions of the party in NSW because of suspicions a federal takeover could see the party’s state factions cede control. Earlier this month speaking on Sydney radio station 2GB, Morrison raised the prospect of federal intervention unless the executive dealt with preselections in a number of key seats. Members of the right faction came to Wednesday’s meeting armed with their own contradicting legal advice arguing the state executive could continue to operate until it holds its annual general meeting currently planned for the end of March. In a statement, the NSW Liberal party president, Philip Ruddock, said the proposal was merely aimed at addressing the functioning of the executive. “Due to the significant challenges associated with holding an AGM in late 2021 [and] early 2022 related to Covid restrictions, the NSW division is taking proactive steps to ensure elected officials on its state executive can continue to serve until the AGM can be held in March,” he said. “This does not affect the functioning of the NSW Liberal Party itself.” While members of the right faction have been pushing for local plebiscites to install candidates in a number of key seats, the preselections have been delayed by Hawke because of concerns a number of sitting MPs could lose their preselection in a ballot of local members. Those current MPs including Hawke, fellow minister Sussan Ley in Farrer, and key moderate Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. Party figures have been holding out hope of reaching a compromise deal which would see the rival factions divide the spoils in a number of NSW seats including Warringah and Hughes, while protecting the government’s sitting MPs. Sources on the right told the Guardian they were fully prepared to “take things further” if an attempt at federal intervention was made, including the prospect of court action. Members of the state executive are expected to hold a vote on Thursday to resolve the matter. The dispute over federal preselections comes after the party’s poor showing in Saturday’s NSW state byelections, which saw the Liberal government lose the previously safe seat of Bega and suffer a 19% swing in Gladys Berejiklian’s former seat of Willoughby on Sydney’s north shore. Although the seat is expected to remain in the government’s hands once postal votes are counted, the swing has focused attention on the government’s slim hold on a working majority in the NSW parliament. The Coalition has effectively been in minority since early last year, after two MPs – Gareth Ward and John Sidoti – were sidelined over separate scandals. Now on the crossbench, those two MPs have remained an electoral buffer inside the parliament, continuing to vote with the government, but the loss of Willoughby would mean they require another vote. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning To avoid that, the Guardian can reveal the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has struck a deal to ensure supply with three key cross-benchers. After a meeting with Perrottet on Tuesday three independents – Greg Piper, Alex Greenwich and Joe McGirr – all agreed to give the government a guarantee on supply. Greenwich said the supply deal would not extend to issues related to “corruption and maladministration”, and that the independent MPs would “judge every motion and piece of legislation on its merits”. Piper put it in plainer terms, saying he had warned the premier: “Maybe you will lose some votes.” “We also told him, as with Gladys Berejiklian, we’ve still got every right to not support legislation or to support non-government bills,” he said. “That’s life in minority government. They might not like it but that’s the way it is.”",News/Australia news,NSW Liberals told federal intervention is required to prevent constitution breach,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/nsw-liberals-told-federal-intervention-is-required-to-prevent-constitution-breach
2/17/2022,"The Omicron variant has caused an avalanche of Covid-19 cases in Australia in the past months. While most people who catch the disease experience mild symptoms, many report feeling short of breath and sluggish for weeks afterward. “It’s normal to feel tired after a viral infection, and everyone’s recovery is different,” says Janet Bondarenko, a senior respiratory physiotherapist at Alfred hospital in Melbourne. “But the severity of your Covid illness doesn’t necessarily predict whether you will have those lingering symptoms.”  The coronavirus can damage various organs, causing ongoing fatigue, says Dr Robert Newton, professor of exercise medicine at Edith Cowan University. “The cardiorespiratory system can’t deliver oxygen to the working muscles efficiently. So what was a light to moderate intensity activity previously feels quite vigorous now.” Sleep and rest help your immune system to fight the disease but it is critical to start moving again to avoid further weakening of your body about seven days after the major symptoms have disappeared, Newton says. Exercise increases capacity of muscles, heart and lungs, as well as the numbers of mitochondria – the energy factories within the muscle cells – which counteract the debilitating effects of the infection. Here is a simple guide that can help you get moving again, but specialist advice from your GP or an exercise physiologist is recommended before you begin an exercise program. There is some evidence that the practice of yoga and meditation may help improve lung health, reduce viral susceptibility and speed the recovery from acute respiratory infections thanks to their relaxing effects. “Controlling stress and anxiety is critical for recovery,” says Newton. “It’s very important to look at strategies such as meditation, mindfulness and yoga to help the body to recover from the coronavirus infection.” In a paper published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, researchers stated that “certain meditation, yoga asana (postures), and pranayama (breathing) practices may possibly be effective adjunctive means of […] helping to reduce severity of Covid-19 disease, including its collateral effects and sequelae”. Newton says incorporating resistance training is crucial to reactivate muscles. He says that bodyweight exercises, such as squats and push-ups on your knees, are a good starting point. As you gradually regain your strength, you can begin to add light weights to your routine, using milk cartons or a weighted backpack. Light resistance training triggers the production of hormones and cell-signalling molecules such as cytokines that work with the immune system to help the body repair. According to Bondarenko, the most accessible physical activity to do after a Covid-19 infection is walking. Especially if you can do it outdoors, Newton agrees. Anyone can easily control the intensity of their walking, they say. Beginning with easy, short strolls is ideal, says Bondarenko. Gradually, you can increase the length and the pace of your walks as long as that does not cause you extreme fatigue or leave you feeling breathless. Pushing through when you are still feeling sluggish after Covid-19 will not speed your recovery, says Bondarenko. “It pushes you back a few steps rather than helping.” She says it is essential to gradually allow yourself extra time to return to your pre-Covid shape. “Everyone’s recovery is different, but over time, everyone gets back to where they want to be.” “Use your body as a barometer,” says Newton. “Test your perceived exertion to make sure you don’t push the system into overtraining, because that will compromise your recovery.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: exercising after having Covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/17/how-to-move-exercising-after-having-covid-19
