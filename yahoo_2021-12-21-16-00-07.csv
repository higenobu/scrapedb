12/21/2021,"Donald Trump is still not over Melania Trump getting flak for her Christmas decor, and complained about it in a speech this weekend. The former first lady was mocked in 2018 for installing red Christmas trees. And in 2017, the Trump White House's white branches also drew flak on social media. Former President Donald Trump is still not over his wife Melania's Christmas decorations being panned. In a speech at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, the former president criticized the media for going after his wife's White House Christmas displays. ""I have to just start by wishing everybody a very, very merry Christmas,"" Trump said during his speech. He went on to talk about how Melania was a former first lady ""loved by everybody"" but lamented that she ""didn't exactly get a fair shake."" ""She would make the most beautiful Christmas decorations,"" Trump said. ""And I remember she made these magnificent red trees and the media said, 'Oh, that's terrible.' I said, 'Honey, next time, try white.'"" ""She made magnificent — remember, the most beautiful you've ever seen — white trees? And they said, 'Oh, that's terrible.' I said the next time, let's do it more traditional. Let's go with green,"" Trump said. ""We went with beautiful green trees, and they said: 'Why wouldn't you make them white like they used to be?' But I'll tell you what, she's loved all over, and she's got a tremendous heart, and she says hello,"" Trump added. In 2017, Trump replaced traditional fir trees with white branches. The next year she installed red, cranberry-covered trees at the White House that were mocked for appearing to be covered in blood. In 2020, Melania's enthusiasm for Christmas was questioned when an audio recording of her complaining about decorating the White House for the holidays surfaced. The 2018 conversation was recorded and leaked by the first lady's friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff. ""I'm working like a — my ass off at Christmas stuff that you know, who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff and decoration?"" she is heard saying on the leaked tapes. ""But I need to do it, right? Correct?"" ""OK, and then I do it, and I say that I'm working on Christmas and planning for the Christmas and they said, 'Oh, what about the children that, they were separated?' Give me a fucking break,"" she said, referring to a controversial visit she made to the border to visit children who were separated from their parents. During the visit, she wore a jacket that said ""I don't really care, do u?"" Separately, the former president claimed this week that Americans can wish one another 'merry Christmas' only because he fought the 'woke' and 'crazy people' who wanted to cancel the greeting.

12/21/2021,"A magnitude 6.2 earthquake hit Northern California on Monday, bringing significant shaking but likely minimal damage to the sparsely populated area. The earthquake occurred just after noon and was centered off the coast about 210 miles northwest of San Francisco, just off a tiny town called Petrolia that’s home to fewer than 1,000 people. The nearest population center, Eureka, is about 45 miles north. That left only about 25,000 people in the range of strong or very strong shaking, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, though residents as far away as Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area reported feeling trembling. The Humboldt County Sheriff’s office of emergency services did not issue any evacuation orders, though a few roads were closed due to rockslides. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated economic losses of less than $10 million and no fatalities. The area last suffered an earthquake of a similar magnitude in 1993, when one person died, according to the USGS. As of Monday evening, no injuries have been reported but some rural roads have experienced rock slides as a result of the earthquake, according to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office. ""We are seeing varying damages, most occurring in the Eel River Valley and South county areas. We have received some reports of structural damages to buildings, broken glass and items thrown from shelves at local businesses. Damage assessments are still underway,"" says Samantha Karges, public information specialist of the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office. The quake was ""very scary,"" according to Ranjeet Singh, owner of the Valley Grocery in Ferndale, a town within the radius of the earthquake. Singh's grocery store stored many items with glass bottles, which then shattered on the floor and caused potentially thousands of dollars in damage, Singh told USA TODAY. However, none of the customers in the store were injured, and Singh has not heard of anyone in the town so far who has experienced major injuries. Singh also said people within the town gathered in Main Street to assess the damage, and members from the local community stepped in to help clean up his store after the earthquake. Petrolia General Store manager Jane Dexter told the San Francisco Chronicle the rumbling and shaking lasted for about 20 seconds. Glass bottles fell off the shelves at the store, bursting on the floor, but no one was hurt, she said. “It was bigger than (anything) I’ve felt in a long time out here,” she told the Chronicle. According to Michigan Tech, earthquakes with magnitudes from 6.1 to 6.9 ""may cause a lot of damage in very populated areas,"" and there are approximately 100 of them per year.x 'THERE'S HISTORY IN THIS REGION': More than 50 earthquakes rumble off Oregon coast over 24-hour period ""Moderate to strong shaking was recorded by the seismic network along the coast. The earthquake was felt in San Francisco by this CGS geologist!"" said California Geological Survey in a Twitter post. Little water was displaced, meaning the earthquake did not trigger a tsunami warning, according to seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones. This statement was later corroborated in an email from the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office sent to USA TODAY. Follow Michelle Shen on Twitter @michelle_shen10.
