3/22/2022,"Brandon Wolf has fond memories of his five years working as a dancer at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom near Orlando, Florida. “It was one of the best times of my life because I moved to Orlando to find a place to belong, to find a community, to discover a world where I could be an out queer person of colour and be proud of that,” the 33-year-old says. “I certainly found that in the central Florida community that I have grown to love. I found that in my fellow cast members and I’m very grateful for my time being able to work with them at Disney.” The Walt Disney Company, one of the world’s biggest media and entertainment empires, prides itself on a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) friendly culture. But today its reputation for inclusivity and tolerance is under scrutiny – as are its deep ties to the political establishment and the lack of LGBTQ representation in its films. Disney’s workers have been staging walkouts in protest at chief executive Bob Chapek’s lacklustre response to Florida legislation dubbed “don’t say gay”. The controversial bill bars instruction on “sexual orientation or gender identity” in schools from kindergarten through grade 3. Republicans promoting it claim that parents rather than teachers should be talking to their children about gender issues during their early formative years. But their prejudices were laid bare by a tweet from Christina Pushaw, press secretary for Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, that said: “The bill that liberals inaccurately call ‘don’t say gay’ would be more accurately described as an anti-grooming bill.” Just in case anyone did not get the message, she added: “If you’re against the anti-grooming bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of four- to eight-year-old children. Silence is complicity.” The legislation has been sent to DeSantis, a rightwing populist in the mould of Donald Trump, for signature but could then face legal challenges. It has been condemned as “hateful” by Joe Biden and other Democrats who argue that it demonises LGBTQ people. Wolf, press secretary of the LGBTQ rights organisation Equality Florida and a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, says: “The ‘don’t say gay bill’ was dubbed that by the community because it is a bigoted, very specifically anti-LGBTQ piece of legislation designed to censor classroom speech about our community. “It is a hateful bill that is rooted in the same anti-LGBTQ animus that has been used to justify discrimination and violence against us forever. It needs to be vetoed and, if it isn’t vetoed, it needs to be repealed.” Few activists or nongovernment organisations could have opposed the bill with the clout of Disney, as synonymous with Florida as beaches and oranges. The opening of the Walt Disney World Resort in October 1971 helped transform the state into an economic powerhouse and tourism magnet. Disney is now the biggest private sector employer in Florida; Walt Disney World had more than 75,000 workers before the coronavirus pandemic. Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, says: “You could argue that Disney has had a bigger impact on Florida and central Florida than any other company or group. It just really changed the face of Florida. “The state had always been a tourist destination, going back to the 1920s, in the sense that it had warmer weather and coastline. But typically it was mom and pop attractions that popped up to service tourists. When Disney came into town, it really put Florida on the map not only as a national destination for many Americans but an international tourist destination well known all around the world.” Disney has also contributed millions of dollars to Republican and Democratic politicians, ensuring a cosy relationship between Mickey Mouse and state government, Jewett adds: “Disney typically has not gotten involved in lots of controversial social issues. They donate to a lot of charities in central Florida and try to be a good corporate citizen. “But they also do try to steer public policy their way like any big corporation and because they are so big and have such influence, usually they’re very successful. Typically almost anything they want they get in terms of public policy.” Yet the “don’t say gay” bill wrong-footed Chapek, who succeeded Bob Iger as chief executive in February 2020. Initially he sent a message to Disney workers affirming the company’s support for LGBTQ rights but also contending that corporate statements often do little to change minds and can be “weaponised” by either side. Chapek then told Disney shareholders that, instead of making an early public statement against the legislation, company officials had been working behind the scenes with politicians “to achieve a better outcome” but without success, despite “our longstanding relationships with those lawmakers”. It was tone deaf response, misjudging the mood of an era in which companies face heightened ethical expectations to take a stand on issues such as Black Lives Matter. Disney workers mobilised with an online campaign including a website, whereischapek.com, that says their leadership “utterly failed to match the magnitude of the threat to LGBTQIA+ safety represented by this legislation”. The site includes anonymous employee statements criticising Disney, a schedule of walkouts in protest and a detailed breakdown of the company’s donations to Florida politicians, including $106,809.38 to the “Friends of Ron DeSantis” political action committee. Jewett comments: “If you look at their donation record, they do give to candidates and elected officials of both parties but over the last 20 years they gave a lot more to Republicans because Republicans have been in charge of our state government for the last 20 years. “Like any big interest group, they want access and influence, and the best way to get that is to make sure you give to the party and people that are in charge. They give to a lot of Democrats, because they want those Democrats to be on their side too, but they have given a disproportionate amount to Republican legislators, many of whom supported and voted for the ‘don’t say gay’ bill. That’s what’s upset a lot of the employees.” The employee protests will culminate on Tuesday with a general walkout by LGBTQ workers and their supporters at Disney worksites in Florida, California and elsewhere. The Human Rights Campaign has said it will stop accepting money from Disney “until we see them build on their public commitment and work with LGBTQ+ advocates to ensure that dangerous proposals, like Florida’s ‘don’t say gay or trans’ bill, don’t become dangerous laws”. How did Chapek get it so wrong? Eric Marcus, creator and host of the Making Gay History podcast, says: “Disney has cultivated an LGBTQ-friendly image, both through their inclusion of LGBTQ characters in recent years and with their employees, so it’s shocking but not shocking that the CEO would have been so flat-footed. I don’t think he realised, although he should have, how much the world has changed.” Chapek is 61 years old. Marcus, who is 63, adds: “That means that he had zero education about LGBTQ history and so what he knows is what he’s picked up along the way and maybe from his diversity and inclusion team. So I’m guessing a lot of the flat-footedness is out of ignorance and also fear of doing the wrong thing.” Stung by the outcry, Chapek apologised and announced that the company was pausing all political donations in Florida. He told employees: “I truly believe we are an infinitely better and stronger company because of our LGBTQ+ community. I missed the mark in this case but am an ally you can count on – and I will be an outspoken champion for the protections, visibility and opportunity you deserve.” DeSantis, in typically combative style, responded by sending a campaign fundraising email that said: “Disney is in far too deep with the Communist Party of China and has lost any moral authority to tell you what to do.” Some activists welcome Chapek’s shift as better late than never. Wolf, the Equality Florida spokesperson who finished working at Disney World in 2013, says: “I don’t know much about Mr Chapek at all personally but it speaks volumes that he’s been willing to to meet with cast members and to acknowledge where his statements have fallen short. “I certainly think in a very divisive political climate, that’s a challenging thing to do. It also speaks to the need for continued growth around representation in leadership positions in corporate America generally.” The row has erupted when the multibillion dollar Disney behemoth has never been more powerful. Its global franchise spans Marvel superheroes, the Star Wars saga, The Simpsons, National Geographic and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who with films such as Encanto projects an admirably inclusive, progressive 21st century vision. But Chapek’s memo to staff on 7 March, which cited “diverse stories” such as Black Panther, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and the TV series Modern Family as “more powerful than any tweet or lobbying effort”, implying that Disney’s content speaks for itself, has been questioned. For decades the studio’s output was steadfastly heterosexual even though its creative talents included gay people such as Howard Ashman, an Oscar winner who wrote the lyrics for The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast before his death from Aids in 1991. There has been some progress since then with a growing LGBTQ portrayals in films and TV shows and the selling of LGBTQ pride-themed merchandise at Disney stores. Last year’s film Jungle Cruise featured a prominent gay character: McGregor Houghton, played by Jack Whitehall. But the struggle against erasure is far from over. In response to the current controversy, LGBTQ staff at Pixar, the animation studio owned by Disney, wrote in an open letter: “We at Pixar have personally witnessed beautiful stories, full of diverse characters, come back from Disney corporate reviews shaved down to crumbs of what they once were. “Nearly every moment of overtly gay affection is cut at Disney’s behest, regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar. Even if creating LGBTQIA+ content was the answer to fixing the discriminatory legislation in the world, we are being barred from creating it. Beyond the ‘inspiring content’ that we aren’t even allowed to create, we require action.” None of these recent events come as a surprise to Henry Giroux, a distinguished scholar in critical pedagogy at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and author of The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence. He says: “What people really tend to underestimate and confuse is that many of the organisations that define themselves as simply avenues for entertainment are enormously powerful political and what I call pedagogical organisations. They shape identities, they shaped values, they get engaged in defining who is excluded and who isn’t, what people want and what people don’t. “The thing about Disney that’s interesting, more so in some ways than other organisations, is it hides behind this veil of innocence while at the same time it utterly commodifies children. It’s one of the top five major corporations that define the entertainment field and beyond all that it exercises enormous influence politically in Florida.” Giroux adds: “Now think about an organisation that basically supports DeSantis. They give money to these people and then they come out and they say, ‘Oh, we’re so sorry, we really are supporting LGBTQ people’. It’s just pure nonsense and s a kind of cover for politics that hides in the shadows.”",Arts/Film,Disney faces backlash over LGBTQ controversy: ‘It’s just pure nonsense’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/21/disney-faces-backlash-lgbtq-controversy-dont-say-gay-bill-florida

3/22/2022,"There has been a new Highway Code since the end of January, as anyone who listens to a lot of phone-ins will know. Unfortunately, if you get your information from phone-ins, the only detail you will pick up is that drivers are very annoyed about it. In fact, it’s not so much a technical rewrite as a whole new code of ethics. There are, of course, new rules, including something called the Dutch Reach, which sounds like a cross between a rugby tackle and a contraceptive. But the main thing is the hierarchy of road-users, which goes, in descending order: pedestrians, cyclists, horses, motorbikes, cars and cabs, vans and mini-buses, HGVs. The principle, which you have probably worked out for yourself, is that those most likely to be injured in a collision take priority. Sure, quibble if you like: I’d make a special separate category for SUVs, below the heavy goods vehicle. Even though they are not as large, nor are they as useful – they are nothing but a wasteful display of wealth, and therefore should go to the bottom of the pile, giving way to everybody and taking responsibility for everything. Also, I would put a horse above a bike; sure, it’s bigger, but it’s also jumpier, and so easily freaked out there’s a saying about it. Nobody was ever warned not to frighten the bicycles. It’s actually quite radical, although it’s radicalism under the radar, since nobody ever said out loud what the hierarchy was before. But we all knew it: in descending order, people who had spent a lot of money on their vehicle; people who spent a lot of time in their vehicle for work-related reasons, and existed in a state of perpetual rage as a result; people who had a vehicle at all; and then everyone else. For brevity, it was the law of the jungle, except that money could stand in for physical prowess if circumstances required. My observations from pootling about on my bike are that nobody has really internalised these changes yet; drivers will still merrily turn left on you without indicating, buses will pull out in front of you, and horses have no idea about their status boost. The journey from jungle to civilisation is a long one, and begins with a single step.

3/22/2022,"During Kurt Waldheim’s Austrian presidential campaign in the spring of 1986, that nation’s collective consciousness experienced a painful return of the repressed, a psychological agony recalled by director Ruth Beckermann in this documentary. Waldheim, who had been UN secretary general from 1972 to 1981, was running for the presidency very largely on the grounds of his international prestige. As far as his war service went, Waldheim had claimed in his autobiography to have been invalided out of (conscripted) military service on sustaining a wound at the eastern front in 1942. But in the febrile few weeks leading up to the election, investigative journalist Hubertus Czernin, together with New York Times reporters and researchers from the World Jewish Congress, discovered documents showing his active membership of the SA, the Nazi Party’s original paramilitary wing, and then his senior rank among the German army’s Group E in Greece and Yugoslavia, where he was, to say the very least, an intimate witness to atrocities. And so this was a time of agony for Austria, where public opinion was resentful and in some cases openly antisemitic about these outsiders’ criticisms. Waldheim dismissed the accusations and claimed not to remember details. It was also a torment for the international political elite, who had seen Waldheim’s career as a key part of Austria’s postwar rehabilitation as an anti-communist stalwart: Helmut Kohl is shown vehemently defending Waldheim and Ronald Reagan visited a German cemetery at Bitburg that included SS graves – an event parsed at the time as a “gaffe” by the conservative press rather than a deliberate, coded political gesture of reconciliation. Waldheim won the election but was excluded from entering the US, a distinction he shared with Fidel Castro, and so his presidency was a pyrrhic victory that arguably set the tone for Austrian isolationism to this day. It seems incredible that Waldheim could have got away with concealing his war record for as long as he did. How would he handle the situation now? Undoubtedly, by declaring “fake news” (which he never quite had the effrontery to try) and probably by slyly claiming it was a retaliatory smear due to his sympathy for the Palestine Liberation Organisation while at the UN.

3/22/2022,"We used to record in Hype Studios in Liverpool, which was owned by Andy Wilson. He called me one day because Shack were there, and they had loved a demo of ours. I went to the studio to meet them. Mick Head, their frontman, was like the poet laureate of Liverpool then, so him saying such great things was amazing. I bounced out of there and got the train to my nan’s, still buzzing. I think I probably skipped there, and then this line came into my head: “What’s up with my heart when it skips a beat?” I thought: “That’s a good opening line.” So I got to my nan’s and started writing. Five minutes later, Dreaming of You was finished. All the hits we’ve had were done like that, written in about the same time it takes to listen to them. The trick is to leave them alone and not question it. At first it was like skiffle. But Alan Wills, who founded our label Deltasonic, thought it could be more like the Specials. When we finished recording our debut album, Dreaming of You wasn’t on there. Ian Broudie, our producer, said we needed another song and, as soon as he heard Dreaming of You, he said record it. We worked on the arrangement. I remember doing the vocal in one take – I’ve always hated doing more than a couple. Ian and Alan thought we’d nailed it. I thought we had, too. Bill Ryder-Jones’s guitar solo is my favourite thing. It’s perfect. I don’t know who the “you” in the title is. Denise van Outen, maybe. She was on the Big Breakfast back then. It’s just a song. I was only 17, I hadn’t done much in my life. I do love the track, though. It’s not deep, but its energy makes it special. Not many people have a song as well known as this, like Dion has with The Wanderer, or Del Shannon has with Runaway. But I’ve got one and it’s a public song now, one that nans know! It’s been used on so many TV shows and adverts I can’t remember them all, although I know that Adele once did a live version. I thought: “YES! I’m quids in here.” But she never persevered with it. If Adele reads this, I think she should carry on, I would love to hear a recorded version. Strings, choirs, the lot. They really didn’t want to record Dreaming of You. But I said it was a must, so we went back to the studio. They were indulging me, probably, but the sessions were great. In two days, we did Dreaming of You, Goodbye and one other. They were a fantastic band playing together, but they were like an ecosystem – when you took one of them away, the whole thing fell apart. So the key was to record them live, playing as a band. My job was to disturb them as little as possible. There were sea shanties on the debut album, psych freakouts, spaghetti western soundtrack, all sorts. So I think they were a bit nervous of Dreaming of You, which was much more conventional. It’s the only song on that first album that doesn’t have some sort of twist. It’s easy to be scared of a song like this. I had the same with Pure, the Lightning Seeds’ debut single in 1989. I had fought hard for that not to be released. But it saved my life, in many ways. That’s probably why I was so sure they should include Dreaming of You on the album. If we’d done our debut album without Pure, it would’ve been a very different life for me. I think Dreaming of You is as important to the Coral, the pivot on which their career turned. The bassline at the start always reminded me of You’re the One That I Want from Grease, but the whole song sounds like people who just love playing. I hear them all in that song. When that solo starts, I hear Bill at his best, James too, and so on. It all slots together. The spirit of the band, distilled into one track. It’s magical.  The Coral tour until 26 March.

3/22/2022,"The Tennessee state house is considering a “Texas-style” abortion ban that would allow relatives, friends, neighbors and the spouse of a rapist to sue anyone who provides or assists in the provision of abortion services to his victim. The bill, which would ban abortion entirely with no exceptions for rape or incest, cleared one hurdle last week, when a health subcommittee passed it. The bill is modeled after the Texas six-week ban, which the US supreme court let stand. The Texas bill deputizes private citizens to enforce the law by giving them the right to sue any abortion provider they believe has violated the law or anyone aiding provision. As in Texas, the government will not be the enforcer under the Tennessee bill. “This bill is modeled directly after the legislation passed in Texas last year,” said the Republican Rebecca Alexander, the legislation sponsor, in a committee session. “Abortions since that bill has been passed have dropped 60% in Texas.” She added: “This is my bill. My intent is to bring a bill that protects the unborn life in this state.” The bill would allow people to sue anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion, “regardless of any standing they have in the case”. Lawsuits filed against abortion providers and assistants would come with a minimum fine of $10,000. A state Democrat, Bob Freeman, asked Alexander if the bill would allow a rapist’s relatives, friends, spouse and neighbors to sue a victim. “My assumption is that they could, other than the rapist,” said Alexander. Although rape victims could not be sued under the bill, the bill would “allow investigators to ask people who lose a pregnancy how it was lost”, said Rejul Bejoy, a legislative attorney. In 2019, nearly 6,000 cases of sexual assault were reported to Tennessee law enforcement agencies. According to the state department of health, children between 14 and 17 had the highest rate of sexual assault victimization. “This bill, while it’s being framed as an anti-abortion bill, is really not doing anything to further restrict abortion,” Freeman told NBC’s Today. “It’s really just going to bring all sorts of lawsuits and force people to have to potentially answer questions about a miscarriage. “It never ceases to amaze me, the bills that pass. I’m not sure how it will fare in the full committee. But let me say this: if it passes through the senate and the house, the governor will sign it into law.

Viewers will be able to donate throughout the evening, and ITV has pledged to donate all sponsorship and advertising revenue generated from the broadcast – an estimated £3m – to the appeal. “I will be singing to try to help every human being forced to flee their home and in solidarity with those being racially discriminated against even within this humanitarian crisis,” Sandé said. “Nobody should be refused access to relief, aid and the right to cross the border to safety, and I’m pleased for the chance to support the DEC’s appeal to help all people whose lives have been affected by the conflict.” Porter said he was “thankful to be able to raise my voice in the chorus of peace”, and added: “Together we can show our support for those that are sadly affected by the current world’s events.” More performers are yet to be announced for the two-hour event, which will also include short films documenting the ongoing relief efforts and the experiences of Ukrainians escaping the conflict. An estimated 1.85 million Ukrainians have been displaced since Russia invaded the country four weeks ago. Global radio stations Heart and Capitol will broadcast the concert live and offer exclusive behind-the-scenes coverage.

3/22/2022,"Britain could welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Ukraine in the next few weeks, the health secretary has said, as refugee charities warned the bureaucracy involved in securing visas was forcing people to wait in dangerous situations. Sajid Javid said the UK had already issued 9,500 visas to Ukrainians with family ties to the UK, while 150,000 people had expressed in an interested in hosting refugees through the Homes for Ukraine programme. “I’m pleased that we are supporting Ukraine in every single way that we can, whether that’s military aid, humanitarian aid or indeed providing sanctuary for those that are fleeing Ukraine,” he told LBC. “I expect that we will see hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians arrive here in the UK, and they will get all the support that they need.” But refugee hosting charities expressed concern about the obstacles posed by the visa application process. Lauren Scott, the executive director of Refugees at Home, said: “We’re hearing that the visa applications are quite long and difficult to complete, particularly for people who have had to flee their homes and don’t necessarily have access to internet and to the necessary paperwork. “Many of those fleeing are older people who may not be proficient on the internet, or have smartphones. These are people fleeing war and persecution and we’d like to see existing refugee legislation be used to cover them instead, and the visa requirement waived.” Ruth McMenamin, who is on sabbatical from her job as a travel company marketing head and has been volunteering at a Warsaw station for the past nine days, agreed. “People are exhausted, they don’t have great English, they’re not leaving their homes with laptops,” she said. She added that volunteers were too overwhelmed to help everyone apply for a visa, or help them understand the process by which they could try to match themselves with people in the UK offering rooms in their homes. “Many of the people we are seeing are very tired, very vulnerable women and children, and waiting for visas poses very real dangers – they have to sleep on train station floors, in emergency accommodation and there are real risks to their safety.” One of the first Ukrainian families hoping to come to the UK after fleeing the war-torn city of Kharkivsaid they had experienced multiple problems with the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme. Olha Haponenko, a university academic, and her nine-year-old son, Petro Syvovol, were hoping to come to the UK after completing the sponsorship paperwork. They linked up with the UK sponsors Nicki and Adam Patrick, who live in Wiltshire with their 10-year-old daughter, through personal connections. Both families thought they had filled out all the forms correctly. Haponenko was given an appointment at the UK’s Paris visa-processing centre on Friday because Petro’s Ukrainian passport had expired. Haponenko said she was shocked to receive an automated response to her application saying visa applications were taking 60 working days to process. The message said: “You will NOT hear from this office again UNLESS we require any additional information from you …” Home Office sources told the Guardian the email had been sent in error and that the issue was being looked at as a matter of urgency. Haponenko left Kharkiv soon after the war started and is distraught after having been sent photos of buildings in her neighbourhood destroyed by Russian bombing. “We tried to sort out the visas on Friday at the Paris UK visa office but we were turned away. We are here again today. Petro understands what is going on. All he wants is to get to the UK safely and to start school,” she said. The Patricks have organised a school place for Petro at the same village school their daughter attends. Nicki Patrick said: I want to help in the spirit of “do it, try it, fix it” to make the process easier for others rather than to be moaning about the Home Office at a difficult time. “I realise we are the test cases in the process, and am sure that it will get easier within days, but if no one brings the reality of the difficulties to their attention, then many families will experience unnecessary additional stress.” Bridget Young, the director of Naccom, a UK-wide network that supports people seeking asylum, refugees and other migrants experiencing destitution, also expressed concern that the UK was continuing to require refugees to apply for visas. She said: “There is definitely a disconnect between the government statements and the support of the British public. People have opened their hearts and homes but are starting to get really frustrated with the lack of clarity being provided on how the full scheme will actually work.”",News/Politics,"Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians poised to enter UK, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/21/hundreds-of-thousands-of-ukrainian-refugees-poised-to-enter-uk-says-sajid-javid
3/22/2022,"An Irish government minister is to talk to Ryanair after accusations that it hiked fares on flights from Poland to Ireland as demand soared from Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war. Ryanair has rejected outright the claims made by the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, Larysa Gerasko, at a parliamentary committee meeting last week. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said the claims were “completely false” but Ireland’s transport minister is under pressure to take up the matter. Interviewed on RTÉ radio on Monday, Eamon Ryan was repeatedly asked whether Ryanair should lay on humanitarian flights. He declined to answer the question, telling the show Morning Ireland: “We’re in constant touch with Ryanair. Through the previous Covid crisis, on a number of occasions, they helped us in terms of getting people out of difficult places in different ways. “Let me first of all talk to the ambassador and then I’ll talk to Ryanair without a doubt.” Demand for flights to Dublin from Warsaw has escalated since Russia invaded Ukraine and Ireland lifted visa restrictions for Ukrainians. Flights in the coming days are all sold out with one-way fares on Sunday being advertised at £144, the first day the route is showing availability. Flights the following day drop to about £60, then £44 and £23 the following days. Ryan told RTE that Ireland had welcomed 10,000 refugees into the country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Asked about the price fare claims last week, O’Leary said: “We already carry thousands of refugees around Europe with fixed fares of €20 [£16.70] and €30 and €50.

3/22/2022,"The French carmaker Renault has resumed manufacturing in its plants in Moscow, bucking the trend of many other large global companies that have cut ties with Russia over its war on Ukraine. Renault had suspended production at the plant last month, citing logistical problems after the invasion of Ukraine on Vladimir Putin’s orders. However, Renault’s decision to restart manufacturing has the backing of the French government, which is its main shareholder, according to sources cited by Reuters. Renault has owned a controlling two-thirds stake in the Russian carmaker Avtovaz since late 2016, after first investing in what was then a fast-growing market in 2007. That means it has larger operations in the country than most other European rivals, with 40,000 local employees, posing a huge challenge as the US, UK and EU governments try to isolate Russia economically. Avtovaz sold nearly 2,900 vehicles in 2021, making profits before tax of €186m (£156m) for Renault – or about 12% of its earnings that year. Avtovaz started as a state-owned company in the Soviet Union, making cars that became strongly associated with the Communist regime under the Zhiguli and then Lada brands. While the Moscow plant has restarted, Avtovaz said on Monday it was partially halting production this week at a huge plant in Tolyatti, a city on the Volga river, and another in Izhevsk, a city 500km to the north-east. The halt was caused by shortages of electronic parts, Avtovaz said. Carmakers around the world have struggled to source semiconductor computer chips used in everything from car radios to windscreen wipers, and Russian factories are likely to fall further down the queue as its economic isolation deepens. Western sanctions imposed on Russia since the invasion include bans on semiconductor exports. Several companies from Europe and other rich economies have been forced to write off assets in Russia after government pressure and sanctions. Authentic Brands, the owner of the Reebok sportswear brand, on Monday said it was “taking the necessary steps to immediately suspend operations” of its stores and website in the country. Those firms remaining in Russia have come under increasing pressure to halt business there, including the Swiss food and drink group Nestlé. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, criticised the company, which continues to sell “essential” products such as baby food, cereals and some pet foods in Russia, in a streamed speech to thousands of protesters in Switzerland’s capital of Berne on Saturday. Nestlé has halted sales of “non-essential” items such as coffee pods to Russia and has said it does not make a profit on the goods it continues to market there. Some prominent US and UK retail brands are still operating in Russia because they have been unable to force independent franchise operators to close down. Burger King’s owner, Restaurant Brands International, last week said fast food restaurants were still operating with its brand because its former Russian partner had refused to shut down. Other companies in similar situations include the UK retailer Marks & Spencer and the hotel groups Accor and Marriott.",News/Business,Renault resumes car production in Moscow as rivals cut ties with Russia ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/renault-moscow-russia-nestle
3/22/2022,"1 Choose your hustle wiselyOver the past couple of years, lots of us have thrown ourselves into new hobbies – painting, baking and pottering our way through the pandemic – and many of these passion projects have been transformed into money-making businesses by budding entrepreneurs. “Lots of successful businesses are launched off the back of an existing job or hobby, so this is an area where you can seek inspiration,” says Ben Law, vice president and head of GoDaddy UK and Ireland. “For example, will your skills allow you to launch a consultancy business? Or are you good enough at yoga to offer classes? Or are people willing to pay for the jewellery you make?” If you have more than one talent, think about which one is most likely to sustain you through the ups and downs of running a business. You might be an enthusiastic knitter, but an absolute ace at bicycle repairs. Or perhaps you can upcycle a chest of drawers in the same time it takes you to bake and decorate a cake, but for double the profit. “Some people who want to start a business think they have to come up with an absolutely original idea, but that isn’t the case,” says Law. “Just look at Facebook – it wasn’t the first social network, but that didn’t stop it achieving global success.” 2 Do your researchWithout customers, your hobby will remain just that, so you need to make sure there’s an audience for your business. “Which businesses or products do you use on a regular basis? Is there something missing from what they offer?” asks Law. Perhaps you’ve found yourself giving out free guitar lessons to friends, so you’re confident there’s a gap in the market – otherwise, you’ll need to embark on some market research. “You need to identify your expected target audience, then find out if they’ll be interested in your business,” says Law. “A good place to start is by finding people who match your target demographic, and asking them to answer questions related to your business.” Once you’ve worked out whether you can actually make money, you’ll be in a good position to embark on step three … 3 Produce a business planFew words can strike fear into the heart of a side-hustler as effectively as “business plan”. Breaking it down into manageable steps will make things easier, and there are some brilliant online guides and templates available to help you navigate your way through them. So although this part of the process is essential, it doesn’t have to be intimidating. “The old saying ‘fail to plan and plan to fail’ is accurate,” says business adviser Polly Arrowsmith. “Among the main reasons for new business failure are lack of planning. A business plan is for you, and is a living, evolving document. “Luckily, multiple platforms provide a business planning template, and you can then play about with your numbers without being a spreadsheet wizard. The key thing is to make sure that you know where the profit is being made.” 4 Get your branding rightIt’s tempting to see branding and marketing as side issues that can be tackled once you’ve started making money, but your brand goals and values will inform every aspect of your business. “A brand is more than just a logo, or your appearance; it’s the gut reaction of your target audience when they encounter your product or service,” says Arrowsmith. “Ask yourself: ‘How do I get people to feel a certain way about my offering?’” Start by thinking about what kind of brand you want to be. Is your side hustle high-end and exclusive, or down-to-earth and accessible? Does it have an underlying set of values, such as sustainability, inclusivity, spirituality? Producing a brand story that explains who you are, and why you’re doing what you’re doing, can help express your business’s personality. “As humans, we love stories,” says Arrowsmith. “So brainstorm, ‘What’s interesting about me, and why will this appeal to my target audience?’” 5 Make time for marketingYou need to market yourself and your business cannily if you want to cut through the noise. Setting up a secure, easy-to-navigate website that offers built-in tools for SEO, social media and email marketing is an easy way to cover all the marketing bases. GoDaddy offers starter business websites with localised and personalised domains and a range of simple templates to suit every type of business. A 24/7 helpline means you can access advice and support on tap, and you can sell to anyone, anywhere, at the click of a few buttons. “Having a business website of some kind is a crucial part of getting started,” says Law. “Whether you’re planning to sell your product or service via your site, or just want it to act as a brochure where people can go to find out more about you, it pays to get your site up and running early on.” And if you’re not sure where to start, GoDaddy has plenty of online advice to help you get started.

3/22/2022,"The last two years have seen a boom in side hustles, as lockdown hobbies became passion projects, which evolved into thriving pandemic startups. With more of us working from home and priorities shifting, the number of new companies registered during lockdown soared. The most popular pursuits were food and crafts – such as the range of homemade self-care products made by mum-of-two Jessica Poole. “During the first lockdown in March 2020, I was a mature student in my final year of university, working part-time and raising my two children as a lone parent,” says Poole, 30, from south London. “The only way I could manage my stress during that challenging time was through self-care: my candlelit baths became necessary to my survival. “I loved the ritual so much, I began blending scented candles and rose quartz bath salts as gifts for friends and family. Then, as word of mouth spread, my products became a side hustle. My dream for London Lotus is to turn it into a business that offers a full range of self-care services, such as meditation classes and body positivity workshops, to help people grow into the best versions of themselves.” Now we’ve reached the other side of lockdown, sparky entrepreneurs like Poole are considering turning their passion projects into serious money-making concerns. And to help them embrace these new opportunities, GoDaddy has created a guide to building a free starter website. When you’re working on a project close to your heart, the nuts and bolts of launching an online business can feel daunting, so GoDaddy offers fast, secure web domains, and hundreds of easy-to-customise website templates to choose from to suit your product or service, whether that’s cakes or cardigans, counselling or copywriting. Users also have access to 24/7 customer care to help remove some of the obstacles standing between them and a thriving small business. “I’d love to build Little Leaf Place into something bigger,” says Samantha Wyatt, who currently sells houseplants at craft fairs and through shopping sites. “At the moment, I’m building my social media presence and offering tips to plant owners on my Instagram page to keep them coming back, but my next step has to be building my own website.” The 27-year-old from Worthing, West Sussex, developed her side hustle after she spotted a boom in people buying houseplants. “They’ve become increasingly popular over the last couple of years, as lots of people have been spending much more time at home,” says Wyatt “I realised I could not only grow plants as my own hobby, but I could sell them, too. “I work in retail, but am planning to focus on Little Leaf Place more over the next few years, just to see what happens. I’d love to expand, and eventually import plants wholesale rather than only selling my own stuff.” If, like Wyatt, you’re planning 2022 to be the year of something bigger, you can grab a personalised .co.uk website from GoDaddy for just 99p. A professional email is also available to help you stand out from the crowd, with customers nine times more likely to choose a business with a professional email address. Once you’ve set up your website, integrated marketing tools can be managed from your phone – and if you don’t know what integrated marketing tools are, GoDaddy can help with that too. The hope is that, with such a wide range of services and tools available for new businesses to use on the move, more future entrepreneurs will find the drive they need to get their passion project off the ground – just as full-time mum Emily Tassi, 38, did. “I’ve loved watching makeup tutorials since I was a teenager, and when I get ready for a night out, people ask me if I’ve had my makeup done professionally,” says Tassi, from south-west London. “I’ve started offering to do it for friends before they go out, and it’s occurred to me that this is something I could turn from a hobby into a side hustle. “I used to work in finance, and at one point, I considered becoming a virtual PA, but makeup is my real passion. I love the confidence it gives people, and to get paid to make up a bride and bridesmaids and make them look gorgeous for their big day would be a dream. “I’ve got an Instagram account, but so far, I simply haven’t found the ‘oomph’ I need to push myself forward and set up a website. It’s so hard to make that first leap, but getting a free website and 24/7 tech support would certainly make things easier.” So, if you’re knitting, baking, meditating or making, but lack the push you need to take a leap of faith, now’s the ideal time to look at what GoDaddy has to offer, and take that first, crucial step towards turning your hobby into the next small business success story.
