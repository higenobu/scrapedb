3/25/2022,"Much has been written about the year of economic misery ahead. Rishi Sunak’s attempts to mitigate the impact of the squeeze on living standards have been pored over and – generally – found wanting. The post-mortem examinations carried out on the chancellor’s spring statement were unflattering. There was plenty for the thinktanks that specialise in analysing tax, spending and living standards – the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies – to mull over. The former said the UK faced a year of cost-of-living misery during a parliament of pain. The latter said it was a bad time to be out of work and reliant on state benefits. Both were agreed the current setback to household budgets was the continuation of a now long-established trend. Put simply, Britain has ceased to be a country where workers can expect to get better off year after year once inflation is taken into account. In 1990, real average earnings at today’s prices stood at around £22,000 a year. During the next 18 years they rose steadily so that by 2008 they were £30,000. Since then, real average earnings have moved sideways and if current trends continue they will have risen to just £31,000 by 2027. Had the 1990-2008 trend continued, real average earnings would be about £11,000 a year higher at around £42,000. According to the Resolution Foundation: “With real wages in the midst of a third major fall in a little over a decade, average weekly earnings are on course to rise by just £18 a week between 2008 and 2027, compared to £240 a week had they continued on their pre-financial crisis path.” This is a staggeringly poor performance triggered by the global financial crisis of 2007-08. The IFS’s director, Paul Johnson, says the result of the near-death of the global banking system was “a decade and more of stagnant incomes and flatlining productivity”. The pandemic and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine have dashed hopes that the 2020s might be an easier decade for the UK than the 2010s. After repeated lockdowns, national output has only just recovered all its Covid-19 losses. Two years have been wasted. Inflationary pressures were already evident as the global economy started to recover in the middle of last year. Supply bottlenecks led to rising prices and that trend has been amplified by events in Ukraine. Sunak has offered some support through lower fuel duty, raising the national insurance contributions threshold and – earlier – money off council tax bills but nowhere near enough to compensate for the severity of the squeeze. Those who rely on state benefits will suffer most. The IFS says a non-working single parent with two children will be trying to get by on universal credit payments that are 8.6% lower in real terms than they were before the pandemic and 17.1% less than when the temporary £20 a week uplift to UC was in place. The upshot of cuts of this size is obvious. Absolute poverty is set to rise next year – the first time this has happened in Britain other than during recessions.",News/Business,Upshot of Rishi Sunak’s spring statement?

3/25/2022,"For just a few seconds on Thursday, Sergei Shoigu was back on Russians’ television screens, sitting in the corner box of a teleconference with Vladimir Putin. The Russian defence minister, arguably the man most responsible for the floundering war effort in Ukraine, had not been seen in public for 12 days. Nor had the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, Valery Gerasimov. Rumours were beginning to circulate that they may have been punished over the bungled invasion, which has failed to capture key Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or Kyiv and plunged Russia into economic isolation. Russians had already watched Putin browbeat and humiliate the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, on television during a televised meeting over the fate of the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine. Journalists have since filed reports on an investigation in the FSB directorate responsible for foreign intelligence, including on Ukraine, as well as the arrest of a senior official from Russia’s national guard. It is unclear if any of those events are related to Russia’s war in Ukraine, an effort that is going according to plan, a Russian foreign ministry official said on Thursday. For many Russians, however, it is apparent that the war is not going to plan, and the expectation among Kremlin watchers is that men such as Shoigu could shoulder the blame. Within an information vacuum the rumours about Putin’s anger at his subordinates has also remained just that. Agentstvo, an independent Russian news website, said a source had told it that Shoigu, one of the most trusted men in the nation according to opinion polling, was suffering from heart problems. By Thursday, the matter was being brought up at a daily press call held by the Kremlin. “The defence minister has a lot to deal with right now, as you can understand,” Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said during a briefing, denying Shoigu was in ill-health. “A special military operation is ongoing. Certainly, now isn’t exactly the right time for media activities. This is quite understandable.” Sensing a problem, the Kremlin promptly returned Shoigu to television. The clip released on Thursday was unusual: a security council teleconference with Vladimir Putin, where Shoigu was said to have reported “progress in the special military operation and efforts being made by the military to provide humanitarian aid, ensure security, and restore vital infrastructure on the liberated territories”. But you wouldn’t know that because the sound was turned off. And Shoigu appeared for just seconds, as his camera was briefly unblocked to reveal him sitting in front of several Russian flags at an undisclosed location. His arm moved, proving it wasn’t just a picture of the defence minister returned to television to dispel rumours about his demise. And then, just as quickly, he was gone again.",News/World news,Russian defence minister resurfaces on TV – but for just a few seconds,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russian-defence-minister-resurfaces-on-tv-but-for-just-a-few-seconds

3/25/2022,"The dust had settled a day after Rishi Sunak swept through a Sainsbury’s petrol forecourt in south east London as part of a publicity event for his spring statement. While the chancellor of the exchequer was mocked on social media for posing for publicity pictures showing him pumping petrol into someone else’s Kia Rio – later telling staff that he hoped customers “would be a bit happier” with fuel duty coming down – it was the wider cost of living squeeze that was foremost in the minds of many passersby on Thursday. Some motorists at the petrol station welcomed a 5p-a litre-cut to fuel duty, though others using an adjacent supermarket characterised the spring statement as a missed opportunity to assist them with potentially crippling daily living costs and increasingly costly bills. George, 65, and Geraldine 70 BridgesTwo retirees on the way to do a weekly shop at Sainsbury’s, across from the petrol forecourt Geraldine: “If I had known that Rishi Sunak was here yesterday I would have gone up to him and really said that we feel forgotten about. We’re already struggling to pay our energy bill at the moment and it’s going to be going up about £585 a year. “We’re just going to do a shop in Sainsbury’s now and we’ve had to change things drastically there too. It’s all yellow label [discounted] items, which we either batch cook things like chilli or put it in the freezer.” “George is on a pension and I am on universal credit and it just feels like it’s one thing after another. Our daughter has been paraplegic since an operation some years ago so we have the two children with us. We bought a motorhome some years ago thinking that we could use it in retirement but we can’t bring it back into London because they want £300 from the congestion charge. It’s stuck outside London.” Dave YoungTelecoms engineer and father taking break before his next job “The national insurance change [the threshold at which employees pay national insurance contributions (NICs) will be lifted by £3,000 to £12,570 a year] was what registered with me because it’s left me three, four hundred pound better off a year. I’m a conservative and I believe that what he has done is good overall since the pandemic, so I have no real complaints about it. Income tax? Well, to be seen to be reducing taxes is an election winner isn’t it ? “Our gas has gone up so we’re not entirely happy about that so it’s very much an up and down spike.

Personally, I feel that food should be cheaper – particularly for people who have children – and even help with the cost of activities. “Other things could change too. I am not working at the moment because we have three children and it makes more sense for me to be looking after them full-time. “To be honest I wasn’t so aware of the energy price increase that’s coming but everything – whether it’s council tax or daily items – does seem to be increasing in price at the moment, so that won’t help.” Felicia KekekeA grandmother on the way to do a supermarket shop “I saw something about Rishi Sunak and what he was announcing on the news last night but I didn’t realise that he was here. If I had known I would have told him that it’s a real struggle. “My energy bills especially are going up, and I’m concerned at the moment because I’ve just recently got a letter telling me that was going to be going up – I think it was British Gas – by about 54 percent. “That’s a lot because at the moment I’m paying about £1,000 for my energy. “I don’t really feel like the government is doing enough to help people at the moment who are being squeezed, or worse. “It’s just me at home at the moment – my husband died some years ago – but I have grownup children who come to visit me.

3/25/2022,"Thousands of people who had saved up to pay for their funeral risk losing money after their plan provider Safe Hands collapsed into administration. The restructuring firm appointed to handle the process, FRP, said they were not able to provide immediate refunds to Safe Hands’ 46,000 customers, leading to concerns that pre-bought funerals may not be honoured. For the next fortnight Dignity, one of the UK’s biggest undertakers, had agreed to step in and provide funerals on the company’s behalf. The window will be used by FRP to explore a longer-term solution, such as the transfer of its funeral plans to another company. On its website Safe Hands customers are told that at present it is “uncertain that the funeral plans will be able to be fulfilled”. Customers should consider their plan “terminated with immediate effect,” it says. “This includes funeral plans that were part-paid and funeral plans that were being processed. No further direct debit or standing order instalments will be collected.” The funeral selling industry is being overhauled and from this summer any provider will be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, a move that will give consumers a greater protection. Safe Hands, based in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was bought by private equity firm SHP Capital Holdings two years ago. Tom Gormanly, who joined as chief executive at the time of the deal, resigned earlier this month. The company failed after a period of severe financial challenges, including the strain caused by the pandemic, that left it unsustainable in its current form, FRP said. “Our immediate focus has been to secure an interim funeral services provision with Dignity for the next 14 days to ensure that any plan-holders that pass away are cared for while we seek to find a longer-term solution,” said Nedim Ailyan, one of the administrators. “Regrettably, the administration means the company is not in a position to issue refunds at this time. We appreciate how upsetting this period of uncertainty will be.” FRP said it would carry out a detailed investigation to discover what could be returned to creditors, including policyholders whose funds are held in a trust fund which itself has a shortfall. “Unfortunately, there is a shortfall between the level of plan holder investments and the forecast level of funeral plan costs to be paid,” said Ailyan. “Essentially, the value of the investments is not enough to meet the funeral plan obligations of the company.” Customer payments were used to acquire investments including equities, bonds, cash, real estate and loans. The legal structure was complicated and they needed to find out which ones could be realised for the benefit of plan holders, FRP said. The process of realising assets and issuing partial repayments to plan holders is a significant undertaking and would take some time to complete, the administrators added. They will be contacting plan holders to explain how they can register a claim. Plan holders and their families can also contact the company’s customer service team on 0800 640 9928.

3/25/2022,"An NHS trust has apologised over the death of a 27-year-old events manager after a locum gynaecologist mistook aggressive cervical cancer for a hormonal or bowel problem. The family of Porsche McGregor-Sims, who died a day after being admitted to Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, told her inquest that she had felt she was not listened to and that the misdiagnosis had robbed them of a chance to say goodbye. Thearea coroner Rosamund Rhodes-Kemp said the case was one of the most “shocking and traumatic” she had dealt with and she would write to Portsmouth hospitals university NHS trust expressing her concern. In December 2019, McGregor-Sims’ GP referred her to a consultant after she complained of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She saw Dr Peter Schlesinger, an agency locum at the Queen Alexandra hospital, at the end of January 2020. He did not physically examine her and believed her symptoms were linked to changing hormones or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). After the UK went into lockdown two months later, McGregor-Sims continued to report symptoms but was prescribed antibiotics over the phone and was seen in person only after a GP thought she might have Covid because she had shortness of breath. McGregor-Sims was taken to hospital where an aggressive form of cervical cancer was diagnosed and she died a day later on 14 April 2020. During the inquest, her family accused Schlesinger of having denied them their chance to say goodbye. Her mother, Fiona Hawke, told him: “You robbed us of the opportunity to prepare for her death and say goodbye to her.” Hawke said that when her daughter finally went into hospital she was “scared and alone”, adding: “She knew it was going to be a fight and she knew she probably was not going to survive it in the long run but she did not expect to die two days after being diagnosed. She expected to be listened to and helped but that is not what happened.“Had the examination been done in January we would have still had some time with her. A few weeks more would have made an indescribable difference to that experience for all of us – including Porsche.” Schlesinger insisted McGregor-Sims’ symptoms – including bleeding after sex – did not lead him to think she had a serious illness. Dr Claire Burton, a consultant gynaecologist, said Schlesinger should have physically examined McGregor-Sims, and apologised for the care she received at the trust. Burton said: “If [Scheslinger] had examined her then she would have been referred for a colposcopy [cervix examination] more quickly, where diagnosis would have been made. I would like to express our condolences to Porsche’s family and friends, and to apologise for the care she had.” Liz Rix, the chief nurse at Portsmouth hospitals university NHS trust, said: “I would like to express our condolences to the family of Porsche McGregor-Sims. When we were aware of concerns around her care, we immediately investigated these and ensured we learnt from the experience of Porsche and her loved ones.” The coroner said she would write a letter of concern to the trust. Rhodes-Kemp said: “We see hundreds and hundreds of cases every year – and I have done about 6,000 inquests – but this one is particularly sad. “It is not clear that a referral in January would have altered the tragic outcome, but an earlier diagnosis would have allowed her and her family more time to prepare themselves.” She concluded McGregor-Sims died of natural causes. The inquest heard the trust had reviewed protocols following the case, which had led to it deciding to employ more in-house consultants rather than using locums.All patients seen by Schlesinger had now had consultations with another doctor, the inquest heard. McGregor-Sims had studied drama at Havant and South Downs college in Hampshire before going to the University of Plymouth to study events management. She met her fiance, Mark Chappel, while at university, and the pair moved back to Portsmouth after finishing their studies.",News/Society,"NHS trust apologises over death of woman, 27, whose cancer was misdiagnosed",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/24/nhs-trust-apologises-over-death-of-woman-27-whose-cervical-cancer-was-misdiagnosed

3/25/2022,"In 1986, the historian John Elliott published a massive biography of a 17th-century Spanish statesman, Gaspar de Guzmán, the count-duke of Olivares. John, who has died aged 91, had already published numerous acclaimed books although his first, Nibble the Squirrel, written for children in 1946, is a lesser-known part of the canon. Although already a toweringly influential historian in Britain, Spain and the US, with his 1963 work Imperial Spain, 1469-1716 still regarded as the go-to introduction to the Habsburg period, it was the bombshell of the 1986 biography that put Olivares on the map and was probably instrumental in John’s elevation in 1990 to the regius chair of modern history at Oxford. The volume was hailed by Raymond Carr in the New York Review of Books as “what must rank as the finest biography ever written on a Spanish statesman”. After it, no historian could remain unaware of the all-powerful, if ultimately unsuccessful, factotum of Spain’s ineffectual Philip IV, a king so concerned with the arts and his innumerable mistresses that he left the administration of the country’s sprawling, ramshackle empire to Olivares. In shedding light on the great adversary of Cardinal Richelieu, John rendered comprehensible the central power struggle of 17th-century Europe, a contest in which the Spaniard was the loser. John’s pursuit of Olivares was lifelong, a hint of which was the brilliant portrait in his first major work, The Revolt of the Catalans: A Study in the Decline of Spain, 1598-1640 (1963). The fascination had begun when, as a Cambridge undergraduate, he first saw the Diego Velázquez portrait of Olivares in the Prado museum in Madrid. It was to be an awesomely difficult task. Most of Olivares’ papers that survived his own cavalier approach to record-keeping were lost in fires in the 18th century. In order to assemble the remnants, John spent a quarter of a century searching in 16 private and public archives in Spain alone, as well as in eight other countries. The triumphant result was the stunningly researched and vividly written biography. Imperial Spain was the first of a series of path-breaking books on the imperial struggles between France and Spain that, in turn, opened up a new field of world history. Another distinguished historian of Spain, Victor Kiernan, said of it: “General readers coming more or less fresh to the subject will be grateful for this masterly introduction to it and … [specialists] who have struggled with it already will receive much fresh light.” John himself commented in the preface that one of his aims in writing the history of Habsburg Spain was to indicate “how much remains to be done before we can confidently claim to have found the answers”. The book was, in his own words, a work of “interpretative synthesis” rather than conventional narrative, a skill in which he excelled. Along the way, the book sparkled with perceptive insights. Take for example this brilliant summary of Spain’s agricultural limitations: “A dry, barren, impoverished land: 10 per cent of its soil bare rock; 35 per cent poor and unproductive; 45 per cent moderately fertile; 10 per cent rich.” His explanation of the popular appeal of the antisemitism that underlay the work of the Inquisition was equally memorable, illustrating how the poor could seek consolation in their “purity” of blood unlike the aristocrats who had often intermarried with wealthy families of converted Jews. In this and other books could be discerned John’s concern with parallels between the loss of empire and national decline in the Spain of the 1620s and Britain in the 1950s, what Kiernan called “a condition of national imbecility such as few nations have ever sunk to”. In 2012, he published his memoir History in the Making, a commentary on the changing nature of historical writing in his lifetime, together with reflections on his own career, what he modestly called “the testimony of a historian who has tried to understand”. That was a worthy vocation for a historian who eschewed theory, wrote accessibly and believed in the importance of human agency in shaping great historical events. He defined the key to the writing of good history as “the ability to enter imaginatively into the life of a society remote in time or place, and produce a plausible explanation of why its inhabitants thought and behaved as they did”. Born in Reading, to Janet (nee Payne) and Thomas Elliott, a headmaster, John went to Eton college, but entirely lacked the arrogance and entitled bluster of better-known products of the school. After graduating in history from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1952, he had a distinguished career as a lecturer there (1957-67) and five years as professor at King’s College London before moving in 1973 to what he called the “scholar’s paradise” at Princeton, where he stayed for nearly 20 years. I got to know John shortly after his return to Britain to take up the regius chair at Oxford. Previously, my knowledge of him came from his books, including The Revolt of the Catalans, which had given him hero status in Catalonia. There, over the years, as in Spain, he was showered with prestigious prizes. To learn Catalan, he had lodged with a family in Barcelona. “Before my stay was over I was even dreaming in Catalan,” he wrote later. He had also acquired a sense of the repression of Catalans under the Franco dictatorship. A striking experience came one day when, innocently speaking in Catalan, he asked a member of the Policía Nacional for directions. The furious policeman snapped: “Speak the language of the empire!” A more nuanced awareness of the history of Catalonia’s relationship with Spain came with studying with the Catalan historian Jaume Vicens i Vives, whose influence meant that John avoided falling prey to the theme of “chosen nation syndrome or innocent victim syndrome”. Thus, his most recent book, Scots and Catalans: Union and Disunion (2018), which made sage criticisms of the most recent Catalan independence movement, did not, inevitably, please the more radical Catalanistas. At Oxford, John set up a small taskforce to work on a not entirely successful project to reform the teaching of history at the university. As a member of his team, I got to know the tall and rather gaunt figure, invariably quiet and courteous. He was a reserved and abstemious man, so much so that it was assumed that he would live long beyond his 91 years. In his work and his life, the watchwords were grace and humility. He was knighted in 1994. His wife, Oonah (nee Butler), whom he married in 1958, survives him.

3/25/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement succeeds most brutally in resurrecting and reinforcing the historical divisions between the “deserving” and “undeserving” poor (UK’s most vulnerable face crunch as Rishi Sunak helps better-off, 23 March). For the “deserving”, many on low wages who earn their poverty, the deceptive small increases are aimed to engender gratitude but will also contribute to scapegoating the “feckless” poor. For the “undeserving”, those on fixed benefits, who will see their income cut by up to 7% (taking into account predicted inflation), life will be hell, as they struggle to keep warm, feed their families or get by on their state pensions or disability allowances. Many will blame themselves for having to depend on charitable relief for food, children’s clothes and bedding, and go without. As your editorial suggests (23 March), Sunak’s statement “is a strategy for inequality”. But notably absent in Wednesday’s parliamentary debate and follow-up interviews with the opposition was any commitment to a wider vision, to radically reduce major societal inequalities through more progressive income tax and wealth reform, or even propose the dignity afforded by a living wage.Prof Mike SteinUniversity of York  Rafael Behr points out that the spring statement from Rishi Sunak provides austerity by stealth, where the poorest bear the brunt of inflation (Rishi Sunak emerged from the pandemic as the candidate of sincerity. But he’s as cynical as Johnson, 23 March). Contrast this with the generosity of English people who offer their homes for Ukrainian refugees, yet consistently vote for governments who punish the poorest and most economically vulnerable.Felicity McGowanCardigan, Ceredigion  Rishi Sunak said he couldn’t help everybody in his spring statement. Well, he could. He could tax the rich energy companies. He could tax billionaires far more, he could introduce a land tax, he could introduce a tax on share dealings. He could also insulate every home, make all new housing zero-carbon, raise universal credit, ie give the £20 extra during the lockdowns back. He could try living on universal credit for a month and then reflect on what it is like, and what it is about some human beings that makes them not want to share their wealth fairly. Luckily, I don’t want a big house, flash car, ugly yacht, expensive new clothes. Someone said the rich aren’t happy – protecting and defending their wealth, losing their integrity, telling lies to themselves. Give me a garden and seeds, trees, somewhere beautiful to walk – these are the real riches of our world.Miranda CoxBideford, Devon  If the chancellor is looking for some extra cash, he might consider cancelling the proposed expenditure of £510m by Thérèse Coffey in pursuit of universal credit fraud. This will bring it neatly into line with the approach adopted by the government in respect of Covid fraud amounting to £4.3bn that is apparently too difficult to pursue.Philip ArundelColwall Green, Herefordshire  The tax-free winter fuel payment – between £100 and £300 – is paid annually to everyone over 67 years of age. Those who receive housing benefit, council tax reduction, child benefit or universal credit do not qualify.

3/25/2022,"Your editorial commending the Welsh government on its smacking ban (21 March) might have drawn attention to the NSPCC’s estimation that at least one child is killed each week in the UK, usually at the hands of a parent or carer. This appalling level of mortality most likely understates the actual figure but is undoubtedly directly connected to the fact that we have historically afforded children less protection in law. My amendment to ensure children had the same legal protection from assault as given to adults was not accepted by the then Labour government when the 2004 Children Act was passed, and I have a vivid recollection of the prime minister, Tony Blair, telling me at the time that the proposal was “a notch too far”. I have often wondered how many of the more than 800 children killed during the near two decades since might just possibly not have lost their lives if we had introduced that very modest and quite simple reform.David HinchliffeLabour MP for Wakefield, 1987-2005  It astounds me that anyone would still consider it acceptable to use physical punishment to modify children’s behaviour, and that any civilised nation would not outlaw it. It displays a lack of self-control on behalf of the adult, and an inability to convey orally to children that their behaviour is unacceptable. We used to put our children into the spare bedroom until they calmed down/apologised, or we withdrew treats, explaining why we considered what they had done was wrong.

3/25/2022,"The leading candidate to become the new chair of the Charity Commission has told MPs he will not allow the regulator to be dragged into media- and government-led “culture wars” – and would even intervene to defend a charity that he felt had been unfairly treated. Orlando Fraser, a onetime Tory parliamentary candidate with links to a rightwing thinktank, has been selected as the government’s choice to run the watchdog. On Thursday he defended himself against criticism that he was a political appointee, saying he was no longer in the Tory party or even a Conservative. The commission has been at the centre of controversies involving charities such as the National Trust and Barnardo’s, while former culture secretary Oliver Dowden said he wanted the regulator to pursue “woke” and “political” charities. Fraser, a commercial barrister who was selected for the role earlier this month by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, told MPs on the digital media, culture and sport select committee he was committed to a “fair, balanced, and independent” approach. His selection was met with dismay by Labour, which said the government had “looked after one of their own” and by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which questioned whether he was fully politically independent. But Fraser, who stood as a Tory parliamentary candidate in 2005, said he had left behind his political interests and was committed to impartiality. He defended his stint as a Charity Commission board member between 2013 and 2017, when it came under attack for perceived politicisation under previous chair William Shawcross. Asked about any personal links with Boris Johnson, Fraser said: “I’d like to say on the record, I’m not a friend of the prime minister and I have never been a friend of the prime minister.” The previous holder of the £62,000-a-year role, ex-Tory minister Lady Stowell, stepped down a year ago after criticism in some quarters that she had pursued a political agenda. Her planned successor, Martin Thomas, quit in December, four days before he was due to start, over a controversy involving his past stewardship of a charity. Labour MP Kevin Brennan asked Fraser if he could assure the committee he would not get involved the government’s culture war agenda, backed by tabloid newspapers, which sought to prevent charities from pursuing legitimate charitable aims. “Absolutely not,” Fraser replied. “We will not be an arm of government in any way at all about that kind of issue. All we will ever do is look at the facts and decide the facts based on charity law. If there is an issue we will do something about it, if there isn’t, we wouldn’t.” Fraser said the extent of the commission’s involvement in arguments about so-called “woke” charities would be to assess through a “narrow legal prism” whether there had been a breach of charity law. “If there’s a problem it should do something, if there is not a problem, then it shouldn’t,” he said. In some circumstances he would defend the charity, he suggested. If the commission had found no legal case to answer against a charity that did good works but had been “damaged by what looks like an unjust media attack”, then the commission, he said, “should be prepared to say something”. Brennan said Fraser’s late grandfather, Labour peer Lord Longford, had been savaged by the tabloid press and Tory ministers because he campaigned for the release of moors murderer Myra Hindley. He asked: “If Frank Longford was around today campaigning on these things, would you be supportive of ministers who accused him of wokeness?” Fraser replied: “I would not have the Charity Commission being an arm of government and assisting in any way with an anti-woke agenda, full stop, with anyone, whether it was Frank Longford or not.” Fraser had links to the rightwing Centre for Social Justice thinktank and was involved in the creation of its influential Breakdown Britain critique, which helped drive David Cameron’s Big Society agenda.",News/Society,Charity Commission chair candidate says he will not be dragged into ‘culture wars’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/24/charity-commission-chair-appointee-says-he-will-not-be-dragged-into-culture-wars
3/25/2022,"Shock news! The No 1 tennis player in the world has announced that there is more to her life than the number of times she wins a tennis championship. The collective state of astonishment at Ash Barty’s retirement at the age of 25 says as much about how we see athletes as it does about this extraordinary woman. How have we reached a point where it is surprising for a top athlete to have a healthy mindset? Where it stuns us that someone who has won at the highest level isn’t desperate to do it again as many times as possible? Where we ask why she is somehow unfairly depriving herself – and us – of something she owes us, as though she hasn’t yet served her time? Barty has been in tennis for 20 years (remarkable given that she has only been alive for 25 years), has won multiple grand slams including the memorable victory at her home slam in Melbourne in January. She has been world No 1 for over 100 weeks. But the questions after Melbourne focused not on this stunning victory, but how many more like it there would be in future. Sporting achievements are transient, each one diminished as the focus shifts inevitably to the next, and next, and next. But by finding lasting value in that magical scene in Melbourne, she could have found her biggest victory. When I joined the Olympic pathway some years ago, coaches asked me whether I was willing to do “whatever it takes”. In hindsight,I can see now how sinister that was. When you inevitably agree in the affirmative – the only option unless you wanted to walk out on your Olympic dream – it is like signing a pact with the devil. It means giving up defining success on your own terms or as anything less than coming first as often as possible, at any cost. Barty has made no such pact. She has explained clearly that she has nothing more to give. Why would anyone want her to keep pushing further at a point likely to lead only to mental and physical damage? Do onlookers want her to continue until she fails? She is, in her words, “the person not the athlete”. So often do we forget that athletes are also daughters, friends, partners, with any number of other interests. Questions of identity are particularly perilous for athletes. Once defined solely by accomplishments of hitting balls, pulling oars or throwing objects, mental health challenges quickly follow: injury becomes a life-crisis, transition and retirement can feel devastating, poor results attack self-worth. Barty has been very smart by defining success on her own terms. When she lost motivation a few years ago, she retired and went to play cricket (where she also excels). When the mojo returned, she came back to tennis not just with great results - more importantly, she created a new way to enjoy the tennis experience, consciously creating a calendar that prevented a repeat of burnout and surrounding herself with a trusted team to share the journey alongside her. Barty had a purpose, perhaps clearest when creating history at the Australian Open and immediately taking the trophy to share with youngsters on the clay courts of Uluru. Her strong sense of social responsibility may well be a guiding force in what comes next. We are certainly seeing an increasing number of athletes, from Marcus Rashford to Hannah Mills to the England football team, recognising how they can bring greater meaning and lasting value to their sporting careers by using their platforms as a force for positive social change. Moreover, when motivated by purpose, it’s far easier to move on to the next part of your life; athletes chasing trophies can only chase more trophies. Barty is not alone as an athlete defining a new path. In the same sport, Naomi Osaka has talked about the darkness that came from chasing rankings and her determination to re-find the joy in tennis. Gymnast Simone Biles similarly astounded the world when she put her own health first, stepping back from competing at the Tokyo Olympics and insisting that “I’m more than my accomplishments and gymnastics.” Many called Biles brave and have used the same adjective for Barty. But something has gone deeply wrong when it’s brave to act in your own best interests and challenge others’ expectations that would likely damage you mentally and physically. Across the high performance world, I have found that when success is defined narrowly (a single result, a moment on the podium) in non-human terms (a medal, trophy or entry in the record books), and imposed by others (“only first place counts”, you will be worth more, funded more, sponsored more, if you get a certain result) – then athletes frequently end up feeling empty, unfulfilled, even depressed. Examples of this abound – from Jonny Wilkinson to Victoria Pendleton. High performance sport has been spectacularly unhealthy for some time. After endless doping, corruption and athlete abuse scandals, there is perhaps a new opportunity for sport and society emerging with the next generation of athletes creating their own stories and refusing to follow past patterns. Ash Barty may just have written herself into the history books after all, in a way that won’t simply be scrubbed out by the next person to win more trophies.

3/25/2022,"Nato leaders are willing to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine after a plea from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for tanks, rockets and air-defence systems at the Brussels summit. On Thursday, during a three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed how they could upgrade and increase their weapons supply – but without provoking Russia to the point where the conflict would lead to a wider war in Europe. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said: “I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying … What I can say is that allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons.” The leaders also warned Russia against using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, arguing that any such use “would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences” – without spelling out what the response would be. Masks, protective suits, detection and other equipment would also be supplied by Nato members to Ukraine, Stoltenberg confirmed, reflecting western fears that Russia is trying to create “some kind of pretext” by falsely accusing Ukraine, the US and Nato of “preparing to use chemical and biological weapons”. At the summit, Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and other Nato leaders heard a characteristically passionate call from Zelenskiy for “military assistance – without restrictions”. He asked for Nato members to supply more weapons because “Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us”. Zelenskiy specifically asked for anti-missile systems, MLRS rocket artillery, anti-ship weapons, air defence equipment – plus tanks and fighter jets. “You can give us 1% of all your planes. One per cent of your tanks,” he said. Nato leaders discussed what further weapons could be supplied given that Ukraine has held out for far longer than expected, and which countries were best placed to supply what arms, western officials said. “There was a discussion both about more [military equipment] in terms of more numbers, and more in terms of different equipment,” one official said. “A lot of eastern allies were talking about … the extent to which they can provide equipment, because it’s ex-Soviet equipment,” which is used by Ukraine’s military, the official added. Some western allies also talked about providing kit that would help eastern European nations backfill, they said. But there remain limits, with officials indicating they thought it unlikely any Nato country would want to provide tanks, for fear of Russian retaliation. A previous proposal by Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets via the US was rejected by the White House, for similar reasons. “We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but Nato allies and Russia,” Stoltenberg said in a post-summit press conference. Nato members have largely said they will only provide “defensive equipment”, but Russian military errors and Ukraine’s determination to fight back have left the aggressors struggling to make progress without resorting to heavy bombardment that has left the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv in ruins. But the impact the Russian bombing has had on civilians partly underpinned Zelenskiy’s plea to the leaders present. “Ukraine does not have powerful anti-missile weapons, and has a much smaller aircraft fleet than Russia,” he said. “Therefore, their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction. “And you see the consequences today – how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed.” Some believe that a more powerfully armed Ukraine could even push Russian forces out of the country. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine said it had destroyed a Russian warship, the Orsk, in an explosion in the occupied city of Berdiansk. Social media video released on Thursday morning by the country’s navy showed a large fire and a plume of smoke apparently coming from a docked ship.",News/World news,Nato leaders agree to upgrade weapons supply to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/nato-leaders-agree-upgrade-weapons-supply-ukraine-russia
