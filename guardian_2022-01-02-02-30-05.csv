1/2/2022,"New year, new dawn? As it turned out, not quite. For a long time, this had threatened to be a first clean sheet for Watford under Claudio Ranieri, but Davinson Sánchez’s injury-time header ensured it was not. Watford have gone through five managers since they last kept a Premier clean sheet and it is that fact that may relegate them. So this was not a moment in history, and without that there will be very little to keep the memory of the game alive. It seems unlikely that misty-eyed fans of either side will ever give a nonentity of a game a second thought. If this is ever shown on a nostalgia channel in three decades time, it can only be because some apocalyptic event has created a cultural desert of previously unimagined barrenness.  For Watford, six points in 11 games since Ranieri took over is not a hugely optimistic stat. For the Italian, pretty much all that can be said is that his win percentage is higher than it was during his disastrous stint in charge of Fulham – although anything but a win at Newcastle in a fortnight would change that. While there have been the remarkable victories over Everton and Manchester United, it’s very hard to argue that there has been an improvement since Ranieri replaced Xisco Muñoz at the beginning of October. From a clean sheet, though, could perhaps have grown belief – and there had not been much of that at kick-off. Rather there was a sense for much of the first half of an acceptance of fate, something encapsulated by the sight of Harry the Hornet forlornly banging a drum in the corner to general indifference. Perhaps the hundreds of empty seats were down primarily to Covid, the complications of festive travel and new year hangovers, but it can’t help that this Watford offer so little incentive to make an effort. Perhaps that is unfair. Watford’s attacking ventures were limited, but there was at least resistance, even if that consisted largely in simply being, existing in a relatively organised 4-4-2. But again and again possession was wasted. Clearance after clearance went to a Spurs player or out of play. Pass after pass was misplaced. Only after half-time, after the introduction of João Pedro and his direct running was there a sense that Watford might trouble Spurs. And the result was that Spurs kept coming in wave after wave. Perhaps this was defiance but it was the defiance if an unremarkable sandstone cliff against the sea: eventually erosion was always going to take its course. Not that Tottenham offered a huge amount. There were a couple of long-range efforts, from Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Sergio Reguilon, and Harry Kane fired just wide after Imran Louza had slipped, but for the most part there was huffing and puffing and passes fired just too far in front of Emerson Royal. Tottenham, like so many high-pressing teams, are at their best against sides who come out at them, which Watford, with their two banks of four dropped deep, simply didn’t do. This was the same as the Southampton game, as Spurs lacked the creative spark to break through against increasingly dogged opponents. Forced to try to play their way through an opponent, Tottenham looked a little one-paced and lacking in imagination. There was the odd twist from Son Heung-min but this was a game of very little subtlety or quality. And that perhaps suggests the limits of this squad. For all Tottenham have improved under Antonio Conte, for all they have a purpose and a drive, for all they look better organised and more motivated, they remain the same group of players, and they are a group that, since the departure of Christian Eriksen, has lacked much in the way of magic or unpredictability. Tanguy Ndombele has at times perhaps suggested he could provide it, but Conte made fairly clear this week that he is no fan: Ndombele’s unpredictability is the wrong kind of unpredictability. If there was improvement after half-time, it was modest, although a smart Kane turn and shot did at least draw a save from Daniel Bachmann, who then reacted sharply to push away a close-range Son effort. But a delay while a fan received medical treatment perhaps allowed Spurs to regroup. Certainly they seemed sharper after the restart and when Son was tripped wide on the left, he whipped in the free-kick for Sánchez to touch home.",Sport/Football,Davinson Sánchez breaks Watford’s resolve with 96th-minute Spurs winner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/watford-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
1/2/2022,"Michael Gove, in his new role as the cabinet’s major-domo and minister in charge of “levelling up”, is about to expend large amounts of intellectual and political capital attempting to close the gap between the south-east and everywhere else. Levelling up, as we are told repeatedly by No 10, will be the defining achievement of the Johnson administration and 2022 is the year that efforts to transform the much-neglected regions begin to gather pace. With this in mind, Gove is about to publish a white paper that outlines how the government plans to tackle this gargantuan task.  So far the prospects for a major commitment across Whitehall are looking slim. The chancellor, for one, wants to make sure that whatever Gove wants comes with no new cash attached. Recycling is popular in government, especially when it concerns money. Gove’s response appears to be a renewed focus on the bureaucracy supporting the regions. He has floated a scheme to fill the geographical gaps between the metro mayors who run most of England’s big city regions with a new concept of US-style regional governors. There is no suggestion of mimicking the neo-colonial mini-White Houses that host governors in most US state capitals – just a network of elected chiefs able to reduce regional inequalities and drive growth around the country. Gove’s mistake here is his apparent determination to join the list of reformers who focus more on structures than desired outcomes. One advantage he can claim as he prepares to confront the many entrenched and powerful interests in the shires (which dominate the Conservative party apparatus and will object to governors) is the lack of agreement among political opponents on an alternative to whatever structure he puts forward. Labour and the thinktanks that feed ideas to shadow ministers agree on one thing – that extra funds and power should be devolved away from Whitehall. But they have not found an alternative system of local democracy to coalesce around since John Prescott’s proposal for regional assemblies was crushed in a referendum held in north-east England more than 25 years ago. And there is good reason. As Prescott found out, extra layers of government appear to the public as civil-service employment schemes. Even sharp-shooting governors can quickly look like jobsworths to those who see themselves as taxpayers first and citizens second. Labour is rightly more concerned with issues that Gove wants to sidestep, such as how to foster more productive regional economic engines based on a collaboration of public and private capital. The access to private capital in England’s north-east, north-west and south-west, where a lack of finance cripples businesses’ ambitions, is so much more important than having a go-getting governor. And what about health outcomes and education, which have improved by leaps and bounds in London and the south-east over the last 20 years, while standards have stagnated or gone backwards in other parts of the country? From George Osborne’s elected mayors to Gove’s planned overhaul, debates about the efficient and functional management of English territory have always taken precedence over questions such as how to determine and represent local political identities in a way that increases levels of participation, accountability and legitimacy. These issues underpin economic success because they give individuals and communities a sense of respect and control. Gove wants the eventual model for the whole country to be London, which, he says, under Labour and Conservative mayors has set out strategic goals, giving coherence to the revitalisation and regeneration of large parts of the capital. The latest of those mayors, Sadiq Khan, says these statements ring hollow. He told the Observer: “The government is saying to all other parts of the country they will have a London-style transport system. But London doesn’t have a London-style transport system and that is because these days the government is micro-managing what we can and can’t do. “Whether you are Andy Burnham or Andy Street, Jamie Driscoll in the north-east or Dan Jarvis in Sheffield, it is clear more powers should be devolved. But the control freakery of the government, with ministers hoarding power rather than giving it away, is overwhelming.” Economic studies show that only a greater degree of autonomy can generate higher and more sustainable growth rates, and that such progress is only seen over long periods of time. So why should anyone put their faith in governors when the template for them, the London mayor, is cut off at the knees, denied not only the cash needed to do anything meaningful, but with Whitehall breathing down his neck? If Gove cannot enhance local democracy and accept all that it entails, then governors and much else he proposes will be window dressing for an administration that is levelling down.",News/Business,It’s hard to ‘level up’ when No 10 is always bearing down on everyone,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/its-hard-to-level-up-when-no-10-is-always-bearing-down-on-everyone
1/2/2022,"Four Peaks Sound Walk (Radio 3) | BBC SoundsDesert Island Discs: Richard Osman (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsA Tribute to Janice Long (BBC Radio Wales) | BBC SoundsChristmas Takeover (Radio 1) | BBC Sounds Radio 3’s Four Peaks Sound Walk, which went out on Christmas Day and the following three days, initially seemed like a strange yuletide-to-new-year offering. Each programme was based around a walk to the top of the highest peak in each of the four nations of the UK. Presenter Horatio Clare, producer Jeremy Evans and sound engineer Andy Fell all tramped to the top of Ben Nevis, Slieve Donard, Scafell Pike and Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), through cawing birds, shifting landscapes, capricious mountain weather and varying amounts of fellow climbers (hardly any on Slieve Donard, hordes on Ben Nevis).  The shows mixed the airy, rainy sounds of the walks with Clare’s observations, reminiscences and recounting of myths. Music was added too, some of which was a little on the nose (classical strings and “bom-bom” drums pull me out of, rather than bring me into an atmosphere), though most was a lovely addition. And Clare is such a wonderful presenter, his occasional exertion-caused breathiness somehow enhancing his gorgeous way with words. I loved his tale-telling: the stories of the to and fro between Irish clan leader Donard and Christian arriviste Saint Patrick; Clare’s own childhood memories of going crabbing with “the Welsh Cézanne”, Kyffin Williams, “a real druid figure with a white moustache and gentle manner”. Clare has a gentle manner, his clipped, polite greetings to other walkers – “Hello there… Hi… Hello” – making me giggle on occasion. Anyhow, the strangeness I mention is not in the programmes themselves, which were eerie and moving, but not weird. It’s in their timing. The Sound Walks were such determinedly open-aired, misty skied affairs, offered at a time when most of us were huggermugger in one warm room, stretching our legs only to shuffle to the kettle or fridge – though perhaps that was the point. I listened when I went out to walk the dog, tramping around a cramped, urban landscape immersed in the sounds of a vast, wilder one. Surprisingly, the shows proved a perfect accompaniment to a small life; contemplative and human, with a strong connection to the past and to the Earth itself. You need headphones and solitude for their full effect. Another exceptionally human listen was Richard Osman on Desert Island Discs. Much of what he said in his interview with Lauren Laverne has already been filleted for newspaper headlines, as Osman is now a national treasure, but it’s worth hearing him talk, especially about how his life has been enhanced by TV. He has nystagmus, an eye condition that means his vision is often blurred, and his description of how telly opened up the world, visually, for him was very affecting. His self-knowledge meant he was an excellent interviewee, despite his naturally private nature, and he talked interestingly about his food addiction, his mum, his brilliant and interesting career. You sensed a deep emotional swirl within him that remained carefully contained; a desire to give and receive love bubbling just beneath that calm, witty surface. A lovely person to spend 45 minutes with. Janice Long, who died on Christmas Day at the terribly young age of 66, was never anything other than a lovely person to spend time with. Her presenting career took her to Radio 1 and Top of the Pops (she’s one of the few hosts still bearable to watch on the reruns), as well as Radio 2 and 6 Music. And she was still going strong: she hosted on Saturdays on Greatest Hits Radio and had a weekday evening show on Radio Wales. Long’s producer at Radio Wales, Adam Walton, pulled together a moving celebration of her life in music, which aired on Monday, just two days after she died. He played music by some of the many bands Long had championed during her career, and spoke to several musicians, including Holly Johnson and Ian McCulloch. Walton hosted too, which must have been difficult, as he was very upset by his friend’s death. He almost lost it on several occasions, including during a link between Trampolene’s Beautiful Pain and the Smiths’ There Is a Light, as did I. But the programme he made for Long and her fans was a beautiful tribute to an exceptionally endearing person. “There was no side to her,” said Johnson. “She was ambitious, but it wasn’t at the expense of anyone.” Very true. In the 80s, Long was not treated particularly well at Radio 1, where she became persona non grata when she dared to have a child. Such discriminatory days are in the past, thank goodness, and it was great to hear plenty of diverse young talent on the station throughout the week. For the past couple of years, between Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, Radio 1 has given new presenters a chance to host a show in its week-long Christmas Takeover. Last week, we heard from 30 new DJs. Every one was remarkably upbeat and capable, even though they were given only short opportunities to speak: a little reading out of what listeners are up to, a spot of throwing to the news. But it was terrifically exciting for the presenters, and you could hear those with a spark enliven these small speaking roles. Plus, as they were all playing nailed-on bangers, every show was an easy, not too chatty listen. Just the thing to inject some bounce into your Twixtmas shuffle to the fridge.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: Four Peaks Sound Walk; Desert Island Discs; A Tribute to Janice Long; Christmas Takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/01/four-peaks-sound-walk-horatio-clare-review-richard-osman-desert-island-discs-radio-wales-tribute-to-janice-long-radio-1-christmas-takeover
1/2/2022,"From a distance, the beach at Winterton-on-sea in Norfolk looks like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, with hundreds of grey bodies lying motionless across the sand. On closer inspection, it becomes clear they are not fallen soldiers but a huge colony of seals taken to the land for pupping season. It’s an amazing annual sight that draws tourists and nature-lovers from across the country, but another process is taking place that is pushing people back – the growing threat of coastal erosion. Just along from where the armies of grey seals lay with their white pups, there used to stand the Dunes Cafe, a much-loved beach facility with a large and loyal clientele.  A year ago it was demolished to prevent its imminent collapse as a result of land lost to sea and storms. The ground where it stood is, like the cafe itself, no longer there. It’s a story of disappearance taking place all along the eastern coast of England, but particularly in East Anglia, that bulbous protrusion jutting into the North Sea. That climate change and rising sea levels take their toll on the landscape is an old story, but one with an urgent new twist. “The sea level’s been rising since the last ice age, 20,000 years ago or so,” says Jim Hall, professor of climate and environmental risk at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. “And it’s going faster. We’re probably not seeing its effect very much yet on the coast, though we will in the future.” A 2020 report by the Committee on Climate Change, on which Hall sits as an expert on coastal erosion and flooding, found 1.2m homes at significant risk of flooding and a further 100,000 subject to coastal erosion by 2080 – which, although it sounds safely distant, will be within the lifetime of most of those born so far this century. Two years ago, the US-based climate change research group Climate Central went further. It produced a map showing areas of the UK at risk of being underwater by 2050. They included sections of north Norfolk, all of the Lincolnshire coast and much of Cambridgeshire, along with parts of East Yorkshire, Merseyside and the Bristol area. According to the group, this would happen even if “moderate” attempts were made to combat climate change. Such predictions are based on highly complex, and disputed, modelling, yet there are significant warning signs that such an outcome is growing rapidly more plausible. Last month, scientists monitoring the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, an ice shelf the size of Great Britain, warned it is in danger of collapse. “It’s being melted from below by warm ocean waters, causing it to lose its grip on the underwater mountain,” said Peter Davis from British Antarctic Survey and the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. He said research suggested that the ice shelf will begin to break apart within two decades. Should there be a complete collapse, it would lead to a highly consequential rise in sea levels of 60cm. That may be a worst-case scenario, but it will almost certainly have a notable impact on the British coastline. In a sense Norfolk is a real-time lesson in how weather and sea can drastically alter a landscape. After the Dunes Cafe was dismantled, a chef called Alex Clare set up a mobile silver Airstream cafe to cater to locals and visitors at the car park next to where the cafe once stood. He’s had to move the Airstream four times in eight months, as sections of the dunes on which the car park sits have collapsed into the sea under pressure from storms and high tides. “In the last two weeks,” Clare told me, “a strip about as long as this caravan has disappeared. You hear about erosion, but you don’t know what it means, what it involves, until you witness it. And it’s a shock to see the physical transformation.” The car park owner has tried to slow the erosion by laying down large concrete blocks on the beach, but it’s the definition of a losing battle. Winterton’s coast possesses a bleak beauty, enhanced by the fact that the village sits back from the sea, behind a broad wall of dunes. By contrast, at Hemsby, a mile or so south, the town, with its amusement arcades and fairgrounds, stretches all the way to the shoreline. Four years ago, there was a line of seven chalets close to the edge of the sandy cliffs that drop down to the beach. They all had to be knocked down as the land beneath them began to fall into the sea. The local council is looking at sea defences, but the only workable answer involves large-scale investment and a major process of sandscaping. That is what took place at Bacton, 15 miles north along the coast from Winterton. A four-mile-long dune was built to protect Bacton Terminal, which supplies around a third of the UK’s gas and had been moving steadily closer to the cliff edge, literally and metaphorically. Designed by the Dutch engineering company Royal HaskoningDHV, it involved the placement of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand along the beaches near the terminal. The design relies on the sand being shifted into place by wind, waves and tides. The Dutch are world leaders in land reclamation and protection, having over the years reclaimed more than a sixth of Holland’s landmass from the sea. “In the long run,” says Professor Hall, “any coast protection is temporary. We’ve been doing engineering to protect the coast for a very long time. Almost half of the UK coast has some kind of protection – sea walls, revetments, promenades, that kind of thing. The Victorians were inveterate promenade builders.” Such protections don’t stop the sea rising. They merely fix, for a while, the point of the shore profile. At Happisburgh, near Bacton, wooden revetments did that job, until they collapsed 20 years ago, leading to a sudden and damaging exposure to the sea. “Once you lose [the protection], there’s a lot of pent-up erosion capacity,” says Hall. Although there is growing media coverage of coastal erosion, it’s as Alex Clare said: knowledge of the thing isn’t the same as experiencing it. “There’s a bit more recognition that the sea level is rising fast,” says Hall. “But I don’t think coastal communities have really understood what the future holds.” He believes there should be an “honest conversation” between government, local government and the affected communities. While the money required to protect cities like London and Hull will have to be found, that’s not likely with isolated villages. When I visited Norfolk last month, the locals seemed fatalistic or in denial, pointing out that the situation was worse somewhere else, either up or down the coast. As I drove back, it began to rain, and that night the weather deteriorated. The next day there was a large landslide at Mundesley, near Bacton, with a huge chunk of the cliff face collapsing on to the beach. Above it, houses stood on the precipice, their future looking about as secure as Norwich’s position in the Premier League. As Pete Revell, station manager at Bacton HM Coastguard, said, Mundesley was viewed as stable by comparison with nearby Happisburgh, and the landslide came as “a bit of a surprise”. It certainly shocked local resident Antony Lloyd, who said he was “very nervous and agitated about any further incidents.” He was finding it hard to sleep and thought he would have to move. Of course, the occasional landfall or loss of beachside chalets is hardly cause for national panic. But like canaries in a coal mine, the inhabitants of the villages strung along Norfolk’s shifting coastline are a warning of a worrying future. There are processes under way whose outcomes are unavoidable, and those that can potentially be arrested. But it will require unblinking foresight and long-term action, neither of which are our national strong suits. If you take the path north from Winterton’s beach car park you come to the roped-off seal sanctuary. Beyond, seals and their pups lie still and vulnerable in the dunes, hundreds of yards from the shore, as if waiting for the sea to rescue them. And come it will, not now or next year, but much sooner than we care to think.",News/Environment,Sands of time are slipping away for England’s crumbling coasts amid climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/sands-slip-england-crumbling-coasts-erosion-rising-sea-levels
1/2/2022,"There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth a few weeks ago when the Daily Telegraph announced that the renovation of the fire-ravaged Notre Dame cathedral would turn it into a “politically correct Disneyland”. As so often when that august publication buckles on its cuirass and bascinet in the War on Woke, it helps to look closely at its sources and evidence. In this case, it relied on the opinions of a conservative architect called Maurice Culot and sight of rather general proposals to install “modern art murals” in some of the side chapels and to project quotes from the Bible in languages that include Mandarin.  A more measured and informed article in the Washington Post, by the art historian Elizabeth Lev, later pointed out that these chapels were formerly “an ill-kept hodgepodge generally passed over by tourists” and there should be nothing very terrible about a cathedral communicating the scriptures in the world’s leading languages. France’s National Heritage and Architecture Commission has since backed the proposals, with a couple of reservations. The work might yet be clumsy and inane or beautiful and thoughtful – it’s just that convincing evidence of its monstrosity hasn’t been produced by its detractors. The devil, so to speak, will be in the detail. Cedric Price was an architect and thinker whose insights, more than 18 years after his death, continue to resonate. One of these was to challenge the assumption of architects and their clients that erecting a building is the best solution to a given problem. A big shiny structure called The Centre for Ending Poverty (to use a hypothetical example) might not actually do what it claims. Price’s wisdom is pertinent to the saga of the Nightingale hospitals, the facilities created with much fanfare and expense early in the pandemic, which treated fewer than 400 patients. Now Sajid Javid is doubling down on this less than triumphant idea by ordering eight “Nightingale surge hubs” – units in hospital car parks to deal with a possible wave of Omicron admissions. One obvious but unanswered question is where the staff might come from to run these hubs. Even more obviously, would it not have been better to implement policies that reduce this potential surge, so that the Nightingales would not be needed at all? I imagine the BBC’s moral compass to be a handsome and substantial instrument, brass-trimmed and Latin-inscribed, kept in a Reithian marble vault deep in Broadcasting House. It seems, though, that someone has tunnelled into its vicinity and placed a powerful electromagnet there, one programmed to switch on and off to an unpredictable synth funk beat. How else to explain its decision to interview Alan Dershowitz as an apparently objective commentator on the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, in particular on the credibility of the couple’s victim Virginia Giuffre? Dershowitz, as the BBC failed to mention, was one of Epstein’s lawyers and associates and is himself embroiled in lawsuits with Giuffre over her accusations that he was another of her abusers. In 2020, he wrote an article in the Spectator, “The Ghislaine Maxwell I know”, which attacked the “one-sided narrative” of “lying witnesses” such as Giuffre. The case against Maxwell, he sagely concluded, “is far from over”. The BBC acknowledged its error, but why make it in the first place? In case my electromagnet theory is not strictly accurate, here’s another: the corporation is now so thoroughly browbeaten and disoriented by accusations of liberal bias that it truly doesn’t know north from south and east from west.

1/2/2022,"Arsenal were left nursing a sense of injustice after VAR decisions contributed to their dramatic 2-1 defeat against Manchester City, with their assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg, suggesting they had been denied a “clear penalty” when Martin Ødegaard was challenged by Ederson in the first half. Stuivenberg was overseeing Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, who looked on from home after testing positive for Covid-19. He and his players felt the referee, Stuart Attwell, should have been asked to review Ederson’s tackle on the monitor, just as he did when awarding City the second-half spot kick from which Riyad Mahrez equalised.  “I think it is a clear penalty, but at least a moment for the referee to check, like what happened with their penalty,” Stuivenberg said. “It is inconsistent.” Aaron Ramsdale, the Arsenal goalkeeper, was similarly confused after seeing City’s penalty appeal at close quarters. Attwell originally awarded nothing when Bernardo Silva went down under Granit Xhaka’s challenge but when invited to review the decision by the VAR official, Jarred Gillett, he changed his mind. “I don’t know why the referee is told to see one and not the other,” Ramsdale said. “It is there for a reason, go and use it. It is the inconsistency. The whole point is to help the game out. In real time it didn’t look like one, [but] slow it down on a screen and it is given.” Despite their frustration at not being awarded a penalty, Arsenal surged ahead later in the first half through Bukayo Saka and were by far the better side before Mahrez levelled. The equaliser was followed quickly by a second yellow card for Gabriel Magalhães, whose first was for what Stuivenberg termed a “normal comment … no dirty language was used”, and Arsenal paid the price through Rodri’s late winner. “I’m sad that we don’t end up with three points, that’s the most frustrating part,” Stuivenberg said. Ramsdale agreed: “I don’t think for large parts of the game teams have done that to Manchester City.” An 11th straight win for City gives them an 11-point advantage at the top, although Chelsea and Liverpool have opportunities to reduce it with games in hand. There have been two bigger gaps on New Year’s Day in the Premier League era. Pep Guardiola accepted City had been fortunate. “Arsenal were better,” he said, before pointing out that City had two days to recover from their win at Brentford. “It was so tough for us to come back. We had no energy. We were incredibly tired and they were better, but football has happened and sometimes it comes in our side.”",Sport/Football,Arsenal bemoan VAR inconsistency after ‘clear penalty’ denied in City defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/arsenal-bemoan-var-inconsistency-after-clear-penalty-denied-in-city-defeat
1/2/2022,"Twitching is synonymous with birdwatching, which can often involve long journeys in search of rare species. But now a new breed of climate-conscious birder is trying to persuade fellow enthusiasts to keep it local instead. A group of young birders has created a challenge for spotters to find birds in their own patch close to home rather than routinely travelling long distances to spot particular birds, a practice known as “twitching”.  The Green Patch Challenge, created by Joe Parham, a 22-year-old birder from the Midlands, invites under-25s to attempt to travel only on foot or by bike to see birds. “We all need to make changes to our lives to address the climate crisis, and the goal of the challenge is to capture this while encouraging young birders to explore and enjoy nature close to them,” Parham said. “It’s not about stopping everything. It’s about making positive changes, doing much less travelling and when you do it, try to do it low-carbon.” Birdwatching has been growing in popularity in the UK and there was a lockdown boom last year when numbers taking part in the RSPB’s annual garden survey, where people report which birds they can see in their gardens, jumped by 85%. About three million people do some birdwatching every year. The Green Patch Challenge has been followed up by Birdwatch magazine, which set its readers a #LocalBigYear challenge for 2022, inviting birders to find species in patches within 10km of their home. The challenges harness the passion that most birders – whether twitchers or patchers – have for drawing up lists of birds they’ve seen. Many have overlapping lists of birds seen in their back garden, in their county, in the UK or the rest of the world. The lists can be quite competitive – on New Year’s Day, many birders began their year list by trying to see as many birds as possible on their patch. At peak migration times, some twitchers travel almost every week to see rare birds, a practice that is increasingly under fire from some parts of the birding community. In November, about 100 birders travelled to Papa Westray, one of the smallest of the Orkney islands, to see a varied thrush – a bird usually seen only in north America and last spotted in the UK in 1982. Some chartered planes and boats to reach the island for the sighting. Javier Caletrío, a researcher based in north-west England, set up the Low Carbon Birding blog in 2018 to try to persuade birdwatchers to travel less. He said it was important for birders to set an example. “If people see us acting as if there is a crisis requiring immediate action, it is more likely that others will also demand urgent, radical action from politicians.” Birding was often dominated by stories about “the excitement of travelling to distant places and seeing rare and exotic birds” he said. “These young people are telling other young people that they can be good birders and have fun without travelling to distant places by means of burning fossil fuels. And obviously low-carbon birding is not about the end of travel. It is about doing it differently – planning your holidays differently and making the most of public transport.” Matthew Broadbent, 20, who helps run the Green Patch Challenge, said: “I know the feeling when you see a stunning, rare bird, and it’s fantastic. It’s a buzz, and makes you want more. But we need to learn to travel shorter distances to see birds, we need to do what we can to protect our planet.” Keir Chauhan, 19, began birding seriously in 2020 and said that joining the Green Patch Challenge in north London had changed his life during the lockdowns. “It provided an outlet,” he said. “If I’d had a bad day, I’d go looking for a new bird around Ally Pally.” A pair of peregrine falcons haunts the BBC signal tower on Alexandra Palace. “It’s amazing to watch them hunt in the mornings, chasing the crows,” he said. “There’s a reservoir near there and most of the time there’s no birds whatsoever. But one time I saw a kestrel land and it turned out they were nesting there. Even in a place as birdless as that – it’s not a foreign country, it’s not a nature reserve – you can see interesting birds.” Stephen Moss, a lifelong birder and author, whose book, Skylarks with Rosie, charts the lockdown birdwatching he did in the patch near his Somerset home, said that making local observations had an important ecological purpose as it enabled research into the prevalence of bird species. “Low-carbon birding is clearly a good idea,” Moss said, “but some people are arguing that we should not be doing any long-distance trips – Chris Packham said he’s never going to do it again. “But there are places like Costa Rica, the Gambia, Trinidad and Tobago, or Kenya where vast amounts of its economy comes from wildlife tourism. We need to find the right balance between the local and global.”",News/Environment,"You don’t need to travel long distances to spot birds, Britain’s twitchers urged",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/travel-distances-britain-twitchers-birds-birdwatchers-species-foot-cycle
