3/6/2022,"It’s always fascinating to me as a botanist that, out of the estimated 400,000 plant species on Earth, humans have become so fixated on a certain number. We have spent generations ingeniously nurturing them in new ways, and dedicated millions of acres of land and incalculable resources to growing them, all for the simple joy of admiring their appearance. Particularly wonderful is that this obsession with specific plants is often culturally bound. While the Japanese have centuries-old nurseries growing moss cultivars, in Britain the only thing you can buy in a garden centre with the word “moss” on it is moss killer. Yet, one of the great things about globalisation, largely driven by the internet, is that it’s opening up horticultural marvels we have long overlooked. A recent rediscovery of mine is the desert rose, Adenium obesum. Adeniums are beautiful succulents from the deserts of the Arabian peninsula. They have glossy leaves and wonderfully swollen “mini baobab” trunks – all crowned several times a year with dazzling trumpet-shaped flowers in a huge range of shades. For centuries, the people of Southeast Asia have associated them with wealth and longevity. Their rounded trunks – like full-bellied Buddhas – and tendency to form natural bonsai create the look of ancient trees, even on young specimens. When I was a kid in 1980s Singapore these were as ubiquitous to me as pampas grass in the UK. Objectively very pretty, super easy to grow, and yet just so commonplace they just seemed to blend into the background. When they started popping up recently on amazing Thai and Indonesian Instagram accounts, however, I was astonished by the miracles that have been achieved with them in the past 30 years. Far from waning, interest in them seems to have reached fever pitch. This has created a huge range of dazzling new flower forms (which to me are a tad on the flashy side), but also amazing pruning and training techniques to maximise their bizarre bonsai forms, like real-life Pokémon. The simplest technique, which I have successfully experimented with, is to remove the plant from its pot and gently wash off the compost from its spiralling, swollen roots. These can be replanted in bonsai potting mix, exposing the top half to give it a Mandrake-from-Harry-Potter look. This will quickly reroot from the buried section, with the unearthed section turning green within a week or two. Most Southeast Asians position these roots splayed out like the spokes of a wheel to create a neat, symmetrical look, but I love their entangled, primeval appearance, so twist them further. With the growing interest in succulents and caudex-forming houseplants, some of which have been illegally poached from the wild, adeniums are a perfect sustainable alternative that are easier to grow, cheaper to buy – and have wonderful flowers. Why these aren’t more popular yet here, I have no idea.

3/6/2022,"Fantasy author Brandon Sanderson might not be a household name like George RR Martin or JRR Tolkien, despite having a legion of loyal fans. But that might be about to change. Sanderson, 46, although traditionally published and regularly selling upwards of 2m copies of his sweeping, epic novels, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Tuesday to self-publish four novels he had written during lockdown. When he woke up on Wednesday, it was to, in effect, one of the biggest book deals in history. And less than three days after launching the project on Kickstarter he broke the platform’s record for the highest earnings in its 13-year existence. Nebraska-born Sanderson has, at the time of writing, earned $23m (£17.5m) from fans who are paying upfront for copies of the four novels to be released next year, in effect funding their production, printing and distribution – and Sanderson’s pay packet for writing them. With the Kickstarter running until 1 April, that potentially puts him in the earnings bracket of thriller writer James Patterson, who scored $150m (£113m) in 2009 for a 17-book deal; Barack and Michelle Obama, who got a joint advance of $65m for their memoirs in 2017, and pop singer Britney Spears, who landed a $15m deal for a book on the conservatorship scandal that has dogged her life. Sanderson rose to prominence in 2007 when he was chosen by the widow of the late author Robert Jordan to complete the Wheel of Time fantasy series, adapted for TV last year by Amazon Prime. Since then, he has published 11 novels through mainstream publishers Macmillan and Random House in the US and Gollancz in the UK, including his bestselling Mistborn and Stormlight Archive series. Speaking from his home in American Fork, Utah, Sanderson said the last few days had been “insane”. He said: “I went to bed on Tuesday night after we’d launched the Kickstarter and when I woke up on Wednesday we’d … passed $8m.” The previous record for a crowdfunded project on Kickstarter was seven years ago when the Pebble smartwatch realised $20.3m after its 30-day campaign. Oriana Leckert, director of Publishing & Comics Outreach, said: “It’s been so inspiring to watch Brandon Sanderson’s massive community rally around this ambitious project with such fervour. He and his team have spent decades building his audience and thrilling them with his myriad intricate fantasy works, positioning him perfectly to smash Kickstarter’s records and soar to this unprecedented level of success. I can’t wait to see what the coming days will bring.” Sanderson admits to having some expectations of a big hit from the project, describing himself as a creative “who is also very entrepreneurial minded”. He has previously Kickstarted a limited edition of one of his previous novels, which brought in $6m. But he says he is stunned by the numbers updating every few seconds on the Kickstarter page as more fans join the 87,000 who have already pledged money for his new books. The new novels, which will be released every three months from January 2023, cost £30 for the ebooks, £45 for the audiobooks and £120 for premium limited-edition hardcovers, which Sanderson said will not be republished even if the four novels get picked up by a mainstream publisher. He said he initially started to write the first of his new books during the first lockdown as a gift for his wife. Then he realised that his new ideas dovetailed with a long-held ambition to crowdfund a series of novels completely on his own terms. But he is not turning his back on traditional publishing. “I love my publishers,” he said. “I have no intention of leaving them. But I like to try new things and perhaps one of the main reasons I did this is because of the dominance Amazon has on the book market . I know people have issues with Amazon, but it’s a fact that they offer a great user experience. And they are the biggest game in town. “I have a team of 30 people and We sat down to work out if we could really publish a front-list title ourselves, just in case a disaster happened with how my books are sold at the moment.” He also said he was looking at ways to involve traditional, independent bookstores. He said: “My career was partially made by bookstores hand-selling my books, and I don’t want to cut them out of this process in any way.”",Arts/Books,Fantasy fans crowdfund record £17m for author Brandon Sanderson’s new novels,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/06/brandon-sanderson-fantasy-fans-crowdfund-record-17m-authors-new-novels
3/6/2022,"In a few weeks an international group of scientists will launch an unusual marine research project. They will dust the surface of the Indian Ocean with artificial whale faeces. The aim of this excremental experiment is straightforward. It is to determine if it is possible to reboot marine ecosystems that have been starved of nutrients and in the process restore dwindling fish populations. It is also hoped the project will help in the battle against the climate crisis. “Whales eat tiny crustaceans called krill, typically about 300 metres below sea level,” said Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government and one of the project’s leaders. “At that depth, the pressure of their backsides is so high they cannot poo. So they come to surface – to get air but also to relieve themselves. They then create a floating bed of excrement and, as sunlight falls on it, phytoplankton grows there and this provides food for fish,” added King who now heads the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University. The problem is the planet’s population of whales is now only 5% of its estimated level 400 years ago, whaling having taken a terrible toll on the world’s largest marine mammals. As a result, the ocean has been starved of excreted nutrients that have provided sustenance for fish. “We need to find a way of restoring stocks,” said King. The marine biomass regeneration project – as it is delicately named – aims to put this right. Backed by a group of large marine laboratories, including the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and the Institute of Maritime Studies in Goa, scientists are about to launch a key experiment to determine the project’s feasibility.“In Goa, there is a massive rice production factory whose main waste product is rice husks,” said King. “This will form the basis of our artificial whale poo experiment, which will take place in the Arabian Sea. Baked and then mixed with nutrients, the husks will float on the ocean surface and we can then study [them] to see if phytoplankton will grow there and replace what whales used to provide.” King stressed that the initial experiment, which is set to be carried out next month, will be limited in size and will last only a few weeks, although he also stressed the potential benefits. “Apart from the fact that phytoplankton will provide food for fish, it will also absorb carbon dioxide, so there is a second potential gain that the project might provide for the planet.”",News/Environment,The squit and the whale: can artificial faeces revive the ocean ecosystem?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/06/the-squit-and-the-whale-can-artificial-faeces-revive-the-ocean-ecosystem
3/6/2022,"Apair of wonderfully winning performances from Claire Rushbrook and Adeel Akhtar lie at the heart of this unexpectedly warm and typically compelling drama from British writer-director Clio Barnard. Described by its creator as a love story about two people who are “a catalyst for change in each other’s lives”, it’s a heartfelt piece that marries the poetic grit of Barnard’s 2013 film The Selfish Giant with something resembling a later-life Romeo and Juliet romance – a fable grounded in reality. Playing out over the course of a lunar month, and drawing inspiration from real-life characters whom Barnard met while filming her previous features, Ali & Ava is a vibrant work that uses the transcendent power of song to turn a streetwise tale into a diegetic musical, with genuinely surprising results. Bafta-nominated for his performance, Akhtar is Ali, a Bradford-based British Asian who is nominally a landlord, but who seems more like a benignly eccentric uncle. A big kid at heart, Ali has a youthful soul that seems to give him an affinity with the various children he encounters. In a lovely early scene, we see him persuading Sofia (Ariana Bodorova), the young daughter of one of his tenants, to go to school by offering to carry her on his shoulders – a goofy solution that works wonders. Later, Ali wins over a group of stone-throwing schoolchildren by turning up the stereo in his car, encouraging them to sing and dance along to the sounds of local Holme Wood hero MC Innes. It’s a bravura sequence, beautifully balanced on the knife-edge between choreography and chaos, conjuring a spontaneous sense of joy. Ali has long harboured his own DJ dreams, storing vinyl and turntables in the downstairs den to which he has retreated since his marriage to Runa (Ellora Torchia) collapsed. Now they are “separated – we live in the same house, but separately” – a heartbreaking situation which Ali has yet to confess to his family. As for Ava (Rushbrook), she’s a classroom assistant of proud Irish descent whose children and grandchildren are all around her. While Ali (who meets Ava while picking up Sofia from school) listens to dance beats, Ava loves country and folk, a discovery that prompts a hilariously deadpan car-bound exchange between the pair. Back at Ava’s house, Ali instigates a headphone disco that switches between the sounds of Sylvan Esso’s Radio and Karen Dalton’s Something on Your Mind, recalling a key scene from François Ozon’s Summer of 85 which itself harked back to an intimate musical moment from Claude Pinoteau’s La Boum. Miraculously, this contrapuntal sequence then segues into the unifying sound of the Specials’ (Dawning of a) New Era, with Ali and Ava’s sofa-dancing rudely interrupted by the arrival of Ava’s overprotective son Callum (The Selfish Giant’s Shaun Thomas) brandishing a sword. All these tonal shifts are executed with a naturalistic elan that disguises the complexities of the film, allowing its potentially jarring gear-changes to feel wholly organic. Appropriately, Ali & Ava also marks an organic evolution in Barnard’s film-making, striking a celebratory tone that feels like a revelation. While The Arbor and The Selfish Giant both raised important issues about inequality and marginalisation, Ali & Ava manages to retain that sense of sturdy realism while also serving as an ode to the beauty of Bradford, and the indomitability of its inhabitants. Yes, there is dark material here, nowhere more so than in Ava’s soft-spoken recollections of years of domestic violence, or in Callum’s anguished inheritance of anger issues, epitomised by the boots that have been passed from father to son. But if the film has a message, it’s about climbing down from confrontation, a theme subtly dramatised in a subplot involving a piece of playground apparatus, and the dawning bravery of a child learning to fit in with her peers. Along with Akhtar’s best actor nomination, Ali & Ava is also up for outstanding British film at the Baftas next Sunday, in which category it will compete with the likes of Aleem Khan’s After Love, Rebecca Hall’s Passing and Philip Barantini’s Boiling Point. On that evidence, the much-maligned British film industry is in robustly diverse form.",Arts/Film,Ali & Ava review – Clio Barnard’s pitch-perfect Bradford love story,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/06/ali-ava-review-clio-barnard-bradford-love-story-adeel-akhtar-claire-rushbrook
3/6/2022,"There’s a short video I keep watching of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen waiting in a ceremonial receiving line with European Council President Charles Michel and Emmanuel Macron to have photographs taken with dignitaries at the EU-Africa summit. The Ugandan foreign minister, General Jeje Odongo, enters, walks straight past her with a microscopic nod and greets Michel and Macron with vigorous handshakes. Macron gestures to Odongo, indicating Von der Leyen. Odongo does nothing; Macron insists, at which Odongo turns towards her with a small, stiff bow – still no handshake. Another slight against Von der Leyen went viral last year. In “Sofagate”, President Erdogan and Charles Michel (yes, again) take the two chairs ceremonially arranged for discussion and photo ops at a summit in Ankara; left seatless, Von der Leyen coughs and gestures in impotent, angry incredulity, before awkwardly perching on a nearby sofa. Von der Leyen is a steely Euro-overachiever: a doctor, mother of seven, trilingual; she was the first female German defence minister before taking on her current role. That’s not to say she hasn’t been heavily criticised (her management of vaccine procurement in particular was widely condemned). But she is a proper politician, not three crackpot opinions in a TM Lewin shirt like most of our government. Yet for the second (televised) time in her career it looks as if she was snubbed in an excruciating slow-motion choreography of misogyny. They are little things: etiquette breaches, missteps, even miscommunications. Von der Leyen “chose to prioritise substance over protocol or form, that is certainly what EU citizens would expect of her”, a bored-looking male spokesperson said of Sofagate, dismissively, bringing my blood to the lethal rolling boil of hot marmalade. You could see worse any day: violent, terrible acts of racism, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia. So why do I keep watching? The first reason is the obvious one: these men seem not to feel the need to hide their contempt for one of Europe’s most senior political figures, in the most public environments. How do they treat less powerful women, in private? It’s also because it’s interesting when prejudice touches people for whom it rarely comes. I see Von der Leyen’s incredulity and I recognise it: the expression of someone whose life experiences did not lead them to expect this treatment. I have felt it, too; made that face of confusion that someone might disregard my opinion, pay me less, intimidate or overrule me. White, straight, relatively well-off, I grew up in a progressive bubble: my stepfather was our primary carer and my mother the “breadwinner”; my partner once ironed my dress just to make a cousin’s macho boyfriend uncomfortable. I was luckier even than Von der Leyen: according to her biographer, her own father said she didn’t need a good degree because she would get married. Not expecting, or needing to anticipate, prejudice is privilege. How restful life normally is for those of us who have that, how frictionless! Being insulated from the permanent, exhausting onslaught of micro- and macroaggressions others face means we have energy to spare. The question, then, is how we use that extra energy. I’m asking myself, really. Von der Leyen addressed the issue explicitly after Sofagate: “I am the president of an institution which is highly respected all around the world and, even more important, as a leader, I can speak up and make myself heard,” she said. “But what about the millions of women who cannot?” She has also explicitly protested Poland’s horrific anti-LGBTQ+ stance. Experiencing prejudice when you aren’t used to it can be galvanising, an electric shock of radicalising realisation. But really, none of us should need personal experience to act. That’s the other reason I’m compelled to watch: because that video is a sort of primer on allyship. Watching Charles Michel, my blood goes past marmalade, until it’s the consistency of the blackcurrant jam I forgot on the stove all afternoon last summer – a black, sticky stain clogging my arteries with fury. Michel was maddeningly passive the first time, a feeble shrug in human form. He “decided not to react further so as not to create a political incident”, he explained, blandly reaffirming his “total full and absolute commitment to support women and gender equality”. But then it happened again, and again, oblivious (according to his spokesman, he simply didn’t see Odongo’s slight), he did nothing. In contrast, we have Macron, steely but cordial, using all that spare energy he has from being a powerful white man to object. We know that to do nothing is to be complicit. But do we (I) act on that, on the bus, in the street, when a colleague or cousin says something that leaves an acrid burnt jam taste? So I keep watching, to remind myself that even if you’re the president of the European Commission, prejudice happens. That unless those of us who feel insulated from it act, it goes unchallenged and gains strength. That it’s possible – essential, actually – to be a Macron, not a Michel.

3/6/2022,"Why is it so exciting – and so nerve-racking – to be meeting Delia Smith? Down the years, I’ve interviewed a lot of famous and important people (and three prime ministers), and yet I can’t remember any of them having induced this combination of extreme eagerness and mortal fear. Is it because when I was a teenager, she was one of the very few truly successful women then in public life? I suppose it must be. It’s no exaggeration to say that she was up there with the Queen, Mrs Thatcher and Madonna – and just like them, her word was The Law. For my 21st birthday, my parents gave me a cheque and a copy of Delia Smith’s Complete Cookery Course, and for all that I was still in my radical feminist stage, I hardly batted an eyelid. Simone de Beauvoir was all very well, but did she have any advice on roasting times or how to make sure your yorkshire puddings rise? No, she did not. Anyway, one result of this desperate, anxious state was that I stupidly decided to bake a cake for her – my God, even to write such words – and when I arrive at her cottage, the conservatory of which I recognise from the TV shows she once presented there, the very first thing I do is hand it over. “It’s a bit … flat,” I say, mournfully (for those who are interested, it’s Nigella’s ordinarily easy-peasy cardamon and marzipan loaf). But it seems that I’m worrying unnecessarily. Delia looks completely delighted by my foil-wrapped house brick, cradling it in her arms as if it was a newborn baby. “You used good ingredients,” she says, kindly. “It will still taste nice.” Cooking isn’t about perfection, she tells me; it’s about achievability. “I once went to a Women’s Institute thing, and I remember thinking: I’m not at all sure my jam would pass muster here.” It’s a beautiful, crystalline day in Suffolk – the house is deep in the countryside outside Stowmarket – and from the sofa, the view is of a pond, on which there floats a single, serene moorhen, and beyond it a line of trees. Delia and her husband, the journalist Michael Wynn-Jones, have lived here since the 1970s, but this expanse of garden is a relatively recent addition: 20 years ago, he bought the meadow as a present for her 60th birthday, and together (with some help, obviously) they sunk the pond. Was it a blessing during the lockdown? “Oh, yes. We’re very lucky. The pandemic has been terrible for so many people, but it wasn’t a hardship for us. We’re older, and we live in a beautiful place. I have an office at the bottom of the garden, and I was there every day from 9.30.” Lunch was an apple, and then, at 5.30, she would return to the house, to a supper made by Michael, who now does most of the cooking. Is he a good cook? “Yes, if he follows the recipe. When he retired, he got really interested in it. He wanted to do more and more, and I let him do more and more, though I do still love cooking and, of course, food. You’ve got to be greedy to love cooking, and I always have been. The first thing I do in the morning when I get up is think: what are we going to eat today? And I’m lucky to be married to someone who feels the same way. But cooking is the one time when I know I’m 80: all that standing, getting a backache.” How on earth can she possibly be 80? In the flesh, she looks exactly as she did the last time we saw her on screen, more than a decade ago, and perhaps even before that. Close your eyes, moreover, and this is still the voice, crisp and light and warm, that once drove us all so mad for cranberries (Delia Smith’s Winter Collection, 1995). But there’s something else, too: she is so interested in everything, enthusiasm and energy radiating from her like steam from a pan. As all the world knows, she and Michael have long been majority shareholders in their beloved Norwich City football club, and her involvement there is still all-consuming. There are its restaurants, which she oversees, and every week there are dozens of management decisions to be taken; above all, there are the matches, her appetite for which remains undimmed. “Yes, I’m afraid so. Three hours there and three hours back, sometimes. Often, there’ll be a game on a Tuesday and I might say: ‘I’m not going.’ But then Monday will come and I’ll think: ‘Actually, I am. I can’t not go.’” For her, football is about community; she believes almost anything is possible when people commit to working together, though admittedly this may not stretch to poor old Norwich’s ability to remain in the Premiership come the end of this season. Which brings us to her new book, the one she wrote while she was sequestered in her office at the bottom of the garden. It also has to do with community. As its title suggests, You Matter: The Human Solution is not a cookbook. Rather, it is (sorry) an extended recipe for living: a nourishing broth of ideas garnered from her wide reading (its presiding spirits are the Jesuit priest and palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, and the American psychologist Abraham Maslow), seasoned lightly with her own thoughts and experiences. How to sum it up? This is tricky. It has, I think, three central premises. First, that we have not yet fully perceived just how awesome the human race is, and as a consequence we underestimate our ability to come up with solutions to our increasingly grave problems. Second, that evolution encompasses, for human beings, a trajectory of unity, one we resist at our peril. Third, that we often neglect our inner, spiritual selves, and by doing so, tend to lose our all-important sense of perspective, something that has an egregious effect on our ability even to begin to tackle the mayhem that is all around. Has Delia gone barmy? This is surely what some people are going to say when they hear about this book, and perhaps you’re thinking it even as you read this. But she doesn’t care if they do. “I’ve had a good apprenticeship when it comes to criticism,” she says. “Because I was very criticised when I was a cook. When people tell me I’m going to get a lot of flak, I think, well, no one wants to take a risk; no one wants to put their head above the parapet. This book could just sink without trace. But if it does, I won’t mind. I had to do it. I want people to know this stuff.” One of the practices she extols in You Matter is silent meditation – though she doesn’t use the m-word, on the grounds it might put people off – and the hour she spends each day sitting completely still as her mind roams where it will has brought her a kind of freedom. “Silence and stillness have taken my fear away,” she says, her voice as calm and as soothing as a bowl of custard. When did she start thinking about these ideas? “Well, they were always bubbling around, and I did write some religious books at one stage [a Catholic convert, she used to go to mass every day; the books in question were published in the 1980s]. But I found they just went to religious people, and I wanted to write for those who don’t have any religion. The main thrust of it is that there is a whole part of our lives that is left unexplored, and this is the crucial time in our history to get into that. Things are very bad. How could we not want to look at the world and say: we’ve got to change?” A pause. “Have you seen Don’t Look Up?” she asks. I shake my head. (In case you don’t know, it’s a Netflix film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, about a comet that’s heading towards Earth, a calamity that is an allegory for the climate emergency]. “Well, it’s brilliant, and it’s also saying what I’m saying, which is that we don’t realise the power we have when we work together.” Before I read You Matter, I hadn’t heard of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a man she describes as “a colossus” (he died in 1955). But she’s not surprised. De Chardin was a Darwinist who fell out with the church over the doctrine of original sin: “All his books were banned by the church for a time,” she says. She got into him in the 1960s. “They’re quite difficult to read. But the more mature I got, the more I realised that humanity is a phenomenon, which is what he says.” The title of her book, however, was not inspired by him, but by a piece torn from a magazine many years ago: the work of a young woman, Dorothea Lynch, who was dying of cancer (Lynch would go on to write a book, Exploding Into Life). It doesn’t always, Delia believes, take a philosopher to spell out the essence of complicated ideas. Lynch was suffering terribly, but in her pain she was able to grasp the beauty of life as never before. “Each of us is very special, very singular, carrying weight,” she wrote. “I matter. I would like to open the window tonight and yell that outside. I matter.” Delia wishes we could all start thinking this way long before we lie dying – and this is where (she hopes) her book comes in. “The world is in chaos. We have got the war in Ukraine, concentration camps again, people freezing and starving. In our own country, some people can have heat, or they can have food… and yet, together, we have such power. People say to me: how can you get the whole world on board? Well, how did Christians get so many people on board? They were just a little band. Or Muslims? Another little band. So I can’t be put off by that. I’m very ambitious.” Her grand dream is to help her readers to achieve self-actualisation, which according to another of her gurus, Maslow, is the highest level of psychological development: the stage in life when potential may be fully realised, the rest of our needs (those that connect to our bodies and to our egos) having already been fulfilled. One of the ways such a state may be encouraged is via what she calls “reflective daydreaming”: that daily hour of silence she mentioned earlier. When, many years ago, she started doing this, inspired by an Indian sufi, she began slowly, clocking in 10 minutes or so at first. “It’s not easy,” she says. “It’s the hardest thing on earth to get someone to be still and quiet. But I just feel that there will be some people who will want to try it, and if we get enough people like that, the world will change.” The Beatles song Within You Without You pretty much sums up her book, she says. Pay attention to what’s inside, as well as what’s outside, and life will be better. “Let’s get away from the idea of me as a saint. I make as many mistakes as anyone. I’m always saying the wrong thing. These ideas are not virtue on my part. I just want to connect.” What has the response to the book been like so far? Michael scrutinised each section as she completed it. “He would say: ‘OK’. Or: ‘I don’t think you’ve got that quite right.’” But You Matter was turned down by no fewer than six publishers, in spite of the fact that Delia has sold more than 21m copies of her cookbooks. “It was tough. At one point we were looking at self-publishing.” Finally, it went to a small press: Mensch. “And thank God those six did turn it down. I couldn’t have done better.” I’ve no idea how her latest editor feels about self-actualisation. But he or she will surely have relished the glimpses its author gives of herself on the path to enlightenment. How surprising (and cheering) to find that she loves Pharrell Williams; that she marched against Brexit; that she idolises Greta Thunberg; that it is her great pleasure to take the Norwich apprentices to the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia to look at paintings by Bacon and Picasso. (“In the cafeteria, these guys of 16 were collecting up the cups; they’ve been trained to think of others because you can’t become a team if you’re only interested in yourself,” she says, when I bring this up.) In its exuberance and sincerity, You Matter is emphatically the work of an autodidact, and perhaps this is one way in which it connects, as unlikely as this sounds, to the rest of her career. She left her school in Bexleyheath at 16, and went to work first as a hairdresser. But having grown interested in cooking, at 21 she started again, this time as a dishwasher in a small restaurant in Paddington, a role that gave her the opportunity to learn on the job (eventually, she graduated to waitressing, and thence to the kitchen). Meanwhile, she spent her free time devouring cookbooks in the reading room at the British Museum, trying out the recipes she found on the family from whom she rented a room. In 1969, she was taken on by the Daily Mirror’s magazine, which is where she met Michael; the first thing she wrote was a recipe for kipper paté. From there, she moved to the Evening Standard and into television (her first appearances were on the BBC’s Look East). Again, she learned as she went along. “That was the best job,” she says, of the Standard. “I used to get a lot of letters, and I learned how to write recipes from those. Someone once asked: ‘You say the tomatoes must be peeled, but how?’ From that moment, I never wrote a recipe without explaining every part of the process.” But she doesn’t miss writing cookbooks or making cookery programmes now. “Some people want more recipes,” she says. “But there are enough. If you’ve gone through your 50th asparagus season, there’s not a lot left to say. I left television when the era of chefs came in; what Elizabeth David called ‘theatre on a plate’, which I can’t stand. I was only about saying: ‘it’s not that difficult’.” Sometimes, she worries about her legacy: are people any better cooks now than they were when she started? “That awful MasterChef thing. You know: ‘Oh, this is a bit greasy,’ or whatever. It’s intimidating. It makes people self-conscious. They feel they’ll never be able to do it.” It’s for this reason that she has put together a cookery course on her website. “It’s the basics. A kid could learn how to make an omelette sitting on the bus.” But at other moments she is reassured. “When I once said that I’d failed [to teach the nation to cook], I got a lot of letters telling me I was wrong, and at football matches people will say: ‘Oh, my mum loves you.’” What about restaurants? Overall, haven’t we gained more than we’ve lost? She’s not sure. “I miss French food. That’s gone.” Do people make a fuss when she eats out? She laughs. “If you think about it, I’m no threat to a chef, though if they do know who I am I feel bad if I leave anything.” This week, she’s going to the Neptune, in Hunstanton, which has a Michelin star. “Usually, that would put me off, but he’s a lovely chef. It’s only slightly poncey.” What’s her favourite dish to make at home? She can’t possibly say, though the Piedmontese peppers from her Summer Collection (1993, as if I could ever forget) “do have to be eaten to be believed”. A friend of Delia’s who worked with her on the Standard told me that no one could be less changed by fame than her, and it is striking how straightforward she seems, how un-grand. What’s her secret? (I mean, apart from the meditation, and all the other things we’ve discussed). Does it – this is my hunch – have anything to do with her redoubtable mother, Etty, who died in 2020 aged 100? “Yes, that’s probably it. She was calm, too, and she had the same love of people. But she was also my biggest critic. ‘Coo, you’ve put on weight,’ she’d say, that sort of thing. I had quite a difficult time, and my parents’ divorce [when she was a teenager] was a trauma, though no one is without those, are they?” She thinks we have a duty to be happy if we can – or at least, not to be too discontented. But perhaps our terms are wrong. Her late friend Sister Wendy Beckett told her that, in life, “happy” is best substituted with the word “peace”. “That was wise. Happiness can seem like quite a shallow thing, like having a Mars bar or something.” I’ve missed the train I was supposed to get, and so we talk on. She doesn’t know what she’ll do next: the press “ruined” her last book, How to Cheat at Cooking, in which she extolled the virtues of ready-prepared ingredients like powdered potato, by being “vile” about it. What about Norwich City? No, she and Michael are not selling, though if someone reasonable with money to spend came along, they would ask the supporters to vote on it. She could discuss football for ever, and it’s sweet to see how thrilled she is, still, to meet its biggest names (once my tape recorder is off, she tells me some good stories). And then, at last, it really is time for me to go. Behind the closed door of their kitchen – how I long to look in its cupboards – Michael is clattering slightly. Back in London, I tell everyone I speak to that I’ve met Delia (no need for second names), and even my mother sounds quite impressed. But I’m still worrying about my cake. In the small hours, I picture her ruthlessly dispatching it, her foot deftly opening a pedal bin as Michael whips up some cheese on toast. Several days later, though, a parcel arrives. Inside it is a signed copy of Delia’s Cakes, and inside that is a card. As I read it, my heart expands inside me like one of her immaculate gooseberry and elderflower muffins. The cake I baked for her was delicious, she writes – and can she please have the recipe?  You Matter: The Human Solution by Delia Smith is published by Mensch, £25 hardback/£14.99 paperback.

3/6/2022,"‘Happy Thursday everyone!” the official Uefa Europa League account tweeted on the morning of 24 February, looking ahead to another crucial round of matches in Europe’s second most prestigious men’s football competition. Alas, not everyone was in quite as festive a mood. For, just a few hours earlier, Russian artillery had moved into Ukraine bringing up the curtain on a bloody and avoidable war in mainland Europe. It’s easy to forget it now, amid the breathtaking speed with which the world of sport has closed ranks against Russia, but in the hours and days after the fighting started Uefa on Twitter was hardly the only sports authority to monumentally fail to read the room. For example, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) eventually banned Russia from the Paralympic Winter Games but only after first announcing an unsatisfactory compromise in which Russian athletes would have been allowed to compete in neutral colours. Fifa only kicked the Russians out of this year’s World Cup qualifying after other European teams made it clear they were not prepared to play them. This is, after all, how Big Sport has instinctively operated: cautiously, conservatively, with a moral cowardice that runs as deep as its avarice. With empty gestures and weasel words. Only when the scale of global outrage became apparent, only when it became obvious that any entity associated with Russia was at risk of suffering grievous, perhaps terminal reputational damage, did many governing bodies take decisive action. “There go my people,” the French revolutionary Alexandre Ledru-Rollin is said to have remarked. “I must find out where they are going so I can lead them.” This is not a particularly new phenomenon. In 1939, the IOC was looking for a new venue for the 1940 Winter Olympics after Japan’s military aggression meant it had to relinquish hosting rights (voluntarily, rather than after any significant pressure). Hitler’s invasion of Poland soon forced the IOC to cancel the Games entirely, having first reassigned them to the charming ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Nazi Germany. However, even in this digital age, it is possible to feel vaguely stunned at the speed with which the landscape of sport has now changed. The men’s Champions League final has been stripped from St Petersburg and handed to Paris. Manchester United have ended their commercial partnership with Aeroflot. Russian teams – and in some cases individual athletes – have been banned across sport, from athletics to cycling, rugby union to Formula One. It is inconceivable that Russia will be allowed to host any major sporting event for many years. Most shocking of all, individuals whose wealth and power were widely assumed to be impregnable have been forced from the stage. Roman Abramovich has announced his intention to sell Chelsea FC, sensing the threat of sanctions in the UK. The Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation and his sponsorship of Everton FC has been suspended. Even Vladimir Putin has been punished, with the International Judo Federation stripping him of the honorary presidency he has held since 2008. Other cases are more complex. Was it right for Russian F1 driver Nikita Mazepin to be ejected from the British Grand Prix then see his Haas team contract terminated? Should individual Russian athletes be punished unless they condemn the invasion of Ukraine? Will Ivan Drago have to be censored out of the Rocky movies? In part, this is the tragedy of autocracy: the state and the individual begin to bleed into each other to the extent that it is difficult to separate them. Whether you are a billionaire oligarch, a film-maker reliant on state funding or an athlete benefiting from a centralised performance programme, it is virtually impossible to thrive in Russia without becoming entangled with the regime in some form. But the wider lesson here is one that goes well beyond Russia and well beyond this war. For years, we have been told by the world’s sporting bodies, many of its athletes and the majority of its autocratic regimes that sport can and should be kept separate from politics. Now we realise why they were so intent on touting and maintaining this fiction. For those invested in the smooth running of international sport, either as a vehicle for commercial growth, personal enrichment or soft power, politics means questions and moral dilemmas. It means independent thought, scrutiny and oversight. It means exercising a conscience. It means change. Now, as it turns out, an entire country can be wiped from the sporting map almost overnight if the will is there to do it. And for political reasons, rather than anything it has done on the field of play. This was possible all along! Why, then, was Russia allowed to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup? Why was the genocidal regime in China rewarded with this year’s Winter Olympics? Why have abusive governments in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia been allowed to own football clubs and cycling teams? Why is this year’s World Cup in Qatar? The past week has been an eye-opener in many ways. Athletes leading the call to action. Public opinion forcing governing bodies into U-turns. People beginning to rethink the entire relationship between elite sport, money and power. Maybe this is just a fleeting illusion of solidarity in the jaws of a terrible human catastrophe. But if things really are going to change, this is how it starts.

3/6/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought with it crippling increases in the price of gas. On Friday, the price per therm spiked 25% to hit a record high on energy markets before slipping backwards. A fresh peak above 500p per therm – nine times the price seen just over a year ago – is expected over the next few days as traders panic about the course of the war. Fears that Moscow is planning to restrict supplies of natural gas in response to further rounds of sanctions, driving the price higher still, cannot be easily dismissed, according to some analysts, who concede that Vladimir Putin’s administration is deliberately undercutting any rational view of his tactics in this increasingly bitter, destructive war. Not surprisingly, the major recipients of Russian gas acrossEurope have spent the last week scrambling to find alternative sources. Italy, which uses gas to generate 40% of its electricity and imports more than 90% of its gas, mostly from Russia, has looked to Algeria and Azerbaijan for alternative supplies. German politicians have talked about cancelling plans to shut down nuclear power plants and ramping up electricity production from coal-powered generators. In the short term, though, Russian gas is an essential element of the energy mix, and without it rationing would be widespread. Heavy industries across Europe have already adopted short-time working or, in several cases, weekly shutdowns to cope with rising prices. Car-company bosses are among many who believe they would never be able to pass on the cost of higher energy to consumers and so have made the choice to restrict production until prices fall. Boris Johnson rightly says Britain has successfully reduced the supply of gas from Russian gas fields to below 5%, but the privatisation of UK supplies in the North Sea ties consumers to the going rate on international energy markets, leaving the UK as exposed as any other country to rising prices. According to industry body Energy UK, recent increases could push the average energy bill from more than £2,000 a year after the lifting of a price cap in April to nearer £3,000 in October, when the cap is reviewed. Consumers are already being quoted fixed-rate tariffs of £3,500 a year. It leaves Britain and Germany among the worst affected by rising prices, in part because they have so little control of domestic supply via public ownership. Energy analyst Ano Kuhanathan says any restriction on Russian gas supplies would hit industrial and residential users hard. He works for Euler Hermes, a branch of the giant German insurer Allianz, and concluded in a report with two colleagues last week that much of Europe will be dependent on Russian gas for several years, despite action to reduce demand and develop alternative energy sources. He dismissed a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which said European leaders could reduce their dependency on Russian gas by a third in just one year, as “extremely aggressive” and almost certainly probably impossible. The IEA highlighted a 10-point plan that included a strong push to insulate homes, a faster windfarm building programme and an advertising push to persuade people to turn down their thermostats by 1C. Emphasising the need to move swiftly, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said: “Nobody is under any illusions any more. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon shows Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter.” Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at UCL, said Britain was in a similar position and “reducing demand for gas should be at the centre of the UK’s response to the invasion of Ukraine and high prices”. But Kuhanathan said a shift in strategic planning would leave the energy market dynamics largely unchanged in the short term and that, without rationing, there was little choice but to continue using Russian gas. “Most gas in Europe is carried by pipelines. There could be a switch to liquefied natural gas (LNG), but there is not the storage capacity. “And anyway, Japan and China are among many nations that want huge amounts of LNG, which means the extra supply isn’t there at the moment,” he said. Britain also lacks the storage capacity that could cushion the UK from the full impact of volatile gas prices. Germans were under the illusion that a lack of storage was not something they needed to worry about. But reports last week in the German press revealed that thetheir largest gas storage facility in the country is part owned by the Russian gas supplier Gazprom and was run almost dry in the weeks leading up to the invasion. Given that Russia accounts for 17% of global gas supplies and 12% of oil production, it will be a painful transition to alternative sources, especially if the switch must take place in months rather than years.",Lifestyle/Money,Soaring gas prices are a cost of this war – and Britain can’t avoid them,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/06/soaring-gas-prices-are-a-cost-of-this-war-and-britain-cant-avoid-them
3/6/2022,"Have you worn a tailored jacket this week? If so, you have also been wearing a skirt. Technically, jackets are skirted garments – the lower part, from the waist down, is known as “the skirt”. The tailored jackets worn by Vladimir Putin, Boris Johnson, Joe Biden: they’re pretty much long-sleeve button-front minidresses. The suit is a globally understood signifier of patriarchal power. But, like all other clothes, it’s just drag. This month, the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London opens Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear, the museum’s first major exhibition dedicated to men’s clothing. The show will gather 100 contemporary and historical outfits, alongside 100 artworks, to reveal how menswear has always pushed beyond binaries, even in garments considered traditional. Included in the exhibition are pieces worn by those who have broken gender norms in the public eye, such as David Bowie, Harry Styles and Sam Smith. There are also pieces that explore the gender complexity of the seemingly sober, such as a row of 19th century frock coats, the predecessor to the modern-day suit. Those frock coats, then the garment worn by those of power, flare out in their skirt. I have donated two outfits to the exhibition. One is from a Comme des Garçons Homme Plus collection inspired by Virginia Woolf’s novel Orlando, which uses clothing to soar beyond gender. The other is a sleeveless romper by designer Rick Owens, in simple black cotton jersey. From the front it is plain, but at the back there is a zippered hatch over the butt, should one ever need easy access. My pieces err towards the flamboyant. I am 48, a midlife point that gives me perspective on what I maybe didn’t realise before. I have always used clothing to poke at the assumptions of gender. As a kid, I had safe parameters from my whiteness and middle-class upbringing within an accepting family. Where I sit on the gender spectrum is like a comedy version of “male”, which has allowed me to pass lightly in this patriarchal society. Others have a different experience. The V&A exhibition will feature the gloriously embroidered cape and suit worn by actor Billy Porter at the 2019 Golden Globes. Porter grew up in a conservative religious family, sexually abused by his stepfather from the age of seven. The actor, who found fame through his role in the TV show Pose, uses expressive clothing to demand visibility for black queer humans. His fashion choices are both a fabulous celebration and an act of defiance. For a new generation, gender-fluid experimentation with clothing is their way of living. Harris Reed, a 25-year-old designer, splices masculine and feminine tropes for his showpieces. One such, a tailored suit cut with a hoop skirt and layers of tulle, was worn by Harry Styles in the December 2020 issue of US Vogue. Reed had only just graduated from fashion college, an immediate sensation with his beyond-binary outlook. I co-run a queer rave in London called Chapter 10, which from the beginning has been actively non-gendered. At our rave the other month, it seemed like everyone young in the crowd, no matter their gender, was wearing a camisole. Using their clothing, this new generation is unravelling gender for themselves. Perhaps it’s safer to do so through what they wear. According to gender-critical feminists, men who voice their trans-inclusive beliefs on gender identity are bullies and misogynists. It is common among such men to desire the dismantling of patriarchy. I am one of them. Yet I believe the result of the gender-critical argument is that gendered stereotypes are maintained, and patriarchy is consolidated. Clothing often expresses what is subconscious, or what words cannot say. It has always been this way, across centuries. The V&A exhibition is an opportunity to champion and encourage those who use what they wear to unpick gender. By using extravagance and the theatre of clothes, they can encourage the loosening of oppressive societal norms. It is the first major exhibition of menswear at the V&A, and hopefully it can be the last. A new generation wants us to transcend gender and just see humans, and their clothes.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Men’s clothes have always been a way to unpick the locks of gender | Charlie Porter,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/06/mens-clothes-have-always-been-a-way-to-unpick-the-locks-of-gender-charlie-porter
3/6/2022,"The murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer a year ago prompted a wave of national shock. Her brutal abduction, rape and killing pierced the public consciousness to such a degree that feminist campaigners wondered if this tragedy might move us from seeing violence as something society has to live with to something that can be significantly reduced. Today, those hopes look misplaced. A single statistic shows how little has changed: since Sarah’s murder, at least 125 women have been killed by men. Some, like Sabina Nessa, were murdered in a public place by a man they didn’t know; many more behind closed doors, often by their partners. The question, after having read report after report, is why, for all the never agains and pledges to do more, have we failed so badly to reduce violence? Any analysis of violence has to begin with the stark difference between the sexes. The vast majority of violence is committed by men – more than four-fifths of violent crime and an even greater proportion of sex offences. While men are also more likely to be victims of violent crime, women are overwhelmingly more likely to be victims of severe domestic abuse. (One of the reasons single-sex spaces have become the norm in prisons, hospital wards and refuges: it is a simple rule of thumb to safeguard against male violence.) Interestingly, the difference in physical aggression between the average man and the average women is moderate – to put it in context, about a quarter as significant as average sex differences in height. The big difference comes at the extremes of the distribution: there are many more very violent men than women. What underpins this difference? In animals, scientists have found a clear link between testosterone levels and male aggression. But this is not replicated in humans, leading experts to believe that the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors – the way children are socialised – plays a much greater role. And there are noticeable differences in the way boys and girls are socialised. Children’s worlds are infused with harmful gender stereotypes – the idea that girls are sweet and boys are tough – in everything from behaviour expectations to their toys and clothes. There are some school-based programmes that try to tackle damaging masculine stereotypes, which draw on evidence of the effectiveness of peer-based programmes to tackle bullying in encouraging friends to call each other out on unhealthy behaviour towards girls. It can only be a good thing to challenge the stereotypes that are corrosive to boys and girls. Perpetrator programmes for violent men have also run with this idea of reprogramming masculinity. That makes sense when you consider that, a few decades ago, the only people interested in reducing domestic violence were grassroots feminists who understood male violence primarily as a symptom of patriarchy: the age-old structural power imbalance between men and women that socially constructed itself out of differences between the sexes. They developed the Duluth model, named after the Minnesota city where it was conceived in the 1980s, which included a curriculum that aimed to educate the patriarchy out of perpetrators. It is used widely today in the US, the UK and Australia, but evidence of its effectiveness is equivocal at best. That is not altogether surprising: the idea that attending a weekly support group will transform lifelong patterns of violent behaviour for most men seems far-fetched. The difference between the sexes is a vital starting point for understanding violence, but cannot be the endpoint. Just as important are differences between men: why are some more violent than others? Some will have the kinds of personality disorders that mean they are incapable of feeling empathy. But longitudinal research finds that adverse childhood experiences – such as parental or domestic abuse, having a father in prison or growing up around alcohol or substance abuse – are associated with poorer outcomes in adulthood for boys and girls and one of those outcomes for some boys is a greater propensity to violence. Yet the services that exist to support children with trauma have been cut to the bone over the past decade. It is not to excuse adult violence to say that some perpetrators have been resoundingly failed as children. This difference between men has also been elided when it comes to perpetrator programmes. One of the most effective is a UK project called Drive, developed by two domestic abuse charities. It has shed once and for all the feminist attachment to the idea that the key to reducing serious violence is teaching men to be better. It works with the highest-risk domestic abusers. They are all assigned a case manager, who can help them access the support they need, such as housing or mental health services. But it also functions as a surveillance system for dangerous men: they are monitored on an ongoing basis and case managers bring in other agencies such as the police and social services to disrupt their violent behaviour. The results are stunning: an 82% and 88% sustained drop in physical and sexual abuse respectively. But just 1% of serious domestic abuse perpetrators get funnelled into targeted interventions. If we were serious about reducing violence, we would be channelling money into a national rollout of this programme in the same way we spend vast sums on counter-terrorism. This idea that we need to disrupt rather than try to fix dangerous men has other implications. There is longstanding research that shows that alcohol restrictions – policies such as minimum pricing, limits on sales of strong alcohol in violence hotspots and timing restrictions – produce not only a range of beneficial health outcomes, but reduce violence. Of course they are a superficial lever and there is much they don’t address, but they reduce harm. Which raises the question: why don’t we use them more? I ended up in a different place than I imagined I would when I embarked on a new documentary for Radio 4. Of course, you cannot understand violence without understanding differences between the sexes, but male violence is about much more than toxic masculinity. And we need to put the same effort into disrupting violent men from killing their partners as we do in stopping them from committing dreadful acts of terrorism.

3/6/2022,"Can Ukraine weaponise time? As long as the will to fight exists, the country’s soldiers and citizens can hope to wear down, even to repulse, the Russian invaders. But their dilemma is a terrible one. As Vladimir Putin’s bombardments grow more barbarous and indiscriminate, the human cost of resistance is rising daily. If they hold on, will the western powers belatedly come to their rescue? Time does not favour Russia’s president. Casualties are increasing. His Nazi-style military blitzkrieg didn’t work. His conscripts are reportedly demoralised, his war machine may bog down. His hubris is destroying Russia’s economy. Protests at home reflect a new political vulnerability. Putin is being tracked by war crimes prosecutors in The Hague. For any rational leader, an immediate ceasefire, accompanied by a bogus claim of victory, would be an obvious way out. But logic and reason play no part in Putin’s “thinking”. This catastrophe recalls Iraq in 2003. How could anyone, however delusional, possibly believe a full-scale invasion was a good idea? The man Donald Trump calls a “genius” turns out to be really stupid. To avoid defeat – to eventually win – Ukrainian resistance forces will need the west’s sustained, long-term military, logistical, financial and intelligence support. Will the allies, fresh from their Afghan cop-out, stay the course this time? Nato combat jets are nowhere to be seen in Ukraine’s skies – but there’s a whiff of betrayal in the air. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, wants instant EU membership. He was cheered at the European parliament last week – but he will not get his wish. Kyiv is pleading for a Nato-patrolled no-fly zone to help stop the merciless bombing of cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv. That isn’t happening, either. Ukraine’s people are determined to fight on. It’s impossible not to admire them – but also impossible, or so western leaders appear to say, to protect them from mass murder. Such bravery underscores the grave responsibility of western governments. Britain and the US, in particular, have encouraged resistance, sending missiles and lethal aid. Raising the stakes, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden portray the war as a defining struggle between freedom and tyranny, democracy and authoritarianism. That’s not the sort of war you can afford to lose. Most European countries, plus Australia, Japan, Canada and others, have pledged open-ended backing, too. For the first time, the EU will supply weaponry. This is all very dramatic, perhaps suspiciously so. Should Ukrainians trust these sweeping promises? What if the war lasts five or 10 years, which is not unusual for such conflicts? Fuelling an apparently endless, widely destabilising insurgency will require grit and consistency in London and other capitals. Few western politicians, eyeing the next election, display such qualities. How long, for example, will German voters’ current outrage outlast the impact of higher bills and taxes to pay for non-Russian gas and vastly increased defence spending? How long will Biden stay engaged if the crisis turns into a grinding war of attrition? He could be a lame duck after November’s midterms. Possible 2024 replacements, such as Trump, have a very different view of Nato and Russia. The longevity and reliability of public and political support for Ukraine is one question. Another will be how to meet the resistance’s need for an unceasing flow of arms, assistance, and staging posts and safe havens outside Ukrainian territory. The probability that displaced fighters, plus a European “foreign legion”, will seek bases in neighbouring Nato members – from which to launch attacks on the occupiers – is strong. Remember how the mujahideen, fighting the Red Army, and later the Taliban, fighting Nato, operated from Pakistan. Extended cross-border warfare would ineluctably suck in alliance countries. It would be viewed by Putin as the product not of unextinguished Ukrainian nationalism but of US-plotted regime change. If Russia, over time, continues to suffer significant losses to a western-backed resistance, Putin will take the war to the west. This is exactly the dangerous escalation Biden and Nato say they are determined to avoid, which supposedly justifies their refusal of a no-fly zone. It’s the “third world war” nightmare scenario Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, warns against. But how to dispel it? Uncertain, too, is the west’s ability to maintain the unusual unity of purpose lauded by a too self-congratulatory Biden in last week’s State of the Union address. The EU is likewise proud of its united stance and tough sanctions package. But big gaps and internal differences remain. Revenue-spinning Russian oil and gas still flow. The banking bans have large loopholes. Even the best-laid sanctions regimes crumble over time. And despite an initially generous EU welcome, the expected huge increases in refugee numbers, if the war drags on, will exacerbate existing tensions in Europe and the UK. Worries about an unvanquished Putin going on to threaten other former Soviet republics, as Biden predicts he might, are also intensifying. The defeatist argument goes like this: Ukraine, sadly, is already lost. Better to concentrate on ensuring the Baltic republics and similarly vulnerable states do not go the same way. The paradox is that the more successful and long-lived Ukraine’s resistance is, the bigger the dangers for Nato. Yet if by supporting it, the allies cannot ultimately avoid being drawn into conflict with Russia, why delay the inevitable? In other words: rather than leave the fighting, and the dying, to Ukrainians alone – and then eventually abandon them – the western democracies should put their air combat forces on standby, declare their intention to impose a no-fly zone – and tell the Kremlin to stop the killing. Putin’s slaughter of innocents is unbearable, yet we are forced to watch. Will the west fight to the last Ukrainian? Or will it stand up and fight for itself?",Opinion/Opinion,"The more Ukraine resists, the greater the danger to Nato.
