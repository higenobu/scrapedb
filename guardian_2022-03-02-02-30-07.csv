3/2/2022,"Boris Johnson and Priti Patel plan to allow more relatives of Ukrainian nationals to enter the UK after being faced with growing pressure for the UK to take in more of those fleeing war in eastern Europe. They say that a further 100,000 refugees, including elderly parents, grandparents, adult children and siblings of British-based Ukrainian nationals, will be eligible to apply under criteria announced on Monday. A new visa sponsor route, called the humanitarian sponsorship pathway, will also be created to let British businesses bring Ukrainians to the UK. Refugee charities have questioned why the government has not followed the EU’s lead and introduced visa waivers, and raised concerns that the UK’s approach would be too slow to help many of those trying to escape the Russian invasion. The approximate number of Ukrainians expected to be covered will rise to 200,000, a government spokesperson claimed. That figure would include the original 100,000 people the Home Office identified as immediate family members – a definition that was criticised by Tory MPs and others for being too narrow. Addressing MPs, Patel confirmed that she was extending eligibility to parents, grandparents, adult offspring, siblings, and their immediate family members, of Ukraine nationals based in the UK. “Those joining family in the UK will be granted leave for an initial period of 12 months. They will be able to work and access public funds. “Secondly, we will establish a humanitarian sponsorship pathway which will open up a route to the UK for Ukrainians who may not have family ties with the UK, but who are able to match with individuals, charities, businesses and community groups,” she said. Patel told the Commons that the case of an elderly Ukrainian national stuck in Paris after trying to cross to the UK to be with her British-resident relatives, which was raised by Yvette Cooper on Monday, had now been solved. She indicated some flexibility for Ukrainian nationals applying to join relatives of British nationals who do not fit into the current criteria and said that ministers across government were aware that they would have to find homes, schools and adequate healthcare for hundreds of thousands of people. Cooper, the shadow home secretary, expressed “considerable relief” at the government’s new position, but sought assurances over the numbers of refugees who would be allowed into the UK and asked if anyone would have to pay if they were seeking sanctuary from Ukraine. “Does the sponsoring family member have to be British or have to have indefinite leave to remain? What about Ukrainians here on work visas, on study visas, who have come maybe as lorry drivers or on visitor visas? “Can she make a simple commitment now that family members from Ukraine who are fleeing persecution are all welcome here in the UK, no matter what visa their family member here in the UK has, that we will give them sanctuary?” she said. Patel replied: “It is a family scheme, on that basis, a Ukrainian family scheme, so family members – and I’ve already outlined some of the categories – will be eligible to come over to the UK and the scheme will be free.” But France asked UK authorities to further relax visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, an adviser to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told French media, because what the Elysée called “over-restrictive” rules had led to people being stranded in northern France.“We have drawn the attention of the British authorities to the difficulties associated with the lack of information and the over-restrictive nature of this system,” the adviser told Le Parisien newspaper on Tuesday.The adviser said the system represented an additional “heavy administrative burden” on refugees, in particular because “at this stage [the UK] is not issuing visas on the spot, but in its consulates and embassies”.France welcomes Ukrainians without visas under the EU’s 90-day rule, which means they can spend 90 days out of every 180 in the Schengen Area visa-free. The UK’s insistence on people escaping the conflict needing a visa to enter Britain has already caused problems for some families in France. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government’s decision to relax visa requirements does not go far enough. “It could mean that far fewer Ukrainians are actually able to reach safety in the UK than the government claims. Sponsorship is a slow process and in recent years has only resulted in hundreds of refugees coming to the UK,” he said. Mike Adamson, the chief executive of British Red Cross, said the proposed humanitarian sponsorship pathway was a positive step, but that concerns remain that it would take some time to put into practice. “As a temporary measure, we’re calling on the government to allow Ukrainians to travel here without a visa. Security checks can still be carried out when people travel or arrive in the UK, and this would be in line with the approach taken in the EU,” he said.",News/World news,"UK to double number of Ukrainians eligible to come to UK, say ministers",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/uk-to-relax-visa-rules-for-extended-family-of-ukrainians-in-britain

3/2/2022,"Borrowing on credit cards and short-term loans slowed in January to its lowest growth rate since September 2021 as the Omicron variant discouraged consumers from venturing out to shops, restaurants and bars. Data from the Bank of England showed a net increase of £600m in consumer credit lending in January, a drop from an increase in December of £800m and £1.2bn in November. Separate figures covering savings showed that households deposited £7.7bn in January, up from £2.7bn in December, to emphasise the retreat back to a pattern of low spending and high saving seen during much of the pandemic. Debt charities said the worsening cost of living crisis after a dramatic rise in food and fuel bills was likely to push consumer credit higher during the spring. Richard Lane, director of external affairs at the debt charity StepChange, said: “The months ahead look sobering in terms of the pressures on UK household finances, with the known rises in national insurance and energy prices exacerbated further now by all the uncertainty in the geopolitical environment.” Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said: “With food and fuel prices continuing to rise, and energy costs set to soar, our fear is that many more people will be pushed into difficulty in the coming months. She criticised government plans to offset rising bills with a £150 rebate on council tax bills in April and a £200 loan in October as inadequate, adding that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should “significantly uprate benefits and increase assistance through the warm homes discount”. Thomas Pugh, economist at the accountants RSM UK, said the easing of Covid restrictions in February would combine with rising costs to push spending on credit cards and loans higher. “As Omicron recedes into the rear-view mirror and the economy fully reopens, borrowing should rise and saving rates will drop, helping to support spending in the face of surging inflation,” he said. He said the average household was in a much better position than before the pandemic, even if many poorer households were struggling. Data showed about £25bn of consumer credit was paid off over the last two years while £225bn of excess savings was built up. “Normally, a rise in consumer credit is a good indication that consumption is growing strongly because it tends to expand when the economy is good. People feel confident enough to borrow and splurge on big tickets items, such as cars,” he said. “This time may be different, though. A rise in consumer borrowing over the next year is more likely to be a sign that high inflation is driving consumers to maintain their lifestyles by borrowing.” Figures for mortgage lending exceeded expectations, with an almost 50% month-on-month increase in mortgage lending in January. Both lending and approvals remained elevated above pre-pandemic norms, said Karl Thompson, an economist at the consultancy Cebr, after net mortgage borrowing increased by almost 50% from an upwardly revised £4bn in December to £5.9bn in January. The threat of higher interest rates from the Bank of England was considered to be one of the driving forces behind the jump in borrowing, coupled with a cut-throat lending market, with banks and building societies cutting fixed-rate offers.",Lifestyle/Money,Britons slow credit card spending and increase savings – for now,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/01/uk-credit-card-spending-slows-savings-increase-january

3/2/2022,"An Asian woman who was attacked in New York by a man with a rock has died after spending approximately 10 weeks in a coma, her family said on Monday. GuiYing Ma, 62, was sweeping the sidewalk outside her home in Jackson Heights in Queens on 26 November when a man allegedly struck her head with a rock, police say. Ma is the fourth Asian American in two months to die in New York as a result of violence against members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. According to data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, anti-AAPI hate crime was up 339% nationally last year. Many such attacks have been motivated by resentment over the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China. Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that tracks and responds to racially motivated hate crimes, said last August more than 9,000 anti-AAPI incidents had been reported across the US since the pandemic began. In a statement, Ma’s family said: “The deaths of Mrs Yao Pan Ma, Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee have made many in the AAPI community feel unsafe. “The family urges tougher law enforcement to keep everyone in the AAPI community safe and in particular, the elderly members of our community.” The man who attacked GuiYing Ma, identified as Elisaul Perez, 33, allegedly hit her on the left side of her head after getting into an argument with her, then left her unconscious and bleeding. Police say he hit her again when she fell. New York police arrested Perez a day later and charged him with assault with intent to disfigure and dismember, assault with intent to seriously injure with a weapon and criminal possession of a weapon. He remains in custody. He has pleaded not guilty. The attack “permanently damaged the right side of Mrs Ma’s brain”, read the family statement, which was posted on a GoFundMe page set up to pay medical expenses. “But the love between Mrs Ma and her husband Mr Zhanxin Gao remained. Despite being connected to a ventilator and a feeding tube, Mrs Ma responded to Mr Gao by moving her eyes and tearing up when Mr Gao would speak to her at the hospital.” Ma woke from the coma in early February and was able to raise her arm in response to her husband, though she was unable to speak. On 22 February, Ma died as a result of “complications of blunt impact injury of head”, her family said. The death was ruled as a homicide. “We are reviewing the latest development in this tragedy and will add or upgrade any appropriate charges supported by the evidence,” a spokesman for the Queens district attorney said. Ma arrived in New York four years ago from Liaoning, China. She is survived by her husband, a son and two grandchildren. According to the GoFundMe statement, funeral services will be arranged after her son is able to travel to New York.",News/US news,"Asian woman, 62, attacked with rock in New York dies after 10 weeks in coma ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/elderly-asian-woman-dies-rock-attack-new-york-guiying-ma
3/2/2022,"Ukraine’s continued access to the internet not only supports day-to-day life and the country’s financial system but it is also enabling the coordination of Ukrainian civil resistance – plus the ability of everyone, from the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to ordinary citizens, to communicate with the outside world. How much of Ukraine still has access to the internet?Ukraine remains largely connected to the internet, especially in major population centres. Mobile networks have struggled under the weight of connections and there have been broadband outages in areas with heavy fighting. But on a national level access to the internet is largely unaffected by the Russian invasion, according to external monitoring organisations. “Ukraine has a diverse internet infrastructure with few choke points – which means it’s difficult to switch off the country and there’s no centralised kill switch,” said Alp Toker of the monitoring organisation NetBlocks. “If an invading nation desired to switch off Ukraine’s internet, this would really be a matter of physically entering internet exchange points and data centres and taking over that infrastructure. And it certainly can’t be done remotely by severing a connection with, say, Russia.” In a bid to boost connectivity, the Ukrainian telecoms regulator has temporarily released spare radio frequencies to mobile phone networks in order to allow them to relieve congestion on their services. What is happening to the internet as Russian forces advance?Lanet, one of the country’s leading broadband providers, apologised to customers in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk this weekend because its connection to the area had been destroyed “as a result of combat operations”. When its users in the city, currently under heavy Russian artillery fire, asked for an update on when their broadband would be reconnected, the company said its technicians could not currently perform repairs “due to active military action on the damage site”. One customer begged for the service to be fixed, posting on the company’s Facebook page to explain why it matters: “Journalists, correspondents, military for communication and civilians need to know what to do … we find out everything from Telegram channels and Facebook.” How could Russia shut down the internet in Ukraine?In recent years autocratic regimes have increasingly moved to switch off internet connections when faced with uprisings, such as in Kazakhstan in January. Many African nations have also enforced full or partial internet shutdowns when faced with internal conflict or in the run-up to elections. Shutting down the internet is relatively easy for an incumbent government. Officials can simply order licensed internet service providers and phone networks to switch off their networks, or risk having their right to operate in the country withdrawn. What is more difficult is for an invading power to shut down a decentralised commercial telecoms infrastructure, especially if mobile networks and internet service providers refuse to collaborate. Toker said a targeted Russian hack or a denial of service attack could briefly take out chunks of Ukrainian communications infrastructure but would be relatively easy to mitigate. This leaves the other scenario where Russian troops physically enter data centres or systematically destroy equipment. “Even then, it might involve coercing staff. It’s the kind of thing that might happen if there’s an attempt to unseat the government. It could well happen to prevent a counterinsurgency.” What has Elon Musk got to do with all of this?The American billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX has been developing a satellite internet system called Starlink, which aims to provide reliable global broadband connectivity through thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites. This would be nearly impossible for Russia to block – but also requires the user to have access to a special piece of equipment. Starlink — here. Thanks, @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/dZbaYqWYCf Following a request from the Ukrainian government, Musk has sent a shipment of these to Kyiv – although it is unlikely that it will be possible to deploy the system at scale. Rather than aiding the general population, it is more likely to be used strategically – such as ensuring key officials retain independent access to the internet.",News/World news,Could Russia shut down the internet in Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/could-russia-shut-down-the-internet-in-ukraine
3/2/2022,"An unusual expedition here for Netflix, unusual less for the nature of the expedition itself and more for the ambition of it, a rare film for the streamer that allows us to travel with characters to a real location, a world away from green screens and sound stages. It shouldn’t be quite this much of a unique selling point but in the age of modestly budgeted fare crafted for the smallest of screens, the sheer on-the-ground expanse of old-fashioned survival adventure Against the Ice immediately separates it from the many other films landing, or most often crash-landing, on the platform. It’s a vital separation from its contemporary streaming peers as when compared with the big-screen films that have come before in this particular genre, it’s a familiar tale told robustly but with very little distinguishing flair. It’s a passion project for the Game of Thrones alum Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who both co-writes and stars as the Danish explorer Ejnar Mikkelsen, but this passion is mostly restrained on screen, a polite, by-the-numbers story of men fighting the elements that should satisfy those seeking a simple, sturdy throwback drama. Those hoping for anything extra will leave feeling a little cold. It’s the true story of the Danish expedition to Greenland in 1909, one to disprove the American claim to the north-eastern territory based on a belief that it was broken up into separate pieces of land. Captain Mikkelsen (who in real life would have been just 29 at the time, a slight stretch for the 51-year-old Coster-Waldau) is following in the footsteps of an ill-fated prior attempt, aiming to recover the bodies or discoveries of the men who came before them. To make the final trek, he must leave his crew on the ship and brave the extremes, a 400-mile round trip that will require a partner. The only volunteer is mechanic Iver (Joe Cole), inexperienced but eager, and so the two set out, aware that they might never come back. But while the characters might be risking life and limb to trek into uncharted territory, it’s a familiar route for the rest of us. It’s a mostly enjoyable one, though, not quite as gripping as it could have been given the intensity of the situation, but charged with just about enough forward momentum to keep us onboard. The film’s most effective moments are those that teeter on the brink of catastrophe, an uneasy tension born from the knowledge that in a place such as this, death is always just one false move away. And it’s not just from falling off the edge of an icy verge or into freezing water (pushed by a rather shoddy-looking CG bear), but also from ruined or lost supplies, injured or killed snow dogs, the constant fear that something is about to go wrong and then all might be lost. Adapted from Mikkelsen’s posthumously published book (which means we’re never completely in the dark over where we’re headed), Against the Ice is a Danish story flattened for a global audience. The decision is made for characters to speak in English with a variety of regional British accents, a slightly jarring sacrifice to increase eyeballs that, for a story all about an ambitious country trying to make strides to end a debate of who-owns-what with another, makes it feel a little confused. There’s a similar lack of specificity with much of the dialogue which at times feels too simplified and at others, far too modern (were people in 1909 really asking others to go for a “walk and talk”?). Like many of his Game of Thrones co-stars, Coster-Waldau has mostly struggled to find his groove outside of Westeros and while he’s far too old to be playing Mikkelsen (the dramatic shift of watching someone in their late 20s v early 50s grapple with such responsibility is huge), he makes for an adequate lead, tasked mostly with tersely reacting to bad things happening. The last act pushes him into hallucinatory mode, to try to bridge the gap between home and away, which makes for a mostly unconvincing lurch to the finish line. But it’s an otherwise satisfying end to the kind of journey that we’ve taken many times before and will most likely take again. Perhaps next time it might even be one to truly remember.

3/2/2022,"The devastation and human misery described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC issues ‘bleakest warning yet’ on impacts of climate breakdown. 28 February) stands as an indictment of failing political leaders and their complicity with a fossil fuel industry that is literally destroying our only home. Scientists warn that we must act quickly to transition away from coal, oil and natural gas to clean energy. The longer we delay the transition, the more catastrophic the impact. Our elected leaders have no excuse; we must pressure them to act. Affordable clean energy is increasingly available. There are policy solutions. In near unanimity, economists say that the best way to speed the transition is to make the polluting industry pay a fee on its carbon pollution. If included in climate legislation, this policy could reduce emissions in half by 2030, spur investments in renewables, provide revenue to support families and motivate other nations, including China, to adopt similar policies.Bob TaylorMontecito, California, US  Your article highlighted the differences between the natural sciences and the social sciences. The natural sciences – physics, chemistry, biology – provide laws that hold true with or without the presence of man. Natural sciences are universal in terms of the location in the universe. The social sciences – economics, politics – can only exist as a construct of man. Unfortunately, politicians and economists assume they have dominion over the natural sciences. The casualty of this mismatch is the environment. We cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet. The outcome is undoubtedly bleak, but the natural sciences will provide a comprehensive explanation of the failure of politicians and economists.Chris HillSheffield  Citizens of the 195 countries of the globe, especially those who live near rivers, in the path of forest fires, violent winds and hurricanes, or encroaching seas, already know what the IPCC report says – that all parts of the globe will be impacted. And although climate change will affect every country in the world, its effects will not be felt equally, initially. Countries with high levels of poverty face the gravest risks immediately from global heating. Recent events have exposed the wilful blindness of all our leaders in the face of this global catastrophe. If we do not act now, our children and grandchildren, in every nation, face dangerous temperature rises. Lay down those expensive deadly weapons please, leaders of all nations. We world citizens do not want to kill each other after all. We have something more important to do. And to those leaders still intent on murderous land and profit grabs, there is no need to waste money on tanks and missiles; the climate will snatch away your land and will kill your children anyway.Drusilla LongLeeds  I am struck by the timing of the IPCC report and terrible news from Ukraine. Both the climate emergency and the Ukraine situation are exacerbated by engineers and scientists choosing to devote their talents to the development of “improved” weapons; the direct and indirect costs of these decisions are simply not justifiable in this time of crisis.

3/2/2022,"The proposal to renovate parliament is the biggest waste of money I have ever heard about (Parliament renovation could take 76 years and cost £22bn, report says, 23 February). The final amount could be double, bearing in mind the history of overspends in major projects. The Palace of Westminster should be pulled down and replaced with a 21st-century building that meets the needs of a modern democracy. The Scots and the Welsh have modern parliament buildings – the English deserve one too. I can see that the people who do not want to change anything would oppose this. So the Thames frontage could be preserved and the new building could be attached to it. This building needs two debating chambers with semicircular layouts to get rid of the confrontational bear pits we have in the present building. It also needs an electronic voting system so every one of our representatives can vote wherever they are in the country, so we can do away people filing through the lobby. Think what the country could do to fix our broken society with the £22bn it will cost just to prevent a building falling down.Roy AppleyardHerne Bay, Kent  Has the world gone mad? You report that parliament’s restoration cost is estimated to be between £7bn and £22bn. If you take a rough estimate of £15bn, that is the equivalent of £23m per MP. As an architect, I find it inconceivable that anyone could seriously support any of these alternatives. Move parliament to a purpose-built shed in west London and set a timescale of five years for the refurbishment, with a budget of £2bn-£3bn. I once presented a scheme to a large retailer.

3/2/2022,"Dr Clare Gerada’s long read (‘In my 30 years as a GP, the profession has been horribly eroded’, 22 February) is a compelling account of the changes in general practice and of her view that the whole service has become “eroded and devalued”. She attributes this to it being “sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and expediency”. But upon whose altar, she is silent. This erosion is substantially the result of a contract in 2004 whereby GPs could opt out of out-of-hours care. Dr Peter Baddeley (24 February) refers to this contract in terms that suggest it was forced on GPs, but it was negotiated by them and was voluntary, although the majority took it up. Dr Baddeley acknowledges that his profession’s “weakness and possible complicity” were responsible for the present situation. More may be to come. In 2020, an article entitled “GP home visits: essential patient care or disposable relic?” was published in the British Journal of General Practice, following a vote in November 2019 at the British Medical Association to “remove the anachronism of home visits from core contract work”. The then health secretary, Matt Hancock, rejected the idea – but it won’t have gone away. The 2004 contract had another outcome: the rise in numbers attending A&E. During 2002-17, there was a 66% increase in annual A&E attendances in England, when the population rose by only 11% and the proportion of over-65s by 13%. It is difficult to see what else could be more responsible than the 2004 contract. That contract has a lot to answer for, and so does the medical profession. The now default GP telephone consultation is a further erosion.Dr Stefan Slater (retired)Edinburgh  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/2/2022,"Platform four or three: at the railway station in Przemyśl, Poland, the fates of hundreds of Ukrainians lie divided. On platform four, families fleeing the Russian bombing of Ukraine get off the carriages, seeking asylum in Europe. At platform three, dozens of Ukrainian men and women are about to board a blue train bound for Odessa, southern Ukraine. “I have worked and lived in many countries,” says Oksana, 50. “I have lived in Poland and Italy. Ukraine may not be as beautiful as Italy, but it is my country. And I’m not leaving my country at such a difficult time. If all Ukrainians flee the country, who will stay in Ukraine? I see many of my fellow countrypeople around me here, coming from Germany and Poland. Some of them had good jobs. But they left them to return to Ukraine and fight.” Onboard the trains bound for Ukraine there are also many women who are determined to bring back their children left behind, or who refuse to leave them alone in Ukraine. Tatiana, 49, leaving for Kiev, says she is ready for anything, even to take up arms. “We are from central Ukraine and my son left from Poland a few days ago to join the Ukrainian army and fight, and I couldn’t leave him alone,” says Tatiana. “All my relatives are fighting there now. There are little boys who are also helping in the fight. We are united, like partisans, like guerrillas. Even if my children don’t want it, I am ready to take up arms.” Elena arrived in Poland yesterday after having returned to Kiev to find and rescue her daughter, 23. Elena, who has been living in Palermo, Italy, for years, recently boarded a flight from Sicily to reach Poland and then Ukraine. The basement apartment in Kiev where her family lived was destroyed by Russian airstrikes, but her daughter survived. “When I heard that the war was about to begin, I couldn’t just stand by,” says Elena. “I couldn’t imagine my daughter there alone. So, I took the first flight to Poland and went to Kyiv. When I arrived in the capital, the bombing began. The building destroyed by the bombs was in front of mine. Getting into Ukraine was not difficult. The problem was getting out.” A German man who had travelled to Kyiv to find his wife, offered Elena and her daughter a ride to the border with Poland, where they joined the tens of thousands of refugees lining up to enter. The mass exodus is causing severe queues at the Poland-Ukraine border, with rows of people and cars reaching back nearly 10 miles and waiting times of 40 hours. “My eight-year-old daughter has a severe intestinal disease and cannot walk,” says Elena. “Fortunately, we were able to pass thanks to the intervention of doctors and volunteers. Now we are headed to Palermo, safe and sound.” On platform three, dozens of men aged 20 to 60 smoke nervously in anticipation of the arrival of a train that will take them to Ukraine, where they will join the army fighting Russian troops. Some are wearing civilian clothes, others military garb. Most aim to travel to Kyiv, where a 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks is also headed. Poland’s border guard estimated on Sunday that 22,000 people have crossed from Polish territory into Ukraine since Thursday. “I lived in Germany and my family stayed behind in Stuttgart,” says a man in his 40s who has just boarded the train. “But I didn’t like watching my fellow citizens fight and die, without doing anything, so I decided to join them. I feel good. I am full of energy. I am already in contact with the armed forces in Kyiv. I can’t wait to join them. I want to go back to Ukraine.” Also on platform three, Igor, a Dominican friar, is preparing to meet his brothers from Kyiv to lend a hand to the refugees. Next to him is a young man from Georgia who has travelled from his country to help his friends in Ukraine. “I’m not going to fight,” Igor says, “but if they ask me, I’m ready.” News is circulating in Przemyśl of mercenaries or war veterans who have arrived from various European countries ready to take up arms with Ukrainian forces against the Russian invaders, after Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a call on Sunday to foreign nationals who are “friends of peace and democracy” to travel to the country to fight against the Russian invasion. “Combat tips” and offers to pay for flights have been circulating on a Reddit forum called “VolunteersForUkraine”, where the announcement that Zelenskiy is creating a foreign legion was met with enthusiasm. According to a 2016 decree, foreigners had the right to join the Ukrainian army for military service on a voluntary basis, Zelenskiy’s statement said. Sunday’s appeal by a sovereign government for foreign reinforcements – reminiscent of international involvement in the Spanish civil war of the 1930s – is unprecedented in modern warfare. A small but growing number of Ukrainians living in the UK have also made plans to go back to resist the invasion, including veterans of the war with Russia since 2014, community leaders told the Guardian last week. “Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals,’’ said Zelenskiy.

3/2/2022,"In the satellite image, the trees of the forest just north of the Ukrainian village of Rudnya-Shpylivska – population 107 – appear as if you could brush them with your hand. Before last week, this hamlet was almost too small to notice, a place that cars would speed past on the P02 highway, those trees a blur. Dead centre of the picture, circulated by the satellite company Maxar Technologies on Sunday, a small clearing is visible, and next to it, on the road heading south towards the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a small proportion of a vast convoy of Russian military vehicles – estimated to be 40 miles long – accompanied by 15,000 troops. In places, the military vehicles can be seen three abreast, almost blocking the road. Other images of the convoy seem to explain its belligerent purpose: fuel tankers and trucks carrying food, ammunition and soldiers. Elsewhere, just visible are the shapes of towed and self-propelled artillery pieces, BMP3 armoured carriers and Russian main tanks. In places you can see the tracks of Russian vehicles that have gone off the road – perhaps to scout against attack from the flanks – visible in the fresh snow covering the fields. Indications of smoke from burning buildings off the road, although not on it, backed up by thermal imaging data from Nasa’s global fire tracking service, suggest, perhaps, outgoing fire from vehicles in the convoy towards Ukrainian positions. And in some images released by Maxar on Monday, troops appeared to have arrived at where they would halt, deploying in camps outside the city, including in and around the town of Zdvyzhivka, to the north of Kyiv. All have been assembled for what western intelligence agencies and analysts believe is an imminent attempt to close Russia’s military encirclement of Kyiv and put the city under siege in its latest attempt to topple Ukraine’s government and install a Kremlin-friendly regime. The presence of the convoy, growing and intact, prompts several conclusions as things stand. Despite its scale and the way it has blocked the road for miles, it appears largely unmolested. This suggests Ukraine’s air force is no longer sufficiently intact to target it in a meaningful way and that Ukraine has not been able to bring drones, used successfully elsewhere, to hit it. On Tuesday the head of the convoy was reportedly passing near the heavily contested Hostomel airbase 17 miles north of Kyiv’s city centre. There are fears that the force in the convoy could be deployed against the nearby district of Obolonskyi, the adjacent village of Horenka, and the main roads running through Obolonskyi towards the city’s centre. There is mounting, urgent concern among western officials that Russian forces are planning to employ siege tactics against Kyiv, cutting off supplies and routes in and out, before moving in. Already, faced with the threat of the buildup barely an hour away, some of those residents of Kyiv not attempting to leave have been digging trenches and setting up barricades to repel the expected assault. The possibility of a siege leading to rapidly rising civilian casualties has been raised by senior Biden administration officials. “It’s likely going to be very significant loss of life,” said the congresswoman Victoria Spartz, who was born and raised in Ukraine. As a picture emerges of how a full-scale Russian ground assault on Kyiv could begin, Russia’s Tass and RIA news agencies quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying it planned to strike the headquarters of Ukraine’s security service and special operations unit, allegedly to prevent “information attacks” on Russia. The ministry urged people near the sites to leave the areas. If those strikes go ahead, they are likely to be followed by a stepping up of artillery and missile strikes across the city before a possible armoured incursion. As Russia masses forces on three sides of Kyiv, in a sign of the battle to come, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said defending the capital was a priority. “If we defend Kyiv, we defend the country,” he said in a video message released on Telegram. “Kyiv is the heart of our country, and it must beat. And it will fight for its life to win.”",News/World news,Vast Russian military convoy may be harbinger of a siege of Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/vast-russian-military-convoy-kyiv-siege-ukraine
3/2/2022,"Stephen Colbert opened Monday’s Late Show with moving images from the war in Ukraine. “We all knew this was going to happen for weeks, but there’s a difference between knowing it’s coming and watching it happen,” he said of photos of refugees fleeing to the Polish border, men trying to stop tanks with their bare hands and outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian volunteers readying to fight the Russian invaders. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis, but also it is a triumph of humanity, because despite all of Russia’s military prowess, ordinary people of Ukraine will not back down or bow down,” he added. The Ukrainian defense ministry, for example, instructed citizens to make molotov cocktails and released instructions on how to do so. “That’s great, but did they really need instructions on making molotov cocktails?” Colbert wondered. “It’s a pretty simple recipe: bottle, kerosene, rag, explode to taste.” And “perhaps the greatest symbol of their indomitable resistance”, Colbert continued, is the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has remained in Kyiv and turned down an offer from the US of evacuation, saying: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” “Is everyone in Ukraine that badass?” Colbert mused. “He’s not fleeing, he’s not abandoning ship. He’s staying! He’s like the captain of the Titanic, if the Titanic spent five days successfully beating the iceberg.” Is Putin going nuclear? And, more important, did these reporters just say they’re shocked that such an invasion would happen in a “relatively civilized” country??? pic.twitter.com/DOoxCkSjNH On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah reacted to Vladimir Putin threatening to “activate” his nuclear arsenal over the weekend. “You see, people? This is why every crazy world leader needs a pasty son-in-law by his side – keeps them in check,” he said over a photo of Donald Trump next to Jared Kushner. “Because no father-in-law wants to act the fool in front of the man who’s banging his daughter, you know?” The fact that Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert is scary, Noah acknowledged, but there’s no reason to panic. “Yes, the threat of nuclear annihilation may have increased,” he said. “Yes, we may be on the brink of World War III, and yes, Europe is once again at the mercy of one power-hungry dictator. But on the bright side, when was the last time you thought about Covid?” Coverage of the war in Ukraine has consumed the vast majority of TV news, and “beyond the war, there’s a really interesting thing that I learned”, Noah said. “And that is: a lot of people on TV didn’t expect a war like this to happen in, let’s say, ‘certain neighborhoods’.” Said one CBS correspondent in Kyiv: “This isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan … this is a relatively civilized, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too – city where you wouldn’t expect that or hope that it’s going to happen.” “Wow, that was you choosing your words carefully?” Noah responded. “So what were you going to say if you weren’t choosing your words carefully? ‘I just hope the next time this happens, it happens back in the Middle East where it belongs.’” Racism aside – and that’s a big aside, Noah added – such remarks showed a blatant ignorance of history. “You do realize that until very recently, fighting crazy wars was Europe’s thing,” said Noah. “That was Europe’s entire thing! That’s all of European history!” “No one, not even apparently Putin’s own officials, is watching this horrific war, and the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding right now, and thinking gee, this Putin guy is a genius,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. No one, that is, except for Donald Trump, who doubled down on his praise of Putin’s invasion at this weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). “Yes he’s smart,” he said of Putin. “The Nato nations and indeed the world, as he looks over what’s happening strategically with no repercussions or threats whatsoever, they’re not so smart. They’re looking the opposite of smart.” His remarks make less sense from there and involve Trump musing that Putin thinks “they’re not going to blow us to pieces at least psychologically?” “Nothing is funnier than a person saying ‘you’re not smart’ and then the best way they can come up to describe the opposite of smart are the words ‘opposite of smart’,” said Meyers. “Also, what the hell are you talking about? ‘Blow Putin to pieces psychologically’ – what do you want us to do? Get him high and play Dark Side of the Moon synced up to the Wizard of Oz?” “The Ukrainians are not giving up,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Monday evening. “They’re showing great courage in the shadow of the murderer Vladimir Putin, a man whose list of admirers is now down to Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump.” Trump, Kimmel noted, also said at CPAC that the invasion of Ukraine would not have happened if he was still president. “It would have been so easy for me to stop this travesty from happening. [Putin] understood me, and he understood that I didn’t play games,” he said, and promised that “someday” he’d tell everyone about his conversations with Putin. “What does he think this is, How I Met Your Dictator?” Kimmel quipped. “The idea that Putin understood he doesn’t play games – all Donald Trump does is play games. He hosted a game show! “I don’t know about you,” he added, “but I am not particularly interested in hearing Captain Bonespurs’ thoughts on war when his only military credentials are leading an attack on his own vice-president at the Capitol.”",Arts/Culture,Colbert on Volodymyr Zelenskiy: ‘Is everyone in Ukraine that badass?’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/01/stephen-colbert-zelenskiy-ukraine-late-show-recap
3/2/2022,"Unions have signalled they will campaign on Clive Palmer’s record as a boss in a bid to urge working people not to support the United Australia Party at the election. The Australian Workers Union national secretary, Daniel Walton, said some members’ experience of the mining billionaire was “not a great one”, citing previous legal battles to get “basic entitlements” in the Queensland Nickel liquidation. Guardian Australia understands the Australian Council of Trade Unions, of which Walton is vice-president, and its affiliates commissioned focus groups in an attempt to discover the appeal of minor parties, including the UAP and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation. The research has so far supported the union movement’s view that One Nation is vulnerable to a campaign, noting its record of voting with the Coalition, while voters could be turned off the UAP by attacks directed at Palmer’s record as a boss. In the latest Guardian Essential, Newspoll and Resolve polls the UAP is registering 3 to 4% of the vote, enough to put it in contention for Senate seats, while private polling suggests it is winning double digit support in some parts of Sydney. Walton said: “The lived experience for [some of] our members with Clive Palmer is not a great one. “The guy does not have any interest in working with people in the country. “You only need to have a look at their experience up at the [Queensland] Nickel refinery in Townsville – and having to undertake several years’ worth of legal proceedings just to get their basic entitlements.” Unions’ broader campaigning will focus on the need for a fair pay rise to keep pace with inflation and job security, while minor parties will be targeted in communications direct to members. With 1.8m members in affiliated unions, the ACTU boasts it is the largest social movement in the country. Asked about the campaign against Palmer, Walton confirmed “we will certainly make sure our members hear the story of our members up in north Queensland”. Queensland Nickel was placed into liquidation in 2016, resulting in the redundancy of hundreds of workers and the federal government stepping in to pay $66m in unpaid entitlements to former employees of the Townsville refinery. Liquidators pursued debts of up to $200m through a court case in which, on behalf of creditors they claimed Palmer had acted as a shadow director of Queensland Nickel, transferring tens of millions of dollars from the company’s accounts for his own purposes. Part of Palmer’s defence was that a complex corporate structure effectively allowed him to authorise the payments. In August 2019, in the third week of the trial, the case settled, with Palmer agreeing to pay all outstanding employee entitlements, the majority of unsecured creditors and repaying the $66m to the commonwealth. At the time the liquidators said settlement negotiations began after “the full weight of evidence was laid before the defendants”. Palmer claimed the settlement of the debts had left him “vindicated”. “Today’s settlement confirms the actions against me were nothing more than a witch-hunt designed to smear my good reputation,” he said. Walton said that members had to sign “individual deeds” with non-disclosure clauses to secure their entitlements, which he labelled “ridiculous”. “[It was a case of] ‘don’t bag Clive’ – because it took several years to get their money.” On Tuesday Victoria Trades Hall Council used a report that Clive Palmer had added Hitler’s car to his vintage car collection to satirise his political advertising: Clive Palmer's latest billboard is wild. https://t.co/FIpn4p8H16 pic.twitter.com/ovkne7iSwm Palmer will also be a target of the Greens, who will use his image to illustrate a campaign calling for a billionaires tax and fighting to win the sixth Senate seat in Queensland, which Palmer is contesting for UAP. The campaign features Palmer alongside other richlisters including Gina Rinehart, Gerry Harvey and Andrew Forrest. Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the party was “coming for Clive [Palmer] and in balance of power we’ll make the billionaires pay a billionaires tax”. “Clive Palmer is the best argument for a billionaires tax you could ever have,” he said. “In the Queensland Senate race, it’s a head-to-head contest and a vote for the Greens in Queensland is a vote to stop Clive Palmer getting into the Senate.” The UAP has suggested at the 2022 election it will outspend its $80m campaign in 2019, prompting renewed calls for spending limits. In February 2020 Palmer was charged by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission with alleged criminal breaches of corporations law. The regulator alleges that in August and September 2013 Palmer dishonestly used his position as a director of Mineralogy Pty Ltd to obtain a benefit or advantage for Cosmo Developments Pty Ltd and/or the Palmer United Party by authorising the transfer of $10m, contrary to the purpose for which the funds were being held. They also allege he breached corporate law in 2012 by announcing a takeover of the body corporate ­behind his Sunshine Coast resort but failing to follow through. Palmer has denied his actions were inappropriate and has argued that the charges are a breach of his human rights. Palmer has asked for a declaration from the court that the criminal case against him is an abuse of process and is seeking for the proceedings to be permanently stayed. The matter is back in court on 9 and 10 March.

3/2/2022,"Logan Madeley had never met her two elderly neighbours before. In Lagoon Grass, just outside the north-eastern New South Wales regional centre of Lismore, their home sat 2km away across a series of paddocks and roads. They had no reason to cross paths – that is until a deluge of rain from unprecedented flash flooding turned the paddocks that parted them into a lake more than four metres deep. Late on Monday, Madeley looked across rising waters and saw her neighbours’ house, tin roofed and painted white, “go under”. When Madeley woke up the next morning, she checked the Lismore Community Resilience & Recovery group on Facebook – a habit developed over recent days. There, locals from the flooded region and concerned relatives had been sharing photos and addresses with urgent calls for rescue, and updates of evacuation to safety. “I heard from all the other neighbours on Facebook, but nothing from them,” she says. “And as far as my research on Facebook could find, they hadn’t been contacted in quite a long time. “Their daughter was upset and concerned and I thought, what am I going to do? Sit at home?” So, at 7.30am on Tuesday she “went off in a kayak” to the couple’s home. When Madeley reached their house, she spotted an overturned boat. “I was concerned, and kayaked past their windows,” she says. “I saw their whole life just floating around inside the house.” Madeley yelled out to them, and, relieved, heard them yell back. She kayaked to the back of the house, where she found the woman and man inside a boat. They had been stranded with no food or water. “She asked, where are you from? And I said, I’m from up the road. Well, the river.” Madeley offered them her phone, and dropped off a bag of water, Panadol and non-perishables like Up&Go drinks and cans of spaghetti and beans. “It is about all I can do,” she says. Fifteen minutes later, a motorised tinnie came past. “They were doing a check on them as well.” The tinnie then towed Madeley in her kayak back home.

Lismore resident Andre Gimblett, his wife and two-year-old daughter were among the thousands of Australians forced to evacuate. They are now living with strangers after losing everything they owned to the flood waters on Sunday night. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says the SES has carried out more than 1k flood rescues and has received 6k calls for assistance. 40k are subject to evacuation orders, 300k are affected by evacuation warnings. Natural disaster declarations have been made for 17 LGAs. @abcnews “We left about midnight [Monday], we got a couple of big bags, but we didn’t get everything,” Gimblett says. “It was so quick, I started saying to my wife around 5pm, ‘We need to go, we need to go’, and we only just got out because the water was coming so fast.” The family thought they would have an extra day to evacuate. “They were saying we’ll let you know on Monday when to evacuate, then Sunday night they were driving the SES van around saying, ‘You must evacuate now, leave now, the road out of Lismore will be blocked’.” The Gimbletts, who were renting after moving to the northern rivers 18 months ago, went to a Lismore evacuation centre but strangers opened their home and the three were now staying in the village of Alstonville, 15km east. “It was someone who came around with a note to the evac centre, helping people who were vulnerable,” he says. “Most of the world is full of good people.

3/2/2022,"The national disaster recovery and resilience agency has defended its decision to omit Lismore from its priority areas for flood mitigation funding just three months ago, as the city battles record floods. The local Coalition MP has criticised the omission as “crazy” and said he expected the issue would be resolved for funding applications in future. Round one of the Preparing Australian Communities Program (PACP) was announced in November, offering grants of between $20,000 and $10m for local disaster projects. The National Resilience and Recovery Agency (NRRA) said projects would be selected which would “assess and plan for disaster risk, increase capacity and raise awareness of disaster risk, or that deliver resilient infrastructure.” The funding was “open to all local government areas across Australia” NRRA coordinator-general, Shane Stone said, but the agency identified dozens of “priority” LGAs in areas particularly prone to bushfires, floods or tropical cyclones. These places were automatically granted extra points under the assessment process. Lismore, one of the most flood-prone areas in Australia, was not classed as a priority area. Hundreds of residents were rescued on Monday as flood waters peaked at 14.4 metres, two metres higher than the previous record. Previously, the worst flooding event in the region occurred in February 1954 when flood waters rose to 12.27 metres. Another flood in March 1974 saw the river rise to 12.15 metres. Nationals MP Kevin Hogan, whose electorate of Page covers Lismore, told the ABC in November it was crazy the town was not considered a priority under the flooding program. “It needs to change, and I’ll be doing everything I can to get those LGAs put in,” he said at the time. Hogan said on Tuesday he had been in contact with the NRRA and the issue had been fixed. His office did not respond to requests for further clarification about whether this meant Lismore would be classed as a flood priority area for future funding rounds. The Preparing Australia Program was announced in May 2021, with $600m to be allocated for reducing disaster risk over six years to 2026-27, in response to recommendations of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements. Applications for round one of the PACP only closed in January, and no grants have yet been announced, so it is unclear if Lismore was awarded funding under the program. In response to Guardian Australia’s questions about why Lismore had been left off the initial priority list, and whether it had since been added after community representations, an NRRA spokesperson said the agency was not able to comment on specific applications during the assessment process. Under the PACP, applications are assessed by the NRRA and given a score out of 100 points. Funding guidelines state that LGAs classed as priority areas “will be awarded an additional 20 points” as part of the application process. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NRRA said priority areas were decided based on their exposure and vulnerability to each disaster type, the infrastructure and resources of each community, and the impacts of climate change. The Australian Climate Service, the NRRA itself, and state and territory governments also had input. In December, Stone stressed that applications outside priority LGAs could still be successful in seeking funding. “Projects will be funded based on merit, so a local government area that isn’t listed as a priority location is still eligible to receive a share of the $150m available under this round, if they put forward a strong application that meets all the criteria,” he said at the time. However, the agency admitted there were concerns raised by the Lismore community after its omission from the priority list, and that Stone visited the area with other NRRA representatives in November to meet “a range of stakeholders and residents”. The NRRA said they met the local council and citizens flood group to discuss “ways to support local, state and federal governments to better work together on local projects” and “improving people’s ‘flood literacy’ so they know what to do when a flood threatens.” “As emphasised at the time, applications from all Local Government Areas were welcome under Round One of the Preparing Australian Communities – Local Stream, even if they were not listed as priority areas for funding,” the NRRA spokesperson said on Tuesday. “Once the immediate emergency has passed, [Stone] will visit the parts of Queensland and NSW that have been heavily impacted.” The federal Coalition government has come under fire from Labor in recent months over another disaster preparedness program, the Emergency Response Fund. Labor’s shadow emergency minister, Murray Watt, complained that only a fraction of the fund – originally commenced with a $3.9bn investment – had been spent, while it had earned more than $800m in interest in the four years since it was set up. But federal emergency management minister, Bridget McKenzie, defended the program, saying it was “only to be accessed once all other sources of funding have been exhausted” and stressing the government contributes billions in disaster funding from other sources. The ERF has only $50m of its funding so far, which had been directed to flood mitigation. Another $50m for floods is in the process of being allocated, while a third round of $50m was allocated to the Coastal and Estuarine Risk Mitigation Program two weeks ago.",News/Australia news,Disaster agency defends not listing Lismore as flooding priority area for funding,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/disaster-agency-defends-not-listing-lismore-as-flooding-priority-area-for-funding
3/2/2022,"Labor has questioned whether Peter Dutton’s GoFundMe page in support of flood-affected communities may have breached Queensland fundraising laws, where individuals are required to seek state government approval for any one-off fundraising appeal. Dutton and fellow Liberal MP Luke Howarth sparked an online backlash for setting up GoFundMe pages in the wake of the floods, with criticism the assistance should be provided by the government instead of through community fundraising. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defended Dutton’s fundraising efforts saying he was surprised at the backlash and Dutton was like any MP “doing their job”. But Labor frontbencher Andrew Leigh questioned whether Dutton’s fundraiser may be in breach of Queensland regulations as he highlighted the need for reform of Australia’s “outdated” fundraising laws. According to the Queensland office of fair trading, organisations and individuals can fundraise for a charitable purpose for “one-off charitable appeals” but must apply for a sanction. “If you want to fundraise for a charitable or community purpose on a one-off basis, you need to apply for a ‘sanction’,” the office states. “A sanction is your permit to fundraise. “We must give approval before you can fundraise. It is an offence to fundraise in Queensland without our approval.” The regulation states that a charitable purpose includes the supply of aid and support for someone who is affected by a natural disaster or other emergency. The regulation also applies to internet-based fundraisers. A spokesperson for the office of fair trading said that GoFundMe pages linked to an already registered charity would not require authorisation, nor would a GoFundMe that was clearly set up for someone’s personal benefit and was advertised as such. But in general, authorisation for online appeals is required to try to protect against the proliferation of scam appeals and to ensure funds are used as intended. “Where concerns are raised, the office of fair trading may in the first instance reach out to the promoter of the appeal and provide advice on the requirements of the Act and the process for obtaining an authority to fundraise,” the spokesperson said. A parliamentary inquiry on charity fundraising in the 21st century and the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements recommended a review of Australian fundraising laws, which charities said can hamper their ability to fundraise for natural disaster assistance. Leigh said the example highlighted the fact that regulations governing Australian charities often hamstring fundraising efforts, and that organisations had been “pleading with the Coalition to fix Australia’s outdated fundraising laws”. “A bipartisan Senate report and a royal commission have called for action, yet the Morrison government has failed to act,” Leigh said. “Complying with these laws is costing charities over $1m a month and making it harder for charities to help when natural disasters strike.” The royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements highlighted the proliferation of fundraising through social media and online channels and the “regulatory compliance issues” arising from it. It said this was an issue “particularly for individuals and small organisations which may not be aware that they need to apply for a licence or register”. “There is scope to improve community awareness and education of fundraising requirements and for charities and fundraising platforms to more transparently communicate the limitations on how donated funds can be used,” the report said. Dutton’s office did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After the 2019-2020 black summer bushfires, concerns were raised about the vast number of online fundraising appeals and the potential for scammers to be exploiting fundraisers for personal gain, with more than 500 scams reported to the ACCC. Comedian Celeste Barber’s mammoth $51m Facebook fundraiser also ran into legal problems, when she was unable to distribute funds to anyone other than the NSW Rural Fire Service. The royal commission found that some localised fundraising efforts “appeared to lack an understanding of relevant legal frameworks, best practice on raising funds and limitations on the dispersal of funds”. The commission recommended that fundraising laws be reformed, with the hodge-podge of state regulations replaced with “a single national scheme for the regulation of charitable fundraising”.",News/Australia news,Labor questions whether Peter Dutton’s fundraiser breaches Queensland laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/labor-questions-whether-peter-duttons-fundraiser-breaches-queensland-laws
3/2/2022,"The ABC has awarded its former head of news, Gaven Morris, a contract to advise on the relocation of some staff to Parramatta in Sydney’s west, just weeks after he left the national broadcaster. Morris, the former head of news, analysis and investigations, joined international communications and strategy consultancy Bastion in December as chief executive of Bastion Transform. He left the ABC in the same month. The ABC confirmed it has now contracted Bastion Transform to manage the process of relocating part of its newsroom to Parramatta and was close to identifying a site. At the ABC Morris had been one of the driving forces behind the strategy to relocate staff to more regional areas including shifting 300 employees from its Ultimo headquarters to western Sydney. In June, he described the move as “an exciting future step” that would “deepen engagement with local communities”. Morris’s strategy adviser and project manager, Luke Howlin, who worked on the relocation project, has also left the ABC to work at the consulting firm. Senior ABC staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there was concern about whether outsourcing the job to a former executive without going to tender was necessary and opened the ABC up to accusations of potential conflicts of interest. The ABC has a property department which manages ABC facilities as well as a large technology section that has managed the broadcaster’s transition to digital platforms in all its divisions. “The ABC, like other government agencies, sometimes uses external consultants when appropriate to ensure the success of significant and specialised projects,” an ABC spokesman told the Guardian. “Whenever the ABC uses a consultancy, all policies and guidelines are met. Bastion is among the consultancies the ABC has worked with in the past. “This move will require specialised technological design features to ensure the potential site meets the requirements of our content makers. The planning and successful completion of this move means consultation not only with relevant ABC teams and managers, but also external advice and expertise,” he said. In June last year, the ABC managing director, David Anderson, told staff that the migration was part of its five-year plan to see 75% of content makers work outside the broadcaster’s Sydney CBD office by 2025. Bastion Transform, according to its website “is the disruptor in digital strategy and transformation space. We partner with teams to frame a clear view of their digital horizon and to build a sense of confidence and purpose to reach it.” The Guardian understands it is a recently set up division of the multinational consultancy firm and has just two employees at this time; Morris and Howlin. The ABC spokesman declined to answer questions about the value of the contract and the processes followed to award it. The ABC also did not explain the precise scope of the contract and whether it lacked the expertise internally to implement the move.

3/2/2022,"Covid means Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade will look a little different from usual this year. Instead of heading down Oxford Street, the action will take place in front of a ticketed crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Those of us who can’t make it to the stadium on 5 March can watch the parade live on the ABC, where festivities will be hosted by a lineup that includes national drag treasure Courtney Act. Courtney Act – AKA Shane Jenek – is no stranger to Mardi Gras. This is her fourth time hosting the parade and, after two years of the pandemic, she’s ready to make it a great one. “This year feels like we’re shaking off the cobwebs and remembering how to do it all again,” she tells Guardian Australia. One object that will be indispensable to Act’s Mardi Gras look is a nameless device for sticking crystals on your face – a makeup choice that, “really adds a big bang for its buck,” she says. Here, she tells us about the oomph-adding properties of a little sparkle, as well as the story of some other important personal belongings. A pair of Oprah Winfrey’s shoes. They’re purple and gold Louboutin sandals that I bought from the Oprah gift store in Chicago in 2010. She had a section called “Oprah’s Closet” where she sold her pre-loved clothing, and then all the money went to her school for girls in South Africa. I never went to a recording of the Oprah show – just to the shop to buy these shoes, which I’ve had sitting in my home ever since. I was once a big follower of the “Church of Oprah” but I’ve since gained a slightly more objective view. I think that perhaps the popularisation of the self-esteem movement and the idea that you can be, do and have anything might be tenets of my generation that haven’t always been so constructive. And Oprah really popularised that. But I think that the impact of the show and the way she took her audience on a journey was nonetheless spectacular. I still recognise her cultural significance and importance. It’s a tool from my makeup bag. I don’t know what it’s called but it’s a pen that’s made for picking up Swarovski crystals and gluing them down. It’s actually designed for putting stones on costumes, but I use it on my face and it’s so handy. One end is a dotter that you dip into the glue. The other end is this wax substance that is just sticky enough to pick up the crystal – but not too sticky – so when you put it on your face where you’ve placed the glue, it sticks instantly. Crystals just add so much extra oomph. I only got this tool in the last 12 months and before that, I would always sit there balancing a crystal on my finger, trying to stick it in the right place under my eye with great difficulty. I’d just put a couple on. But now with this tool, I can go ham and stick on hundreds! Well, maybe not hundreds – who has the time? Maybe just for Mardi Gras. When I was 12, I went on a bus tour of south-east Queensland with a theatre company. It was an end of school-year tour where we would perform this loosely educational Christmas-themed production. There were 40 kids in the show and together we would travel all the way from Rockhampton through to Biloela, Emerald, Gladstone and Toowoomba. Back then I basically didn’t understand the concept of belongings and looking after things. And on that trip, I lost everything that I left the house with – my sister’s camera, which she’d kindly let me take, along with all my luggage and everything else. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning From that day forward, I was always known as the kid who lost things. And that reputation followed me around until I was 18 and able to move to Sydney, where I could recreate myself anew. But every now and then someone from Brisbane who remembers me from that time is like “oh, that’s Shane, the kid that loses everything”. Weirdly, it was a horrible burden to carry around because it became like a part of my identity. Moving away from home was very handy when it came to sexuality and gender and all that sort of stuff, because it meant there was no one looking over my shoulder.

3/2/2022,"Everyone has a happy place, and for 10-year-old Craig Williams it’s the creek. But this is no humble trickle of water. The sprawling, overgrown world of the creek is a thrumming mini-society for Craig and his fellow kids, where they establish tribe-like peer groups while finding their individual footholds in the world. That’s the simple premise for Craig of the Creek, a hugely popular Cartoon Network show that might prove just as appealing – and all the more poignant – for adults. The show’s central message is about challenging yourself to push beyond your comfort zone, something that arguably becomes even tougher in adulthood. In the very first episode (Itch to Explore), Craig and his two closest friends set out to penetrate the daunting Poison Ivy Grove in order to put their own mark on Craig’s hand-drawn map of the creek, which doubles as a handed-down history of the local kids’ boldest exploits. Unfolding in brisk 12-minute episodes, the show was created by Matt Burnett and Ben Levin, both former writers for the like-minded Steven Universe. It debuted in 2018 and recently capped its fourth season, with a fifth season and a prequel movie to come. And there’s a spinoff in the works for pre-school audiences, starring Craig’s little sister Jessica. It’s easy to see why the show has struck such a chord: the characters are diverse and highly relatable, earning plenty of laughs as they navigate each new obstacle. The supporting cast starts with Craig’s two best friends. A year younger, Kelsey is a voracious reader whose heroic inner monologues are inspired by her love of fantasy sagas. She totes a sword fashioned from PVC pipe and is fiercely protective of her ever-present budgerigar Mortimor. Meanwhile, JP is a year older than Craig and plays the dreamy oddball to Craig’s inventive tinkerer. JP reliably gets the funniest, sweetest lines in the show, especially during an episode where he convinces himself that he’s an alien (“Jextra Perrestrial”), which would explain his trouble fitting in. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In the same episode, JP’s older sister Laura (voiced by guest-starring comedian Fortune Feimster) is shown to be openly gay. The non-binary character Angel José is also introduced in the third season. But the writing doesn’t make a big deal about it: this is a show that casually foregrounds people of colour, and bakes deeper inclusivity directly into its big-hearted storytelling. There’s also a strong DIY message throughout, not just in Craig’s elaborate contraptions but in its plots – in Vultures Nest, for instance, a local punk band – played by the real-life Washington DC quartet Bad Moves – is forced to find a new practice space due to oversensitive neighbours. That’s just one of many musical highlights on Craig of the Creek. The eccentric rapper Del Tha Funkee Homosapien appears in two episodes in a version of his time-travelling Deltron 3030 guise, and the modern punk icon Jeff Rosenstock contributes both the adrenaline rush of the show’s opening theme and the gentle comedown of its closing. There’s also a full-blown musical episode (In the Key of the Creek), when Craig is stuck inside due to rain. The creek itself is a major character, home to rival factions and the daily mythologising of childhood rites. There’s the girls who pretend to be horses, the tyrannical champion of the Four Square court, the girl who runs the Trading Tree and the little-seen Timekeeper: a band kid who blows her enormous sousaphone at 5pm every day to signal dinnertime for the creek’s far-flung inhabits. The creek stands in for school and often home for these kids, though a few breakout episodes see Craig and his friends dealing with the world at large. When the gang heads to the beach with Craig’s family, Craig’s jokey dad threatens to steals his son’s thunder. And when Craig tries to graduate from the kids’ table at Thanksgiving, he earns Wonder Years-style narration from his future self, played by Keith David. Especially touching is an episode (The Takeout Mission) in which Craig and his friends have to order takeaway all by themselves – and then go retrieve the meal in the pouring rain. Celebrating everyday imagination and spontaneity, Craig of the Creek slots in comfortably alongside current animated shows like Hilda and Bluey. It becomes all the more endearing as one keeps watching, thanks in part to savvy pop-culture references and repeated callbacks to past episodes. The setting may be a fictionalised version of the Baltimore/Washington DC area, but the thickly forested, adventure-rich backdrop could be anywhere. No matter who you are or what you’re going through, escape is always just as close as the creek.

3/2/2022,"Parenting a young adult child and manoeuvring the latest version of the dependence-independence push-pull paradigm is hard enough, but during a pandemic it’s even harder. It’s the toughest parenting I’ve ever had to perform, and that’s saying something. I was a first-time mother at 42, too scared to leave hospital after my son’s birth, and who, when his father left a few months later, descended into a sort of parenting paralysis for over a year. Then I started to write about my son and me. Writing helped. But it was my mother’s parenting me, and her grandparenting my son, that helped the most. My son left home in a blur a week after getting his year 12 results in 2020. In a nifty inversion of the pandemic-fuelled relocation from city to country phenomenon, he fled to the city from our country town 2 hours away. It’s a cliche, but it was a shock. To me and to him. I knew about empty nest syndrome – not a clinical diagnosis apparently but a syndrome – “in which parents experience feelings of sadness and loss when a child leaves home”, but my child’s departure hit me for a six. The Mayo Clinic adds that, “You might also worry about your children’s safety and whether they’ll be able to take care of themselves.” “Mum! Stop calling and texting me all the time! It’s stressing me out.” Stressing him out? He’s only ever in touch when there’s a crisis, and those can range from “Is that black hoodie still at your house?” (your house? That hurts), to “Do I have ambulance cover?” I wake up most mornings awash in images of my son in strife that run like a whirring, spooling Super 8 film in my mind’s eye all day. I find excuses to contact him, knowing that mostly he’ll either ignore these texts – ones thinly disguised as practical questions but requiring immediate action – or respond monosyllabically like an ex-boyfriend. For years the ABC Radio National audience listened to my son grow up from toddler to teenager via autobiographical monologues I presented for Life Matters. But then he asked me not to write about him any more because it was “sooo embarrassing”, and so I stopped. After my sister died I wrote a few pieces of grief-fuelled manic-memoir but stopped that too. Now my son has given me permission to write about him again. When I say permission … “I don’t care. We’ve got different surnames anyway. Do I have any black trousers at your place?” My son deferred his place at uni last year. He and so many other Gen Zs have since spent another year in and out of lockdown and hospitality work, living in share houses, siege-surviving on everything from Uber Eats to drugs delivered straight to your door, thanks very much, via encrypted text messaging. He has just moved into his third share house in 18 months. I help him pack up one place and we borrow the van and move him into his next joint. On a wing and a prayer and a swift scrub of the latest kitchen sink and does he need another mattress? A dining-cum-coffee table? Does he even sleep or dine, let alone drink coffee? My 89-year-old mother has spent the pandemic at home with my late sister’s 12-year-old son, remote learning (hah!). She has reared my nephew since he was a baby. She is holding on to her grandson, to her own life, to me, to my son, for grim death. Once you lose a child, nothing is ever as bad, but everything is worth holding on to. I lost my casual academic job at university at the top of the pandemic and now wrestle with a PhD (what for? Who cares? As if) and a new-ish relationship. I never thought I’d do romantic love again. Who would have thought? He and I started just before lockdown #1 and he became my “intimate partner” before we were even that intimate. I just wish I wasn’t so preoccupied with my son all the time. We used to talk, my son and I. I’d tell him stories at night well into his teens. We’d go for walks and he’d disclose all sorts of things. Sometimes he’d even hold my hand. Today I watch him lurch from day to day, from child to adult. And I watch him fall over. Once very badly. He nearly died. I nearly died watching him nearly die. His body is six foot three, long and slim and sporting a tattoo of something he tells me I would not understand. His face is beautiful. These days his eyes show me little. He has a goatee thing going on and his hair is Kurt Cobain. When I was his age, on the cusp of 20, I was in and out of love. I was living in and out of home. I was dropping in and out of university. I worked as a waitress, was always broke, and every shift at every cafe was an open letter to the Me Too movement. I dreamed of becoming a famous actor. Zoomers like my son have had it uniquely tough during this pandemic-style precariousness. What are my son’s dreams, I wonder? “Uni starts when? What subjects are you doing?” (Like I don’t know already.) “I forget. The timetable online is so confusing I gave up.” “Don’t give up. New people. New things. It’s face-to-face on campus now.” ” Mum, stop! Oh no. Shit.” “What? What’s wrong!” “Now my keyboard’s stuffed.

3/2/2022,"Loveland, by Robert LukinsFiction, Allen & Unwin, $32.99 Loveland is a gripping and masterful novel about two women, decades apart. In the modern time, May escapes an abusive marriage in Brisbane to claim her inheritance: a decaying boathouse on a poisoned lake in Nebraska. In 1956, that house is the home of her grandmother Casey, a prisoner of her own violent husband. It’s unusual to read a novel in which women are abused but not defined by it; it’s refreshing that these women – with their fury, complexity and, in May’s case, wonderful wit – were written by a man. As our critic Beejay Silcox writes in her forthcoming review, Lukins gives them dignity; he “understands that it is not necessary to hurt women to prove how women are hurt”. – Steph Harmon Son of Sin, by Omar SakrFiction, Affirm Press, $29.99 Omar Sakr’s poetry collection the Lost Arabs won him the 2020 Prime Minister’s Literary Award – and his talent as a poet infuses every vivid character and scene in his debut novel. At its core, Son of Sin is a coming-of-age novel about Jamal: a Lebanese-Australian discovering he’s attracted to men, while growing up within the cultural confines of his Muslim community in western Sydney, amid national headlines dominated by racism and a family torn by trauma. Jamal is looking for belonging, first in western Sydney and later in Lebanon, through worlds and relationships drawn from Sakr’s experience, and painted with such warmth, humour and life you can feel them. – Steph HarmonThe Idea of Australia: A search for the soul of a nation, by Julianne SchultzNon-fiction, Allen & Unwin, $34.99 What is the idea of Australia? Do Australians have a collective soul? No small subject, this, but Julianne Schultz traverses far and wide across Australia’s intellectual, cultural and political landscape to tell the story of the nation. Looking both backwards and forth, she delves into the conflicting perspectives that have characterised our national psyche. Are we for a fair go or are we mean and insular? If we continue to tell ourselves lies about our past, can we be optimistic about the future? Beautifully written with a personal touch, it’s a deeply thoughtful and provocative biography of a country. – Lucy Clark The Teeth of a Slow Machine, by Andrew RoffShort stories, Wakefield Press, $29.95 Andrew Roff’s debut collection is lightly interlinked, tapping into the news (from Covid to offshore detention) and unafraid to take risks with voice and form.

There’s a story in code, one inside a video game, a hard-boiled noir about a sinister fried-chicken conglomerate … The Adelaide writer’s day job is as a lawyer, and his work is laced with the obscenities of corporate life, but also with wrenching intimacy: tired people trying to connect and stay afloat. It’s bleak, technological and tender: an Australian George Saunders, maybe. I’m interested to see what he’ll do next. – Imogen Dewey Triple Helix: My donor-conceived story, by Lauren BurnesMemoir, UQP, $32.99 Can you miss someone you’ve never met? In Triple Helix, aeronautical engineer Lauren Burns comprehensively answers this question with a sense of yearning that is beautifully elucidated. Discovering at 21 that she was donor-conceived, Burns’s provenance immediately became a puzzle. Her biological father was known only as C11, and she had no legal right to discovery. Writing with the sensibility of a novelist, Burns embarks on a personal quest to overturn the law which ultimately takes her to the revelation that she is from a well-known Australian family. On the way she explores the idea of connection and belonging at a molecular level, literally. – Lucy Clark Auē, by Becky ManawatuFiction, Scribe, $32.99 The word auē is a Maori verb to cry, howl, groan, wail, bawl and yes, yes, yes, yes and yes, you may do all of these things when reading Becky Manawatu’s incredibly assured debut novel. Small word, big emotions – and the perfect title for a book that deals in deceptively simple narration and oceanic feeling. Set within one family caught in the teeth of intergenerational gang violence, Manawatu elicits compassion from ugly places, and threads through redemptive spiritual beauty, and innocence, too, via alternating voices. Yes it’s not technically an Australian release, but it’s finally coming out here after being a bestseller in New Zealand and winning multiple awards. More are likely to come. – Lucy Clark",Arts/Books,The best Australian books out in March: what we’re reading this month,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/02/the-best-australian-books-out-in-march-what-were-reading-this-month
3/2/2022,"Australian anti-vaxxer groups are awash with conspiracy theories praising Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an attack on the “deep state”, with some followers of the Covid-sceptic movement expressing admiration for Vladimir Putin. Separately, just days after the United Australia party disendorsed a candidate in Melbourne for his pro-Putin views, the party is now facing questions about another candidate apparently defending the Russian president. Sean Ambrose, a UAP Senate candidate for New South Wales, appeared to defend Putin in a tweet on Saturday, in response to another post critical of the Russian leader being a member of the World Economic Forum. The global organisation has been a key focus of online conspiracy theories, particularly those about a supposed “great reset” plot against humanity. “I was initially of the same opinion but let us not forget that he [Putin] expelled the Rothschild Banking families from Russia and is now shutting down the child sex and human trafficking and the U.S. biological weapons facilities in the Ukraine,” Ambrose tweeted. The Poynter Institute has debunked widespread claims on social media regarding US biological weapon facilities operating in Ukraine. The cover image on Ambrose’s Twitter profile carries the slogans “No mandatory vaccinations” and “No vaccine passports”. He tweeted on Sunday that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, “is a stooge for Klaus Schwab”, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. He also wrote “Media telling lies again” when retweeting a post stating that an Australian news story on the invasion had used a fake photograph of an injured Ukrainian. But the woman, Olena Kurilo, was interviewed by the Daily Mail about the attack on her home, and an image of her was widely published. Last week the UAP disendorsed its Macnamara candidate, Jefferson Earl, for his pro-Putin views, with the party leader, Craig Kelly, saying: “It is very important that the entire world is united in condemning Putin’s conduct to the Ukraine.” Kelly and Ambrose were contacted for comment. The UAP did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment. Separately, and speaking generally, academics researching conspiracy movements say the harnessing of the Russian cause by some anti-vaxxer groups is a sign these groups may continue to be active after the Covid pandemic has passed, warning that the malleable belief systems of the anti-lockdown crowds may attach to other anti-government causes in future. “There’s an authoritarian undertone to the organising logic, vocabulary and actions of these protest movements,” said a senior research fellow at Deakin University, Dr Josh Roose. “That won’t go away just because conditions might change.” The messaging app Telegram, which allows users to post content in the equivalent of chatrooms or message boards, is favoured by some far-right and conspiracy groups. Telegram channels previously dedicated to anti-vaxx sentiment or organising anti-vaccine mandate protests have been flooded with content praising the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Video clips are being shared as well as comments from the former US president Donald Trump, who appeared to praise Putin’s actions. Many shared memes or claims from international anti-vaxx channels, spreading baseless claims that Russia’s invasion was variously about attacking US bioweapons facilities in Ukraine, that Putin was fighting the “deep state” or that the US government was secretly promoting the conflict as a “distraction” from domestic political issues. “Is Putin really taking on the deep state to drain the swamp?” asked one Australian anti-lockdown voice on his channel with 67,000 subscribers. Roose, who studies violent extremism and populist leaders, claimed some protesters viewed the issue through the same lens as Trump due to their correlating belief systems – a mistrust of authority, disdain for institutions and criticism of mainstream media. “What struck me is the pivot of message boards into that emphasis on Ukraine, which broadly coincides with Trump calling Putin a genius,” Roose told Guardian Australia. “Also, the agenda that Trump had been laying out in painting the foreign policy community, the career bureaucrats and diplomats, as part of a deep state plot. “They’re taking their lead directly from Trump and his supporters in the US … it’s not at the level of conspiracy, necessarily, because this is what mainstream politicians and news figures are talking about.” Dr Kaz Ross, a researcher studying conspiracy movements, said a distrust of the media was driving the movements. “The deep underlying belief structure of these movements is like Qanon, in that they believe there’s secret stuff going on that we don’t know about and the media is lying to you, so whenever you see a simple explanation for something, that’s not right,” she told Guardian Australia. “So if it looks like Russia is invading because they’re evil bullies, these groups would say, ‘No, look for the counter narrative’… they’d say, ‘We can see through the lies of mainstream media, so whatever they say, we have to say the opposite.’” Countless posts inside the groups poured scorn on media coverage. “It’s hard to know what is happening without an honest and fair media,” one supporter of a large anti-vaccine group posted. Another said: “One way to find the truth is turn on the TV and whatever they report go with the opposite.” That such conspiracy-minded groups transfer their ideology on to news events of the day is not new. But what Ross and Roose noted was the Ukraine invasion was one of the first times the anti-lockdown or Covid-sceptic movement – a broad church variously consisting of anti-vaxxers, sovereign citizens, evangelicals, civil libertarians, members of the far right and anti-government groups – had pivoted strongly to a topic outside of Covid. Roose and Ross said it suggested the groups may have longevity beyond the pandemic. “People think the groups will settle down when Covid returns to normal, but this Putin issue shows the movement still has life in it,” Ross said. “Who knows where it goes? “Some people have made it their identity, they’ve made it their life to be a ‘freedom fighter’.” Roose suggested the groups would be fertile ground for cultivation by far-right populist politicians or movements. “I don’t think they’ll go away,” he said. “There’s a fluidity and diversity of the movement, common emotional and political strands of a deep sense of anxiety about the future. “Some will go back to work after Covid, but there’s that sense of alienation and disenfranchisement. That deep distrust of government, science and politicians doesn’t go away.”",News/Australia news,Australian online anti-vaccine groups switch to Putin praise and Ukraine conspiracies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/australias-anti-vaccine-groups-switch-focus-to-putin-praise-and-ukraine-conspiracies
3/2/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal state executive is trying to negotiate a plan for branch preselections before Friday to avoid federal intervention, which would almost certainly trigger a legal challenge just weeks from the federal election campaign. Some members of the state executive have put forward a proposal to hold so-called fast-tracked plebiscites in all remaining seats where there is a challenger. These include seats held by two ministers – Sussan Ley in Farrer and Alex Hawke in Mitchell – and factional power broker Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. Plebiscites would also be held in Dobell, Warringah, Hughes and Parramatta. The proposal calls for truncated timetables for the branch plebiscites. Instead of in- person meetings, the party would hold online town halls where candidates present to the selectors. This would make it easier for selectors to register so they did not have to attend in person, and slim down the vetting process. The vetting process, done by the nomination review committee, has been a major sticking point in finalising candidates in NSW, amid allegations that prime minister Scott Morrison’s representative on the committee – Hawke – did not make himself available for meetings for nine months. He attended a meeting last week. Ninety per cent of the 28-person state executive would need to agree to the use of special powers to make the three process changes. The actual motion calling for plebiscites amounts to following the process set out in the NSW Liberal party’s constitution and will require only a bare majority to pass. On Tuesday senior members of the party were canvassing support among factional leaders. However, late on Tuesday night another rival proposal involving skipping plebiscites altogether was circulated to the state executive. It proposed a factional carve-up of the winnable seats and appeared to have the backing of several senior Liberals, including Hawke. The deal involves saving the three sitting members and putting the former Young Liberal Alex Dore into the seat of Hughes and Michael Feneley into Dobell. It also involves anointing candidates in a raft of other seats including Greenway and Eden-Monaro. But because it requires use of special powers, it requires 90% support. Some on state state executive said the latest plan was bound to fail, and was actually designed to trigger federal intervention. Morrison had indicated he does not want to lose his two ministers – Ley and Hawke – and the first solution offers them no special treatment. Party insiders said Ley would face an uphill battle to win her preselection in Farrer against Christian Ellis, a member of the hard right and a former staffer for Dominic Perrottet. Hawke’s future would be line-ball, as there had been several recruitment drives to the branches by rival right and centre right factions in Sydney’s north-west. The two proposals are expected to be put to state executive by a so-called “fax ballot” on Wednesday or Thursday. The federal executive is meeting on Friday and has already warned that it would intervene unless the preselection fiasco was resolved. It could either appoint an administrator to the branch or stage a more limited intervention by issuing a detailed instruction to the branch on how preselections were to be conducted. Either option could trigger fresh legal action by members of the state executive, embroiling the party in more controversy. The second option to skip preselections altogether could also trigger action by would be candidates who missed out. There is also some reluctance by the federal executive, which is mainly made up of state presidents and office holders, to intervene in a state branch, further undermining the morale of party members just weeks before an election. One option floated was for the federal executive to stage a very limited intervention to save Ley, Hawke and Zimmerman, which would probably not provoke a legal challenge by those determined to see the new, more democratic process for selecting candidates implemented. Gaining NSW seats may be vital to the Morrison government’s chances of reelection.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberals to consider fresh preselection plan to avoid federal intervention,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/nsw-liberals-to-consider-fresh-preselection-plan-to-avoid-federal-intervention
3/2/2022,"Thomas Tuchel urged reporters to stop asking him questions about the invasion of Ukraine and Roman Abramovich’s plan to pass the stewardship and care of Chelsea to the club’s charitable foundation. Chelsea’s manager was holding a press conference before Wednesday’s FA Cup tie at Luton Town and lost his cool after being pressed one too many times for his thoughts on the war in Ukraine. Tuchel had faced several questions about Abramovich, who announced he was giving up the running of Chelsea after a call in parliament for him to face sanctions, and he snapped after being asked whether he hoped the club’s Russian owner could help to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. “Listen, listen, listen, you have to stop,” Tuchel said. “I am not a politician. You have to stop, honestly. I can only repeat it. And I even feel bad to repeat it because I never experienced war. So even to talk about it I feel bad because I am very privileged. I sit here in peace and I do the best I can, but you have to stop asking me these questions. I have no answers for you.” Tuchel was asked whether he had a message for Chelsea’s fans after Abramovich’s decision to transfer the stewardship of the club to the foundation’s trustees, who are yet to agree to the arrangement. Some trustees have concerns and the Charity Commission has contacted the foundation for more information after a serious incident report was reported to the regulatory body. They are likely to want an impenetrable indemnity policy in place if they are to go ahead with the plan. That would ensure they are not liable for any financial ramifications on their watch. “I am not so sure if I am the person who should give messages to the fans about anything other than sports,” Tuchel said. “We are trying to be calm here, I am calm and we are calm at the centre of a storm or some noise around us which we cannot control and are not responsible for. In the end, it is best to stay calm and focus on what we love and do. This is sports. “I think we have a right to focus on sports, the players have a right to be focused and this is what we can tell the fans. I think this is what the fans saw on Sunday. There is a big situation out there and there was a big commitment still from the players, clubs and fans. I think everyone is aware of more important things and the situation is Ukraine is by far more important. We still arrived with two strong teams to play a fantastic match. We arrived still to entertain the fans with a match of maximum effort and entertainment. I don’t know what we could do different.” Tuchel was reluctant to say whether being owned by Abramovich, who has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned, is a problem for Chelsea. “I have to say that’s a bit too much for me to answer,” the German said. “I’m not aware of any details, and I’m not aware of the whole situation. We all agree there are situations much, much more important than football, this will never change. And situations like war are of course so much more important. But the role from Mr Abramovich is not on me to comment, because I simply don’t know enough about it.”",Sport/Football,‘You have to stop’: Tuchel loses cool over queries on Russia war and Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/thomas-tuchel-loses-cool-questions-russia-war-and-abramovich-chelsea
3/2/2022,"A convicted British money launderer wanted for her role in a £1bn mobile phone tax scam has been arrested by Spanish police after spending almost nine years on the run. Sarah Panitzke, 47, described by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) as one of the UK’s most wanted tax fugitives, was arrested by plainclothes Guardia Civil officers while out walking her dogs on Sunday in the Catalan town of Santa Bárbara. She was part of a 16-strong gang that bought mobile phones abroad without VAT then resold them in the UK. She disappeared in May 2013 while on trial for money laundering offences but was convicted and sentenced in her absence to eight years in prison. Panitzke’s longstanding links with Spain led HMRC to contact the Guardia Civil, who began hunting for her. By 2015, it had tracked her down to the town of Olivella, in the province of Barcelona. Surveillance revealed that Panitzke hardly ever ventured out of her hiding place and was dependent on weekly visits from her husband, who brought her basic supplies. “However during the operation that was due to lead to her arrest, she managed to pick up on the police presence, completely change her appearance, and escape,” the Guardia Civil said in a statement. “From that moment, she became a priority aim for investigators, who gathered and analysed a massive quantity of information about her and kept a permanent watch on her closest contacts. They also found that she had broken off all physical contact with her family in Spain to avoid being detected.” But last month, detectives were alerted to her possible presence in Santa Bárbara, a small town of about 4,000 people in Tarragona province. “At the beginning of last week, we found a woman closely matching the suspect’s physical description who lived in a block of flats on the outskirts of the town,” the statement said. “Mindful of what had happened in 2015, a large team of plainclothes officers was deployed and she was arrested on the morning of 27 February while out walking her pets.” Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, remanded Panitzke in custody pending the extradition process. Tom Dowdall, the National Crime Agency’s international deputy director, said Panitzke’s arrest sent a clear message to other fugitives. He said: “We will not rest until you are captured, no matter how long it takes.” He noted Panitzke had been on the run for almost nine years, saying: “Given the length of time, she might have thought we had stopped searching, but she remained on our radar. “Joint working between UK law enforcement and our partners in Spain led to her being apprehended, and we will now seek her extradition back to the UK to serve her prison sentence.” Simon York, the director of HMRC’s fraud investigation service, said: “Sarah Panitzke was one of Britain’s most wanted tax fugitives. She played a pivotal role in a multimillion-pound VAT fraud and moved millions through offshore bank accounts.”",News/UK news,Woman described as one of UK’s most wanted tax fugitives arrested in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/sarah-panitzke-one-of-uks-most-wanted-tax-fugitives-arrested-in-spain

Additionally we will ensure we are compliant with all relevant sanctions.” Gazprom supplies gas to Centrica, which it then sells to British households. The agreement is understood to account for a fraction of what Centrica supplies to its customers and the gas is not physical gas molecules from Russia. The partnership is not covered by sanctions but Centrica, Britain’s biggest supplier of gas and electricity, has begun talks with Gazprom about unwinding the deal. Shell said on Monday evening that it would withdraw from its own partnership with Gazprom, signalling an exit from assets worth $3bn, including a 27.5% stake in the vast Sakhalin-2 gas project.

3/2/2022,"Here is an utterly bizarre fictionalised biopic of Canadian singing star Céline Dion, whose opening scenes will have audiences screaming and running out of the cinemas the way they were mythically supposed to have done at the Lumière brothers’ first silent movie about the arriving train. Even now, I still can’t believe I have seen it. Valérie Lemercier (from Claire Denis’s Vendredi Soir) directs and stars, playing Aline Dieu – a made-up version of Dion – the youngest of 14 children in Quebec, all the kids kept in line by their formidable working-class mum Sylvette (Danielle Fichaud). Young Aline shows precocious singing talent and her parents send a demo tape to ageing record producer Guy-Claude Kamar (Sylvain Marcel), a version of the real-life René Angélil, who is to become her manager, husband and soulmate as Aline begins her ascent to mega-selling glory, culminating in the Titanic theme My Heart Will Go On and legendary Vegas residencies. Now … you may be wondering: which actor plays Aline as a child? The answer, horrifyingly, is Valérie Lemercier herself! Her face is digitally superimposed on to the body of a girl between 10 and 12, a face first glimpsed impishly peering over the edge of a stage. Why? Why in the name of all that is holy do that? For a terrifying instant, this looks like a biopic of Jimmy Krankie, or a horror film. Lemercier’s weirdly grinning, gurning face superimposed on the child’s head creates an unnatural chill that the film fails to shrug off, even after Aline as an adult is supposed to be glammed up with her teeth fixed. It does at least create a point of interest in what is otherwise a desperately bland TV-style film. But that opening section is the scariest thing since The Omen.

3/2/2022,"From an acerbic novel about queer Māori-Russian-Catalan siblings to a self-published portrait of 100 indigenous women, the books in line for New Zealand’s top literature prizes are some of the most diverse yet, with Māori women represented in every category and emerging authors claiming their seat at the table of established writers. “Within that field of New Zealand writers, there is tremendous diversity of points of view, style and of experience,” said Paula Morris, the spokesperson for the New Zealand Book Awards Trust. “To have both emerging and established writers on our shortlist is a really good sign that we’re not just discarding the old for the new, but we’re not excluding the new because we’re so busy looking after the old and venerable.” The four contenders for the top fiction prize are all first-time nominees in that category, including two Māori authors, one of whom – Rebecca K Reilly – is nominated for her debut novel. Morris cannot remember the last time she saw two Māori writers represented in the top fiction prize. “Perhaps we are seeing a coming-of-age for Māori writers in print.” The shortlist was also striking for the broad range of publishers – from established university presses to tiny independent initiatives, she said. The fiction writers refused to be pinned down by genre, said Rob Kidd, the convener of judges for the fiction prize. “These novels are packed with life in an array of ordinary and extraordinary forms; they all swell with vitality.” “A Good Winter by Gigi Fenster is an unnerving and absorbing reading experience as the darkness gradually closes in. Bryan Walpert’s Entanglement is dazzlingly intelligent and ambitious in scope. Rebecca K Reilly’s Greta & Valdin is gloriously queer, hilarious and relatable, and Kurangaituku by Whiti Hereaka is poetic, intense, clever and richly imagined.” The poetry finalists “have pushed their craft to new limits”, added Saradha Koirala, the category’s convener of judges. “In a time of global instability, Aotearoa poets have reconnected to their sense of self, exploring identity and challenging our collective history.” Established in 1968, the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards are the country’s top literary honours, recognising achievement by New Zealanders in fiction, poetry, illustrated nonfiction and general nonfiction. Only the fiction prize comes with a large cash prize of $60,000. The general nonfiction, poetry and illustrated nonfiction category winners will each receive $10,000. The winners of the four Crystal Arts Trust Best First Book Awards will each receive $2,500. The winner will be announced at an awards ceremony on 11 May, though a decision is yet to be made over whether it will be held in person or online, due to the Omicron outbreak sweeping the country.

3/2/2022,"It’s not the greatest time to be a fan of Everton Football Club. Admittedly, that’s something that could have been said at pretty much any point during the last 9,776 days – the amount of time elapsed since the club lifted their last trophy, less a week to factor in a brief period of contentment following the winning of that 1995 FA Cup – but here we are. Oh the Ev! Oh Joe, Howard, Walter, David, Roberto, Ronald, Sam, Marco, Carlo and Rafa! Those parvenus across the park have just lifted their 16th trophy during your drought! How on earth has it come to this for the School of Science? They just can’t catch a break, is how. On the field, they’re mired in relegation bother, hovering inches above the drop zone, a precarious position where every single point is crucial. That may explain why referee chief Mike Riley has personally apologised to latest boss Frank Lampard for the fiasco last Saturday which saw box-bound Manchester City midfielder Rodri catch the ball, bounce it, cuddle it, spin it on his finger in the Harlem Globetrotter style, and theatrically hold it aloft and address it as Yorick, only for VAR operative Chris Kavanagh to somehow miss the entire performance and wave play on.

Exactly what effect this will have on the Ev is unclear, which is certainly not ideal, but let’s search for the positive: if nothing else, the fact that nobody has a clue what’s going to happen, or what to do next, or how to fix it, means both the on- and off-field operations at the club are in lockstep for once.

3/2/2022,"More than 100 members of staff at the University of Manchester have signed a letter opposing an attempt to force out the director of the Whitworth Art Gallery (WAG), calling it a “grave violation of academic and artistic freedom of expression”. The Guardian reported last week that Alistair Hudson was asked to leave his post by the university over a row regarding a statement of solidarity with Palestine’s “liberation struggle”, which was removed from an exhibition of works by the human rights investigations agency Forensic Architecture. It followed a series of complaints by UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), which advocates for Israeli causes. UKLFI told the Guardian it had “suggested that the university should take appropriate disciplinary action” against Hudson in September. Sources also said the university had explicitly cited Hudson’s response to the fallout from the exhibition as the reason for his alleged ousting. In a statement shared with the Guardian, staff across the university, as well as members of Forensic Architecture, said they were “gravely concerned and outraged at the attempt to force out” Hudson. “We demand that he be reinstated and an apology issued by the UoM to this grave violation of academic and artistic freedom of expression,” they said. The statement said it was “damaging and dangerous” that the university “supported the idea that a statement against Israel’s war crimes against the Palestinian people was an act of antisemitism, and forced its removal. “Forcing out the WAG director six months after the event is therefore not only punitive, but also shows that the UoM will not support and defend its staff when and if under pressure from outside organisations.” The controversy dates from August, when a statement was removed from the exhibition exploring how pollution, chemical attacks and the aftermath of explosions affect marginalised people in places around the world, including Palestine. The letter added: “After demonstrations from staff and students (including over 13,000 letters of support for Forensic Architecture sent to the UoM senior management team) the solidarity statement was reinstated, but a counter-statement was exhibited alongside it.” A protest against the university’s action against Hudson “and their censoring of support for Palestine” took place at Whitworth Hall on Tuesday. About 150 protesters gathered outside the University of Manchester on Tuesday. . The crowd, who chanted “UoM, shame on you,” heard from speakers including Palestinian students, one of who said: “It is extremely sickening to see our voices being censored.” Ekua Bayunu, a local Labour councillor, said: “We will not let [Manchester University] erode the great work being done at the Whitworth Art Gallery to place a creative institution firmly at the centre of communities.” The crowd then marched to vice-chancellor Nancy Rothwell’s office and on to the Whitworth Art Gallery. One banner read: “The purpose of art is the fight for freedom”. In Tuesday’s open letter, university staff demanded “that the UoM reinstate Alistair Hudson and apologise to WAG, the wider UoM staff, and UoM students for this grave violation of the principle of academic and artistic freedom. We also extend our solidarity to the Palestinian people for the right to live with freedom and in dignity.” One of the organisers of the letter told the Guardian it had received “a large endorsement” within days. They called the alleged move to oust Hudson a “chilling precedent” that they said risked damaging the prospects for politically engaged research “and further marginalising Palestinian solidarity in UK universities”. Colleagues, they said, were “also profoundly saddened that the episode threatens to seriously damage the international reputation” of the university. A group of 23 artists – including the Turner prize winners Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo – said they were withdrawing their work from the Manchester leg of a prestigious touring art exhibition in support of Hudson, Palestinians, political freedom and artistic expression. The University of Manchester pointed to a previous statement that said staffing matters “remain strictly internal to the university” and it would not comment on Hudson, whom it described as “our current Whitworth director”. A spokesperson added: “We would, however, like to address the explicit criticism in the coverage that the university has in some way suppressed academic and artistic freedoms, or bowed to external pressures. We refute such claims entirely. Museums and galleries have traditionally been a space of experimentation and challenge and we hope that the Whitworth is a place where we can debate, discuss and disagree well.”",News/Education,Manchester University staff sign letter in support of Whitworth gallery director,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/01/manchester-university-staff-sign-letter-alistair-hudson-whitworth-palestine
3/2/2022,"A Ukrainian campaigner challenged Boris Johnson over the UK’s failure to bring in swift sanctions against Russians resident in London, in an emotional intervention during a press conference in Poland. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, also pressed Johnson over the collective refusal of Nato countries to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Kaleniuk told Johnson, who was giving a press conference in Warsaw on Tuesday after talks with his Polish counterpart, that she was from Kyiv and had passed across the border into Poland in recent days. “Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone,” she said. “What’s the alternative for the no-fly zone? Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of world war three but it’s already started and it’s Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit. “You are talking about more sanctions, prime minister, but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he’s in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London.” Johnson responded: “I just want to say I am acutely conscious there is not enough we can do as the UK government to help in the way that you want. I’ve got to be honest about that. When you talk about the no-fly zone … unfortunately the implication of that is that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, would be engaged in direct combat in Russia. That’s not something we can do.” He said the UK had been among the first to “tighten the economic noose” around Putin’s regime, and “Putin and Putin alone” was responsible for the suffering of the Ukrainian people. Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who recently passed stewardship of Chelsea FC to a charitable foundation, is said to have gone to Belarus to try to help negotiate peace. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, told parliament last Thursday that Abramovich should have sanctions placed on him. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin or that he has done anything to merit sanctions. Johnson is coming under mounting pressure over the UK’s slowness to bring in sanctions against oligarchs close to Putin, with the only asset freezes and travel bans so far brought in targeting Gennady Timchenko, Russia’s sixth richest oligarch, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg. Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP, has listed in parliament 35 Russians who have been suggested by the imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny as possible targets for sanctions. Johnson on Tuesday acknowledged more could be done to tighten sanctions. “There is plainly more to be done on [the payments system] Swift, we can tighten up yet further on Swift, even though it has had a dramatic effect already, I think we do need to go further,” he said. “There’s more to be done on Sberbank, there’s more to be done on the freezing of Russian assets. I think there’s genuine amazement and dismay in Russia about what has happened already but there is more to be done.” There could be more “severing of sporting links” and “cracking down on the billionaires associated with Vladimir Putin,” he added. At a later press conference in Tapa, Estonia, Johnson pressed home the message that Nato is a “defensive alliance” and would not be placing troops into direct conflict with Russian soldiers. “I think for any Nato member to get involved actively in a conflict with Russia is a huge step which is not being actively contemplated by any member,” he said. “We will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine, and our reinforcements are firmly within the borders of Nato members and they are profoundly the right thing to do.” Speaking alongside him, the Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, urged the west to upgrade support for the Baltic states, which she called “the most vulnerable part of Nato”. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, responded by stressing the alliance’s determination to defend its member countries. “There must be no doubt, no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding. Our commitment to article 5 of the Washington treaty is iron-clad. We will protect and defend every inch of Nato territory.” ",News/World news,Ukrainian activist berates Boris Johnson over Russia response,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/01/ukrainian-activist-berates-boris-johnson-over-russia-response
3/2/2022,"Downing Street has criticised a Conservative MP for travelling to Ukraine, despite government guidance warning against anyone visiting the country that is under siege by Vladimir Putin’s troops. Adam Holloway said he was in a town about 80 miles east of the border with Poland and had witnessed queues outside military conscription centres and volunteers packaging up medical kits for Ukrainian soldiers trying to hold off the Russian advance. As he crossed into Ukraine, he described seeing a queue of people trying to flee that stretched for 20 miles, with many of them corralled together and forced to wait for four days in the cold. “The McDonald’s near the border was packed with women and children and a few elderly people,” Holloway said. The Gravesham MP, who is a member of the Commons home affairs select committee and a former soldier, said he believed that unlike in Russia, Ukrainian citizens were offering to join the military voluntarily. Speaking to GB News on Monday night, Holloway said: “I’ve only been on the ground for just over 12 hours but it seems to me that these people here are absolutely determined to fight. “If you look at the moral component of warfare – and as you know I used to be a soldier – that is the decisive thing. “We can’t know what’s going to happen over the next few days and months. But one thing I can absolutely tell you is that these people here – certainly where I am right now and I think right across Ukraine – it does feel to me as if they’re going to fight.” Holloway said that while on his travels he had also run into “Ukraine’s top concert pianist”. He added: “It was fascinating talking to him, because so many people are volunteering for the military that they’re only taking people with actual military experience – there just aren’t enough guns.” Downing Street said it was unaware of Holloway’s trip beforehand. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the advice not to travel to Ukraine “applies to everyone”. Asked if Holloway should return home, the spokesperson said: “He should certainly not travel to Ukraine.” Travel advice issued by the Foreign Office says all British nationals should “leave Ukraine immediately if you judge it is safe to do so”. Those who need assistance are told to contact the government, but the advice said: “British nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances.”",News/World news,Tory MP Adam Holloway rebuked by No 10 over Ukraine trip,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/tory-gravesham-mp-adam-holloway-rebuked-by-downing-street-for-travelling-to-ukraine-russia-putin-invasion
3/2/2022,"Nicola Benedetti, the award-winning Scottish violinist, is to take over as director of the Edinburgh international festival, becoming the first woman to run the event. Benedetti, a Grammy and Brit awards winner, is also the first Scot to direct the festival since its foundation in 1947, adding to the dramatic impact her appointment is likely to have on the event’s wider popularity and fame. In a brief statement, Benedetti said: “I am deeply honoured to contribute to the long and rich history of the Edinburgh international festival and the cultural landscape of Scotland. This festival was founded on principles of reconciliation and the ideals of art transcending political and cultural fracture.” She will succeed Fergus Linehan, an Irish arts administrator who staged his first festival in 2015, in October. At 34, she is also one of the festival’s youngest directors. Its third director, Robert Ponsonby, was 30 when he took control in 1954. Benedetti has been appointed as the festival prepares to celebrate its 75th anniversary this year. Linehan, who will announce August’s festival programme this month, has previously said he wants the event to be a “huge civic moment from celebration to requiem” after the Covid crisis. On Monday evening, the festival announced that Valery Gergiev, the Russian conductor who is a close friend and ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had stepped down as its honorary president. The EIF said it had asked him to resign. “Edinburgh is twinned with the city of Kyiv and this action is being taken in sympathy with, and support of, its citizens,” it said. In 2020, the festival was in effect cancelled for the first time in its history, producing a handful of online-only events; last year, there were a reduced number of in-person events, with much smaller audiences, but with heavy investment in digital streaming of its productions. Unlike her immediate predecessors, Benedetti has no experience running large arts festivals but has built up a significant reputation as an arts educator and ambassador for classical music, particularly with younger musicians and schools. She won BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2004. A champion of modern compositions, the soloist became the youngest recipient of the Queen’s medal for music in 2017 and formed the Benedetti Baroque Orchestra in 2020. Her violin concerto to a score by the jazz trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis also won a Grammy that year. In a speech to the Royal Philharmonic Society in 2019, Benedetti said music “is the art of all the things we can’t see or touch. [It] brings millions together through the basic act of listening and thousands together through the act of making melody, rhythm and harmony in the practice and service of collective expression”. Keith Skeoch, an investment banker who chairs the festival’s board of trustees, said: “In many ways she reflects the spirit of this festival. Internationally recognised and respected but Scottish to her core, she’s dedicated to advocating world-class music making and innovating new ways to bring it to audiences.” Founded to revitalise European classic music in the aftermath of the second world war, the Edinburgh international festival has sought to increase its artistic and cultural diversity under Linehan and his Australian predecessor, Sir Jonathan Mills. Its current board, appointed in 2019, is the first in the event’s history to have a female majority membership and greater ethnic diversity, signalling its intentions to become more representative and, by appointing members with expertise in digital arts, broaden its output. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said: “I welcome Nicola Benedetti’s appointment as director – especially as she becomes the first woman to ever hold the role. Her experience in promoting Scotland’s cultural scene to audiences around the world will be invaluable and I wish her every success.” Jude Kelly, founder of gender equality charity, the Wow Foundation, and previously the Southbank Centre’s first female artistic director, called Benedetti’s appointment a “huge step”.Until recently, she said, conductors in the classical world “were saying ‘women can’t really conduct’, or ‘they can conduct Mozart but not Beethoven’. So this is one more step that says women can take on these vast and complex leadership positions.”According to Kelly, Benedetti was a “renaissance person. She’s not only a brilliant musician, but she’s also a thought leader committed to creative education. You need that in an artistic leader. Not just somebody who is a fantastic creative person, but somebody who understands policy, and the impact of culture on society.”Jennifer Tuckett, the director of University Women in the Arts, a mentoring organisation to help improve the transition for women from studying to working in the arts, said she was delighted to hear of Benedetti’s appointment.Research by the organisation conducted at the University of Cambridge in 2019 “showed that having women in leadership positions and female role models makes a big difference in terms of what seems possible to the next generation”, she said.",Arts/Music,Nicola Benedetti becomes first woman and first Scot to lead Edinburgh international festival,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/nicola-benedetti-becomes-first-woman-and-first-scot-to-lead-edinburgh-international-festival
3/2/2022,"A British man who made a journey of more than 1,700 miles to be with his wife and two-year-old son in Ukraine has insisted he is not a “superstar dad” – and said he would fight the Russian army “without hesitation”. Ian Umney, 28, has become an online sensation since beginning his trek, with nearly 200,000 people subscribing to his TikTok page where he documented his travels. Umney, from St Helens in Merseyside, was reunited on Tuesday with his wife, Nelia, and their son, whom he asked not to be named, at their home in a city in south-east Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian moments after he arrived, Umney became emotional as he described stepping off the bus outside his apartment block following a 500-mile train journey from Lviv. He said: “I looked up and I saw my mother-in-law waving at me and I waved back. And then as I went to the door of the apartment block, my wife and son opened the door. And my son put his arms out to me, and gave me a hug. Yeah, there were a few tears. And that felt amazing.” Umney, who has lived in Ukraine for six years, was in Britain for work when the Russian army invaded five days ago, leaving Nelia and their son at home in a city near the Russian border. He said he had not seen his wife and son for nearly a month after they returned to Ukraine after a short stay in Britain on tourist visas for Christmas. Umney said he was woken by his wife in a tearful phone call on Thursday to tell him that Vladimir Putin had sent in Russian troops. Having being talked out of driving to Ukraine from Merseyside, Umney instead flew from Manchester to Kraków, in Poland, on Sunday, documenting his voyage on TikTok, where his updates have received millions of views. He told the Guardian the journey was “filled worry and angst” and that he had been stopped and questioned by armed soldiers, including outside his home where the Ukrainian military asked to see his documentation. “It’s all been worth it now I’ve given my wife and son a hug and they are a bit relieved that I’m here.” He added: “I’m quite shocked that so many people are supporting me, calling me a hero, a superstar dad and a brave person. I’m not. I’m just Ian from England and my wife and son are away and I have to be with them.” Umney said his first priority was to bombproof their home and tape up their windows. They had planned to travel to the Polish border and then back to the UK but he said he would almost certainly be conscripted into the Ukrainian army. His second option, he said, was to “defend the city, and if I need to I will defend Kharkiv and Kyiv. I will do that without hesitation.” Previously a teacher, Umney said he had no military experience and had only ever fired airsoft or BB guns. However, he said he would be prepared to pick up a weapon to fight Russian shoulders. He said: “I’ve got no military experience. Nobody here does. They’re all civilians who are taking up arms. So I’m no different to them. They’re just Ukrainians. I’m just married to one. My heart is here. My blood is half here – my son. I have no second thoughts about picking up a weapon. “I don’t have experience but I’ve got some knowledge. And I just have the heart and determination to defend Ukraine. So I will fight alongside the Ukrainians just as they would with me.”",News/World news,"Merseyside man travels 1,700 miles to be reunited with son and wife in Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/merseyside-man-travels-1300-miles-to-be-reunited-with-son-and-wife-in-ukraine
3/2/2022,"Say what you like about Vladimir Putin; he may be slaughtering innocent Ukrainians, but, on the plus side, he has never once called the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson a racist. Last Tuesday, Carlson, who is reportedly paid $10m (£7.5m) a year for his piercing insights and analysis, told Americans that they had been brainwashed into thinking Putin was a baddie. Think critically, Carlson instructed his depressingly large audience. Ask yourself this, he posited: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? … Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? These are fair questions – and the answer to all of them is no.” To be clear: these are inane questions and the answer to all of them is: “Turn off Fox News before the rest of your brain turns to mush.” Carlson, it should be said, has significantly toned down the pro-Putin rhetoric in the past few days. What is noteworthy, however, is the fact that Carlson is far from the only person on the US right to have a soft spot for old Vlad. While Donald Trump has called the Russian attack on Ukraine “appalling”, he has also called Putin’s actions “genius”, “savvy” and “smart”. While I haven’t called up every white nationalist group in the US and Europe for comment, it is fair to say the Russian premier has a fervent fanbase among the far right in the west. Why is this? They love what he has done with Russia. They love the way he has dismantled women’s rights. They love his attacks on gay and transgender people. They love his dismissal of western liberalism. Their values align perfectly. There is also a whiff of antisemitism in the right’s support for Putin. On Sunday, for example, Wendy Rogers, a Republican state senator in Arizona, tweeted about the Ukrainian president: “[Volodymyr] Zelensky is a globalist puppet for Soros and the Clintons.” “Globalist” and “Soros” are well-established dog whistles, of course. (Zelenskiy is Jewish.) Rogers’ comments on Zelenskiy came shortly after she attended a white nationalist convention in Florida, where she praised Nick Fuentes, its Holocaust-revisionist organiser, and proposed hanging “traitors” from “a newly built set of gallows”. A very normal thing for a politician to say! Fuentes, meanwhile, urged the crowd to applaud Russia and had them chanting: “Putin! Putin!” It is not just the racism, homophobia and misogyny that the right love about Putin: it is also his muscle. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll from January found that 62% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents reckon Putin is a “stronger leader” than Joe Biden; that number rises to 71% among those who name Fox News as their primary source of cable news. Putin’s bare-chested photoshoots have done their job, eh? While I have absolutely nothing good to say about Putin (or his biceps), we should condemn him without lapsing into simplistic narratives of good versus evil. The right may be full of unthinking Putin fanboys, but there are also a number of liberals who seem to think that Putin is uniquely bad. They are quick to rationalise invasions and occupations when a western country or a western ally is the aggressor. Many liberals care deeply about Ukrainians, as we all should, but aren’t quite so bothered about Yemenis, Syrians or Palestinians. The west should condemn Putin – but it could also do with thinking more deeply about its own actions.

3/2/2022,"The Nevada governor and his wife were accosted and chased from a restaurant in Las Vegas on Sunday, as two men, one a rightwing “digital creator”, shouted profanities and threats. In a statement, Steve Sisolak said the men shouted “racist threats” at his wife, Kathy Sisolak, who is of Chinese heritage. The Sisolaks planned to meet their daughter at the restaurant. They were not accompanied by security guards. Cellphone video posted to social media showed a man in a red T-shirt reading “Cannabis and Combat” asking Sisolak for a picture. While posing with his arm around the governor, the man began to insult him. The man was identified by news outlets as Justin Andersch, a “digital creator” who posts anti-government rightwing conspiracy theories on a blog called Cannabis and Combat. The Las Vegas Sun reported that Andersch took credit for accosting the Sisolaks on a podcast he creates. “Where’s your security at, punk, huh?” Andersch was heard to say in the video, pointing his cellphone at Steve Sisolak’s face. The governor turned to leave. As Kathy Sisolak joined him, Andersch followed, saying: “You working-for-China piece of shit.” Several suspected hate crimes have recently been reported in Las Vegas and Nevada. Last August, an elected official in rural Nye county declared, without evidence, that Kathy Sisolak had family members in China profiting from selling items related to the coronavirus pandemic. Sisolak said then: “Kathy and I, along with so many others, have worked hard to fight back against the anti-Asian racism brought on by misinformation regarding Covid-19, but comments like these only take us backward.” On Sunday, a second man also followed Sisolak and his wife out of the restaurant, shouting that the governor deserved to be hanged. “We should string you up by a lamp post right now,” Andersch said. “You’re running into a patriot now.” In the parking lot, Sisolak’s daughter, Ashley Sisolak, a lawyer and public defender, rushed over to her parents. “Because your daughter’s with you, I’m going to leave you alone now,” Andersch said. Nevada police confirmed they were aware of the incident at the restaurant and were investigating. In a statement, Sisolak said: “We can disagree about the issues but the personal attacks and threats are unwarranted, unwelcome and unbecoming behavior for Nevadans.” Siolak’s press aide, Meghin Delaney, said the governor was “deeply disappointed in how this incident unfolded, particularly with the language used to talk about First Lady Kathy Sisolak’s heritage”.",News/US news,Nevada governor and his wife accosted at restaurant by men shouting ‘racist threats’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/nevada-governor-steve-sisolak-restaurant-video

3/2/2022,"Manchester United’s net debt stood at £494.8m on 31 December 2021, up from £455.5m at the end of the previous year, according to the club’s latest accounts. The report, published on Tuesday, shows that a sizeable proportion of the debt increase derived from a fall in broadcasting revenues – £22.3m (20.5%) less was earned in the last quarter than in the equivalent period of 2020-21 – because four fewer games were played. There was also a £2.6m decrease in sponsorship money after the end of the club’s training kit contract, though there was revenue growth of 7.3%. The scale of the debt is regularly raised by fans opposed to the owners, the Glazer family, who undertook a debt-loading takeover in 2005. Speaking to the club’s Fans’ Forum, the football director, John Murtough, claimed United had the “right structures” for the men’s and women’s teams to win trophies. Murtough’s comments come despite the men’s team being in flux with an interim manager in Ralf Rangnick and a 19-point gap to the Premier League leaders, Manchester City. United last won the league nine years ago. “Overall, while there is potential for further improvement and progress, we do feel that we now have the right structures in place across our men’s, women’s and academy teams to support long-term success and we will continue working relentlessly and investing to achieve that,” Murtough said. “We know that consistency is key as we strive for a top-four finish this season. I want to reiterate however that this is not the ultimate objective for Manchester United, and everyone at the club is focused on challenging for the top trophies. “We are now conducting a thorough process for the appointment of a new permanent manager who will take charge this summer, with the objective to get us back to challenging for those domestic and European titles. We are in the process of recruiting for a head of women’s football, emphasising our commitment to our women’s team operations and the women’s game as a whole.

3/2/2022,"The UK government has said Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to suspend exports to Russia will help to isolate the country’s economy, after Britain’s largest carmaker said it would pause deliveries. JLR is owned by India’s Tata but builds most of its cars in the UK. It said on Monday night it would pause deliveries to Russia because of “trading challenges” related to the “current global context”, without mentioning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine explicitly. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said JLR was one of “a rapidly growing number of companies and governments joining the whole international community in isolating Russia, both diplomatically and financially”, in a Twitter post on Tuesday. I welcome Jaguar Land Rover's decision to pause the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market.There is now a rapidly growing number of companies and governments joining the whole international community in isolating Russia, both diplomatically and financially. Carmakers – along with companies across almost every industry – are scrambling to assess their exposure to Russia as the US, EU and UK work together to cut it off from the global economy via sanctions. While the movement of non-military cars or parts has not been blocked, several Russian banks are subject to blocking sanctions which could complicate cross-border trade. The conflict has added yet another difficulty for the global car industry, which has been crippled by disruption over the last two years – to the point that JLR was forced to fly in crucial key fobs in suitcases at the start of pandemic. Production has been held back most notably in recent months by shortages of semiconductor computer chips. Japanese carmaker Toyota suffered a different problem this week, when its production across Japan was halted owing to an alleged cyberattack on a supplier to all of its factories. Toyota is a leader in lean manufacturing to cut costs, meaning it does not have stockpiles of components to fall back on. The supplier, Kojima Industries, said on Tuesday it had found an undisclosed threatening message written in English on one of its systems, Reuters reported. Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, had said on Monday that the government would investigate whether Russia was involved. The Russia conflict has already had serious knock-on effects for carmakers. Germany’s Volkswagen has had to pause production at two German plants for days this week because of shortages of components from Ukraine, while its Skoda brand has also had to limit production for the same reason. Russia is a relatively minor market for UK car plants, whose exports are predominantly aimed at EU countries. It is thought that the UK exports fewer than 10,000 cars a year to Russia out of an annual production on 860,000 in 2021. However, there are Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce showrooms in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as dealers stocking cars from BMW-owned Mini. A JLR spokesman said: “Jaguar Land Rover’s first priority is the wellbeing of our entire workforce and their families, as well as those within our extended network. The current global context also presents us with trading challenges so we are pausing the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market and continually monitoring the situation on behalf of our global customer base.” Other UK factories have so far been less affected.

3/2/2022,"Jürgen Klopp believes that talk of Liverpool winning the quadruple is crazy, with the manager citing how even Manchester City have not been able to achieve it. Klopp’s team beat Chelsea 11-10 on penalties at Wembley on Sunday to claim the Carabao Cup. With Liverpool six points behind City in the league and still in the FA Cup – Norwich are their visitors for Wednesday’s fifth-round tie – and Champions League, the manager was asked about Liverpool achieving an unprecedented clean sweep of trophies. “No team in the history of English football ever won the quadruple, right? Because it’s really difficult,” Klopp said. “We are not even close to thinking about crazy stuff like that. We have won the Carabao Cup, we are behind City in the league and now we have Norwich in the FA Cup after 120 minutes on Sunday. Even Manchester City with all their quality did not win it. The reality is [that] to win something you have to be focused on the next step and the one after that – that’s what we do. “I don’t see it as a compliment [if people think they can] but it’s better people think we can do good things rather than be useless. I don’t need this kind of compliment – we are close to nothing at the moment. We face a lot of good teams between now and the end of May. The smallest problem I have right now is thinking they [players] could fly.” Klopp said Thiago Alcântara, who was forced out of the final with a hamstring problem, could be available against West Ham on Saturday or Internazionale next Tuesday.",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp plays down talk of Liverpool winning ‘crazy’ quadruple,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/jurgen-klopp-plays-down-talk-of-liverpool-winning-crazy-quadruple
3/2/2022,"For centuries, organists have almost all been male, and the magnificent instruments from which rich and vibrant sound emerges have reflected that. Now a campaign has been launched for adjustable organ benches to be installed to help the growing number of female organists to reach the instrument’s pedals without risking back pain or even toppling forwards. The Society of Women Organists (SWO) says adjustable benches would increase opportunities for women and young people to play. Two-thirds of almost 500 respondents to a recent SWO survey said they did not have an adjustable bench at their usual venue, and almost half said the lack of one had affected their performance. One said: “Benches and the organs themselves being so big make me feel inadequate or not the right sort of person to play the organ sometimes.” Another said organ-playing frequently resulted in backache. Cathedrals and larger churches usually have fully adjustable benches, according to the SWO. But many smaller churches – where female organists are more likely to be found – have a fixed-height bench that is suitable for the average man but too high for the average woman. The average male height in the UK is 5ft 9in, and the average female height is 5ft 3in. Men make up 90% of permanent directors of music and organists in English and Welsh cathedrals. Marion Lees McPherson (5ft 3in), of the Edinburgh Society of Organists, said the lack of adjustable benches had put her off learning the organ as a teenager. She later returned to the instrument, which she has now been playing for 35 years. “The organ world has always been male-dominated and stuck in its ways,” she said. “You have to use your feet when you play, so it’s a huge problem – and especially difficult if you’re asked to play at a wedding or funeral or concert at an unfamiliar venue. “You have to balance on the edge of the bench, and hold on with your core strength to stop you falling flat on the keys. High heels can help. It’s always been something we’ve had to put up with, but we’re hoping to get people to speak out, to say this is unsatisfactory.” Sir Andrew Parmley, the director of the Royal College of Organists, gave his “hearty support” to the campaign, saying it aimed to “ensure equal access to the organ irrespective of a person’s height”. Katelyn Emerson, an international concert organist, said the campaign could “help the organ to become more accessible to and help prevent injuries in players of all heights”. The SWO, which was set up in 2019 and now has 204 members, said fully adjustable benches cost about £1,800 but cheaper solutions were available.",Arts/Music,Bench campaign aims to bring organ-playing within reach of more women,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/bench-campaign-aims-to-bring-organ-playing-within-reach-of-more-women
3/2/2022,"A planned response to Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night by Rashida Tlaib, a progressive Democrat from Michigan, highlighted a rift in the party. The president will speak to Congress and the nation from the Capitol. The Republican rebuttal will be delivered by Kim Reynolds, governor of Iowa. Tlaib will also respond, for the Working Families party. It will not be the only Democratic response: Collin Alred of Texas will speak for the Congressional Black Caucus. One moderate Democrat, Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, said Tlaib’s decision to speak was “like keying your own car and slashing your own tires”. Tlaib said: “Despite some sensational coverage, it’s simple: I’m giving a speech about supporting President Biden and his Build Back Better agenda for the people.” Build Back Better, valued at $1.75tn and meant to improve health and social care and address the climate crisis, passed the House with moderate support. But it stalled in the Senate, opposed by Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Biden’s State of the Union address will be overshadowed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But he is expected to reframe his domestic ambitions. Tlaib will highlight the cost of not passing Build Back Better. The Working Families party was formed in 1998 by unions and other groups. It aims to “build our own party on top of the two-party system in the United States”, sometimes running candidates in Democratic primaries, seeking to build “the multiracial movement we need to win the America we deserve”. On Monday, Maurice Mitchell, the party’s national director, said: “Obstructionist Republicans and a handful of corporate Democrats have ground Washington to a standstill while child poverty spikes and costs continue to rise for housing, healthcare and childcare. “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Gottheimer played a prominent role in negotiations over Build Back Better and Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure plan, which passed with Republican support. He is scheduled to participate in his own event after the State of the Union, a “Problem Solvers Perspective” streamed on Facebook by No Labels, a group founded in 2010 to provide “a rebellious but constructive third force in American government”, aiming to “break the gridlock and dysfunction that is destroying our democracy”. Gottheimer told Axios Tlaib’s speech would be “massively counterproductive”. He added: “This only highlights the real tension between the socialist far left and the common-sense moderate wing, which is focused on crime, costs, tax cuts and affordability and turning the page on Covid.” Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said it was “astonishing” that the “radical left continues to promote a Democratic death wish, and sees no problem relegating our party to the permanent minority”. Tlaib said Americans should “look past the headlines and hear progressives’ vision for working with the president and Congress to deliver for our residents”. Biden will deliver his first State of the Union with his approval rating at new lows and with Republicans favoured to re-take the House in November.",News/US news,‘Keying your own car’: Democrat hits out at Tlaib for State of the Union response,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/rashida-tlaib-biden-state-union-response-democrats-gottheimer
3/2/2022,"Inflation in the US reached its highest level in 40 years in January, with prices rising 7.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

3/2/2022,"A man shot and killed his three daughters and a chaperone before turning the gun on himself at a church in the Sacramento, California, suburbs on Monday, authorities said. Deputies had been called to the church in the Arden-Arcade neighborhood of Sacramento on Monday evening after a church employee heard gunshots and called 911, said Sgt Rod Grassmann with the Sacramento county sheriff’s office. The deputies found five people dead, Grassmann said, including the gunman and three girls ages nine, 10 and 13. . The shooting had occurred in the main sanctuary area, he said. Later on Monday evening, the Sacramento county sheriff, Scott Jones, said investigators believe that the shooter had been estranged from the children’s mother, who had a restraining order against him. Investigators believe the shooting happened during a supervised visit with the children, Jones added. The fourth victim, an adult, was the chaperone. The shooter’s identity wasn’t immediately released. Officials didn’t know if the family members belonged to the church, which sits on a mostly residential block near a commercial area east of downtown Sacramento. It wasn’t immediately known how many people were at the church or if there were any services or activities at the time of the shooting. Another senseless act of gun violence in America - this time in our backyard. In a church with kids inside. Absolutely devastating.Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and their communities.We are working closely with local law enforcement. “This is an unspeakable tragedy,” said Darrell Steinberg, the Sacramento mayor. “It happens too often, and tonight it happened in our backyard.”",News/US news,Sacramento church shooting: three children among five dead,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/sacramento-church-shooting-children-among-dead
