3/3/2022,"On Thursday the Marine Corps launched its first ever Marine littoral regiment ― a new unit that already may have the U.S.’s near-peer militaries worried. “Adversaries do not like this concept at all,” Gen. Eric Smith, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told reporters at a briefing on Monday. “They don’t like the fact that units are highly mobile, that they have a low signature, and that the adversary doesn’t know where these things are.” The new 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment will be headquartered out of Marine Corps Base Hawaii and is based around the current 3rd Marine Regiment. Designed based on potentially thousands of hours of war games, the new unit is set to the be the flagship formation seeing the Corps enter the post Global War on Terror era. Standup of Marine littoral regiment will usher new gear into Pacific theater But not everyone is sold on the new concept or buys the Marine Corps’ total confidence of the fear these units may strike in potential enemies. “It was as if they had entered the mind of our opponents,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and current senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Marine Corps Times. “I think it would be more accurate to say, ‘In our war games the Chinese player finds it very difficult to track down these platoons,” Cancian said. The new littoral regiment will be made up of three elements: a littoral combat team ― consisting of one infantry battalion and one missile battery potentially capable of sinking ships, a littoral anti-air battalion and a combat logistics battalion. The littoral combat team will be capable of deploying in plus-sized platoon elements ranging from 75 to more than 100 Marines depending on the mission, Smith told reporters. The Marine Corps envisions using those teams to create and occupy expeditionary advanced bases widely dispersed across the littorals of any future fight. Those Marines will be able to launch cyberattacks, spot targets and possibly even sink or destroy large enemy ships. Despite the firepower, the Corps hopes the small size and the dispersed nature of the unit will keep it undetected from enemy sensors for an extended period of time, while the unit’s mobility will allow it to run away unscathed once the enemy does stumble upon it. Eventually the Corps will have three littoral regiments, all stationed within III Marine Expeditionary Force, Smith said on Monday. The Marine Corps has been experimenting with the formations and tactics the regiment will implore since the 2020 release of Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger’s Force Design 2030. Smith said it was those tests that have shown how worried the enemy is about the new Marine Corps formation. “We’re talking about an organization of 75 Marines … that are inherently mobile and have capabilities to shut down a network to strike an enemy capital warship and then fade away and move again,” Smith said. “Adversaries hate that because they don’t have effective control over the adversary’s plan.” Smith said he could not give details on how that information was gathered or assessed because it was classified. The Marine Corps’ hesitancy to publicly provide data about Force Design 2030 tests has caused some to be skeptical of the Corps’ assertion that potential adversaries are shaking in their boots. “The Marine Corps states that the war games support their concept and maybe they do, but it is not evident,” Cancian said. But not all are as pessimistic. Dakota Wood, a retired Marine and current senior research fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, told Marine Corps Times, “It’s not 100% guaranteed, but I think there’s been a lot of intellectual effort put into it.” “I think these newly derived solutions will be applicable against a range of tactical scenarios,” Wood said. Cancian agrees that the Marine Corps needs to modernize and shift its focus toward near-peer threats like China. But the retired Marine pointed out that this was the first major introduction in Marine Corps war fighting concepts during peace since helicopters were introduced between World War II and the Korean War. While the Corps has gone through significant changes since the late 1940s, most of those changes came out of weaknesses exposed on battlefields and almost immediately were tested in the fires of war. By contrast, Force Design 2030 has been developed and tested through simulations and field exercises that allow the Marine Corps to make its own assumptions about the enemy’s capabilities. “It’s very good that the Marine Corps is conducting them,” Cancian said. “It’s all very sensible, but nobody on the outside has any visibility into them.” Wood acknowledged it is possible for confirmation bias to make its way into the Marine Corps analysis process. He noted that it is important for the Marine Corps and outside observers to constantly question these studies and experiments to ensure they hold up. But from his vantage point, the Marine Corps seems to be heading in the right direction. Though he did not provide many details, Smith said the Corps is constantly listening to small unit leaders running Marines through these exercises to figure out what is working and what is not. “We are constantly adjusting the exact size of an infantry battalion, the exact number of missiles a unit needs to carry so that it matches our logistics capability, the exact signature that they will put out,” Smith said. “Those things are constantly in motion, but our cardinal direction has not changed at all and every piece of analysis that we have comes back and says, ‘The adversaries do not like what you’re doing at all,’” Smith said.",U.S./Defense News,Marine Corps launches new littoral unit that US adversaries reportedly hate,https://news.yahoo.com/marine-corps-launches-littoral-unit-233325024.html
3/3/2022,"A Russian businessman has placed a $1m bounty on Vladimir Putin’s head and urged the country’s military officers to bring the president to justice. Entrepreneur Alex Konanykhin made the promise in a post on social media site LinkedIn and called it his “moral duty” to take action and help Ukraine following the unprovoked attack. “I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws,” wrote Mr Konanykhin. “Putin is not the Russian president as he came to power as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents.” His post included a photo of Mr Putin, with the caption, “Wanted: Dead or alive. Vladimir Putin for mass murder.” And he added: “As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia. I will continue my assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin’s Orda.” The word “Orda” is Russian for “horde.” Mr Konanykhin has a complicated history with the Russian government, and in 1996 was arrested while living in the US after Russian authorities claimed he had embezzled $8m from the Russian Exchange Bank. FBI agents testified that the Russian mafia had taken out a contract on Mr Konanykhin, and the case was settled and he was granted political asylum. His asylum was revoked several years later, but his deportation was eventually cancelled by US District Judge T S Ellis, who overruled it, who said that a decision to return him to Moscow “stinks”. Mr Konanykhin’s reference to blowing up buildings relates to a conspiracy theory that the Russian intelligence service, the FSB – which Mr Putin was head of from 1998 to 1999 – was responsible for explosions in four apartment blocks in 1999 which killed about 300 people. The attacks, blamed on Chechen terrorists, helped spark the Second Chechen War, which itself helped consolidate Mr Putin’s popularity in Russia. He became prime minister in 1999 and was named acting president on the last day of the year, subsequently being elected to a full term the following March. The theory was expounded among others by former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was assassinated in London in 2006 – apparently by Russian agents – using the radioactive isotope polonium-210.",World/The Independent,Russian businessman places $1m bounty on Vladimir Putin’s head,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.html
3/3/2022,"Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has responded to calls for his company to freeze the crypto assets of Russians amid its attack on Ukraine. Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov publicly asked all major crypto exchanges to freeze accounts in a bid to further challenge Russia’s resources and stop the war. But the cofounder of one of the most popular crypto trading venues in the U.S. has refused, explaining his position in a Twitter thread. While he has “deep respect” for the people of Ukraine, he said he believes crypto should enforce individualism, rather than nationalistic alliance to a country. “Besides, if we were going to voluntarily freeze financial accounts of residents of countries unjustly attacking and provoking violence around the world, step 1 would be to freeze all U.S. accounts,” Powell wrote on Twitter. “As a practical matter, that’s not really a viable business option for us.” https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1498112746646241281 His comments received widespread support on Reddit’s r/Cryptocurrency forum. “I’m an [sic] Russian and I was really heartbroken when people suggested freezing our Crypto. We never wanted war, Putin is the reason we are suffering,” one user wrote on Reddit. “Down the streets we are also protesting against this invasion.” Powell has said he will only freeze the accounts if he’s legally required to, a possibility he believes could be imminent as Russian attacks continue to intensify. Many Russians have already invested in crypto, and the country ranks 18th globally for adoption.

3/3/2022,"MOSCOW/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has proposed Israeli mediation between Russia and Ukraine, spoke with the leaders of both countries on Wednesday. The first call was with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy said on Twitter they spoke about ""Russian aggression."" The Kremlin later put out a statement that Bennett initiated a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin, the Kremlin said, told Bennett that taking into account Moscow's security interests was among the key conditions for settling the conflict. Israel has good ties with both Moscow and Kyiv. While it voted with a sweeping majority at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to reprimand Russia for invading Ukraine, Bennett's rhetoric has been circumspect. At Kyiv's behest, Bennett offered for Israel to mediate peace talks. He has also voiced solidarity with Ukraine and sent it humanitarian relief. Officials in Bennett's office confirmed the calls but offered no other details. ""The different players want us in a place that we are able to hold a dialogue with everyone,"" Bennett said in an interview aired on Wednesday on Israel's Channel 13. Israel is keen to keep rank with its U.S. ally on the crisis. But it is also mindful of Moscow's military sway in next-door Syria, where Israel regularly strikes Iranian targets. Israeli-Russian contacts prevent them trading fire by accident.
