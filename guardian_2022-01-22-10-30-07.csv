1/22/2022,"William Blake said “Great things are done when Men and Mountains meet”, and the capitalisation seems telling; while there are female mountaineers, there is something hyper-masculine about the idea of conquering mountains. In his classic memoir, Touching the Void, Joe Simpson talks candidly of his addiction to the thrill of mountain climbing, and the strange pull towards danger that comes from “too much testosterone and too little imagination”. The book became famous when it was published in 1988, and then the docudrama that came in 2003 made Simpson and his fellow climber Simon Yates even more famous. Certainly, it was an extraordinary tale of grit and survival; two climbers in impossible danger, a shattered leg, a drop, a body hanging from a rope. That rope became a kind of talismanic representation of human connection, and the decision to cut it – ostensibly sending a fellow climber to his death – chillingly underlined its limits.  A stage adaptation of a story that takes place entirely on the top of a mountain in the Andes begs the question of how, but more important is the question of why. What attracted playwright David Greig to this story, and what did he think a stage version could tell us that hadn’t been told before? It would be informative to ask him, because the play doesn’t provide satisfactory answers. The central alteration Greig makes is the introduction of Joe’s sister Sarah (Lucy Durack), who opens the play with a speech she gives at the pub hosting Joe’s wake. Attending are Joe’s climbing partner Simon (Kevin Hofbauer) and the man who looked after their tents back at base camp, Richard (Karl Richmond). As the three drink and mourn, as Sarah punctures the men’s grandiloquence and reaches for details of her brother’s fate, Joe (Joe Klocek) himself appears like an apparition. The story of the climb and the fall slowly reveals itself, as an adventure story in its own right and as a means of exorcising ghosts. But Greig has a trick up his sleeve. What becomes clear is that Sarah isn’t conjuring Joe; rather Joe, trapped and alone on the mountain, is conjuring Sarah. The wake is a mere hallucination, Joe’s imagined end to a life still hanging literally in the balance, and his sister becomes a phantom guide to get him through. This may have struck the playwright as an ingenious device, a way of taking the book’s relentless interiority and making it external and therefore the stuff of stage drama. But the effect is strangely inert, and intellectually thin. In Simpson’s own version, a voice from within keeps him alive and moving; here it’s his good old sister Sarah, cheering him along like an overzealous life coach. If the playwright thought the introduction of Sarah would help balance the gender disparity at the heart of the story, he needed to give her some inner life. As it stands, and despite Durack’s earthy charm and welcome cynicism, Sarah is merely an adjunct to the men and, as the play progresses, dangerously close to the manic pixie girl trope. Worse, because she accompanies Joe throughout his ordeal, that existential terror of being alone – the void at the centre of the story – fails to register. Director Petra Kalive seems more at home with the play’s lighter moments, its casual humour and breezy banter, than she is with the tilt into awe; she struggles to wrestle the tonal shifts into something cogent and affecting. Andrew Bailey’s monumental set, with its mountain made of strips of metal, is clever and suggestive, and Katie Sfetkidis’s lighting is brilliantly effective. The mountain seems to shift from snow-capped peaks to rocky moraines simply with a change in the light. The cast are admirably physical and committed, even if they never seem particularly stretched (mountain climbing aside). Klocek is a winning Joe, avuncular even when most tortured, and Hofbauer is suitably pained as the climber who carries the guilt. Best of all is Richmond, who brings enormous amounts of charm and depth to a character who could easily become irritating. Why people feel compelled to climb impossible summits for fun is anyone’s guess, but at least Simpson’s own telling grappled meaningfully with the grand questions of life and death. Greig’s version feels depressingly lightweight, glib and avoidant. Perhaps adaptation isn’t for him; he wrote the appalling stage adaptation of Stanislaw Lem’s Solaris for Malthouse Theatre a few years ago. Blake may have been right about great things happening when men and mountain meet, but not in this iteration.",Arts/Culture,Touching the Void review – mountain climbing adaptation fails to reach book’s thrilling heights,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/22/touching-the-void-review-mountain-climbing-adaptation-fails-to-reach-books-thrilling-heights
1/22/2022,"Three Canadian tourists have been shot by a lone gunman in their hotel in the Mexican resort town of Playa del Carmen – the latest attack involving tourists in a region increasingly rife with violence and disputed by drug cartels. One of the tourists died of their injuries while being transported to hospital, according to the Quintana Roo state public security secretary, Lucio Hernández Gutiérrez, who confirmed the nationality of the victims.  Information shared on social media showed a lone attacker dressed in a grey tracksuit and brandishing a pistol on the grounds of the Xcaret hotel on Friday. A video posted on Twitter showed people shrieking as a victim received first aid. The video later panned to show two more victims lying wounded by the pool – one heavily bleeding. “He’s still breathing,” one person could be heard saying amid the chaos. The attacker escaped into the thick tropical vegetation surrounding Xcaret – which is famed for its theme parks on the Riviera Maya – and remains at large. Hernández Gutiérrez said the shooting “stemmed from a discussion between hotel guests”. Global Affairs Canada said in a short statement it is “aware of reports that Canadian citizens have been affected by an incident in Mexico”. The attack at a luxury hotel compound comes amid a string of shootouts on the Yucatan peninsula’s Mayan Riviera, which have killed or injured tourists who were caught in the crossfire. A team of at least 10 gunmen stormed a beach at a luxury hotel near Cancún in November, killing a person linked to a rival faction and dragging away another person trying to hide. A Californian travel blogger and a German tourist were killed in October at a restaurant in Tulum, south of Playa del Carmen, during a shootout between suspected gang members. The region draws in millions of tourists annually – including during the coronavirus pandemic as Mexico has imposed no Covid tests or vaccination requirements for travellers. But many of Mexico’s major drug cartels are disputing the region, where they run extortion rackets and deal drugs to tourists. State officials have blamed the rising violence on disputes over drug dealing – with foreign tourists being the biggest buyers.",News/World news,One Canadian killed after tourists shot at Mexican beach resort hotel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/one-canadian-killed-after-tourists-shot-at-mexican-beach-resort-hotel
