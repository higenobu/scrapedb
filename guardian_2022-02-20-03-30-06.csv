2/20/2022,"Paul Ince has made a shock return to the dugout after agreeing to take interim charge of Reading, the troubled Championship club his son, Tom, joined on loan last month. Ince has not managed since being sacked by Blackpool in January 2014 but will take over from Veljko Paunovic, who took charge of Saturday’s 3-2 win at Preston – their first in 14 matches – while the club search for a new permanent manager. Reading are at risk of relegation to League One, five points and one place above Derby County, who have been administration since September.  Reading finished seventh last season but this campaign has been a different story, with Paunovic overseeing eight defeats after the turn of the year, including an embarrassing FA Cup third-round exit at Kidderminster. Paunovic met Reading’s under-fire chief executive, Dayong Pang, on Friday following a 0-0 draw at fellow strugglers Peterborough in midweek, after which he declined to comment on questions about his future. Players expected Paunovic to be sacked before now but the arrival of the former Manchester United midfielder Ince will inevitably raise eyebrows. In a statement on Saturday evening, Pang said: “The board and I will now work diligently to identify the right candidate to take this club forward. This work will be done quickly but without undue haste as we fully appreciate the importance of our decision to appoint a new manager at this crucial stage of the campaign.” Lucas João struck twice in the opening 19 minutes, with John Swift adding a third early in the second half. Daniel Johnson pulled a goal back for the hosts, with Cameron Archer, on loan from Aston Villa, setting up a tense finale with 15 minutes to go, but the Royals held out. Louie Sibley hit a stoppage-time winner as Derby beat relegation rivals Peterborough 1-0, with both sides finishing with 10 men. Posh defender Hayden Coulson was sent off after picking up two cautions in the space of four minutes just after the half-hour mark. Rams captain Tom Lawrence was dismissed for a foul on Nathan Thompson early in the second half, but Sibley had the final say. Bottom club Barnsley lost 1-0 at Coventry, where Dominic Hyam struck in the third minute of stoppage time. Cardiff and Blackpool drew 1-1. Marvin Ekpiteta headed Blackpool into an 11th minute lead, but Joel Bagan had the home side level soon after the restart. Stoke and Birmingham shared four goals at the bet365 Stadium. Jordan James put the Blues ahead in the 12th minute, with Tyrese Campbell equalising before half-time. Campbell struck again seven minutes into the second half, but Gary Gardner squared things up again on the hour. Ten goals were not enough to separate Wycombe and Cheltenham as they were forced to share the spoils from a frenetic 5-5 draw. Alfie May scored four goals altogether, grabbing his first in the opening three minutes after lobbing goalkeeper David Stockdale. Wycombe then scored three times in eight minutes to take the lead, with Jordan Obita scoring two before Brandon Hanlan added a third. May got his second at the start of the second half with a headed effort and the Robins then levelled through Kion Etete. Two quickfire goals from Sam Vokes within a minute of each other put the Chairboys back in the lead but May added two more to draw 5-5. MK Dons stay third in the table with a 2-1 win against Sunderland. Mo Eisa put the visitors in front but Ross Stewart quickly equalised for the Black Cats, scoring his 19th goal of the season. Former Sunderland striker Connor Wickham found the winner for Dons and Sunderland now drop out of the play-off places into seventh. Oxford put four past struggling Charlton to move up into the play-off places. Matty Taylor scored a brace in the first-half before Sam Baldock and Cameron Brannagan struck in the second half. Sean Clare was shown a straight red card for the Addicks in the 62nd minute for a clash with Taylor. Four was also the magic number for Bolton after goals from Jon Dadi Bodvarsson, Oladapo Afolayan, Dion Charles and Amadou Bakayou saw the Trotters beat Wimbledon 4-0. Sheffield Wednesday came from behind to beat Doncaster 3-1 in a Yorkshire derby. Rovers were awarded a penalty just before half-time and Dan Gardner scored from the spot. Wednesday equalised through Callum Paterson and were awarded a penalty in the 76th minute, but Barry Bannan’s effort was saved. Saido Berahino put the Owls ahead two minutes later and Bannan added a third. Ipswich made it three wins from five games with a 3-0 win against Burton. Kayden Jackson opened the scoring in the first minute before Wes Burns and Bersant Celina both scored in the second half. Plymouth made it four consecutive wins after beating Gillingham 2-0. The Pilgrims opened their account one minute into the second half through Jordan Garrick and Luke Jephcott doubled the lead after scoring from the spot in the 75th minute. Cambridge returned to winning ways with a 2-0 win against Accrington thanks to second-half strikes from Sam Smith and Wes Hoolahan. QPR left it late to draw 1-1 at home against Hull and sit fourth, above Huddersfield – 2-1 victors at Fulham – on goal difference. Marcus Forss, on loan from Brentford, fired the Tigers into the lead in the 26th minute. There was a lengthy delay just after the hour when the Hull goalkeeper Matt Ingram needed treatment following a collision with QPR’s Albert Adomah and eventually was taken off on a stretcher. Ilias Chair then struck from close range with 15 minutes left to secure QPR a point. Sheffield United continued their push up the table after sweeping past Swansea 4-0 at Bramall Lane. Morgan Gibbs-White broke the deadlock in the 14th minute and George Baldock soon added a second before Billy Sharp made it 3-0 shortly before half-time. Gibbs-White bagged his second with 12 minutes left as the Blades moved into the top six. Michael Flynn’s first match in charge of Walsall ended with a surprise 1-0 victory at runaway leaders Forest Green. It brought to an end Rovers’ 20-game unbeaten run, though they still lead by 10 points with two games in hand over Tranmere. George Miller’s 12th-minute goal, firing in after Emmanuel Osadebe’s through ball, was enough to secure victory. Tranmere missed a chance to strengthen their grip on second in the table after Port Vale snatched a draw in stoppage-time. Josh Hawkes put Tranmere ahead after 50 minutes, slotting in from Kane Hemmings’ through-ball, before Jamie Procter’s 94th-minute leveller made it 1-1. Exeter now have three games in hand on Rovers after they were frustrated by the weather as their clash with Barrow was called off. Salford’s bid to continue their play-off push against Crawley also fell victim to the weather, while Harrogate’s meeting with Leyton Orient was also postponed. Northampton capitalised on Exeter’s absence to move up to third with a 3-0 win over relegation-threatened Colchester. Dom Telford snatched a 1-1 draw for Newport against fellow play-off chasers Mansfield. Telford struck from the penalty spot nine minutes from time to cancel out Josh Pask’s own goal, after John-Joe O’Toole was sent off for Nigel Clough’s side in the 73rd minute. Hartlepool are four games unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at Sutton. Oldham’s revival under John Sheridan continued as they climbed out of the relegation zone after making it five games unbeaten with a 2-0 win over managerless Bradford. The Latics went ahead through Hallam Hope after 19 minutes and Davis Keillor-Dunn doubled their advantage five minutes later. Paudie O’Connor was sent off in the 71st minute for the Bantams. Carlisle replaced Oldham in the relegation zone after a thumping 3-0 home defeat by Swindon. Harry McKirdy gave Swindon, who moved into the play-offs, a 17th-minute lead before the Robins hit two goals in two minutes in the second half with Josh Davison and Louie Barry on target. Scunthorpe remain rooted to the foot of the table after Rochdale came from behind to win 2-1. Manny Onariase put Scunthorpe ahead after 13 minutes, but Liam Kelly and a late winner from Max Taylor left Scunthorpe seven points from safety. Bristol Rovers hammered Stevenage 4-0. Rovers, who have now lost just one of their last 10 games, went ahead through Sam Finley in the 36th minute before Elliot Anderson, Harry Anderson and Aaron Collins sealed a resounding win for the visitors. Middlesbrough saw their play-off ambitions stall after losing 2-1 at Bristol City. Andreas Weimann gave the hosts an early lead, with Antoine Semenyo wrapping up the points in the second half. Matt Crooks scored a late consolation for Boro, who are seventh and a point behind Sheffield United. West Brom also lost ground on the top six following a 2-0 defeat at Luton. Cameron Jerome headed in from a 55th-minute free-kick and Allan Campbell wrapped up the points with seven minutes left.",Sport/Football,Reading boost survival hopes with win as Paul Ince takes interim charge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/reading-boost-survival-hopes-with-win-as-paul-ince-takes-interim-charge
2/20/2022,"Esi Edugyan, 44, is a Canadian author who was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta. She wrote her debut novel, The Second Life of Samuel Tyne, in 2004 when she was just 24. In 2011, she won the Scotiabank Giller prize for her novel Half Blood Blues and in 2018 she was shortlisted for the Booker prize with Washington Black. Out of the Sun: Essays at the Crossroads of Race is her first nonfiction work and interweaves personal narrative with discussions on racism, the slave trade in Canada, art history in the west and ghosts. You open with an essay on black sitters in western portraiture…The first [piece] is very much about 18th- and 19th-century portraiture and how depictions of black people have changed throughout history and how what we see is often predicated on the prejudices that the artist has brought to bear on their own paintings. A work I considered was Johann Gottfried Haid’s painting of Viennese courtier Angelo Soliman, an enslaved man who was taken captive as a child and arrived in Marseille in the 1700s. One of the most interesting takeaways, looking at both his portrait and also at David Martin’s portrait of Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay, a British heiress born into slavery, is the fact that details specifically included to elucidate certain elements of their lives are paradoxically obscuring. Their turbans, for instance, speak to exoticised notions of the “Orient” and yet neither had actual connections to what would then have been considered the Orient.  You expose many little-known histories and facts regarding slavery in Canada. In what ways did it differ to America and the Caribbean?I was born and raised in Calgary. In all of my school years, slavery in Canada was never mentioned. This was not something that was in the curriculum in the 1980s. That’s quite striking. The underground railroads [the network of secret routes and safe houses established in the US during the early to mid-19th century to help enslaved African Americans reach Canada] seems to have been our central Canadian story. That we were a place of refuge and very welcoming. That’s not quite the full story. Afua Cooper is a tremendous Canadian historian and has done so much work in this realm. From the 1600s into the 1800s, we had slavery on our territory. There were people who were enslaved, mainly working as domestics in households. That is something that is very much a part of our history, but we don’t discuss it. So I really wanted to draw attention to [stories] like the hanging of Marie-Joseph Angélique. She was a slave born in Portugal in 1705 and was sold to a businessman in Montreal. At the age 29, she was accused of starting a fire that destroyed 46 buildings. She was hanged and her corpse was burned. You also write, with some ambivalence, about Rachel Dolezal and Jessica Krug, two white women who fraudulently claimed black identities. How do you see the discourse around being “transracial” developing?Even though these controversies happened four or five years apart, the more recent response to Krug was just as vehement. It seemed to suggest that not only had things not progressed – where we feel like there’s a possibility to cross racial lines in a way that’s benign – but that there’s been a hardening. As I say [in the book], for me it felt unfair to deny this woman [Dolezal], who very much feels herself to be a black woman, her blackness. But on a visceral and emotional level, it feels like an encroachment. Having done some research into it, people expressed this feeling of them being caricatures. That isn’t her natural hair texture, this isn’t her natural skin colour. I understand that sensibility. Maybe in 10 years, we’ll feel differently about it all. Or maybe we’ll be more entrenched in the sense of the fixity of racial identities. Do you feel a pressure or duty to write about race?I did start this book soon after the murder of George Floyd, [so] I felt deeply compelled, rather than obligated, to write about race. Race and racism play their part in my life. Washington Black, for instance, is a book about race and racism, but it’s also very much a book about a young boy finding his feet and establishing his place in the world and discovering that he’s gifted. Character, for me, will always trump ideological explorations of race. I want to explore the lives of people. How important is travel to your writing practice?I spent almost a year and a half living in Germany and that prompted me to write Half Blood Blues. Travel has been the backbone of my writing. Looking back, I feel like if I never went anywhere ever again, I would have enough material to write for the rest of my days. Having said that, I think moving around a lot impedes your writing. These past two years have been so hard for so many. One of the more positive things that’s happened for me personally is being forced to stay still. Connecting with my work and also reconnecting with my children. I think I was away too much. Are you a disciplined writer?Before I had children, I would start writing at 10 at night and finish at six in the morning. For the past 10 years, I have written during school hours. It’s a much more truncated and prescribed schedule. Which writers to do you admire?I recently read The Transit of Venus by Shirley Hazzard. It just completely opened me up. It’s so pristine and just beautifully written and so intellectually alive. In some ways, it’s a perfect novel. As soon as I finished it, I started rereading it. Toni Morrison will always be a guiding star for me. I read her at a moment where she just made this enormous impression. I really enjoyed Rachel Cusk’s trilogy. The poetry of Dionne Brand, Patrick Lane, Lorna Crozier – all of these Canadian poets were so formative. Your husband is the poet and novelist Steven Price. What is it like to write with another writer in the house?We read each other’s work. He reads all of my first drafts and I read his. It’s been really crucial. He really gets his hands in there. It wouldn’t look like it does without his editing.  Out of the Sun: Essays at the Crossroads of Race by Esi Edugyan is published by Profile (£16.99).

2/20/2022,"He’s the designer famed for reviving Savile Row tailoring in the Cool Britannia era of the 90s with his sleek, jewel-coloured suits. Since then, office attire has become less formal and working from home has taken off, yet Ozwald Boateng believes rumours of the death of the suit are greatly exaggerated. As he prepared to show at London fashion week on Monday after a 12-year absence, he told the Observer that he believes the suit will be seen as less an everyday work uniform and more as special occasion wear – but with many of those going into an office just two or three days a week making more of an effort and opting to dress more formally.  “During the pandemic, we had two years of re-evaluating everything, and our attitudes to the way we dress changed,” Boateng said. Hybrid working had informed the way we approached suiting up, he added – this time last year, searches for suits had fallen by 34% and there was a rise in smart-casual workwear informed by virtual office meetings. “Now it’s a choice, rather than a uniform. When we go back into the office, you’ll think more about [wearing a suit]. It will be more of an occasion. I think we’re going to make more of an effort,” he said. Despite his absence from London fashion week – he’s been concentrating on other projects, including designing uniforms for British Airways staff – Boateng remains relevant. The conversation about the death of the suit is as current as ever, and diversity and structural racism remain hot topics among the fashion set. Monday’s show will be an immersive celebration of black excellence in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, with nods to his Ghanaian heritage. “The George Floyd experience brought a sadness to my heart and made me think that there’s so much more to be done,” he said. “Even though there has been change, there also has to be an acceptance of change. Sometimes, it’s easier to push it away and say ‘can we move on?’. But it still needs to be talked about.” When Boateng opened his shop on Savile Row in the 90s, he was part of the “New Bespoke Movement”: hip young gunslingers who were seen as modernising the area, cutting through the elitism. “In the late 1990s, Cool Britannia was reaching a global audience and Savile Row was ripe for being reinvented,” says Professor Andrew Groves, director of the Westminster Menswear Archive. “Like Tommy Nutter in the 1970s, Ozwald Boateng, along with Richard James, Timothy Everest and Richard Anderson, made it cool to hang out on Savile Row.” But he faced discrimination, too. In his biographical film, A Man’s Story, Boateng said: “You weren’t accepted because you are black,” encapsulating the uneasy tensions that existed. “I came to Savile Row to evolve tradition,” he says now. “I remember André Leon Talley saying, ‘you’re not a tailor, you’re a couturier’. What I was doing was taking traditional values and finding ways of modernising them. That created a uniqueness.” Moving on to become creative director at Givenchy Homme in 2003, Boateng and his trademark look became a favourite of celebrities, including Will Smith, Keanu Reeves, Idris Elba, Jamie Foxx, Spike Lee, Jude Law, Prince Charles and Barack Obama. He was also in demand in Hollywood (Ebony magazine called him “Great Britain’s biggest import since the Beatles”) and has costumed films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Black Panther and Stanford Blatch’s character in Sex and the City. Boateng’s appeal was that his tailoring was always edgier than the average suit and, after showing sporadically at Harlem’s Apollo Theatre and in Accra, he’s now back. His show promises to be of epic proportions, featuring 100 creatives, and will focus on the African diaspora. Both thematically and aesthetically, his reappearance chimes with a zeitgeist that seems more open to diverse stories told through fashion. The inspiration behind his current show marks a change from his early days 30 years ago, when he admitted in an interview that “when I first started designing, I never used to reference Africa”. His name is mentioned by young menswear designers, such as Bianca Saunders and Priya Ahluwalia, both of whom use their experience as second-generation immigrants to influence their collection. “It was incredibly inspiring for me as a young black woman to see someone that looks like me become such an industry powerhouse,” said Saunders. “When I started, Ozwald and his team were very supportive and provided me with fabrics for my graduate collection. His arrival on Savile Row and in the fashion industry had huge cultural significance, and he has inspired many others, too. At that point, Ozwald Boateng was one of the few people of colour in the UK fashion industry.” Boateng doesn’t see Monday’s show as a return to showing regularly. “When I have something to say, I’m going to do a show,” he says. But he does see it as a restart of sorts. “In terms of me doing another show next season, I haven’t thought about it,” he says. “Let’s get through Monday and see what happens. I might do another one next week… No, I’m kidding!”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Wear a suit to the office.

2/20/2022,"Dymtro Hurin, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, was a pacifist until Friday, when he signed up for weapons training. “I decided the moment is now,” he said over a coffee at a chic central Kyiv cafe, where tables were still crowded with shoppers taking a break and young workers on laptops. “I need to know how to shoot. It’s a useful skill.” Ukraine’s capital is poised between normality and horror after a warning from US president Joe Biden that it could be directly targeted during a “catastrophic” Russian invasion. Hurin is one of millions of people trying to decide what they should do if war comes to their doorstep.  Some have headed west, towards the border with Poland, and a few have left the country. But most are staying in their homes, through choice or compulsion, bracing for war, and weighing up whether to fight. More than a third of adult Ukrainians say they would like to join an armed resistance, if Russian troops cross into their country, one recent poll found. At Veteran Brownie cafe in Kyiv this weekend, owner Roman Nabozhniak is offering free coffee to anyone signed up with a new territorial army of volunteers. “Come after training, warm up, recharge, smile,” he wrote on Instagram, below a picture of a cappuccino and a paratrooper patch. The government says thousands of volunteers have been recruited since the start of the year. He wasn’t in the cafe himself because he’s getting ready to be called up again, six years after laying down arms. “My responsibility is to prepare for every scenario, then wait for something to happen,” he said over a salted caramel bake and coffee that wouldn’t be out of place in Hackney or Brooklyn. “I told my staff your safety is your priority. If serious fighting starts, take care of yourself, not the business. “I couldn’t imagine myself discussing such topics five or six years ago and being so calm, because it would have seemed like something not from this reality. Now we have to expect anything.” Ukraine’s east has lived with the daily toll of war for eight years, after Russian-backed separatists carved out territories along the border with Russia in 2014, and Moscow’s troops seized control of Crimea. Violence has continued in sporadic bursts there ever since, albeit across a frontline largely frozen since 2016. But hundreds of miles away in Kyiv, businesses and bars, shops and factories were emerging, making it the heart of a young democracy’s fight to escape the shadow of its powerful neighbour. “Russia’s reason to invade us is not about language, or economy or protecting Russian speakers. It’s because they know a free, democratic and economically successful Ukraine is a dangerous model for the Russian people. It shows them there are other possibilities,” said Hurin. “The irony is that (President Vladimir) Putin lost Ukraine for Russia. Ten years ago, there was a big debate about what kind of country we should be, close to Russia or to the west. Since 2014, support for joining Nato has climbed from 18% to over 60% now.” On Friday US President Joe Biden said he believed Russia had decided to launch a “catastrophic” war, though he also added that last-minute diplomacy might still offer some hope. Tensions had been rising since Moscow began massing tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine’s borders last year. The west responded with increasingly urgent warnings that Putin was mulling an invasion, and started shipping weapons to Ukraine, and sending troops to nearby countries including Poland. Western leaders had highlighted 16 February as the date of a possible invasion, so in the central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, 21 year-old Oleana and her friends planned to spend the evening together, just in case. “It seemed like we were prepared for everything, but everyone still had an extreme level of anxiety. So we decided to hold an ‘invasion party’,” she said by phone. They watched a comedy, opened a bottle of wine and tried to laugh and chat. “After 2am struck and we realised nothing is going to happen, we just celebrated another peaceful night and everyone went home. At this point there is nothing we can about the situation. We can only change our attitude towards it.” Ivona Kostyna, the CEO of Veterans Hub, which supports demobilised fighters, says she is grateful for the western decision to go public about potential Russian invasion plans, and the practical support in the form of military supplies, although she wishes it had come sooner. “Of course, we are encouraged by the international support, but it’s hard for veterans to understand why it wasn’t there before (when needed),” she said. “For eight years, we knew we were fighting a war, but it seemed the world didn’t notice it. Now everyone is using the same language.” She worries that the country’s 460,000 veterans, many of whom needed years to recover from the front lines, face “pressure and distress” from escalating tensions, and many could be called up again. That would leave her organisation short on staff just as demand for their services are soaring, because so many of her 68-strong team are veterans. No one in Ukraine has any illusions that the west will fight with Ukrainian forces, but many are grateful for the strong stance taken by Biden, Boris Johnson and other western leaders including France’s Emmanuel Macron, who have been shuttling to Moscow and Kyiv in a bid to fend off war. “We have a joke that that the president who did the most to create modern Ukraine was Putin,” said Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, another member of parliament. “He is not fighting against Ukraine, he is fighting against western values and way of life, so the more close connections we have with western partners the better.” The Ukraine which Putin resents is the cosmopolitan city where activists try to shape a different future, and independent journalists root out corruption. At its kiosks, where people gather for their morning coffee, and speakeasy bars where mixologists serve up the latest trends, people are just trying to get on with their lives. But the roads are thinning of traffic as people stay at home, or slip away to stay with family and friends further west, reunite with relatives in rural areas, or leave the country entirely. Some employers have even helped their entire staff fly overseas. Alina Viatkina, who spent nearly a year on the front line as a 19-year-old, now works in a mental health support team. She cancelled a trip to the US this week, which had been more than two years in the planning, because she felt she could not leave her family, including her parents and a nephew, in Kyiv without her. She is grateful for western support, saying: “I look at flight radar and see all the weapons and equipment coming in and I know it’s really expensive for other countries to send it.” Still, after years of trying to escape the long shadow of combat, she is terrified that her efforts will be destroyed in a moment. So last Wednesday she and her boyfriend went for dinner at an expensive restaurant. “We thought if Russia is coming, why not?” she said. “I was trying so hard to come back from war (mentally) and now, it’s not even that I am going back to war. War is coming to me.” Additional reporting by Iryna Gorlach",News/World news,Ukraine's capital is caught between normality and horror in shadow of war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ukraine-capital-is-caught-between-normality-and-horror-in-shadow-of-war-kiev-russia
2/20/2022,"Iran can make a large-scale prisoner swap immediately and is willing to hold direct talks with the US if it makes a major goodwill gesture such as releasing $8bn worth of Iranian assets locked abroad, Iran’s top diplomat has said. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, also said the US and Iran had “never been so close to reaching a deal as we are today”, referring to an agreement to revive the 2015 nuclear deal from which the US had walked out on in 2018.  Iran and European powers have been staging talks on reviving the deal since February, but all sides now agree a conclusion has to be reached. The minister speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday said Iran still needed to see flexibility by the US in providing political, legal and economic guarantees that the US will honour the nuclear deal. Asked about the possibility of prisoner swaps as part of the deal, he said “it is a completely humanitarian issue. There was a kind of agreement that was formed last year that all the prisoners at once will be exchanged”. He said the Americans are interested in linking the prisoners to the Vienna talks, but he said “from Iran’s point of view there is no relationship between the prisoners and the Vienna talks. Away from it, we can do it immediately.” With both sides normally remaining tight-lipped about the final stages of the negotiations, the minister’s remarks lift the lid on some of the remaining stumbling blocks. It also confirms the Americans are trying to include guarantees about the release of dual national political prisoners in the deal. He said the most important guarantee about the future status of any non-proliferation agreement was economic, and Iran had proposed that no sanctions could be applied legally to any deal struck between an Iranian company and a foreign company so protecting that deal from the threat of sanctions being slapped on them if the US pulled out of the deal again. He revealed the US chief Iran negotiator Rob Malley in a non-paper had suggested statements made by the US President, Joe Biden, at the G7 Summit in Cornwall in June that his administration would abide by the agreement were politically sufficient. But Iran’s envoy said this proposal was not enough due to the high wall of mistrust between US and the Americans caused by the US ruining the previous deal by walking out. He proposed the parliaments of the countries signing the deal “could confirm some kind of support for the talks outcome”, suggesting this could be “at any reasonable or acceptable level”. He said the most important guarantee was economic, pointing out that Malley had told Iran via intermediaries that he cannot guarantee that the next administration will remain loyal to the commitment Biden had made. He claimed this stance conflicted with international law that requires governments to abide by the international agreements made by their previous government”. He also confirmed the US repeatedly through intermediaries had been seeking to persuade Iran to hold direct talks with the US. He said the US could present a big goodwill initiative to lift sanctions or release $10bn Iranian assets frozen in foreign banks. “Saying we have goodwill in words is not enough for direct talks. On the ground they have to show it in practice.”",News/World news,Iran hints at prisoner swaps if US shows flexibility over nuclear deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/iran-hints-at-prisoner-swaps-if-us-shows-flexibility-over-nuclear-deal
2/20/2022,"Hundreds of mourners gathered at a church in North Carolina on Friday night to celebrate the life of Cheslie Kryst, an attorney, former Miss USA and justice advocate who died last month, aged 30.  “Cheslie … sowed many seeds through her work, her philanthropy, her advocacy, and most importantly, her genuine care for others,” said Kryst’s mother, April Simpkins, as reported by the Charlotte Observer. “I know those seeds will continue to bear fruit for many years.” The newspaper said “thousands” attended the memorial online. Kryst killed herself on 30 January in New York City. In addition to her pageant participation, Kryst created White Collar Glam and was a correspondent for the entertainment news show Extra. In the legal world, she advocated for criminal justice and social justice reform, fighting for the wrongly incarcerated. Edward Watson, whom Kryst worked to free several years ago, said at the memorial: “In life we encounter ordinary people, but there are rare cases when we meet extraordinary people. “I needed help. The Lord sent the help that I needed.” Watson spent 25 years behind bars on weapons and crack trafficking charges. Kryst worked with her stepfather, David Simpkins, and the attorney MiAngel Cody to shorten his sentence. “Cheslie preached the sermon just in how she showed up in the world, who she was there for and what she called us to do,” Cody said at the memorial. “I always found her to be [a] curriculum for how to be an attorney, how to be an advocate and how to be a human being.” Kryst was also an ambassador for Dress for Success, a non-profit that aims to “empower women to achieve economic independence by providing a network of support, professional attire and the development tools to help women thrive in work and in life”. Her work for the Charlotte-area chapter was praised at her memorial. “Be like Cheslie, honor Cheslie and share your gifts,” said Kelly Barr O’Conner, executive director of Dress for Success Charlotte. “Sweet Cheslie, rest in peace and may perpetual light shine upon you.

Bath eventually fell to defeat, only the Tigers’ second success in 12 Premiership visits to the home of their great rivals. But after the threat of another Recreation Ground rout for the hosts had hung in the air, Bath hassled and disrupted their opponents and came close to a famous win. In the end, Leicester’s power and precision was decisive. After five minutes of early sparring, Leicester’s first visit to their opponents’ 22 showed why they are top, as they sliced through thanks to a fine floating pass from Freddie Burns to Dan Kelly. Nemani Nadolo’s heavy-duty carry sucked in several defenders, and the No 8 Jasper Wiese capitalised by forcing his way over.  Bath were struggling to contain Leicester’s powerful carries but when the wind held up a Leicester kick from hand, a beautifully judged grubber kick by Ben Spencer sent Will Muir over. Orlando Bailey’s conversion was diverted away by the blustery wind. A classy piece of work by Dan Kelly soon saw the Tigers breeze through Bath again: Guy Porter was released and offloaded to Richard Wigglesworth who strolled under the posts to make it 14-5. The ease of the score did not bode well for the hosts and when Muir was shown a yellow card for taking out Bryce Hegarty, things looked to be heading south even faster. Hegarty, however, was penalised on the Leicester 22 soon afterwards and Bailey converted the three-pointer. Some fine work at the breakdown from Max Ojomoh brought another penalty for the hosts. Bath twice kicked for the corner and were rewarded when another brilliant grubber, this time by Jonathan Joseph, was smartly finished by Ojomoh. Bailey converted and Bath believed. The hosts not only won the 10 minutes in which Muir was off the field; it got better when Josh McNally and Bailey combined to put Josh Bayliss into space on the left. The back-rower had only just come on because of a head injury assessment for Nathan Hughes, but showed a clean pair of heels to Burns to speed over. Bailey converted and Bath edged in front. Bath were competing, and then some, but Leicester turned the screw soon after half-time, camping themselves in the home 22 and winning a couple of scrum penalties before a decoy run by Nadolo allowed Burns space to score against his former club and edge them back ahead by a point when he converted his own try. Muir was soon scorching down the left wing and bringing the home crowd to their feet yet again, but Leicester scrambled sufficiently in defence and held firm. Hegarty’s penalty edged Leicester further in front. Bath almost shoved over the line with 15 minutes left, the raucous crowd urging them onwards, but a penalty for the Tigers shifted the momentum away from them again at the crucial moment. Danny Cipriani was introduced by Neal Hatley, with Bailey switched to full-back, while the much-travelled former England wing Chris Ashton also joined the fray for Leicester. Leicester camped themselves near the opposition line as the final minutes ticked down, retaining their four-point lead, pinning Bath back where they least wanted to be. Steve Borthwick’s men closed out the win.",Sport/Sport,Leicester’s Freddie Burns ensures Tigers survive scare from battling Bath ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/bath-leicester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
2/20/2022,"Gloria Mertoli’s shift is over when the first light of dawn shines on the goalposts of a rugby pitch in the Librino district of Catania, a stronghold of the Cosa Nostra, the feared Sicilian mafia. Since mobsters torched the clubhouse and team bus, she and other players on the women’s rugby team, Briganti Librino RUFC, have taken turns to stay after evening practice and guard the area overnight. Since the club started working to take children – easy targets for mafia recruitment – off the streets of Librino, the clans have tried to put it out of business.  “Librino is a complex neighbourhood,” Piero Mancuso, one of the founders of the Briganti, told the Observer. “We knew it wouldn’t be easy to work here. These criminal attacks risked destroying everything we had achieved in recent years. But if I look at what we have done so far, I can say that these attacks have made us stronger.” The story of the small Briganti team from Catania has made news around the world and received expressions of solidarity from England’s national rugby coach, Eddie Jones, as well as from former England captain Bill Beaumont. Even World Rugby has expressed its support for the team. Last year, the amateur rugby team from Bolton, with a 150-year heritage, forged a partnership with the Sicilian team. “For the people of Librino, rugby offers an alternative to a potential life of crime on the streets,” said the Bolton chairman, Mark Brocklehurst, in a note last year. “If we can help Briganti by offering a glimmer of hope, then amazing things can happen. What better motivator for Bolton to get involved?” The Briganti, which runs several junior and senior teams, as well as women’s teams across multiple age groups, was established in Librino in 2006, with the goal of doing more than simply playing rugby. “We built a clubhouse with a small library, a café, and a kitchen,’’ says Mancuso. “We offered after-school activities for the least advantaged kids in the neighbourhood, and we started teaching them the noble sport of rugby, which is based on a respect for adversaries and rules.” Librino, with a population of 70,000, is not an average district. School dropout rates reach among the highest levels in Europe, and the mafia has used the area as a hub for drug dealing and stockpiling, which are controlled by the Cursoti Milanesi and Cappello clans of Cosa Nostra. Here, crime is seen as a path to financial success, as well as respect within the community. Like other depressed areas in southern Italy, few institutions exist to offer a credible alternative to children in these neighbourhoods. And the youth are a prime target for mafia recruitment. In 2017, a police investigation revealed the use of a six-year-old boy as a drug dealer. In such a context, educating kids in legality and respect for others is met with distrust by the mobsters. At midnight on 11 January 2018, a fire broke out in the Briganti clubhouse. Books, footballs, the cafe, computers, jerseys and trophies were all burnt beyond recognition. “At least 10 years of memories went up in smoke,’’ says Mancuso. “It was devastating.’’ The clubhouse was rebuilt within months, thanks to private donations, but thefts and attacks continued. Last April, someone broke down the club’s iron door and stole equipment. Weeks later, on 16 March 2021, the team’s bus was set on fire. “My whole life I’ve heard people talk about the mafia, but when you have it right in your face it’s a completely different story,” says Mertoli, 22, who is the captain of the women’s rugby team. “When they torched our bus, it was as if they had set my own house on fire. You find yourself in a difficult situation because you don’t know how to handle it. You don’t know if you should go to the police. You really have no idea how to react.” Since that day, Mertoli and her teammates take turns at night watching over the locker rooms, the new clubhouse and the library. “We’re there all night,” Mertoli says. “We order food and pass the time playing Risk or Monopoly. If we hear a noise, we grab our clubs.” Claudio Fava, president of Sicily’s anti-mafia commission and son of the late journalist Giuseppe, killed in Catania by the mafia in 1984, says that “anyone who offers a different life to kids who are born and raised in these mafia strongholds are ball breakers for the mafia bosses”. Fava compares the terrorist acts against the Briganti to the assassination of Father Pino Puglisi in Palermo, a priest shot dead by mafia hitmen in 1993 after he challenged the organisation’s control over one of the city’s toughest neighbourhoods. The parish priest had fought for the building of a football pitch to get young kids off the streets. “In these neighbourhoods, offering a way out for these kids, through school or sport, is an affront to the bosses,” Fava added. But life, like rugby, is a game of resilience, and anything can change the outcome of the match, up to the last minute. Thanks to international support and donations, the Briganti have managed to christen their new rugby pitch, which was officially inaugurated last Friday. “We have risen from the ashes of the fire that these people started,” says Mancuso. “And if they come back to bother us, we’ll be here,” adds Mertoli. “And like in a rugby match, we will not move back an inch. We will continue to defend ourselves, because this, this is our home.’’",News/World news,‘They torched our clubhouse’… but Sicilian rugby team won’t let mafia win,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/they-torched-our-clubhouse-but-sicilian-rugby-team-wont-let-mafia-win
2/20/2022,"The British government is reportedly considering ditching its pledge to ban fur and foie gras imports after opposition from within the cabinet. The new rules, which were due to be part of the animals abroad bill, were expected to be introduced soon. But, according to the BBC, the government is likely to drop the plans due to objections from several cabinet ministers.  The government said that a final decision was yet to be made, saying it was “united in its commitment to upholding its world-leading standards in animal welfare”. A spokesperson added: “Our action plan for animal welfare sets out the government’s vision to introduce a range of world-leading reforms to improve the welfare and conservation of animals at home and abroad.” But the BBC reports that the bans on fur and foie gras are expected to be dropped after numerous cabinet ministers, including the Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, raised their concerns. According to the broadcaster, Rees-Mogg believes the government should not impose restrictions on customers and argued that the proposed ban would not benefit animal welfare in the UK. It also reported that ministers including the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, and defence secretary, Ben Wallace, had also shared their concerns about the ban. British farmers are banned from making foie gras, created by force-feeding ducks or geese, and fur farming has been illegal in the UK since 2000. The new draft legislation intended to improve animal welfare includes a crackdown on hunting animals for trophies and holidays that lead to animal neglect. But following debate over how some aspects would be enforced, the bill has been delayed. In recent weeks, ministers have confirmed that they plan to ban importing hunting trophies from under-threat species such as elephants, rhinos and lions. The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, said last year that the government would bring in the ban on imports at “the earliest possible slot”. But animal rights campaigners warned that removing the ban from the bill would lead to huge disappointment. “A very large number of people will be disappointed if they don’t,” Claire Bass, the executive director of the Humane Society International UK, told the BBC, adding: “People won’t stand for that.” Abigail Penny, the executive director at Animal Equality UK, called for an end to the importation of “immensely cruel” foie gras.",News/World news,Pledge to ban fur and foie gras imports could be dropped after cabinet opposition,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/pledge-to-ban-fur-and-foie-gras-imports-could-be-dropped-after-cabinet-opposition
2/20/2022,"Harlequins returned to winning ways with a bonus-point victory in a match most significant for a first appearance for the visiting flanker Jack Willis in 53 weeks. Willis sustained the second horrendous knee injury of his career just over the road when playing for England against Italy last February, and has spoken candidly about his struggles along the path to recovery. Here he played the last 35 minutes from the bench and above all else it warmed the heart to see him back in the thick of it. By the time he had got his bearings, Harlequins – bolstered by the surprise availability of Joe Marler – had raced into a 24-3 lead with tries from Oscar Beard, Huw Jones, Cadan Murley and André Esterhuizen. Louis Lynagh added another for Harlequins to leave Wasps, who had won their previous four Premiership matches, reeling.  While there were one or two signs of rust from the 25-year-old Willis, it was no coincidence Wasps fought back to within five points after his introduction. “He added a bit to us,” said Wasps’ coach, Lee Blackett. “When he came on we started going forward and on the back of that the breakdown got easier. Today was big for him. I’m just happy for Jack, it has been a long time, it has been tough for him.” Marler, meanwhile, has played a combined 31 minutes in England’s two Six Nations matches, and though Eddie Jones picked a smaller squad for last week’s training camp, the loosehead prop’s omission still caught the eye. He will almost certainly return to a wider squad on Sunday but there can be little doubt that Harlequins benefited from his experience, set-piece nous and sense of theatre. “Even before [Joe] joined England for the Six Nations he said if there are any fallow weeks and I’m not getting much game time then I’d love to come and play,” said the Harlequins coach, Tabai Matson. “Clearly he’s had that conversation with Eddie Jones, which is fantastic for us. On the back of that surely he’ll be playing [next Saturday] against Wales. At his best he’s one of the best players in the competition.” Given the blustery conditions, a repeat of the 94-point thriller edged by Harlequins in the corresponding fixture last season was always unlikely. But the hosts did not begin like a side who had lost their past three matches. Wasps were not helped by losing Tom Cruse to injury after 30 seconds but Harlequins were into gear from the word go. They struck with a trademark opening try from Beard after three minutes, Danny Care lighting the touch paper with a quick tapped penalty. Marler was also making his presence felt, winning a turnover at the breakdown to earn Harlequins some welcome respite and a scrum penalty, much to the delight of the home supporters. By that stage Harlequins had stretched their advantage to nine points – Jones taking a short pass from Esterhuizen and piercing the defence. It put the home side in command at the interval, with Wasps having a solitary Jacob Umaga penalty to show for their efforts. Harlequins struck with two tries in three minutes early in the second half, Murley finishing the first after a series of offloads before Esterhuizen added the second with a powerful finish from close range after Harlequins – Willis coming on in between those scores. His brother Tom finally got Wasps going in the second half in the left corner before a flying finish from the replacement Lynagh gave Harlequins a lead they surely could not let slip. Wasps did rally but tries from Sam Spink and Jeff Toomaga-Allen were enough only for a losing bonus-point.",Sport/Sport,Harlequins hold off late Wasps fightback to end losing Premiership run,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/harlequins-wasps-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
2/20/2022,"A leading Commonwealth charity which has the Queen as its patron is promoting the online coaching business that employs Prince Harry as its chief impact officer. The coaching, by BetterUp, is described as “truly phenomenal” in testimony by one user on the website of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust (QCT). Prince Harry was previously president of the trust.  While Harry stepped back from royal duties in February last year, the partnership reveals how his royal connections are still proving helpful as he forges a new career in the US. One branding expert said the endorsement was valuable publicity for the startup, which is now valued at $4.7bn (£3.5bn) and is described as “the largest mental health and coaching company in the world”. Officials from the charity said last week that the charitable partnership was one of several agreed with organisations with the goal of providing support to young social entrepreneurs across the Commonwealth. About 1,000 young leaders are said to have been offered free coaching under the arrangement and the charity says on its website it will be “rolling out” the collaboration more widely this year. David Haigh, chief executive of the London consultancy Brand Finance, said: “Any company which is supported by the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust is going to gain credibility, and this will be of economic value.” He said a careful due diligence process would have been required to ensure the charitable partnership with an American startup was appropriate. The trust’s partnership with the firm, under which young leaders are given free access to the coaching platform, is prominently displayed on the charity’s website. A testimonial from one of the young leaders who has benefited from the coaching says: “The 3 staff members who have signed up have all been completely blown away by how much we are learning and growing.” BetterUp said in a blogpost on its website last year that it was working with the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust, but the exact terms of the arrangement, the duration of the partnership and the number of people who will benefit have not been disclosed. The initiative is part of a “Pledge 1%” movement, under which the firm donates 1% of its coaching to communities. Chris Kelly, chief executive of the QCT, says in a press release on the charity’s website: “Working with BetterUp will make a massive difference for us. The collaboration with BetterUp means [the charity] can add this to the package of support we offer our young leaders.” The QCT was launched on 21 April 2018, funded by money from the now defunct Queen’s Trust and Diamond Jubilee Trust. An inaugural statement read: “Our mission is simple. We champion, fund and connect young leaders who are working hard to change the world.” Harry was appointed president, and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, became vice-president the following year. The couple resigned from these positions in February 2021 when it was confirmed by Buckingham Palace they would no longer be working members of the royal family. Charity accounts show QCT raised £796,106 in the financial year ending March 2021, while paying staff costs of £787,314, including nearly £420,000 to its five most senior executives. It has faced challenges in raising funds during the pandemic and hopes to increase its number of financial supporters. The charity has its headquarters in London, and the model Naomi Campbell joined last year as a global ambassador. Harry joined BetterUp in March last year. The San Francisco-based company was founded in 2013 and is a mobile-based platform offering coaching to employees. The cost of individual subscriptions is not advertised on the website, but reportedly range from $249 to $499 a month. The charity said: “QCT is fortunate to benefit from multiple charitable corporate partnerships, all of which, through gifts in kind, enable the charity to enhance the support it offers young social entrepreneurs across the Commonwealth. “One of the charitable partnerships QCT is grateful to have is with BetterUp, a collaboration which came about through BetterUp’s chief impact officer, Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, the former president of QCT, who remains a friend of the charity. All gifts in kind are published in the charity’s annual report and accounts.” BetterUp said: “Our collaboration with QCT includes offering 1,000 young leaders free access to BetterUp’s full coaching platform, so that they are better prepared for the pressures of becoming an entrepreneur, and so that their creative ideas can become reality.”",News/UK news,Website of Queen’s charity promotes Prince Harry’s US coaching firm,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/19/queen-commonwealth-trust-prince-harry
