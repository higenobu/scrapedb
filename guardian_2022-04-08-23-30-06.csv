4/8/2022,"Extensive UK tours by orchestras from the EU are, one suspects, likely to be rarities for some time to come. A combination of the lingering consequences of the pandemic and the extra layers of bureaucracy imposed by Brexit make the organisation of such undertakings much more challenging, so the current six-date tour by the Zagreb Philharmonic – its first visit since 1974 – is rather remarkable. Jan Latham-Koenig is the conductor for all the concerts, which include music by Croatia’s most familiar composer, Dora Pejačević, alongside repertory works by Sibelius and Mahler. The tour-opener, in the rather bright, sometimes unforgiving acoustic of the Anvil, suggested that the Zagreb orchestra is a feisty, highly accomplished band, which more than compensated for its occasional lack of tonal refinement with an energy and vividness that Latham-Koenig exploited in his performance of Mahler’s First Symphony. It was very much an interpretation presented in bold, primary colours, without a great deal of subtlety but with very loud, almost brash climaxes which allowed the brass much more chance to assert itself than the orchestra’s woodwind. That assertiveness did result in some problems of balance, and in Sibelius’s Violin Concerto, too, there were passages in which the soloist, Tamsin Waley-Cohen, had to fight just a bit too hard to make her finely chiselled lyricism heard. But the general profile of her approach – severe and brisk in the first two movements, far more unbuttoned in the finale – came across clearly, even when some of the details were obscured. Four of Pejačević’s orchestral songs, sung by the soprano Marija Vidović, had opened the concert. Settings from 1915 of poems by Karl Kraus and Rilke are ambitious late romantic essays, with Strauss and perhaps Zemlinsky as their stylistic references, while the two Butterfly Songs, composed in 1920 just three years before Pejačević’s death at the age of 38, are charming miniatures, composed with the lightest of touches, which Vidović presented with just the right combination of tact and charm.  At the Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham on 8 April, and touring until 14 April.

4/8/2022,"England have amassed 131 points in their opening two Women’s Six Nations victories, conceding just five, but Wales will head to Kingsholm without fear for a meeting with the defending champions . After two overwhelming victories on the road, against Scotland and Italy, England will play their first home match of the campaign at Gloucester’s stadium in front of more than 14,000 fans. However, 10 members of the Welsh squad play their club rugby for Gloucester-Hartpury and visiting supporters are expected to turn out in force – it may prove to be the closest thing possible to a home game for unbeaten Wales without playing just across the border in Cardiff. The head coach Ioan Cunningham, who recruited a DJ to play during Welsh training sessions this week, believes his side are ready to face the music against opponents who have won 20 consecutive Test matches. “We can’t wait. We want to see where we’re at,” he said. “We want to compete against the best in the world, so this is a great opportunity for us. The players train and play with and against the England players week-in, week-out so while we respect the side, there is familiarity, not fear. It will be fantastic to play in front of a huge crowd which will hopefully include some Welsh voices.” Cunningham makes five changes to the side that fought back from 19-7 down against Scotland last week to win 24-19. Donna Rose starts at loosehead prop, Sioned Harries slots in at No8 with the captain, Siwan Lillicrap, switching to blindside flanker. Wales also field a new half-back pairing, with Robyn Wilkins starting at fly-half and Ffion Lewis at No9. The 18-year-old Sisilia Tuipulotu, meanwhile, makes her debut in the second row alongside Gwen Crabb. “We just want her to be herself and enjoy the occasion,” Cunningham said of Tuipulotu. “If she’s good enough, she’s old enough.” England’s Lydia Thompson scored a hat-trick in the 74-0 dismantling of Italy in Parma last Sunday but the head coach Simon Middleton said she “picked a bump up in training” this week and is sidelined as a result. Thompson’s absence is one of seven changes to the England XV with Jess Breach returning on the wing for her first start since May last year. Marlie Packer is back at No 7 and Abby Dow, who usually plays on the wing, starts at full-back. At scrum-half, Lucy Packer of Harlequins makes her first start after three caps from the bench, while Poppy Cleall moves to the second row and Sarah Bern comes into the front row in place of Shaunagh Brown. The highly experienced centre, Emily Scarratt, is back at No 13 to win her 99th international cap. Sarah Hunter, who captains the side at No 8, believes two comeback victories against Ireland and Scotland demonstrate Wales’s spirit and the task at hand for England. “They’ve come from behind, which is a really tough thing to do, and that just shows the belief that they have in one another,” Hunter said. “If they’re in the the game they’ll bring it to you, and they’ll force errors and they’ll make it tough. We want to be in a place where we don’t want to let them into the game. They’ve got a really strong set piece, that’s the heart of their game.” Middleton agreed. “We’re very conscious of Wales’s set-piece,” he said. “We were good last week, we were really good in lots of things we did, but defence in particular is one thing we can still improve on.”",Sport/Sport,Wales’s women happy to face music against finely-tuned England in Six Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/waless-women-happy-to-face-the-music-against-finely-tuned-england
4/8/2022,"Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a Donald Trump ally, has accused a “finance gerontocracy” including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon of hindering bitcoin’s progress. The outspoken libertarian tech investor described multibillionaire Buffett, the world’s richest investor, as the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” in a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on Thursday. Thiel’s address began with an analysis of the investment merits of cryptocurrencies but soon escalated into a tirade against the financial establishment, including “bankrupt” central banks and the “hate factory” of ESG – which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance and is a cornerstone of responsible investing principles. “It’s a movement, and it’s a political question, whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether whether the enemies of a movement are going to succeed in stopping us,” he said, shortly before naming Buffett as “enemy number one”. In a speech that also cited JP Morgan’s CEO Dimon and Larry Fink, chair of investment group BlackRock, he said institutions run by a “finance gerontocracy” were hindering the cryptocurrency. Thiel said choosing not to invest in bitcoin was a “deeply political choice” and the financial establishment should be told “you have to get onboard on this”. Thiel added that the $830bn (£638bn) bitcoin market could rival the global equities market, worth more than $100tn. Comparing bitcoin with conventional capitalism, he said, to applause: “Woke companies are sort of quasi-controlled by the government in a way that bitcoin never will be.” Thiel, 54, is the most high profile Trump supporter in the tech industry, having donated millions of dollars to Trump’s 2016 campaign and served on the ex-president’s transition team. Casting the progress of bitcoin in political terms, Thiel rounded off his speech with a libertarian rallying cry depicting cryptocurrency’s progress as a battle between ESG and a “revolutionary youth movement”. “If we had to summarise this in in one frame, it is … the finance gerontocracy that runs the country through whatever silly virtue signalling, hate factory term like ESG they have versus what I would … think of as a revolutionary youth movement.” He added: “We have to just go out from this conference and take over the world.” Thiel announced in February that he was stepping down as a board director at Facebook’s parent, Meta. Thiel has been on the Meta board since 2005 and is a confidant of Meta’s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.",News/Technology,Paypal founder launches tirade against ‘gerontocracy’ over bitcoin,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/08/peter-thiel-paypal-founder-tirade-gerontocracy-bitcoin
4/8/2022,"One of Domingo Hindoyan’s stated ambitions when he took on the chief conductorship of the Liverpool Philharmonic was to get the orchestra performing more opera. A concert performance of Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle was the first glimpse of what’s to come operatically during his tenure. “Where is the stage – outside or within?” the opening monologue asks. Bartók’s only opera is a disturbing tale underpinned by a general murkiness, a searching inward psychodrama as Judith slowly discovers just how troubled Bluebeard really is. The bright white interior of the Philharmonic Hall is less than ideal for such gloom but the artistic team, led by producer Katy Wakeford-Brown, made the best of a tricky assignment. Strong red hues throughout, plus X Factor-style lights that swivel at the climactic opening of the fifth door, certainly added oomph. Bloody axes, shiny armour and gothic castles projected behind the orchestra gave the performance its basic, traditional framework, but with both leads reading from scores the dramatic potential was minimalised. Adrienn Miksch, a late replacement for an indisposed Jennifer Johnston, portrayed a determined Judith, adding a febrile edge to her probing of Károly Szemerédy’s sullen Bluebeard. Hindoyan’s direction of Bartók’s thrilling score had a convincing thrust to it, drawing a good deal of sonic terror – the pick being the shimmering Lake of Tears behind the sixth door. But this opera is so much more than its breathtaking sounds, and in a piece that can shock to the core, the drama fell a little short. Bartók’s hour-long work presents a problem for programmers - a fraction too short to present without an opening companion piece. The opening Adagio from Mahler’s 10th Symphony echoes Bartók in its intensity of feeling; this surprisingly graceful rendition reserved some of that power for the second half.",Arts/Music,RLPO/Hindoyan review – shock but not enough awe in Bluebeard concert staging ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/08/rlpo-hindoyan-bluebeards-castle-review
4/8/2022,"It may have taken a war to bring into sharp relief, but step by step Britain’s foreign policy has become more militarised since Brexit, becoming an increasingly defining feature of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Today the UK wants a leading role in helping to arm Ukraine. It organised a “donor’s conference” of military aid last Thursday, and this week ministers demonstrated missiles and armoured vehicles that it hopes to give to Kyiv’s embattled forces to Ukrainian ministers and generals. Helping Ukraine as it fights Russia’s unprovoked invasion is not particularly contentious, but it is less than a year ago – in May 2021 – that two Royal Navy ships were sent to Jersey as part of a post-Brexit dispute over fishing rights with France. Aukus, a tripartite military pact between the US, Australia and the UK also emerged last year, initially to supply nuclear-powered submarine technology to Canberra. That too involved conflict with France, which had been supplying diesel-powered submarines to Australia, only for Paris to discover its partner had been secretly negotiating an alternative. Aukus was further extended this week. The three countries are also to work on developing hypersonic missiles, which Russia and China already possess. In theory they can be nuclear armed, but Aukus members insist any of the high-speed, manoeuvrable warheads they use will be conventional. Shipping weapons and engaging in new arms races is far removed from the promise of Brexit that Boris Johnson outlined in a speech he gave in Greenwich in February 2020, just after Britain completed its exit from the EU. “Global free trade needs a global champion,” he said, as he talked up the prospect of trade deals around the world. Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said: “Brexit was sold on an economic ticket, but it has fallen by the wayside.” Britain’s trade deal with Australia is expected to add 0.02% to the size of the UK economy over 15 years. “Trade deals have not proved to be the eye-catching dimension of Global Britain they were built up to be, whereas military agreements make the news, and increasingly fit the moment,” he said. Aid spending was cut by £4bn a year in 2020 and will remain below the 0.7% statutory target until 2024-2025, while defence spending was boosted by a similar amount, £16.5bn, over four years. Robin Niblett, the director of the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank, said Britain had long had a strong military component to its foreign policy, but that leaving the EU has inevitably brought it to the fore: “The military element is something a British leader can refer to to show the UK is a credible global power,” he said. Johnson played host to Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, at Downing St on Thursday, promising to launch a “proper thoroughgoing security, defence partnership” between the two countries. In fact the relationship between London and Warsaw is already close. Britain agreed in November to send 550 troops to Poland in three stages. Eastern European Nato members have also made clear they want greater direct military support as part of “deterrence by defence” plan to keep Russia at bay – and the UK is expected to respond positively as a plan is hammered out later this spring. “Nato is the club that Britain remains a part of,” Ricketts said. The question is whether UK has the resources to match the ambition. It is also nominally committed to the Indo-Pacific tilt outlined in its integrated defence and foreign policy review last March. Evidence of the tilt in action has been modest, however, beyond the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier’s voyage to the Pacific last year, in which the British flagship had to rely on a US destroyer and fighter jets, as well as a Dutch frigate, for escort. Soaring inflation also means defence budgets are falling, by 1.9% a year in real terms against CPI, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. But the crisis in Ukraine is continuing, the calls for help from eastern Europe are becoming louder and Johnson remains eager to show Global Britain has meaning – all of which means militarisation is here to stay.",News/Politics,"The UK may try to flex military muscles, but has it got what it takes?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/uk-may-flex-military-muscles-ukraine-has-it-got-what-it-takes
4/8/2022,"During lockdown, Spasia Dinkovski started making böreks and selling them on Instagram. Soon, her side hustle grew into a full-time biz called Mystic Börek, inspired by her grandmother’s cooking in Macedonia. I loved the drama of a huge börek in a pizza-style box. This chocolatey Easter börek is my homage to Spasia’s, which brought a little light to my lockdown. I use ghee in this recipe, because, as cook and food writer Melek Erdal points out, it is best for filo because it doesn’t burn in the oven. Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 10-12 130g cream cheese1 egg90g sugar¼ tsp orange blossom waterA pinch of flaky salt240g ricotta1 x 270g pack filo pasty (7 sheets)150g ghee, melted over a gentle heat100g milk chocolate, choppedFor the syrup50g caster sugarThe juice of ½ orange To finish10g dark chocolate, melted10g crushed pistachios Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. In a bowl, gently beat the cream cheese with the egg and sugar until smooth. Mix in the orange blossom water and salt, then stir in the ricotta. The filling should be loose, but not too runny – you will be spreading it over the filo. To assemble, lay out four sheets of filo lengthways on a work surface, overlapping the ends to make one continuous sheet. Brush liberally with the melted ghee, lay the remaining three sheets of filo over the first three on the bench, again overlapping them slightly and leaving the final sheet on the bench in a single layer (this will make it easier to wrap the end under the spiral). Liberally brush with ghee. Spoon the ricotta mixture over the middle third of the filo, leaving space at the bottom and top so it’s easier to roll it up. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate over the ricotta. From the bottom, roll the filo up tightly into a sausage shape. Then, starting at the end with two layers of filo, turn the pastry into a spiral shape, gently guiding it from one end of the work surface to the other. Don’t worry if tiny splits form. Once you’ve reached the end, gently tuck the pastry tail under the spiral and lift it into a cast-iron pan or a closed bottom cake tin. Make sure there are no gaps in the tin, otherwise the ghee will spill in the oven. Brush the börek liberally (but don’t drown it) with ghee and bake for 50 minutes to an hour, until golden all over. Meanwhile, make the syrup, put the sugar, orange juice and 60ml water in a small pan, bring to a boil and cook rapidly for two to three minutes. Leave to cool a little, then pour over the börek while it’s still warm. Drizzle with melted chocolate, sprinkle over the pistachios and serve warm on its own or with ice-cream.

4/8/2022,"Boris Johnson is congratulating himself on doing so much to help Ukraine, but Britain is like a doctor treating a patient is symptoms after causing the infection in the first place. The weapons shipments are crucial, as are plasters and painkillers when someone’s unwell, but there is no sign yet that Downing Street recognises how to treat the underlying condition. The Kremlin is solely to blame for the horror it is inflicting on the Ukrainians, but its ability to wage war derives from the wealth it has accumulated. And that is something we share responsibility for, and something we should address as urgently as we are providing Kyiv with missiles to destroy Russian armoured vehicles. For far too long, Britain welcomed the Kremlin’s companies and oligarchs and allowed them to raise funds on our financial markets. Our lawyers defended their interests, our accountants filed their accounts and our shell companies protected their assets. Our professionals may have dropped their oligarch clients in the past six weeks, but the damage had already been done: the Russian state would have nothing like the wealth it has now, and would thus not be able to wage this war, without the assistance they provided. And does anyone really believe that, once the memories of Bucha, Kramatorsk and Mariupol have faded, the City won’t sell its services to the Kremlin elite again? If we wish to degrade the oligarchs’ influence and undermine Russia’s military in the long term, we need to stop them ever doing business in this country again. There are two reasons why Britain has allowed Russian kleptocratic wealth to flow through the City of London in such vast quantities. The first is that we have cared only about the fees it generates, not about how it was earned. The second reason is more complex, and lies in the nature of Vladimir Putin’s regime. The Kremlin controls everything in Russia, and it interchangeably uses whatever tools are available – the military, the FSB, the economy, organised crime, embassies, the media – either singly or in combination, for whatever task it wishes to address. This is fundamentally different to how the British state operates, and that has allowed the Russians to slip through the cracks in our system with ease: the threat is not purely criminal, so it’s not the police’s responsibility; it’s not military, so the Ministry of Defence doesn’t step up; it’s not run by spies, so our security services don’t step in. For far too long, the threat posed by Russia has always been – for British officials – “somebody else’s problem”, and has thus never been adequately addressed. This is a shame, because there is one vulnerability in Putin’s system that the UK is perfectly placed to address. The Kremlin’s ability to move illicit wealth seamlessly through the offshore financial system, and therefore through London, underpins every aspect of its behaviour. When British shell structures were used to hide the ownership of billions of pounds laundered out of Russia, the government did nothing about it, thanks to its failure to appreciate the security threat inherent in anonymous wealth pouring into our country. When Russian state companies raised capital in the City, British politicians did not recognise we were effectively funding the Kremlin’s war machine, and instead welcomed the business we were generating. When oligarchs bought up swathes of west London, we didn’t consider that we were providing them with a stable home for their wealth, so they could build a looting machine at home, and instead welcomed all the stamp duty they were paying. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has this week been lecturing the Europeans about buying so much oil and gas from the Russians. But by protecting and managing the Kremlin elite’s money, Britain has been at least as complicit as Germany in helping Putin build his aggressive regime. To expose, investigate and block the Kremlin’s money, we need three things, all of which are easily achievable if the political will can be found: proper transparency of shell companies, so we know who owns what; robust regulation of professional enablers, so crooked lawyers and accountants can be prosecuted; generous funding of law enforcement, so we can confiscate suspicious wealth. And those three policies should be coordinated by a fourth: a single individual who is responsible for tackling illicit finance, who can force agencies to take action and can confront politicians who drag their feet, and who can stop the Kremlin’s infiltration of our economy being “somebody else’s problem”. We must take kleptocracy as seriously as we take terrorism, and that requires more than just an MP being named “anti-corruption champion”. So far the government has relied on sanctions to block the oligarchs’ wealth, but sanctions do nothing to destroy the networks that moved that wealth in the first place. Taking more substantive action will mean enforcing greater regulation, which will undeniably cost us money, just like stopping Rosneft or any of the other oligarchs’ companies from listing on the London Stock Exchange would have cost us money. But it will help protect our society from infiltration by kleptocratic wealth, undermine the Kremlin’s ability to threaten others and – in the long term – weaken Putin’s hold on power. In the past, such policies have been blocked by the Treasury, which has prioritised maintaining the underregulation that it considers crucial to the competitiveness of the City over defending the integrity of our financial system. And new regulations will undoubtedly be unpopular with wealthy people who have for decades been using exactly the same tricks as the oligarchs to minimise their taxes and disguise their wealth. The question now for government ministers is this: are they prepared to put their support for the Ukrainians ahead of the tax breaks and loopholes enjoyed by their friends, donors and – in the case of Rishi Sunak – wives? Because until they are, they won’t really be helping the Ukrainians at all.

4/8/2022,"Just because many of us have been walking for most of our lives doesn’t mean we’re doing it in the best way. So what is the healthiest way to walk? I spoke to Annabel Streets, author of 52 Ways to Walk: The Surprising Science of Walking for Wellness and Joy, One Week at a Time. There are many areas of health – mental health, emotional health, gut health, etc. Can walking really help them all?I think so! The air you want to walk in should be full of negative ions, which happens where water is crashing. Waterfalls are brilliant. One study compared different groups of care workers. One group walked near waterfalls, one stayed inside, and another walked in the mountains. The waterfall group had far less psychological distress, improved lung capacity and much higher levels of an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin, which is found in the mucosal lining of our mouth and nose, and in our gut. Alas, there are no waterfalls where I live in London.Head to a park and find a water fountain. It’s the best we’ve got. What’s the best time to walk?That depends. If you’re a poor sleeper, you need to walk for at least 10 minutes within an hour of waking. It’s no good being by a window – you need maximum light in the back of your eyes telling your body to sleep again in 15 hours. A walk in the late afternoon also gives your body a reminder, ideally in a forest. One of the studies I looked at found that for people who walked in a pine forest, the effect was similar to taking a sleeping pill. If you’re walking for mood, the science says get out early too. But I hate mornings!Night walks can be good. Especially if there’s a full moon. The average person sleeps 20 minutes less on a full moon. Our ancestors would have used the moonlight as an extended day – we’re designed to be out in it. I’m guessing my usual walk through congested streets is not the healthiest.Afraid not. I do see some good buildings though.If you’re doing that, I always tell people to look out for fractals. Fractals?A fractal is a repeating pattern, often found in nature and absolutely everywhere in architecture. When we look at a fractal, we instinctively relax – our brain produces feelgood alpha waves. That sounds like an improvement on just reading emails.I’d urge you not to do that – you could get hit by a car! And you can’t hear the birdsong. A study found that people who lived in cities had their mood lifted by birdsong. Also, what happens to your body when you look out at the horizon? Your stress level drops, the cortisol falls. It’s why we love views. You talking about birdsong gave me a flashback. The nightclubs would kick out at 4am, but it would be a little while until the first tube, so my friends and I would walk in the direction of home until we could get on a train. It was an almost religious experience. The city’s empty and the sun’s coming up, you can hear the birds, see the buildings, feel their history …Wow, that sounds like a good reason to go clubbing. “I’ve gone clubbing, but only for the walk home.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,What is the healthiest way to walk?

4/8/2022,"The mental health of the UK’s transgender community is at crisis point, with many people “hanging by a string”, professional bodies and support groups have told the Guardian. The stark warnings follow a week of intensified public discussion of transgender rights as the government moved to exclude trans people from a ban on conversion practices. The Equality and Human Rights Commission also published guidance saying transgender people could legitimately be excluded from single-sex services if the reasons were “justifiable and proportionate”. The focus on such issues has raised concerns among experts, who see a direct line between statements made by politicians and individual wellbeing. “There is strong evidence that minorities experience greater levels of stress when their rights are being debated,” said Dr Adam Jowett, the chair of the British Psychological Society’s Sexualities Section. “The mental health of the trans community has been affected not just in the past week but over the past few years: by the perception that the government is hostile to trans rights, the sense that they are not protected and the fact this is happening against a backdrop of hate crime and transphobia on the rise”. Jowett conducted research for the UK government on conversion practices last year ahead of its consultation on a ban. He emphasised that all psychological and medical bodies in the UK – including the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association – were united in the view that the practice was unethical, potentially harmful and not supported by evidence. “We feel it is absolutely necessary for transgender people to have the same level of protection as everybody else.” In the past week, support services for trans people have reported an increase in demand: the anti-abuse charity Galop, for example, said it was taking calls to its helpline “from trans people who feel exhausted and dispirited by their exclusion from the government’s proposed conversion therapy ban, and the surrounding conversation on social media and in the news”. Meanwhile, individual families contacted the Guardian privately to express their despair at what was described as “a perfect storm of transphobic misunderstanding and misinformation, which is hurting the same vulnerable young people they claim to be protecting”. “All LGBT young people, but trans young people especially, are suffering a crisis in mental health,” said Dominic Arnall, the chief executive of Just Like Us, a UK-wide charity that works with schools to support LGBT+ youth. “It’s driven by the constant drip-drip of negativity from government, media and others, creating a climate that says they are not worthy of the same human rights and freedoms the rest of us enjoy. “The past week in particular has been tremendously difficult for trans young people. They hear the prime minister describing conversion therapy as ‘abhorrent’ but then not banning it for trans people.” Oscar Hoyle, who runs Blossom, a support service for LGBT+ young adults in Surrey, said: “You can’t look at a computer without seeing something questioning a fundamental aspect of who you are. “It puts the young people we work with in the position where they never know who is going to support them and who is going to question who they are. “Members of our community are struggling and I know from experience that the mental health of a large number of trans and non-binary people at the moment is certainly hanging by a string,” they said. But they added: “As trans people I think we develop a really unique sense of resilience which means no matter what we face, our community will continue to move forwards. Things are incredibly hard but I don’t want to underestimate the true value of our community, the wider LGBTQ+ community, and allies coming together to support and uplift trans individuals.” This exclusion of transgender people from the conversion practices ban prompted the resignation of a senior equality adviser and cancellation of the government’s flagship international LGBTQ+ conference in the face of a mass withdrawal of stakeholder support. Boris Johnson then stated that “biological males” should not compete in female sporting events and that women should have “dedicated” spaces in hospitals, prisons and changing rooms. This last statement reflects new – non-statutory – guidance published by the EHRC on single-sex services. Critics argue this focuses on the exclusion of trans people, and specifically trans women, risking illegal discrimination. The guidance was welcomed by gender-critical feminists as “a big step forward”. Helen Belcher, the chair of the education and advocacy group TransActual and a Lib Dem councillor, said: “I am furious that our equalities body is telling me that I am a second-class citizen and can only do things if everyone else is OK with it. Now every trans woman in the country is gearing up to fight to have a wee. It’s vile. “I transitioned around 20 years ago. In the early days you feel very vulnerable, like your appearance is being scrutinised, but then your confidence grows. But in the last few months, all that fear has come back, the same feelings I thought I’d left behind 20 years ago.”",News/Society,"Trans people’s mental health is at crisis point in UK, warn experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/trans-people-mental-health-crisis-point-uk-warn-experts

4/8/2022,"It says much about Leeds’ travails against Watford that the last man to score a winner for them at Vicarage Road was Ross McCormack. That was in May 2013, when a side managed by Brian McDermott triumphed in a chaotic game where Troy Deeney was sent off and the hosts missed out on automatic promotion. With Watford scrabbling for Premier League survival and Leeds only six points clear of the drop, this game is similarly high stakes. Joe Gelhardt has shaken off a knock and could feature, but Jesse Marsch will be without Patrick Bamford, Jamie Shackleton, Junior Firpo and Tyler Roberts.

Chelsea will want to bounce back from two heavy home defeats to Real Madrid and Brentford as their season threatens to fizzle out.

They host Spurs at a time when Antonio Conte’s side appear to be finding peak form as they chase a top-four spot – three wins on the spin, 21 goals in six league matches, and scorers popping up from all over the pitch. Tottenham won the reverse fixture in October after Matt Targett unluckily deflected the ball into his own net, and – curiously – “own goals” is Spurs’ joint-third-top scorer in the Premier League this season, with six in total.
