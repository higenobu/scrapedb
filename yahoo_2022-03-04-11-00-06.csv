3/4/2022,"MEDYKA, POLAND — While busloads of Ukrainian refugees streamed across the border Thursday into Poland, small groups of determined-looking men were heading in the opposite direction to fight the Russians. Most appeared to be Ukrainian émigrés in their 20s and 30s, but some could also be heard speaking other languages. Many of the men had black tactical boots hanging from their duffle bags. And judging by the license plates of the cars dropping them off at the crossing in this Polish border town, they had come from as far away as Italy and Germany. Among those heading east into Ukraine was a man with a military bearing from Great Britain who identified himself only as Ian and said he was 62. “I’m going to fight,” Ian told NBC News correspondent Jay Gray. Then Ian walked up to the Ukrainian border guards, who looked him over, checked his papers and sent him to the left to join the other hard-eyed men waiting for a bus bound for the battle against the Russians. Ian and the others were answering the call that embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on his website Sunday for “friends of peace and democracy” to join their new brigade, the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine, and help them fight the Russians. “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” his statement said. Zelenskyy said Thursday that some 16,000 foreigners have already joined the brigade, a number NBC News could not immediately confirm. As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Europe as at least a million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began. Co-founder of Project Dynamo, Bryan Stern, joins News NOW to discuss how his organization, made up of mostly current and former U.S. service members, is working to rescue Ukrainians trying to flee the country. The Ukrainian leader’s appeal harkened back to the 1930s when the embattled Spanish government called for international volunteers to help fight in the civil war against Gen. Ferdinand Franco and the fascists, a struggle Ernest Hemingway immortalized in “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” In France, the Ukrainian Embassy has been actively recruiting former soldiers to join the fight, and it set up a Facebook page with information and paperwork they would need to fill out, The New York Times reported. More than 1 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children, have fled in the eight days since the Russians invaded their country, and the pace at which civilians have been crossing the border into Poland has been accelerating as the fighting has grown fiercer. An army of Polish volunteers backed by relief workers from other countries has set up refugee aid centers in nearby cities, like Przemysl, an ancient city of some 61,000 people. From there, Ukrainian refugees have been bused to major Polish cities like Warsaw, Krakow and Gdansk, as well as to Germany, Austria and even Denmark. In recent days, the border crossing at Medyka has been the scene of emotional reunions as émigré Ukrainians reunited with loved ones who had traveled for days to get there. There have been outbursts of anger from Ukrainians frustrated by the bureaucracy on both sides of the border. And there have been allegations of racism lodged by Africans and Asians who had been living in Ukraine and who say their escape was delayed by Ukrainian border guards. But on Thursday, the evacuation appeared to be going smoothly. Rather than marching across the border, most of the escapees boarded buses provided by Poland's national fire department on the Ukrainian side. Waiting on the Polish side was a couple who gave their names as Jim and Alyona and said they had driven to Medyka from Belgium. Alyona, who's Ukrainian, was waiting to collect her sister, who had been traveling by train for several days from the city of Dnipro. Visibly distraught, Alyona said she had heard from her sister, who was still at least three to five hours away from Medyka. ""I will wait here all night if I have to,"" Alyona said.

3/4/2022,"Authorities in China's Shaanxi Province said they are now investigating a Chinese man for allegedly abusing his mentally ill wife and locking her in an iron cage.

The allegation was reportedly posted on WeChat by the public account Xianshidemuyang (The Look of Reality), claiming that the man, identified as Li Limin, had previously boasted about abusing his wife, Tang Xiaoyu, on his Kuaishou account.

Li’s videos on the local Tik Tok-like video-sharing app have reportedly been removed, while his account, which had over 780,000 followers, appears to have been banned on Kuaishou.

Li was reportedly a jobless man from the city of Yulin who ended up running livestreams. To allegedly make his streaming more interesting for his viewers, he shared details about how he has abused his wife. Sources claimed that in one of Li’s livestreams, he told a story about how he bound Tang to a chair for three days.

Citing a witness, Xianshidemuyang alleged that Li was seen locking his wife in an iron cage attached to the back of his motorized tricycle when he had to leave his house. Xianshidemuyang’s WeChat post also included screenshots from one of Li’s live streams which showed alleged ligature and burn marks on Tang’s body.

Li was accused of taking Tang from the side of a road in 2009, forcing her to marry him and holding her against her will since then. Unconfirmed sources who reached out to Xianshidemuyang claimed that Tang looks similar to Wang Guohong, a student from Qinghai Province who went missing in 2009.

Li allegedly bragged on Kuaishou about having a son and daughter with Tang in 2012 and 2015, respectively. He purportedly sold their daughter for 30,000 yuan (approximately $4,746) and kept their son.

Li has also been accused of causing Tang’s mental disorder since he would beat her often and confine her whenever she attempted to flee. According to an unidentified source, Li earned fame and fortune through his livestreams and his alleged work with other vloggers by “helping find missing people.”

Tang’s case came to light after a similar story was reported in late January about a video showing a mentally ill woman left in an outdoor shed with a chain tied around her neck. Authorities launched an investigation into the mother of eight after a video of her went viral and public outrage grew.
