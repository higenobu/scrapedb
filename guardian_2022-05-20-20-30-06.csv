5/20/2022,"Children who spend more time engaged in adventurous play involving an element of risk have fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to research found the effect was more pronounced among children from lower income families. The study set out to test theories that adventurous play – climbing trees, riding bikes, jumping from high surfaces, or playing out of adult sight – offers learning opportunities that help build resilience in children and protect mental health. Researchers surveyed two samples of parents of children aged five to 11 – 427 parents in Northern Ireland and a nationally representative group of 1,919 parents in England, Wales and Scotland – and asked them about their child’s play, their mental health before the pandemic and their mood during the first Covid-19 lockdown. They found that children who spent more time playing adventurously outside had fewer “internalising problems”, which are characterised as anxiety and depression, and they were also more positive during the first lockdown. The effects were relatively small but consistent after factoring in a range of demographic variables, including a child’s sex and age, as well as parents’ employment status and mental health. The larger sample also found the association was stronger for children from lower income families than their peers from wealthier backgrounds. As a result, the study’s authors are calling on planning authorities to ensure that every child, particularly those from disadvantaged families who cannot pay for additional, organised adventure experiences, has free access to a safe space for adventurous outdoor play close to their home. The study, Child’s Play: Examining the Association Between Time Spent Playing and Child Mental Health, published in the journal Child Psychiatry & Human Development, comes at a time when child psychologists are worried that children have less opportunity for adventurous play out of sight of adults, that Covid has limited play, and playgrounds have become sanitised amid fears of litigation. Helen Dodd, professor of child psychology at the University of Exeter, who led the study, said: “We’re more concerned than ever about children’s mental health, and our findings highlight that we might be able to help protect children’s mental health by ensuring they have plentiful opportunities for adventurous play. “This is really positive because play is free, instinctive and rewarding for children, available to everyone, and doesn’t require special skills. We now urgently need to invest in and protect natural spaces, well-designed parks and adventure playgrounds, to support the mental health of our children.” In July, one of Europe’s biggest indoor children’s play centres is set to open in Wetherby in Yorkshire, promising a new and challenging experience for children. The £3.5m Playhive at Stockeld Park features a series of themed and interconnected adventure zones in a doughnut-shaped building with a 10-metre (33ft) tower at its centre. Its creator, Peter Grant, said: “We didn’t want the usual soft play scene, but one that truly inspires imaginations. The idea is children of all ages can do most of it, but some of it is more challenging for older children.” Belinda Kirk, explorer, mother and author of the Adventure Revolution: The life changing power of choosing challenge, welcomed the University of Exeter findings on adventurous play. “There is this incredibly normal instinct to want to protect your children, which I have in bountiful amounts. “But we live in a world that is so obsessed with physical safety that we’ve forgotten to balance it with mental health. We’ve prioritised physical safety or physical health over mental health, so we’re not letting kids fall down and learn to pick themselves up again, and therefore build up coping mechanisms and resilience.” Previous research found that primary-age children are not allowed to play outside on their own until they are two years older than their parents’ generation. While their parents were allowed to play outside unsupervised by the age of nine on average, today’s children are 11 by the time they reach the same milestone. 1. Go for a walk in the dark. Take a torch to make it more fun. “Doing it at night makes it all the more exciting, because even environments you know, like a footpath near your house, feel different. It smells different, the wildlife’s different, it’s a proper adventure,” says Kirk. 2. Go for a night cycle. 3. Explore woods alone or with a friend. 4. Camp out overnight. “Sleeping out under the stars is a hugely exciting thing,” says Kirk. “Even just in your back garden.” 5. Go swimming or paddling in a river or lake. 6. Go geocaching. It’s a treasure hunt. Just get the app, create an account, choose your geocache from the millions available – there are more than 8,000 in London alone – and off you go. 7. Climb a mountain (or a local hill). “Summiting your first mountain is a wonderful thing to do,” says Kirk. “It could be Snowden, with your parents, or a hill near your house.” 8. Try out new skills on a skateboard, roller skates or a bike. 9. Create an obstacle course inside or outside. 10. Do a source-to-sea river walk.

5/20/2022,"Roker Park, the final game of 1989-90. Sunderland were sure of their place in the playoffs; Oldham knew they would miss out, largely because of the strains of an extraordinary season in which they had reached the League Cup final and the FA Cup semi-final. Oldham won, 3-2, and as the final whistle went, home fans invaded the pitch. Slowly they made for the corner of the Roker End where the away fans were housed. I was on the terrace a few yards away and remember clearly the sense of sudden anxiety as my dad gripped my arm and started to make for the exit. But then something remarkable happened. The invaders stopped a few yards from the corner flag, raised their hands above their heads and clapped, a salute for Oldham’s extraordinary season that would end with nothing. As Mike Keegan’s book on that season, This Is How It Feels, makes clear, that moment entered Oldham folklore, confirmed to them that the rest of the country also respected what they had achieved, those performances against Arsenal, Everton, Aston Villa and Manchester United. It remains one of the most surprisingly moving things I’ve seen in a football ground. That was a very unusual invasion, and it was never clear at what point the decision was collectively taken to applaud the away fans. But even the more common-or-garden invasions can be glorious, an ecstatic release of pent-up emotion at the end of a tense game at the end of a season. The temptation is to say, let it go, that football cannot simultaneously celebrate and market the passion it generates and then protest at these euphoric outpourings. But the problem is, some fans can’t be trusted, and no matter whether the crowd numbers a dozen or several thousand, it only takes one to make an invasion extremely dangerous. In the past week, we’ve seen four incidents in England. Port Vale fans appeared to punch and kick Swindon players after their League Two play-off semi-final win. Mansfield’s Jordan Bowery was manhandled and a flare thrown by Northampton fans after their League Two play-off semi-final win. The Crystal Palace manager, Patrick Vieira, seemed to aim a kick at an Everton fan who had been taunting him after they had confirmed Premier League survival. And worst of all came at the City Ground on Monday when, amid other altercations, a Nottingham Forest fan called Robert Biggs head-butted the Sheffield United substitute Billy Sharp, leaving Sharp requiring stitches and earning himself a 24-week jail sentence. Two things appear to be happening simultaneously. The first is that there are more pitch invasions than there used to be. That in part is simple copycat behaviour: one club’s fans celebrate with a pitch invasion and so others decide that is also how they should celebrate – while simultaneously realising that there is little chance of mass banning orders being imposed if hundreds run on to the pitch. But there was also a sense in the post-Hillsborough years that invading the pitch was taboo. Invasions had been why fences were erected, and everybody had seen the consequences of that. That Roker Park invasion in 1990 was notably cautious, as though there was a recognition there was a need, as far as possible, to avoid alarm. The generation that understood that almost intuitively has moved on. The second is that those invasions seem more likely to be violent towards opposing players and staff than ever before, and this is a widespread issue; it’s not about one club. Nor is it just about football: violent crime has risen steadily in the UK since 2013. Violent crime by strangers dropped during lockdown, but has accelerated since. More anecdotal evidence would suggest the widespread use of cocaine by fans has added a more aggressive edge to a tribalism fuelled by social media. And that means that, realistically, pitch invasions, however joyous, have to be stopped. It’s a shame, because football is richer for these eruptions of glee, but players, coaches and other fans should never be placed in danger as they manifestly now are. So what can be done? It’s unrealistic to expect stewards on minimum wage, many of whom have received only cursory training, to stand in the way but equally it’s unrealistic, in terms of cost and resources, not to mention the look, for pitches always to be ringed by police. The Football League this week suggested it was considering partial stadium closures as a deterrent, although collective punishments always seem unsatisfactory and it surely can’t be that difficult with CCTV to identify the majority of those responsible. A more straightforward countermeasure may simply be to cover the front few rows of seats with tarpaulin, although that would obviously reduce capacities. But really, more than anything, this is about culture – the culture of football and the culture of society. There’s no reason for fans not to get along: there were two fairly serious incidents involving Eintracht Frankfurt ultras in Seville this week leading to six arrests, but fundamentally tens of thousands from Frankfurt and Rangers drank harmoniously together. It can be done. We live in a world in which mockery and taunting the Other is commonplace. Anybody not of our tribe is contemptible. Everything is reduced to Them and Us. Football has to put immediate safety measures in place to protect players, but the truth is pitch invasions wouldn’t be a problem, these moments of anarchic fun could still be permitted, if people could just stop being idiots.",Sport/Football,Fans’ ugly behaviour is not just about football – it’s about society | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/football-fans-ugly-behaviour-society-pitch-invasions
5/20/2022,"This is a glum, plodding production depicting a grim, hard-hearted world. There is little happiness our young couple can eke out in 1920s Russia, when all around them is a wealth of pain, famine and the ghosts of war. Fraser Grace has developed Bliss from a 1939 short story by Andrey Platonov, a writer dismissed by Stalin for his harsh depiction of Russia. Lyuba (Bess Roche) is a medical student, bright with expectation. Nikita (Jesse Rutherford) has just returned from war, carrying what he has seen in his tortured eyes and shaking hands. Cloaked in grey, the characters are both hungry and lonely; each gravitates towards the other. The supporting actors float around them, foul-mouthed fathers and consumption-riddled friends. Jeremy Killick gets a rough deal as an ethereal homeless man haunting Nikita, spending most of his time curled up silently in a corner. Relentlessly stern, it is clear that the production is searching for a way to convey the weight of war, how conflict stays with you beyond anyone else’s comprehension. The outcome is a long, dour evening. The set, designed by director Paul Bourne, is made up of wooden pallets, arranged carefully in sedate scene transitions into a carpentry workshop, a bed and stepping stones by a river. Everything is done with a steady precision like that needed to slot one piece of wood into another, but it creates an interminable slowness, losing any tension built from the scene before. The cast deliver intense performances, with Rutherford in particular radiating torment in the wildly tangential second half, while Roche offers the play’s only glimpse of hope. But the dialogue direly lacks subtext, with little room for the actors to build around. The production conjures a country full of hardships but this specific tale might work better on the page.

5/20/2022,"With the number of cases of monkeypox in the UK rising to 20 and the infection also being detected in countries from Australia to Portugal we take a look at the situation and whether it is cause for concern. Monkeypox is a viral infection typically found in central and western Africa. Cases, usually small clusters or isolated infections, are sometimes diagnosed in other countries, including the UK where the first case was recorded in 2018 in an individual thought to have contracted the virus in Nigeria. There are two forms of monkeypox, a milder west African strain and a more severe central African, or Congo strain. In the UK and Australia at least, it is thought the recently diagnosed individuals have the west African strain, although not all countries have released such information. According to the UK Health Security Agency, early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills, as well as other features such as exhaustion. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals,” the UKHSA says. “The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks. Monkeypox does not spread easily between humans, and requires close contact. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is thought that human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through large respiratory droplets. “Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC says. “Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.” Monkeypox cases have been confirmed in recent weeks in a number of countries where it is not endemic, including Italy, the US, Canada, Portugal and Sweden, with the first cases reported in Germany and Australia on Friday. Suspected cases have been identified in Spain and France. While some cases have been found in people who have recently travelled to Africa, others have not: of the two Australian cases to date, one was in a man who had recently returned from Europe, while the other was in a man who had recently been to the UK. A case in the US meanwhile appears to be in a man who recently travelled to Canada. The UK is also experiencing cases of monkeypox, with signs that it is spreading in the community. The first recent case was reported on 7 May in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria. A week later a further two patients were reported to be receiving treatment for monkeypox in London. They lived in the same household and their infections are thought to be unconnected to the previous case. On Monday another four cases of monkeypox were reported. These do not appear to be linked to any of the previous cases, with all four in men who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men. Since then a further 13 cases have been confirmed, bringing the UK total to 20. The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that it was now coordinating with UK and other European health officials. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, says the latest cases may be the first time transmission of monkeypox though sexual contact has been documented, but this has not been confirmed, and in any case it is probably close contact that matters. “There is no evidence that it is a sexually transmitted virus, such as HIV,” Head says. “It’s more that here the close contact during sexual or intimate activity, including prolonged skin-to-skin contact, may be the key factor during transmission.” The UKHSA is advising gay and bisexual men, as well as other communities of men who have sex with men, to look out for unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, in particular their genitalia. “Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit,” the UKHSA says. At present, the answer seems to be not very. Experts have suggested it is unlikely there will be very large outbreaks, although it is important contacts of those infected are identified. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at UKHSA, calls the situation “rare and unusual” but adds: “UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact.” On Friday, it emerged that the UK had bought supplies of a vaccine against smallpox – a related but more severe virus that has been eradicated. According to the World Health Organization, “vaccination against smallpox was demonstrated through several observational studies to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox”. The jab may help to prevent monkeypox, or reduce the severity of illness. Reports suggest the vaccine has already been offered to healthcare workers in the UK, although it is unclear how many have been vaccinated. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “Those who have required the vaccine have been offered it.” Spain has also been rumoured to be looking to buy supplies of the vaccine, while other countries – such as the US – have large stockpiles of the jabs.",News/Society,What is monkeypox and should UK residents be worried?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/17/what-is-monkeypox-and-should-uk-residents-be-worried

5/20/2022,"The government’s plans to pay farmers for their stewardship of nature could be delayed or scrapped, it is feared, as hard-right Tory MPs join the campaign against the environmental land management scheme (Elms). The rollout of Elms, seen by some as one of the few positive Brexit dividends, is due to begin this year, with more standards beginning incrementally between 2023 and 2025. Brexit campaigners pointed to the ability to leave the common agricultural policy – the EU’s farm subsidy system – as a good reason to leave the EU. Part of that system involved paying farmers for having land in food production, and this, it has been argued, led to environmental damage across the continent. Michael Gove, as environment secretary and one of the cheerleaders for Brexit, drew up the new system for England’s farmers, paving the way for what he claimed would be a “green Brexit”. But Labour and the Liberal Democrats have joined the National Farmers’ Union in calling for a delay to the scheme, arguing that it is incompatible with the cost of living crisis to pay farmers not to produce food, and instead to create forests and ponds. There are worries within government that those in the right wing of the party have seized this opportunity to get the subsidy scrapped. Sources say Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is believed to have successfully caused the government to drop its post-Brexit animal welfare commitments including a foie gras ban, has been among those putting pressure on the government to drop the Elms scheme. Steve Baker, the MP for High Wycombe, who is widely thought of as being instrumental in the campaign for a hard Brexit, has been openly pushing for Elms to be rethought. Baker, who runs the eurosceptic European Research Group and is a member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which is pushing against the government’s net zero measures, said: “Multiple government ambitions on land use have taken land out of food production. Food security should be as much a national priority as energy security. We must prioritise food security and food chain resilience – cutting unnecessary regulations and interventions, and consider refocusing our food chain functionality.” Defra ministers say they are fighting to keep Elms a priority and that they hope it can still be delivered on time. Victoria Prentis, the farming minister, said: “Abandoning the phaseout of the area-based subsidy would not be the right thing to do for farmers or the environment. In 2017, £1.775bn of payments were made across 85,000 farms – 10% of claimants received half of this total. 33% of farms received less than £5,000 each. “Our new schemes are supporting the choices that individuals take for their own farms and helping to boost their productivity and profitability. We have recently almost trebled our new farming equipment and technology fund to over £48m to support more farmers with their investment plans.” Delaying Elms would put a big dent in the government’s net zero plans, according to analysis by the thinktank Green Alliance. It would reduce agricultural emissions savings in 2035 to half what they could have been if the Elms programme was delivered on time. Because emissions savings are cumulative, this would put more pressure on other areas to decarbonise even faster to make up for this loss, leaving a “substantial gap in the UK’s net zero plans”, according to the report.",News/Environment,Hard-right Tories push to delay environmental land management scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/hard-right-tories-push-delay-environmental-land-management-scheme-brexit
5/20/2022,"The actors Samantha Morton and Cathy Tyson have paid tribute to the late Kay Mellor, calling her a “fighter, a warrior woman and an insanely talented” writer and director. Mellor, who died on Sunday aged 71, wrote numerous TV shows over a 30-year career including Band of Gold in 1995. The series revolved around a group of sex workers who lived and worked in Bradford’s red-light district, and starred a teenage Morton alongside Geraldine James, Cathy Tyson and Barbara Dickson. Band of Gold was a sensation when it premiered on ITV and won plaudits for the human way it told the sex worker’s stories. Its success, Morton said, was a testament to Mellor’s unique vision and her courage to tell overlooked stories. “You really didn’t get writing like that for women on television at the time,” she told the Guardian. “It was a whole series that was written by a woman and starring women, with female directors and producers as well. “It was a working-class drama based on real people that Kay had spoken to, heavily influenced by life on ‘the lane’, and that was utterly groundbreaking. Over 20 million people a week watched it.” The show, Morton added, brought to light the poverty that communities are once again going through today, “particularly northern places where there is abject poverty. It also touched on subjects such as child exploitation and child abuse”. Morton was an unknown 17-year-old when she was cast to play Tracy, a teenage runaway who is abused by her father and becomes hooked on drugs supplied by her pimp. For someone whose own childhood was blighted by sexual abuse in children’s homes, it was a life-changing opportunity that opened new doors. “I found Kay to be so inspirational,” she said. “She was a fighter, a warrior woman and insanely talented. For me, as a young teenager and then young woman in the industry, I was just surrounded by white, middle-aged men who told me how it was meant to be. I had a few issues growing up in regards to male directors and Kay was always unbelievably supportive of me. She would have my back and protect me whilst we were shooting. She would also really listen to us and how we felt.” The role, Morton said, cemented her as an actor. “There’s been nobody like Kay and I doubt there will be again. There was truth in her writing. I was very lucky that I fit the bill, I’m not sure they would cast somebody so young today. I had to do quite graphic sex scenes, and Kay was so supportive if I didn’t want to do things.” The actor went on to feature in a string of productions including opposite Tom Cruise in Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Minority Report and has been nominated for two Academy Awards. But she recalled a time when her working-class background held her back in the industry. “I was lucky enough to play Jane Eyre when Kay wrote an adaptation of it and I was so honoured,” she said. “I was very working-class and normally the actresses that play that role are certainly not from a children’s home in Nottingham. Up until that point I’d auditioned for costume dramas and they always said ‘she just isn’t the right class’. But Kay believed in me. She changed my life.” To this day, Morton said, she had tried and failed to pitch shows to TV companies that explored working-class life and communities. “People want shows like Downton Abbey and The Crown. Band of Gold wasn’t a comedy, it’s not funny. It was hard drama. Each week, you would be going on this journey about the lives of sex workers in Bradford. My character was in a relationship with a woman. It’s absolutely astonishing when you think of it.” Tyson, who played the character of Carol, a mother who turns to sex work to support herself and her young daughter, also told the Guardian what made Band of Gold so unique was that “it was the first series to document both the working lives and personal lives” of sex workers. “Band of Gold humanised sex workers,” she said. “It stripped away the layers of taboo. It also gave female leading roles to half a dozen women. And many great guest roles to women. I’ve a lot to be supremely grateful to Queen Kay Mellor. I truly hope that the series benefited the women it was about. They were very generous with their time and I will never forget my time on three series.” Mellor, who received an OBE for her work in 2009, began a career in TV writing in the 1980s. She spent some time on Coronation Street, being one of the earliest female writers on the show. The first two of three series of Band of Gold were turned into novels, both of which Mellor co-wrote with author John Burke. Her other notable works include Fat Friends, a Bafta-nominated drama about members of a slimming club in Leeds, Girlfriends, which followed the lives of three middle-aged female friends, and The Syndicate, about lottery winners. Morton said she was lost for words over the loss of Mellor. “Kay’s body of work and commitment to making incredible work about working-class people was incredible. We say working-class people, I say normal people,” she added.",Arts/Television & radio,Actors pay tribute to ‘warrior woman’ Kay Mellor,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/20/actors-samantha-morton-cathy-tyson-pay-tribute-to-warrior-woman-kay-mellor

5/20/2022,"Goddard & Gibbs, a laid-back, prettily staged, speciality fish restaurant, may lack a charming harbour view, but it does offer an exciting glimpse of east London nightlife. Inside, the place is a modern, airy, Santa Monica-style seafood brasserie, with large, luxurious booths for group eating, tasteful jazz music and fuzzy, flattering lighting. Outside, the post-6pm-on-a-Saturday high street is lairy, with police vans lining up to begin battle with shoeless mobs of vomiting bottomless brunchers. Goddard & Gibbs has dropped anchor at the new One Hundred Shoreditch hotel, formerly known as the Ace, which had a restaurant called Hoi Polloi. That rather cool, all-day diner was a pleasant enough spot, and you might have seen a minor celebrity or fashion designer barking through a power breakfast, but the food – twists on British and American classics – wasn’t anything to clap like a seal about. Then again, restaurants in hotels very rarely are. There are exceptions, but most rely heavily on the hotel’s guests being chivvied there for one night to eat mediocre food that at least looks passable with an Instagram filter on it. Cleverly, the name Goddard & Gibbs doesn’t seem as if it would be anything like that at all. Rather, it sounds like some established firm of fishmongers that has put a handful of tables in front of its counter in order to serve the day’s best catch. So I booked a table absentmindedly, with one eye on the website and the other on administering the cat’s hyperthyroid medicine, firmly believing I was off for dinner at a tiny, independent restaurant down some Shoreditch back street. Obviously, it was nothing of the sort. “Inspired by the quaint fishing villages and busy seaside towns dotted along Britain’s coastline,” the restaurant website reads, as if the copywriting had been farmed out to an enthusiastic someone in Azerbaijan who had clearly never seen Cleethorpes or Bognor, or, for that matter, the enormo dining room in Shoreditch they were describing. Still, the website also promises a thoughtfully curated, almost all-pescatarian menu, and Goddard & Gibbs definitely does seafood, beginning with Maldon oysters, raw Orkney scallops with elderflower, dressed crab and steamed mussels, before moving on to hake kiev, poached Cornish pollack and skate wing with XO butter. And that all seemed very encouraging – until the food began to arrive, when I started to suspect that here was a kitchen doing the very minimum it could to push out hundreds of covers a day, with few flourishes, scant innovation and often little flavour at all. Six oysters turned up on a silver stand with a red-wine shallot dressing – that is, exactly how we’ve been eating them in the UK for the past 50 years – followed by a plate of yuzu-cured chalk stream trout that wasn’t particularly zinging with freshness. Sea bream ceviche was marginally better, with a soy dressing and topped with slivers of scotch bonnet. A bowl of “ember-baked” potatoes with cod’s roe was served with such little attention to detail that I began to feel offended. It consisted of 10 unseasoned new potatoes that seemed more steamed than baked, and they came topped with a dot of low-grade taramasalata goo. Just up the road on Redchurch Street, Brat’s legendary smoked potatoes make me breathless; in comparison, Goddard & Gibbs’ spuds were like a terrible covers band honking through my favourite hits. We ordered “the catch of the day”, which that evening was more sea bream, this time butterflied and overcooked by about five minutes. It lacked anything saucy, oily or buttery to help it along, apart from some shaved fennel and more thinly sliced scotch bonnet. On the side, and for a mere £5, we received about 100g of overcooked broccoli with a scattering of the non-expensive kind of flaked almonds. The overall mood of the experience puzzles me. Why open a gigantic seafood restaurant with little care or attention to the fine culinary art of fish cookery? The staff were charming, sometimes attentive and dealt stoically with the fact that those lovely, six-person booths are so deep, they can barely hand the food into them safely. By 8pm, the front of house were already struggling to cope and turning away crowds of hopeful walk-ins at the door. We had psyched ourselves up to see what their rendition of fried doughnut, malt ice-cream, miso caramel and peanut dust might be like, and we waited and waited, before eventually realising that our pudding order never reached the kitchen. Goddard & Gibbs is a confused restaurant that’s perfect for people who are on holiday in Shoreditch, who may want to drink heavily and have a lovely time talking to friends, and who don’t really care if they don’t remember a whole lot about dinner.

5/20/2022,"Tell Me an Ending by Jo Harkin (Hutchinson Heinemann, £16.99)This compelling cautionary tale is set in an alternative present when it’s possible to have painful memories removed. Patients at the Nepenthe Clinic may choose to be either “self-informed”, remaining aware that they have had a portion of their past erased, or “self-confidential”, having the knowledge of erasure excised along with the memory. However, not only does this willed diminution of the self fail to bring with it the bliss of ignorance but, after the procedure has been shown to be faulty, Nepenthe is compelled to offer restoration to all clients, including those with no memory of having received treatment in the first place. Interconnecting narratives by multiple characters, including former and prospective Nepenthe patients and Noor, a psychologist from the clinic who comes to suspect that her boss is up to no good, weave into an intelligent ensemble piece that raises fascinating questions about how we use memory both to create and dismantle ourselves, and the ultimate mystery of who, or possibly what, “myself” actually is. Wrong Place Wrong Time by Gillian McAllister (Michael Joseph, £14.99)Another ingeniously plotted genre-bender – one in which time travels backwards. Set in Crosby, Merseyside, the action begins with conscientious divorce lawyer Jen Brotherhood witnessing her 18-year-old son, Todd, fatally stab a stranger in front of the family home for no apparent reason. The boy tells her and his father that “there was no choice”, and, when taken to the police station, refuses a solicitor. The following morning, Jen’s first thought on waking is to help her son, who is being held in custody – then she realises that it is not the day after but the day before, and the murder has not yet taken place. Each day she regresses, initially by only 24 hours but then to points in her life that have significance for what is to come, and she must search the past for the means to prevent the future crime from happening. It’s easy for characters to become ciphers in books that require this much fancy footwork for the internal logic to remain intact, but McAllister succeeds in making us care, and the result is a tour de force. Oxblood by Tom Benn (Bloomsbury, £16.99)Many crimes have already happened prior to the start of Benn’s novel, which deals with the legacy of violent men. The Dodds family once ruled Manchester’s underworld but, by 1985, kingpin Jim and his son Sefton are long dead and 22-year-old grandson Kelly, about to be released from prison, is the sole adult male representative. The three generations of Dodds women who share a house in Wythenshawe, a place where there is “no good to be done or honest work to be had”, are each, in their different ways, prisoners of the past. Matriarch Nedra seeks consolation in the Catholic church and plays grandmother to half the estate; daughter-in-law Carol is still grieving for her murdered lover; and 15-year-old Jen, full of sexual bravado, tears at the narrow strip of life on offer and has entirely rejected her as-yet unnamed and unregistered baby. This trio of strong female, working-class voices, each telling her own story, is an absolute triumph: complex, haunting and powerful, this is a blazing tale of complicity, shame, love and hope. The Island by Adrian McKinty (Orion, £12.99)Hoping to bring his newly reconfigured family together, fortysomething American doctor Tom Baxter has piggybacked a holiday in Australia on to a work conference. However, 14-year-old Olivia and 12-year-old Owen, who are considerably closer in age to second wife Heather than he is and consider her to be full of “Millennial Hipster bullshit”, have other ideas. Things seem to be improving when they visit a remote private island where – for a price – they can see exotic fauna, but turn nasty after Tom accidentally runs over one of the O’Neill family, who are the place’s only inhabitants. There are definite shades of Deliverance in the ensuing manhunt, but it’s Heather and the children who find their inner strength as the Baxters fight for survival in this tense, pacy page-turner from the author of The Chain. Dear Little Corpses by Nicola Upson (Faber, £12.99)The 10th book in Upson’s Josephine-Tey-as-detective series is set on the eve of the second world war when, in a febrile atmosphere of uncertainty not entirely dissimilar to that of March 2020, the children of Britain’s cities were evacuated to the comparative safety of the countryside. When a little girl goes missing from the Suffolk village of Polstead where Josephine and her partner Marta live, suspicion is rife, while in London, their policeman friend Archie Penrose investigates the case of a man’s body discovered in a Shoreditch tenement. With excellent period detail and a strong plot, Dear Little Corpses is well up to the standard of its predecessors. A second real-life crime fiction writer, Margery Allingham – who actually did live down the road, in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex – puts in an appearance and helps with the sleuthing.",Arts/Books,The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/20/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup

5/20/2022,"Hearts had more cause than would be customary to revel in Scottish Cup semi-final success over their city rivals, Hibs. The securing of a place in the Europa League playoff round means guaranteed European group stage football, if perhaps in the Conference League, next season. With that comes a financial boost loosely estimated at £5m and widely categorised as a game changer. The mistake, however, would be in assuming Hearts have any interest in parading balance sheets. Saturday’s meeting with Rangers provides opportunity to win the Scottish Cup for only the ninth time in a club history hurtling towards 150 years. “I want to make sure we are at least third in the league before trying to eat into the gap [to the top two] but I don’t want us to be a club that ‘wins’ third place every year,” says Andrew McKinlay, the Hearts chief executive. “I am trying not to let myself think what it will be like if we win this cup. You could only appreciate the enormity of it if it happens. It means so much to Hearts; look at how the teams who won cups previously here are revered. It doesn’t matter whether these are the best teams Hearts have ever had or not. Whoever plays on Saturday, if they win that cup they will forever be club legends.” If Celtic can be delighted with the reclaiming of the title and Rangers with a run to the Europa League final, there should be pride at Tynecastle over this campaign. Having returned to the top division – and amid grumbling from their supporter base at performances – Robbie Neilson’s team coasted into third place. High praise is due to Neilson, the sporting director Joe Savage, chair Ann Budge and McKinlay. Hearts kept cool heads when their head coach was under extreme pressure, largely because of a Scottish Cup exit at the hands of the Highland League’s Brora Rangers last March. “It doesn’t really matter whether you think that was over the top; it was what it was,” McKinlay says. “It helps that Robbie understands the expectations of the fans. It probably gave me a better understanding of the expectations of the Hearts support. I know when Robbie speaks to new players that he tells them about an expectation to win every game, especially at Tynecastle. “I think of the interviews I had at the beginning of this season and there was a lot of negativity, a lot of: ‘What if you start slowly?’ I genuinely didn’t think we would but you never really know until you start playing. It went the other way: we got really positive momentum. It was a great start to the season and we never looked back. “There’s a chance – depending on injuries – of just one Brora participant starting this Saturday. None of us will ever suggest anything other than that result being utterly unacceptable.” Yet that evening seemed to kickstart a rebuild and attitude shift that has served Hearts well. Hearts have legitimate aspirations of raising annual income levels to £25m and more before long. The backdrop to that is unusual. The supporter-led Foundation of Hearts, the club’s main shareholder, makes significant annual donations. So, too, and to the tune of millions, do benefactors including the philanthropist James Anderson. Other areas of the Scottish game also benefited from Anderson’s extraordinary kindness during the pandemic. “The only thing he has ever asked for is that he doesn’t have to wear a tie in our boardroom,” says McKinlay. “He wants to know what more he can do to help, not just financially. He wants us to be better. He really encourages us to stretch ourselves. Why does he do it? My perception is that he was very taken by Ann totally changing the culture of the club. Hearts were put back into the middle of the community and he liked that. I think he is the best thing to have happened to Scottish football since I don’t know when. His generosity is incredible.” It is unclear whether Anderson must don neckwear at Hampden Park. More certain is that Hearts would celebrate glory in an emotional manner that would register far more than European bounties.",Sport/Football,‘If they win they’ll be legends’: stakes high for Hearts in Scottish Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/if-they-win-theyll-be-legends-stakes-high-for-hearts-in-scottish-cup-final
5/20/2022,"China has been urged to name a date for a key UN nature summit this year, amid growing frustration with Beijing and concerns among experts that we are “sleeping through this cataclysmic climate extinction”. After two years of delays, governments had been scheduled to meet in Kunming, China, for Cop15 in late April to negotiate this decade’s targets to halt and reverse the rampant destruction of ecosystems and wildlife crucial to human civilisation. It had been hoped the summit would be a “Paris moment” for biodiversity, with China holding the presidency for a major UN environmental agreement for the first time. But after successive pandemic-related delays, and now a Covid-19 outbreak the Chinese government is struggling to control, there is no date for the summit despite dire scientific warnings about a human-driven sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. At a bureau meeting of the UN convention on biological diversity on Thursday, China was again unable to provide a date for the event, which it had previously indicated might take place at the end of August. Oscar Soria, campaign director of the activism site Avaaz, said: “It’s unbelievable that China is not able to provide any answers [about the date for Cop15]. It sends the wrong message – that this is not important, and can be postponed, even though we are in an ecological emergency and this cannot wait. “The outcomes of this convention will impact the next 10 years. We’re seeing very pessimistic signs that this Cop is going nowhere,” he said. “The logistics of the Cop are as important as the substance of the Cop – a badly organised Cop means the delegates are in a bad mood and it won’t be productive.” With big Chinese cities under lockdown and strict border restrictions still in place, holding a large international event in Kunming, in China’s south-western Yunnan province, appears unrealistic. The UN will now draw up a range of alternative venues for Cop15 and make a decision before the final round of pre-Cop15 negotiations in Nairobi at the end of June. The UK, France, Canada and Turkey are all possible destinations if the event is moved, the Guardian understands, although China would retain the presidency of the summit. One person at Thursday’s meeting, who did not want to be named, said the potential relocation raised the prospect of an unprecedented clash if China did not agree that the event should be moved outside its borders. Draft targets for the biodiversity agreement to be negotiated at Cop15 include proposals to protect 30% of land and sea, cuts to chemical runoff from agriculture and restoring at least a fifth of degraded freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Doug Flynn, a biodiversity financing specialist, said: “The political process feels as though it’s being ignored – not treated with the seriousness it deserves. Every time you push it down the road, you weaken it because you’ve got less time to actually action it and make it real … The political process is essential because it sets the playing field. Policy is the most powerful tool we have in this fight. “For someone working in the sector for so long, it feels like we’re sleeping through this cataclysmic climate extinction,” he said. “The deafening silence of collapsing ecosystems seems to be matched by the deafening silence of global action, and that has to change.”",News/Environment,Sleepwalking into disaster: China pressed to come up with date for Cop15,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/sleepwalking-into-disaster-china-urged-end-delays-set-date-kunming-cop15-un-summit-aoe
5/20/2022,"Royalty and the pedestal-prison of womanhood is the theme of this new film from Austrian director Marie Kreutzer, imagining the home life of the Hapsburg Empress Elizabeth of Austria in 1877, the year of her 40th birthday. Like Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette and Pablo Larraín’s Princess Diana, the kaiserin lives in a luxurious delirium of loneliness: notionally cherished, actually patronised. The movie even shows the empress riding at the Northamptonshire estates of Diana’s ancestor, the fifth Earl Spencer – and enjoying there a capricious romantic flirtation with her riding instructor. It’s broadly historically accurate, though this doesn’t apply to the use of Help Me Make It Through the Night on the soundtrack or indeed Elizabeth’s encounter with later inventions such as cinema and heroin. But Kreutzer sees her political melancholy as part of the tension that led to the first world war. Elizabeth is brilliantly played by Vicky Krieps as mysterious and sensual, imperious and severe: a woman of passions and discontents who faces icy distaste from the court and the family of her unfaithful husband Franz Joseph (Florian Teichtmeister) – this is because of her sympathies for the Hungarian part of the Habsburg empire and her intimacy with the worldly Hungarian Count Andrássy (Tamás Lengyel). Snickering Viennese attendants and officials impugn her Austrian loyalties as they body-shame Elizabeth – every day she faces the literal and figurative struggle to fit into her corsage and get down to a terrifying 18 inches around the waist. Elizabeth wears violet gowns, violet parasols, smokes violet cigarettes and distributes violet-scented chocolates to the unfortunates in hospitals and asylums. She only really smiles at the sight of her dogs and is utterly devastated when the horse that threw her has to be shot. When travelling incognito in Vienna (to spy on her husband’s mistress) she wears a dark veil – and requires an attendant to pose as her in this veil for a formal event while she is indoors shooting up. Later, she suffers the indignity of being congratulated on her atypical poise on this occasion. Elizabeth’s whole life is veiled, and Kreutzer sees her style of dress and existence almost as a variation of court mourning. The movie has her living in a series of huge, chilly salons and gloomy dining rooms from which she takes refuge in bathrooms, subjecting herself to various self-harming weight-loss regimes. She is a lonely figure, galloping unattended across various European estates. She remembers the alcoholism of her Bavarian father, who would put away seven tankards of beer of an evening and she confesses that she thought all grownups slurred their speech after dark. In many ways this is a study in anger, and it is an austere and angular picture. Krieps gives an exhilaratingly fierce, uningratiating performance. Kreutzer’s last film, The Ground Beneath My Feet, from 2019, had just the same shrewd sense of how women are isolated and restricted by whatever status they have been able to cultivate. For Elizabeth, the personal is political.

5/20/2022,"In a move that could provide some income for homeless people and clean up the streets, the Catalan government is looking at paying €4 to anyone who hands in a pack’s-worth of cigarette ends at a recycling point. The cost of the proposal would be covered by a 20-cent levy on each cigarette, its proponents say, which would nearly double the price of a pack of Marlboro Red from about €5 (£4.25), compared with about £13 in the UK. A similar levy on plastic bottles and aluminium cans introduced in New York City in 1982 has provided the homeless with a small but steady income. “We want to put a stop to the present situation where around 70% of cigarette butts end up either on the ground or in the sea,” Isaac Peraire, the head of the Catalan waste agency, told El Periódico earlier this week. According to the EU, cigarette butts are the second-most common single-use plastic found on European beaches – and the environmental organisation Ocean Conservancy says that of all the rubbish thrown into the sea, butts are the most numerous. In an effort to limit marine pollution, smoking will be banned on all of Barcelona’s city beaches from July. Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government is also planning to overhaul the country’s smoking laws to make it illegal to light up on the outside terraces of bars and restaurants, on beaches, and at open-air sports venues. According to figures from 2019, 19.7% of Spaniards smoke on a daily basis, slightly above the EU average of 18.4%. The three EU countries with the highest rates of smoking are Bulgaria (28.7%), Greece (23.6%) and Latvia (22.1%). The details of the levy plan have yet to be confirmed but one proposal is that the butts could be returned to the tobacconist or kiosk where the cigarettes were bought. “The idea isn’t to generate income but to reduce the environmental impact of these products,” Peraire said. “It’s hoped that one day this measure will cease to be necessary because the problem will have disappeared.” Meanwhile, the Spanish government is proposing that cigarette manufacturers should pay the cost of sweeping up butts and should educate the public not to discard them because they contain an environmentally damaging cellulose acetate. Andrés Zamorano, the president of the National Committee for the Prevention of Tobacco Use, said he was in favour of the measure because “tobacco comes at a high cost, not just from an environmental point of view, but because it pollutes public spaces”. Zamorano conceded, however, that tobacco companies were likely to add the clean-up cost to the price of their products. Ismael Aznar Cano, director general for quality and assessment at Spain’s environment ministry, said the proposal came within the context of a law on waste due to take effect at the start of 2023. The law will prohibit the sale of plastic cotton buds, cutlery, plates, expanded polystyrene cups and plastic straws, although cigarette butts are not yet covered by the law. Spain is not the only country trying to address the issue. In 2016, Naman Gupta and Vishal Kanet, two Young Indian entrepreneurs, launched a project to recycle some of the estimated 100 billion butts that are dumped every year in the country. They devised a scheme to collect cigarette ends and a process that separates any remaining tobacco, which is recycled into compost, while the filters are treated and made into a substance used for stuffing soft toys and cushions. Another Indian scheme launched in Kolkata last year is ButtRush, which organises the collection of butts for recycling. On the island of Guernsey, authorities have introduced so-called ballot bins where the public can vote on local issues or the result of a football match by depositing their fag ends in a bin showing their preferred option. The bins are at the bus station and outside a chemist’s shop, where cigarette butt pollution is said to have fallen by 46%. In the United States, the recycling firm TerraCycle offers businesses a free collection service and will recycle not only cigarette ends but also the packaging and the foil lining. And in the French city of Bordeaux, a public-private partnership collects and recycles up to 200,000 butts a year and has so far collected more than 1.5 million. Similar action has been taken in nearby Toulouse. One study suggests that there are 4.5 trillion butts littering the environment. The plastic in the filters takes up to 10 years to biodegrade, releasing toxic arsenic and lead as they do so. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco waste contains up to 7,000 toxic chemicals. It is not uncommon to find cigarette ends in the bodies of dead fish and sea birds and they can be lethal to freshwater and marine species. There are no precise figures for the cost of cleaning up cigarette ends in Spain. However, a Catalan study estimates the cost at €12-21 each inhabitant a year, with the cost highest in coastal areas.",News/World news,Cigarette butt recycling scheme aims to stub out waste in Catalonia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/cigarette-butt-recycling-scheme-aims-to-stub-out-waste-in-catalonia
5/20/2022,"Ireland’s taoiseach has said it is unacceptable for one party in Northern Ireland to block others from taking power, as he visits Belfast to try to break the deadlock over the Brexit protocol and power-sharing at Stormont. “It is unheard of in a democratic world that that parliament would not convene in the aftermath of an election. We can’t have a situation where one political party determines that the other political parties can’t convene in a parliament,” Micheál Martin told the BBC before meetings on Friday with party leaders including the Democratic Unionist party, which has refused to re-enter power-sharing until “decisive action” is taken to scrap elements of the Northern Ireland protocol. He said he understood there were “legitimate issues” to be discussed with the DUP but that the only answer to the problem was collaboration, not confrontation. Martin accused Boris Johnson of moving “too far in a unilateral way” over the UK’s approach to Northern Ireland after the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, announced plans to introduce domestic laws to override the protocol if the EU did not meet the government’s demands. He also said claims the EU was being intransigent and inflexible were exaggerated. “I spoke to Boris Johnson and I have to nail this, this idea that somehow the European Union is being inflexible on this is just not the truth, it doesn’t stack up. “What has happened now is a certain unilateralism on behalf of the British government saying ‘our way or no way’ and you don’t negotiate with the European Union on that basis, particularly when you have signed off on the agreement that you now don’t like.” His comments came as a US delegation of Republican and Democratic congressional representatives landed in Europe for a week of talks with Brussels, London and Dublin leaders to try to calm tensions over Northern Ireland. They will meet Truss on Saturday morning. Richard Neal, the chair of the US ways and means committee, said he would be reminding everyone that the 1998 peace agreement was hard won and not just a “cavalier achievement” that could be used for domestic political ends. His trip coincided with a broadside by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who said unilateral action on the protocol could damage the UK’s chances of a trade deal. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, told the BBC in response that if “Pelosi wants to see the agreement protected then she needs to recognise that it is the protocol that is harming and undermining the agreement and that is why we need to deal with it”. He said the protocol had “changed some of the key principles” of the accord and “made it impossible to have power-sharing on the basis of consensus”.",News/UK news,"Unacceptable for one party to block Stormont, says Irish PM",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/unacceptable-for-one-party-block-stormont-says-irish-pm-micheal-martin
5/20/2022,"The podcast is arguably the first great art form of the 21st century. Podcasts have launched careers and inspired endless innovation across comedy, documentary, drama and more. I reckon I probably get through close to three hours of listening every day, and I can’t really remember what I filled my ears with before they existed. And yet, as marvellous as podcasts are, there are some aspects to them that I find really, really annoying – and which maybe you do, too. Here, then, are a few podcast pet peeves I hope to see the back of in 2022: Badly placed ads You know the feeling: you’re approaching the climax of some gripping true crime epic when suddenly, just as you’re about to find out whodunnit, an advert for super-soft mattresses/artisan men’s razors/life insurance/another podcast is dropped in without warning. Sometimes these adverts arrive mid-sentence, which is even more infuriating as you invariably have to rewind back to remember the point the host was making … and then listen to the ad all over again. Random release dates Because podcasts aren’t beholden to a tight schedule like TV, they can be dropped on to feeds whenever their creator fancies. Which, in theory, is great: who doesn’t like a surprise bonus episode every now and again. But, in practice, it often means that new episode you were looking forward to listening to on the train arrives hours or even days late. Live episodes This one might be a little contentious, but I find episodes of podcasts recorded in front of a live audience immensely irritating. The entire appeal of podcasts is their intimacy – that feeling of eavesdropping on a conversation, or having a presenter speaking directly to you and you only. So there’s something extremely off-putting about a crowd of 300 people guffawing away in the background of saidconversations. Also, audiences ruin the flow of podcasts – panellists are forever having to pause their train of thought to account for an impromptu round of applause. I’m a fan of the model used by the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast, who treat live episodes as their own distinct thing, and don’t make them available as part of the podcast feed. Paying for podcasts Podcasters invest huge amounts of time, effort and money into creating their shows, so why shouldn’t they be compensated for them? It’s a job, after all. Yet, one of the great things about podcasts is their DIY ethos: anyone can make one and send it out into the world. Until recently, adverts have ensured that this status quo is maintained, but increasingly companies like Spotify, Apple and Audible are putting podcasts – including series that, for a long time have been free to all – behind a paywall. Perhaps this was always inevitable, but it does seem a shame. That said, I can understand the dilemma faced by podcast creators, particularly those who are also responsible for hiring and firing staff – this New York Times piece lays out that dilemma very well. Epic running times There are short podcasts, there are satisfyingly in-depth podcasts, and then there are podcasts that amble on for two-plus hours without any sense of structure or direction. Podcasts should be a maximum of an hour, or an hour and 15 minutes if we’re being generous. We’re talking about people chatting amiably into a microphone here, not a King Crimson record. Anything that requires several commutes to listen to in full should immediately be sent back to the editing booth. Of course, there are caveats – The Rewatchables, one of my favourite podcasts, regularly stretches into the 90-minute mark. Also, Joe Rogan – the world’s most successful podcaster – releases three-hour tantric chat-gasms on a daily basis, and everyone seems to lap them up, so hey – what do I know?

5/20/2022,"Good morning. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine entering its 86th day, the US is accusing Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, demanded at a UN security council meeting yesterday that Russia lift its blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and enable the flow of food and fertiliser around the world. “The Russian government seems to think that using food as a weapon will help accomplish what its invasion has not: to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people,” he said at the meeting called by the Biden administration. Ukraine’s grain exports fell from 5m tons a month before Russia’s February invasion to 200,000 tons in March and about 1.1m tons in April, said Serhii Dvornyk, a member of Ukraine’s mission to the UN, who pointed out that 400 million people around the world depended on grain from Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president of Russia, warned that Russia would not continue food supplies unless the west eased its sanctions against the Kremlin. As the discussions about the food crisis continue, Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, is in Berlin and backing a recovery program for Ukraine similar to the Marshall plan, which helped rebuild Europe after the second world war. “With the memory of the Marshall plan in mind, what we’re talking about is not only about how we fund immediate needs and support their ability to maintain the war effort, but how we support the ability of Ukraine to be economically viable and generate a sustainable future for themselves, even as they’re under attack,” Buttigieg told the Guardian. This comes as the Senate overwhelmingly approved a $40bn infusion of military and economic aid for Ukraine. “Help is on the way, really significant help. Help that could make sure that the Ukrainians are victorious,” said the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer. A former FBI special agent who infiltrated white supremacist groups in the 1990s has told the Guardian that his former agency is failing to address the rising scourge of white supremacist violence – even amid stark warnings that such attacks pose the greatest domestic terrorism threat in the US. “US law enforcement is failing, as it long has, to provide victimized communities like Buffalo’s with equal protection under the law. They are not actually investigating the crimes that occur,” said Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center at NYU School of Law. The Buffalo mass shooting suspect was heckled in court yesterday, with some calling him a coward. Payton Gendron, 18, is accused of killing 10 Black people in a racist, targeted attack on a Buffalo supermarket. Oklahoma’s Republican-led legislature passed a bill yesterday allowing citizens to sue anyone, anywhere who “aids or abets” a patient in terminating a pregnancy. The bill bans abortion from conception, even before an egg implants in the uterus, and would go into effect immediately if signed by the Republican governor, Kevin Stitt. Evidence suggests that Congress members led “reconnaissance tours” before the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, the House select committee tasked with investigating the attack has found. Fox News provocateur Tucker Carlson tried to use Hunter Biden to get his son Buckley Carlson into Georgetown University, according to the Washington Post. Los Angeles hotel workers are fighting for hotels to provide workers with panic buttons to protect them from sexual harassment and assault on the job. The Senate approved legislation aimed at easing the baby formula shortage for families participating in a government assistance program that accounts for about half of all formula purchased in the US. A delegation of Democrats and Republicans will arrive in London on Saturday in a bid to calm tensions over Northern Ireland. North Korea’s Covid caseload passed 2m amid global concerns that the regime may not actually be achieving “good results” in its battle against the outbreak. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is engaged to her longtime partner, Riley Roberts, who she met while studying at Boston University. Wildland blazes have been burning across New Mexico, Texas and Colorado for weeks now, with thousands of fire personnel battling flames in dry, windy weather. A fire in west Texas has destroyed dozens of structures and the gusty winds, high temperatures and extremely low humidity in New Mexico have authorities expecting that the number of structures destroyed there will reach 1,000. Director Terence Davies spoke to the Guardian about reconstructing trauma on screen, the use of humor and his upcoming Siegfried Sassoon biopic. “Being in the past makes me feel safe because I understand that world,” Davies said, on how he has largely avoided contemporary settings. French mustard producers said seed production in 2021 was down 50% after poor harvests, which they are attributing to the changing climate in France’s Burgundy region and Canada, the second largest mustard seed producer in the world. The result is that supermarkets in France are now running out of dijon mustard, raising questions about whether the shortage may spread to other countries as well.

Eighteen months ago, sculptor Aidan Harte was commissioned to create a 2-meter-tall bronze statue of a púca for the town square in Ennistymon, County Clare in Ireland. When photographs of the clay mould for the sculpture leaked in April 2021, they elicited an immediate response on social media: the parish priest called it “sinister”. An artist painted it in a mural.

5/20/2022,"The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, asked a BBC presenter how much a litre of unleaded petrol costs in an awkward exchange on live television, adding: “I’m just checking how in touch you are.” The testy discussion came after fuel prices climbed to record highs, with statistics from the data firm Experian Catalist showing that the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on Wednesday was 168.2p. Diesel prices reached an average of 181.0p a litre on Wednesday, up from 180.9p a day earlier. On Friday, BBC Breakfast’s Charlie Stayt asked the justice secretary how much a litre of diesel cost. Raab said he bought unleaded, and that the last time he visited a petrol station it was £1.65-£1.67 a litre. However, Stayt said it had “gone up” recently, adding: “What’s happening in the real world is that people try and deal with things and those pump prices, as you pass them, they go up by the day.” Raab then switched the question on to the journalist, asking Stayt: “Well you tell me, what’s a litre of unleaded today?” The BBC presenter said the highest price he had seen for diesel recently was £1.99 a litre at a service station on the M6. Raab pressed Stayt again on the price of unleaded, saying: “I’m just checking how in touch you are, because last time I looked it was 165-167.” Stayt said that £1.68 was the latest price that he had seen for unleaded. The deputy prime minister replied: “I’m just making the point that I’m actually right about the cost of a litre of unleaded.” Stayt’s question falls in line with the “pint of milk” test, a strategy often used to show how much a politician is engaged with the realities of everyday life. Journalists have repeatedly asked senior politicians and leaders if they know the price of everyday items, including milk, bread and fuel. People caught out by such questioning have included the former US president George HW Bush, the former UK prime minister David Cameron and the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison.",Lifestyle/Money,Raab turns the tables on BBC presenter with petrol price question,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/20/dominic-raab-turns-tables-bbc-presenter-petrol-prices
5/20/2022,"The prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, has secured French citizenship, according to reports. French officials reportedly told the AFP news agency that Johnson, 81, whose mother was French, obtained French nationality on Wednesday. Johnson, father to Boris, Rachel, Leo, Jo, Julia and Maximilian, campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU in 2016, while his son Boris led the leave movement. However, Johnson Sr has since expressed support for Brexit. He confirmed he was applying for a French passport on the eve of Britain’s Brexit transition period coming to an end on 31 December 2020. Johnson served as an MEP 40 years ago and was one of the first UK civil servants to work in Brussels after Britain joined the EU – then the European Economic Community – in 1973. He went on to work for the European Commission. He joins thousands of Britons who have acquired EU citizenship since the Brexit vote. He previously said: “It’s not a question of becoming French. If I understood correctly, I am French. My mother was born in France, her mother was entirely French, and her grandfather too. So for me it’s a matter of claiming what I already have.” He is also on record as saying: “I will always be European, that’s for sure. You can’t tell the English ‘you’re not European’. Europe is more than the single market, it’s more than the European Union. That said, to have a link like that with the EU is important.” Foreigners with French relatives can no longer claim French nationality when their family has remained settled abroad for more than 50 years without having exercised the rights linked to nationality, according to French law. This is known as loss of nationality through désuétude, or disuse. However, an article of the French civil code allows these people to regain French nationality by simple declaration, subject to justifying “manifest cultural, professional, economic or family ties” with France or having fought for it. It was on this basis that Johnson is understood to have made a declaration of French nationality, Le Figaro reports.",News/Politics,PM’s father Stanley Johnson ‘secures French citizenship’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/pms-father-stanley-johnson-secures-french-citizenship
5/20/2022,"Shares in THG soared as much as a quarter in early trading on Friday as investors cheered the prospect of a multibillion-pound bidding war for the online retailer, including a possible offer from property tycoon Nick Candy. The market value of THG, the online health and beauty retailer formerly known as the Hut Group, leapt by almost £400m to £1.8bn after the company confirmed there had been three takeover approaches in recent weeks. It said that it rejected a £2.07bn bid from two investment companies, Belerion Capital and King Street Capital Management, in a statement on Thursday night. It said it was the third such approach but has not revealed details of who made the previous two or how much was offered. Iain McDonald, Belerion’s co-founder and chief investment officer, is a THG non-executive director. “The board of THG notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it received a third unsolicited, highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal of 170 pence per share,” the company said. “The board of THG considered the proposal, together with its financial and legal advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects, and accordingly unanimously rejected the proposal.” THG’s confirmation of a third approach came hours after it emerged that Candy was considering making an offer for the e-commerce company. Under UK takeover rules, Belerion and King, Candy and the other unnamed suitors have until 16 June to make a formal offer or walk away. Candy is also a major investor in the London-listed podcast company Audioboom and the augmented reality business Blippar. Any bid requires the backing of Matthew Moulding, the founder and chief executive of THG, who has a special share that allows him to veto any hostile offer. The company has said it intends to unwind the special share arrangement by the end of this year. Last month, Manchester-based THG, which runs beauty and nutrition websites including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Myprotein, said it had dismissed “numerous” recent takeover approaches as “unacceptable”. The company’s share price closed at 116p on Thursday, down 4%, but soared to 144p in trading on Friday morning off the back of the bid speculation. The company floated at 500p in September 2020, and peaked at 837p last September. THG is attempting to recover from a tough year when it faced criticism for allowing Moulding to serve as executive chair and chief executive, which is against best corporate governance practice. The board also signed off on a deal that allowed Moulding to acquire a number of THG properties before leasing them back to the company for millions of pounds a year. Last year the company reported a 35% increase in revenues to £2.2bn, helping push adjusted earnings up 7% at £161m. In its results for the first quarter of this year, THG’s revenues rose by 16% to £520m.",News/Business,THG shares soar amid prospect of bidding war for online retailer,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/thg-shares-soar-amid-prospect-of-bidding-war-for-online-retailer-nick-candy
5/20/2022,"The key moment in Tim Firth’s nourishing new musical would be easy to miss. It comes after a very funny Michele Dotrice has been on a rant about playground games. As Ivy, an endlessly raging former trades union rep, she considers enjoyment to be politically suspect. “Nothing makes me more angry than people trying to make me happy,” she fumes. But no sooner has she let off steam than a hand reaches out to her. It belongs to one of the primary school children who are never far away in Joyce Branagh’s production. It is the smallest of gestures, as simple as it is innocent, but one that straddles the generations. Momentarily silencing Ivy, the handclasp connects the playfulness of youth with the glorious eccentricity of old age. Now Is Good is two things. First, it is a DIY monument to Firth’s late father, Gordon, who, by the playwright’s account, was a compulsive collector and repurposer of rubbish. Fictionalised as Ray and played winningly by Jeff Rawle, he becomes a retired builder who is supposedly renovating a former bank, realised on a deep and dusty set by designer Sara Perks. He is, however, easily distracted. Befriending passersby, he turns a building site into a home for singalongs, dressing-up games and medieval jousting. The mood is whimsical and cheerfully anarchic. From this affectionate portrait emerges the show’s second element. It is unusual both in its casting of older actors – Elizabeth Counsell zipping around in a mobility scooter, Maxwell Hutcheon looking stiffly on – but also in its inclusion of children. Beyond the fogeyish jokes about the internet, Firth offers a vision of a balanced and inclusive society. Only by embracing our community, he seems to say, can we cope with change and loss. Chris Hannon as Ray’s son Neil is a health and safety officer in need of a physical and emotional safety net. In the midst of turmoil, he leans into his community for solace. “Now is good,” he decides. From breezy beginnings, it builds to a tremendously moving second half, not least because of Firth’s songs that emerge conversationally before heading off down shuffling jazz avenues and clever melodic loops. They are arranged with colour and invention by musical director George Francis and sung with relish by an excellent cast.

5/20/2022,"Antonio Rüdiger has blamed his decision to leave Chelsea on talks over a new deal with the club going quiet early this season. The Germany centre-back is joining Real Madrid on a free transfer after deciding not to extend his contract. Rüdiger rejected Chelsea’s first offer of £140,000 a week last summer and says he was then left in the dark about his future for five months. Chelsea went back with another offer of £230,000 before sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich in March. It would have made Rüdiger the highest-paid defender in their history but talks broke down again when the club received demands for a huge signing-on fee for the player and large fees for the 29-year-old’s representatives. Chelsea were unable to resume negotiations after Abramovich was sanctioned and the uncertainty led to Rüdiger accepting Madrid’s offer. “Unfortunately, my contract negotiations had already started to get difficult last fall,” Rüdiger said in a piece for the Players’ Tribune. “Business is business, but when you don’t hear any news from the club from August to January, the situation becomes complicated. After the first offer, there was a long gap of just nothing. “We’re not robots, you know? You cannot wait for months with so much uncertainty about your future. Obviously, no one saw the sanctions coming, but in the end other big clubs were showing interest, and I had to make a decision. I will leave it at that, because business aside, I have nothing bad to say about this club.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Rüdiger blames Chelsea exit on talks going quiet in autumn,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/antonio-rudiger-blames-chelsea-exit-on-talks-going-quiet-in-autumn
