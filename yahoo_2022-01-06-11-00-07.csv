The co-infections have been happening since early in the pandemic and are now being dubbed ""flurona."" Experts said that being vaccinated against both the flu and COVID-19 will make a co-infection much milder for most. A Los Angeles teenager who was unvaccinated against the flu and COVID-19 has tested positive for a dual infection of both illnesses, dubbed ""flurona,"" according to the Los Angeles Times. The co-infection was detected in a teenager who was returning from a trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with his family, per the 911 COVID Testing center in Brentwood. The teenager reportedly had a runny nose after the trip and tested at the 911 COVID Testing center. Steve Farzam, the chief operating officer of the testing center said it was the first case of a co-infection that the testing center was aware of. Insider reached out the 911 COVID Testing center for additional comment. ""In and of itself, it's not overly concerning; however, it is concerning and can be problematic for someone who has preexisting medical conditions, anyone who is immunocompromised,"" Farzam told the Times, urging people to get both the flu and COVID-19 vaccine. Co-infections have been happening since early in the pandemic, and medical experts early on warned of a ""twindemic"" caused by the flu and COVID-19. The LA County Department of Public Health told the LA Times in a statement that co-infections were ""exceedingly common"" with the flu. Insider reached out to the LA County Public Health Department for comment. ""We are not tracking these occurrences systematically and cannot tell you how frequently they have occurred,"" health officials told the LA Times in a statement. For the past 35 years, flu activity in the US has peaked in February, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has also recommended getting vaccinated against both illnesses, and reported that in 2021, flu vaccination rates were lower than usual.

1/6/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A 65-year-old Northern California man was paralyzed after being slammed to the ground during a traffic stop where police officers used “pain compliance” techniques and expressed disbelief when he repeatedly cried out “I can’t feel my legs,” according to a lawsuit announced Wednesday. Police video released by lawyers for Gregory Gross shows the incident and his arrival at a hospital, where Gross is handcuffed to a bed, his nose bloodied. “You want to grab his arms and flop him up on the bed?” someone asks after Gross tells a medical worker that he can’t feel his legs. They then do so while placing him in a sitting position without restraining his neck or spine. “Don’t tell me again you can’t move,” a medical worker tells Gross later as he is prepared for a full body scan. Gross ultimately required two surgeries to fuse his spine. In separate lawsuits, Gross alleges the combination of police and medical misconduct left him unable to walk or care for himself, and he will require round-the-clock nursing care for the rest of his life. He sued Rideout Memorial Hospital in Marysville, along with the University of California, Davis, Medical Center and individual medical workers, last August. The new lawsuit claims Yuba City Police Officer Joshua Jackson broke Gross’ neck. It names Jackson, fellow officers Scott Hansen and Nathan Livingston, and Yuba City. The lawsuit alleges Hansen assisted in Jackson's repeated use of force and that Livingston failed to intervene. Jackson has not been employed by the Yuba City Police Department since February 2021, the department said Wednesday. Officials there could not immediately say if he had his own attorney. The department and Yuba City said in a joint statement that they had not been served with the lawsuit and couldn't comment. Rideout hospital officials did not respond to telephone and emailed comment requests. “It's about police brutality that destroyed his life,"" said Gross' attorney Moseley Collins. Along with obtaining enough money to pay for his lifelong care, Collins said, ""Greg doesn’t want this to happen to anyone else.” Gross, an Army veteran who lives in Yuba City, was accused of driving drunk and causing a slow-speed collision in April 2020. He faces a jury trial in March in Sutter County, north of Sacramento, on charges of misdemeanor DUI, hit-and-run and resisting arrest. In the police body camera video supplied by Gross' lawyers, an officer identified as Jackson is seen twisting Gross' handcuffed arms and forcibly seating him on a lawn. “You can start going with the program,” the officer tells Gross as he protests that “I didn't do nothing” and “that hurts.” “It's called pain compliance,"" another officer says, to which Gross — now seated with his head forced forward — replies that he is not resisting. “It will continue to hurt if you don't shut up and listen,” an officer tells Gross as he repeatedly and profanely insists he is in pain. Timothy T. Williams Jr., a police tactics expert who spent nearly 30 years with the Los Angeles Police Department, said that based on the video, the officers seemed to overreact. Pain compliance, such as using a wrist lock, is a common technique with someone who is resisting, he said. But in this case, Gross was already in handcuffs and being escorted to a patrol car. “Apparently he just wasn't moving fast enough for them,” Williams said. “From what I observed, there was no need for pain compliance,” he added. “There was no need to drive him to the ground.” He also questioned the officer twisting and suddenly raising Gross' handcuffed arms. “That's something that during my time wasn’t taught,” said Williams, who served from 1974-2003. ""If you don’t know what you’re doing you can remove it (his shoulder) from its socket.” Officers later restrained Gross facedown on the lawn outside the hospital. “I can't breathe, I can't breathe,” Gross says. “You're talking. You can breathe,” officers tell Gross as he moans and slurs his words, his nose now bloodied and a cut over his eyebrow. “I can't feel my legs” Gross says repeatedly as he is placed in a wheelchair. “I can't feel my arms.” “Mr. Gross, we are done with your silly little games,” an officer tells him. Later, inside the hospital, Jackson tells Gross: “I only slammed you on the ground one time, sir, and it was very controlled.” Williams said officers seem to have acted improperly by ignoring Gross’ repeated complaints about not feeling his limbs. “You don’t make that assumption. You’re not a doctor, you don’t know what the person is going through,” Williams said. Gross said he had been physically active before his injury, working as a seasonal truck driver, walking his dogs for 2-4 miles at a time, swimming and cooking. He now spends his time in a hospital bed in his living room. Though he can move his arms, he said he can't write or perform other activities because his fingers are contracted with paralysis. “I just pretty much lay in bed all day,"" said Gross, who was wheeled into a news conference strapped to a gurney.

1/6/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — For years, Sean Hannity has skirted ethical boundaries with his role on a television network with “news” in its name. Yet it's never been as stark as now, with the committee investigating last year's Capitol insurrection seeking his testimony. The Jan. 6 select committee has revealed a series of texts where Hannity privately advised former President Donald Trump before, during and after the assault, and is seeking his insight about what happened in those days. The popular Fox News Channel prime-time host hasn't said what he will do, but he's slammed the congressional probe as a partisan witch hunt. His lawyer has raised First Amendment concerns about the request. It's not unheard of for journalists to offer advice to politicians — history records Ben Bradlee's friendship with former President John F. Kennedy — but such actions raise questions about their independence and allegiance to the public interest, said Jane Kirtley, director of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota. Just last month, CNN fired prime-time host Chris Cuomo when it became clear his efforts to advise his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, were more extensive than previously acknowledged. In one text revealed by the committee on Tuesday, Hannity wrote to Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, on Dec. 31, 2020, that “we can't lose the entire WH counsel's office” and said Trump should announce he was leading a nationwide effort to reform voting integrity. In a previously-revealed text, Hannity urged Trump on Jan. 6 to tell people to leave the Capitol peacefully. On Jan. 10, Hannity texted Meadows that Trump should never mention the election again — advice Trump clearly didn't take. Noting that Hannity had texted on Jan. 5 that he was “very worried about the next 48 hours,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee chair, said he wanted to know what concerned the host. It was widely reported during the Trump administration that Hannity spoke frequently with the president. The texts to Meadows put specificity to some of the communications. Hannity's identity as a conservative talk show host has been locked in for two decades, both as a prime-time host on Fox News Channel and on talk radio. His identity as a journalist has been murkier. Fox refers to him as an opinion host. In 2016, Hannity told The New York Times that “I never claimed to be a journalist.” A year later, he told the same newspaper that “I'm a journalist. But I'm an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist.” He conducts interviews on his program, sometimes with people he's been privately advising. “He seems to consider himself a journalist when it suits his purposes and an entertainer when it doesn't,” Kirtley said. “And he can't have it both ways.” Fox News executives have not immediately commented on the revelations of what Hannity has been texting Meadows or criticism about his or the network's ethics. There have been times when Fox News has acknowledged journalism norms with regards to Hannity. He was forced to cancel a 2010 appearance in Cincinnati when it was revealed he was participating in a fundraiser for the Tea Party. When Hannity was featured in a 2016 Trump campaign video, he was told not to do it again. In 2018, Fox called it an “unfortunate distraction” when Hannity was called on to speak at a Trump campaign rally. “It obviously raises ethical issues for Hannity,” Kirtley said. “But it also raises ethical issues for Fox. What do you purport to be? What do you aspire to be? You have to decide where your loyalties lie, whether your goal is to be a microphone for a particular political agenda or to serve the public interest.” Fox has long tried to draw distinctions between news and opinion programming. Particularly in the past few years, those lines have become less clear, as they have at a number of news organizations. Some of Fox's prominent journalists, like Chris Wallace last month, have left. “I don't consider Fox to be a news organization,” said June Cross, a documentarian and journalism professor at Columbia University. “They're in the business of what I call ‘news entertainment,’ that may or may not have anything to do with news.” For a traditional news organization, implicit in the text messages is another kind of embarrassment: that someone on its payroll was aware of some significant, newsworthy information — about what was being discussed in the White House before and after the Capitol riot — that was apparently kept private. If opinion journalists elsewhere were in a similar position, such as Maureen Dowd of The New York Times or Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post, “I would argue they did have an obligation to tell their news organizations,” Cross said. “If your loyalty is to the public,” Kirtley said, “you should have revealed this.” In his letter to Hannity, Thompson said that the committee has “immense respect for the First Amendment.” He said members wanted to question Hannity on a specific and narrow range of factual questions, and not about his broadcasts, reporting or opinions. “We have no doubt that you love our country and respect our Constitution,” he wrote. “Now is the time to step forward and serve the interests of your country.”",U.S./Associated Press,"Hannity, Fox face ethical issues over Trump text revelations",https://news.yahoo.com/hannity-fox-face-ethical-issues-230022779.html
1/6/2022,"By Fabian Hamacher and Ann Wang CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan air force jets screamed into the sky on Wednesday in a drill simulating a war scenario, showing its combat readiness amid heightened military tensions with China, which claims the island as its own. Before takeoff, flight crews at a base in the southern city of Chiayi - home to U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets that are frequently scrambled to intercept Chinese warplanes - rushed to ready aircraft as an alarm sounded. The exercises were part of a three-day drill to show Taiwan's battle readiness ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday at the end of this month. Tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait have been rising in the past few years, with Taiwan complaining of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratic island. Chinese military aircraft frequently fly into the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone (ADIZ), airspace around the island that Taiwan monitors and patrols. ""With the very high frequency of Communist planes entering our ADIZ, pilots from our wing are very experienced and have dealt with almost all types of their aircraft,"" Major Yen Hsiang-sheng told reporters, recalling a mission in which he was dispatched to intercept Chinese J-16 fighters late last year. China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan has termed China's activities as ""grey zone"" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan's forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test its responses. In a new year message for China last week, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said military conflict is not the answer. Beijing responded with a stern warning that if Taiwan crossed any red line it would lead to ""profound catastrophe"".
