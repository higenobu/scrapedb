5/20/2022,"Russia has deployed its ""Terminator"" armored fighting vehicle to the Donbas. Photos and videos on social media show the vehicles near a Donbas town. The vehicles are made for engagements in urban settings, but Russia is believed to have only nine. Russia has deployed its ""Terminator"" tank-support vehicles in Ukraine as the Russian military campaign seeks to encircle Ukrainian defenders in the eastern Donbas region. A Russian military source told the Russian state news agency RIA a platoon had been deployed in Ukraine. Russia is believed to have about nine of the armored vehicles, which are built on the chassis of the T-72 tank. The Terminator, which has the official designation BMPT, is heavily armored and armed, designed to defend tanks from ambushes and attacks at close range in urban settings. Justin Crump, a former British-army tank commander, told Sky News that the deployment of the Terminator around Severodonetsk, a city in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, showed the ""determination to assault that city"" by Russian armed forces. Crump said the vehicle was a ""signature Russian piece of equipment."" ""It's nicknamed the Terminator — it's a tank-support vehicle,"" he said. ""It's designed to do the work of infantry in support of tanks. So it's a tank with a turret designed to suppress enemy infantry."" Terminators have four anti-tank missile launchers, two 30 mm autocannons, two grenade launchers, a machine gun, and a top speed of 36 mph, The Times of London reported. Russian armored vehicles are suffering a heavy toll in Ukraine. Researchers have counted 671 lost tanks and 365 lost infantry-fighting vehicles in nearly three months of war. In addition to the proliferation of accurate anti-tank missiles, Russian tank operators have made errors that exposed them to artillery fire, and Russian commanders have deployed them without infantry or air support, decisions so faulty they are contributing to a reassessment of the military's effectiveness. Even if properly used, Russia's inventory of BMPT is too slight to defend most of its tanks. The Russian state media outlet TASS reported in 2017 the vehicle had been designed following the experience of Russian armed forces in Afghanistan. A senior executive at the Russian tank manufacturer UVZ told TASS: ""The tank support combat vehicle is protected no worse than any other tank. Its multiple weapon systems have a far greater firepower and are capable of hitting several targets in different directions simultaneously."" Terminators have previously been used in Russian combat operations in Syria, RIA reported.

5/20/2022,"CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago mother has been charged with child endangerment after a gun in her second grader's backpack accidentally discharged at school, injuring a 7-year-old classmate, police said Wednesday. The 28-year-old woman appeared in court on Wednesday on three misdemeanor child endangerment counts. A judge ordered her release from Cook County Jail on $1,000 bond. During the hearing, prosecutors alleged that the woman's 8-year-old son found the gun underneath her bed and took it to Walt Disney Magnet School on the city’s North Side on Tuesday. The mother has a valid firearm owners identification card. According to police, the backpack was in the boy's classroom when, just before 10 a.m. on Tuesday, the gun discharged. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that prosecutors said during the hearing that the bullet ricocheted off the floor and grazed the child's abdomen. The child was taken to a hospital in good condition, police said. In an email to parents, the school's principal said the bullet ""caused some debris to ricochet in your child’s classroom, which hit a member of our school community and caused minor scrapes.” The school did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A teacher then grabbed the backpack and gave it to security officers who found a Glock 19 handgun inside, prosecutors said during the hearing. The woman's attorney, Rodger Clarke, acknowledged that the gun should have been locked up and not just placed under the bed. But, he said, “This wasn't something she planned or something she did on her own volition.” Cook County Judge Michael Hogan was not impressed by that argument. “This may not have been an intentional act, but it is a supremely negligent act,” he said. He continued: “We are inches away, possibly centimeters away, from a very different case and a very different tragedy.”",U.S./Associated Press,"Gun in 8-year-old's backpack goes off at school, mom charged",https://news.yahoo.com/woman-charged-gun-sons-backpack-154537361.html
5/20/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines president-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr is all but certain to command a supermajority in Congress, a proclamation of winners showed on Wednesday, boosting chances of advancing his legislative agenda when he takes power next month. All but two of the 12 candidates declared winners of Senate seats by the election commission were allied with Marcos's ""Uniteam"" political juggernaut, adding to a new lower house revealed last week that was dominated by parties that sided with the presumptive president. Marcos, the son and namesake of the disgraced dictator driven from power in a 1986 uprising, has yet to reveal a policy agenda, but many analysts expect him to continue from where outgoing leader Rodrigo Duterte left off. ""It will be easy for the incoming administration, given the support they have from the local government and political families, to get their way in terms of legislative agenda,"" said Ranjit Rye, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines. Marcos, 64, who won last week's election in a landslide, inherits an economy on a stronger footing but will need to raise revenue for infrastructure and addressing big debts from Duterte's pandemic borrowing. A legislative majority was expected and Marcos's opponents have expressed fear he will use it push through constitutional changes to entrench his family's rule for decades to come. Marcos Jr's crucial alliance with running mate and incoming vice president Sara Duterte-Carpio - the president's daughter - could ensure support in Congress and co-opt politicians loyal to her father, who also enjoyed majority legislative support. The new senators join 12 incumbents who were elected in mid-term polls in 2019, most of those Duterte supporters. Widely expected to become Senate president is Cynthia Villar, wife of a billionaire, whose son also won a Senate seat having campaigned under Marcos's ""Uniteam"". Marcos's cousin, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, is likely to become lower house speaker, according to political analysts, having received pledges of support from the overwhelming majority of the 300 newly lower house lawmakers, among them Marcos's eldest son. Cristina Palabay, secretary general of rights group, Karapatan, said the backing Marcos will have does not bode well for checks and balances. ""It is worrisome that Marcos and Duterte allies will have supermajority,"" Palabay said. ""His priorities and agenda can be anything that is consistent with his father's policies and politics, and to Duterte's.""
