4/27/2022,"Giovanni van Bronckhorst has shrugged off the suggestion from RB Leipzig’s Willi Orban that the German club’s players are physically and mentally drained as they prepare to meet Rangers in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final. Orban made the claim after a surprise weekend loss for Leipzig, at home to Union Berlin, which ended a 15-game unbeaten run. Next up is the visit of Rangers, whose manager has paid no attention to Orban’s words. “We just concentrate on our own game,” said Van Bronckhorst. “We have also played many games in the last weeks so I think for everyone still involved in Europe, in all the competitions, it’s quite demanding on the squad mentally and physically. In that case it’s the same for all of us. “We have to make sure we are doing well ourselves and prepare the way we want to play against Leipzig. For me that’s more important than what other players or teams feel.” Rangers can glean confidence from their elimination of Borussia Dortmund earlier in this competition. An anticipated travelling contingent of about 8,000 supporters illustrates a feeling among fans that Rangers can reach their first European final since 2008; a sense shared by the staff. “Of course we have the belief,” Van Bronckhorst said. “If we are still involved in Europe and in a semi-final and you see the run we’ve had in Europe then it’s been very good. But we need another good performance and again next week. “The confidence is there but I think also that we know that we have to perform again and everything we achieved in the past doesn’t count against Leipzig. We are just preparing well for these two games and I am very confident in my team. “It’s the semi-final of the Europa League so the level is high, the level needed is also high, so we have to prepare well and make sure we have a good result to take back to Ibrox for next week.” Rangers’ personnel issues are in attack. Injuries sustained by Alfredo Morelos and Kemar Roofe pose an obvious problem for Van Bronckhorst, who is likely to deploy Ryan Kent in support of Fashion Sakala. Allan McGregor, the goalkeeper, missed Rangers’ 2008 Uefa Cup semi-final and final because of injury but will play in Germany aged 40. “It was obviously disappointing last time but it is a different challenge and a wee bit further on in my life,” McGregor said. “Obviously it will be special, it will be special for every player. To get to this stage of a European competition for the club is massive.”",Sport/Football,Rangers’ Van Bronckhorst shrugs off Leipzig claims of feeling drained,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/rangers-van-bronckhorst-shrugs-off-leipzig-claims-of-feeling-drained-europa-league-semi-final
4/27/2022,"Civil wars don’t always begin with gunfire. Sometimes civil wars begin with learned arguments. In April 1861, Confederate forces shot on Fort Sumter, but at the time even Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, had doubts about whether the event mattered all that much. It was, he claimed, “either the beginning of a fearful war, or the end of a political contest”; he could not say which. During the decades that preceded the assault on Fort Sumter, complex legal and political fissures had been working their way through the United States, slowly rendering the country ungovernable and opening the path to mass violence. The US is the middle of another such legal crackup, this time over the question of abortion. The courts today face the crisis American courts faced in the 1850s: is there any way to make laws for a country with furious and widening differences in fundamental values? This summer, when the US supreme court makes its long-expected decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, it will inevitably alienate half the country. In anticipation of the overturning of Roe v Wade, several states have passed draconian anti-abortion laws, in the expectation that they won’t be challenged. Idaho has already imitated the Texas law which allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman procure an abortion, a law that the supreme court has refused to overturn. Two American blocs are emerging. In the south and parts of the west and midwest, abortion laws are about to return to where they were in the 1950s. The rest of the country has already set itself in opposition to these laws. The division will not stay considerate and respectful, particularly in areas where liberal and conservative states neighbour one another. In anticipation of a post-Roe world and a flood of out-of-state patients, abortion providers have established a series of abortion clinics in Illinois, across the river from more conservative Missouri. Oregon recently invested in a $15m fund for medical refugees traveling from Idaho for abortions. There are, right from the beginning, two reactions to the new division. The first is the use of force, as in the case of a 26-year-old Texan woman, Lizelle Herrera, who was recently arrested for murder for allegedly self-inducing an abortion. The local district attorney’s office ultimately released her without charge, explaining that “in reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her”. To be clear, current applicable Texas law doesn’t apply to Herrera’s case. When it does, they will charge people like her with murder. How far will the forces opposing abortion take a custodial approach? Do they want to set up a DEA-style birth police? Any enforcement mechanism will also probably be highly ineffective. After billions of dollars spent on the war on drugs, the average price of a hit of heroin on the street is between $5 and $20. Women with means who want abortions are going to get them. The second reaction to an America divided along abortion lines will be interstate conflict. Missouri is leading the way here. A recent bill proposed a travel abortion ban, explicitly focused on clinics in Illinois. This looks, on the face of it, like a straight violation of the 14th amendment, but the supreme court is a partisan institution and interpretation of the constitution now follows the partisan affiliation of the justices. They’ll come up with something. No matter what decision the supreme court makes, civil unrest will follow. Anti-abortion activists will feel that their political system has failed them no matter what the court does. They have sacrificed everything – the dignity and integrity of their party, the value of their national institutions – in the name of getting enough justices on the court to enact this one legal change. If the court upholds Roe v Wade, they will quite naturally feel betrayed. If the court overturns Roe v Wade, they will discover a fact the new Texas law has inadvertently revealed: that the criminalization of abortion doesn’t work. Their basic assumption, that the government can outlaw abortion, is simply untrue. At first, the Texas law appeared to cause abortions to decline by half. But quickly the numbers reasserted themselves. The decline is less that ten percent. Women went out of state or bought chemical abortions. The overturning of Roe v Wade will makes women’s medical treatment more difficult and impersonal and humiliating. It won’t change the abortion rate significantly. Meanwhile, from the other side, an overturning of Roe v Wade will be experienced as oppression pure and simple, especially given the number of justices appointed by presidents who did not receive the popular vote. In November 1860, five months before Fort Sumter, in the immediate aftermath of Lincoln’s election, a judge in South Carolina announced that the state would no longer register indictments in federal court. Andrew Magrath, in a deliberate act of rejection, removed his judicial robe and folded it over his chair. He would now serve as a justice of his state, not his country. The audience recognized the gravity of the act. As one commentator at the time noted: “Here was a great political movement precipitated, not by bloody encounters in the street or upon the field, but by a deliberate and reasoned act in the most unexpected and conservatives of all places – the United State courtroom.” From that moment on, there were two legal systems. All that remained was the war. A similar breakdown in the legal system of the United States is already apparent. Needless to say, this entire conflict is futile and stupid. Abortion in the United States is in rapid decline without the negligible effects of criminalization. The number of procedures dipped 19% between 2011 and 2017. If activists want fewer abortions, there are plenty of strategies that are vastly more effective than making them illegal. Canada, which has no federal laws of any kind on abortion, has a fraction of the abortion rate of the US. But that’s not really the point. Abortion is only a stand in for a fundamental conflict in political vision: morality against policy, community values against personal agency. There are two countries, at least, in the United States. The legal system is only catching up.

4/27/2022,"Ottawa’s police chief has vowed to stop an upcoming biker rally from reaching the city’s downtown core as residents brace for a potential rerun of the so-called “Freedom Convoy” anti-government protests that paralyzed the Canadian capital earlier in the year. Thousands of bikers are expected to arrive in Ottawa on Friday for the “Rolling Thunder” rally purportedly called in honour of military veterans. The rally’s organizer, Neil Sheard, has denied that the event is a protest, but prominent anti-vaccine figure Chris Sky has been advertised as a “special guest” speaker, and Veterans for Freedom, a group which opposes public health measures, is also part of the event. Organizers had planned to march on Parliament Hill on Friday and then meet at the war memorial the following day. But the interim chief, Steve Bell, warned that a “heavy police presence” and road closures would instead greet the bikers. “We will not allow for unsafe or unlawful conditions that could lead to another protest, as seen in February,” Bell told the police services board on Monday. Bell said there was so far no indication the Rolling Thunder rally would become a sustained occupation like the trucker protests, but acknowledged things could change quickly. “I want to be clear with both organizers and participants: you will be held accountable for your actions before, during and after the events.” The city is still reeling from the February protests, when hundreds of commercial trucks blockaded the streets in front of Parliament Hill, honking their horns at all hours of the day and night and defying multiple orders to leave the area. That event began as a protest against public health measures, but quickly transformed into a broader anti-government movement, with protestors calling for Justin Trudeau’s government to face criminal prosecution. After weeks of disruption, the federal government invoked the Emergencies Act, permitting officials to freeze bank accounts and suspend the commercial licences of truck drivers involved. On Monday, the federal government announced an inquiry into the use of the rarely-used legislation. The protests ended after nearly a month when police stormed the blockades and arrested nearly 200 demonstrators. Ottowa authorities later revealed that the demonstrations cost the city more than C$36m (US$28m, £22m). “I do not want our children, seniors and other vulnerable residents re-traumatized. Our businesses should not be forced to close again,” Ottawa city councillor Catherine McKenney wrote on Twitter Monday. Zexi Li, a downtown resident whose exasperation with non-stop truck honking led to a C$306m class action lawsuit against the convoy, told the Guardian she and others fear that “mistakes will be made again” as officials attempt to prepare for the influx of bikers. “Without a doubt, there was a loss of trust in the city, in our officials, in the police from the protests. We were just utterly disappointed by the people that were supposed to protect us,” she said. Sheard warned earlier this week the event could turn into a “free-for-all” as bikers are forced to deviate from a previously planned route after police said they wouldn’t allow vehicles into the downtown core. “We keep hearing that things never should have gotten as bad as they did if certain steps had been taken from the very beginning,” said Li. “Well, we know what those steps are now. So all the need to do, in theory, is take those steps.”",News/World news,Ottawa police chief vows to stop biker rally as city braces for potential protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/ottaway-biker-rally-rolling-thunder
4/27/2022,"Angela Rayner has hit out at claims that she viewed “sexist slurs” made against her as a joke, amid a row between the Commons Speaker and the Mail on Sunday, whose editor rebuffed an invitation to discuss an article about the deputy Labour leader. David Dillon was asked to meet the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, following anger about comments made by Conservative MPs in a story about Rayner, in which they accused her of crossing and uncrossing her legs like the character played by Sharon Stone in the film Basic Instinct to distract Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions. On Wednesday, the Mail ran a response from Dillon saying he would not attend the meeting, as well as a story suggesting Rayner had joked about the comparison on previous occasions with Tory MPs as well as on a podcast. On comedian Matt Forde’s The Political Party, Rayner said she was “mortified” by an internet meme comparing her actions to the scene in Basic Instinct which Stone’s character crosses and uncrosses her legs in front of detectives while not wearing underwear. She said: “There is a tint of misogyny in it… … Every time I do a PMQs somebody has an opinion on what I wear. Did you see the meme on Sharon Stone like I was doing it at the last PMQs? I was mortified.” Forde asked her if the suggestion was that she was “doing that to distract Boris”, to which she replied: “It doesn’t take much, does it? I don’t need to do that.” Rayner tweeted in response on Wednesday: “I said to (Forde) in January that the sexist film parody about me was misogynistic and it still is now. As women we sometimes try to brush aside the sexism we face, but that doesn’t make it OK. “The Mail implies today that I somehow enjoy being subjected to sexist slurs. I don’t. They are mortifying and deeply hurtful. ‘She loves it really’ is a typical excuse so many women are familiar with. But it can’t be women’s responsibility to call it out every time. I don’t need anyone to explain sexism to me – I experience it every day. “Boris Johnson gave assurances he would unleash ‘the terrors of the earth’ on the Tory MPs spreading this vile sexism. I hope to hear what he’ll be doing about it today.” Hoyle told MPs on Monday he had arranged a meeting with Dillon following an outcry over the claims in the article. Dillon said he and his political editor, Glen Owen, would not be attending as journalists should “not take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be”. The Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to consider revoking the Commons pass of the article’s author. However, Hoyle – who met with Rayner on Monday – suggested it would not be right to remove his pass. Speaking before the meeting was rejected, he said: “I am a staunch believer and protector of press freedom, which is why when an MP asked me to remove the pass of a sketchwriter last week for something he had written, I said no. “I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea – nothing more – for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder.” Rayner told ITV’s Lorraine on Tuesday that she had told the Mail on Sunday: “This is disgusting. It’s completely untrue. Please don’t run a story like that.” Conservative whips have claimed they will try to find out which Tory MP made the comments about Labour’s deputy leader.",News/Politics,Angela Rayner hits back at claims she enjoys ‘sexist slurs’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/angela-rayner-hits-back-at-claims-she-enjoys-sexist-slurs
4/27/2022,"Women’s health groups are calling on healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson’s largest shareholders to force the company to end all sales of its controversial talc-based baby powder and hire an independent firm to conduct a racial justice audit. The pressure comes after decades of independent science suggested a link between ovarian cancer and baby powder, and the Food and Drug Administration detected cancer-causing asbestos in one lot of the product. Internal company memos show Johnson & Johnson for years marketed it toward African American and overweight women and, the groups charge, knew of the asbestos contamination. Two resolutions to be voted on at the company’s virtual Thursday shareholder meeting include one on directing Johnson & Johnson to stop global sales of talc based baby powder, and one on conducting the racial justice audit. A letter sent to Vanguard, one of Johnson & Johnson’s major shareholders, by an alliance of advocacy groups, led by Black Women for Wellness, states the investment firm has a “moral imperative” to support the proposals. “Johnson & Johnson has betrayed consumer and investor trust, while violating the rights of millions of individuals by selling asbestos-contaminated talcum baby powder, by intentionally targeting Black women in the marketing of this product, by refusing to admit wrongdoing, and by continuing to sell its talc-based baby powder worldwide,” the letter reads. Though Johnson & Johnson discontinued US talc-based baby powder sales in 2020 amid mounting public pressure and nearly 38,000 lawsuits, it continues to sell it globally in regions with high populations of people of color. The American multinational corporation has steadfastly denied that its products contain asbestos and said accusations are based on faulty science. Its attorneys previously urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to block the proposals from being voted on because it would affect pending lawsuits across the world. The SEC allowed the vote to proceed. Talc, considered the world’s softest mineral, is often used by women as a genital antiperspirant and deodorant. The groups charge it is difficult to ensure talc is asbestos-free since they naturally form together, and asbestos-contaminated talc fibers that enter the body are linked to cancer. Many of the lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson have alleged the product caused ovarian cancer. A division of the World Health Organization began classifying talc powder as “possibly carcinogenic” in 2006, according to reports by Reuters and other outlets, but Johnson & Johnson continued to sell it. The company recalled 33,000 bottles in October 2019 after the FDA detected chrysotile asbestos in a bottle purchased from an online retailer. It previously said it replaced talc with cornstarch amid slumping sales “fueled by misinformation around the safety of the product”. “We empathize with anyone suffering from cancer and understand that people are looking for answers,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “We believe those answers can be better understood through science – and decades of independent scientific testing by medical experts around the world has confirmed that Johnson’s Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.” An internal Johnson & Johnson marketing report leaked in 2006 revealed it was specifically pushing the product to “curvy Ssouthern women 18-49 skewing African American” and in “underdeveloped geographical areas with hot weather, and higher [African American] populations”. “This could be an opportunity,” a document stated of the product’s popularity with the demographic. As part of the campaign, it distributed product samples at churches and beauty salons in African American and Hispanic neighborhoods, and partnered with Weight Watchers. “You can’t get more specific than that and, to be honest, it’s racist,” said Astrid Williams, environmental justice program manager for Black Women for Wellness, which is taking the lead on the plan. She said “racist” marketing continues as the powder is marketed in Asia, Africa and Latin America. A company spokesperson said the “idea that our company would purposefully and systematically target consumers with bad intentions is unreasonable and completely false.” “Our products are safe, and our campaigns are multicultural and inclusive,” she added. The groups’ letter to Vanguard also highlights the financial fallout: Johnson & Johnson has lost or settled lawsuits tallying billions of dollars in damages. Among those is an award of $2bn for 22 plaintiffs who claimed that they suffered from ovarian cancer after using Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder. Williams noted that 11 of those women have since died. In response, Johnson & Johnson, which has headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, is attempting to shield itself from liability by creating a spinoff company that now houses its baby powder division and has filed for bankruptcy protection. It scored a legal victory in February when a federal judge declined to throw out the case, but it has been appealed to a higher court. “If their products are safe and there’s no issues, then why are they taking these steps to try to evade and find protections?” Williams asked. “It says that they’re hiding something.” Vanguard and other investment groups met with Tulipshare, an investment platform that pools shares in order to meet the threshold to submit resolutions for shareholder votes. Public health advocates have turned their attention to shareholders because “nothing else has worked”, said Stacy Malkan, a volunteer and author of Not Just a Pretty Face: The Ugly Side of the Beauty Industry. “Including science catching up with them, lawsuits from tens of thousands of women and pressure from hundreds of groups over the years,” she said. “They still keep selling talc baby powder, even though safer alternatives are readily available.” Activists say they’re confident the strategy will succeed. “There is no excuse for choosing short-term financial gain over the health and wellbeing of women,” the letter reads. “There should be no defense of the racist tactics J&J has used in the marketing and sales of its product. Racism is a public health threat and it is bad for business.”",News/Business,Johnson & Johnson shareholders called on to end talc baby powder sales,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/johnson-and-johnson-baby-powder-talc-shareholders
4/27/2022,"It is four years since Cork writer Danny Denton published his debut, The Earlie King and the Kid in Yellow. A gritty gangster tale set in a post-apocalyptic Ireland and written in a mishmash of experimental styles, it was gloriously off-the-wall: think Kevin Barry meets James Joyce meets Blade Runner. All Along the Echo, Denton’s second book, is set in a more familiar Ireland, some time in the near future. It follows chatshow DJ Tony Cooney and his young producer Lou as they embark on a road trip across the country. The plan is to award a brand-new car – and a year’s supply of petrol – to one lucky listener. The only catch is that the winner must be among the many Irish who have recently returned from London, fleeing the capital’s spate of terrorist attacks. As the book alternates between “ON AIR” and “OFF AIR” sections, we observe Tony and Lou in both personal and professional modes. At work, Tony is the confident, charismatic DJ entertaining the nation; at home, he is a dejected father of two, plagued by a midlife crisis and pining for his first love. Meanwhile Lou – the calm, reliable sidekick – is secretly crippled with anxiety about her relationship and the impending possibility of motherhood. Alongside these two we encounter Ann, an elderly cancer patient, and Jada, a homeless teenager; we also hear from the endless array of individuals who phone in to voice their opinions on Tony’s radio show. Here they cover everything from racially motivated violence and the legalisation of sex work to the history of the English language – all intercut with ads and jingles and texts from other listeners throwing their ideas into the mix. Like The Earlie King, the novel experiments with layout and style – some sections are formatted as radio scripts, others are broken up with nonsense words and static interference. Denton draws parallels between this plethora of voices and the profusion of graffiti that adorns Cork city, examples of which are replicated on the page. Tony doesn’t see the connection, dismissing the graffiti as “just names, slogans, rants, stupid things like that” – precisely the content his show generates. For someone who has made a career out of listening to others, he can be surprisingly narrow-minded. Although the world of All Along the Echo may appear more familiar than its post-apocalyptic predecessor, there is also a recurring section in which two disembodied voices from the future exchange existential banter while “listening in, trying to piece it all together”. We are in the territory of Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape, as the pair go back through the archives and select choice instalments to replay: “go on. give’s some more of TONY and LOU and all those other poor souls. i’m in the mood for it today! [static]”. The disembodied voices also warn us: “It all gets so confusing, this business of living and imagining and dreaming in the one skull.” All Along the Echo does run the risk of confusion, with its abundance of different ideas and threads. However, it is a credit to Denton that he holds the book together. Inevitably some sections work better than others, and there is a certain amount of repetition, but the energy and invention are undeniable. Best of all, amid the imaginative pyrotechnics, there are moments of real tenderness and emotional resonance. The shocking violence of a shooting in a London theatre will stay with me for a long time, while Jada’s profound loneliness is delicately drawn. Denton also writes beautifully about parenthood. “People are like cyclones made of words,” one character tells us. All Along the Echo is a cyclone of a novel, emulating the barrage of noise we navigate every day in our “information age”. It foregrounds the fundamental human desire to be seen and heard, as well as the tension between our constructed “ON AIR” identities we perform to the world and our private “OFF AIR” selves.

4/27/2022,"When Bobby Kolade moved back to Uganda in 2018 after 13 years in the European fashion world, he was intent on joining the movement to ban secondhand clothes. The designer remembered buying used clothing at Uganda’s biggest market, Owino in Kampala, as a child, but had since learned about the damage this trade is doing to the environment and to African textile industries. “I see these clothes, and they offend me. I see white shirts with sweat stains and torn colours, and I feel oppressed,” says Kolade. “What does it say about whoever’s donating those clothes to us? And what does it say about our position in the world? It’s rude, you know? It’s really rude.” And yet today Kolade is launching a fashion brand made up entirely of repurposed secondhand clothing sourced in Uganda. Buzigahill is all about “redesigning secondhand clothes and redistributing them to the global north, where they were originally discarded before being shipped to Africa”. Kolade describes Return to Sender, Buzigahill’s first collection, as genderless, playful and raw. Each of the 250 pieces is unique, made from garments that have been cut up and artfully stitched back together. Prices range from $195 (£150) for four-panel T-shirts to $530 for extended coats. Each garment has a “passport” label identifying its country of origin and source. “The thing I enjoy most is the workmanship you can see. You can tell somebody sat down with scissors, cut something up, then put it back together somehow,” says Kolade, who has sourced the materials himself over the past year. Initially, this meant jumping on boda bodas (motorbike taxis) to visit the huge warehouses next to the maze of stalls at Owino, where he would buy clothing bales imported from countries such as the UK, Germany and Canada. Later, he built relationships with clothes importers who would deliver bales – from silk scarves made in South Korea to T-shirts from Canada and the US – directly to Buzigahill’s studio. Here, Kolade designs and produces the clothes along with his small team of tailors. Kolade describes the project as “reactionary design” to the overconsumption of the global north, and the role Africa plays as “a very effective waste disposal system for people’s clothes”. When clothes in the west are discarded at charity shops or donation bins, most are sold by export companies. According to Oxfam, more than 70% of clothes donated globally end up in Africa. Unable to compete with the price of used clothing, local textile industries across the continent suffer. In 2015, members of the East African Community (EAC) – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda – announced plans to ban secondhand clothing imports from their markets. But the US threatened to remove these countries from the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which gives African countries duty-free access to export certain products to the US. Only Rwanda went ahead with a ban in 2018, and, despite severe sanctions, the country’s textile and garment sector is showing promise, growing 83% in value from 2018 to 2020. But used clothes continue to flow into Uganda, and that’s what led Kolade to change his original vision of designing and producing clothes made in Uganda from Ugandan cotton, and for Ugandans. Initially grown using forced labour under British colonialism, Uganda has been producing cotton for more than 100 years. In the post-independence era, it had a thriving homegrown textiles industry. This deteriorated following Uganda’s tumultuous politics in the 70s, combined with economic liberalisation in the 90s which enabled secondhand clothing to become the lucrative industry it is today. With just two textile mills remaining, only 5% of Ugandan cotton is consumed locally, with the rest exported in its raw form. These topics are interrogated in Vintage or Violence, a podcast hosted by Kolade and film-maker Nikissi Serumaga, who is also making a documentary featuring Kolade. The podcast explores why secondhand clothes dominate African textile markets, and what impact this has on local economies and cultures. “International trade was designed such that, in a country like Uganda, our companies are not supposed to succeed,” argues Kolade. He and his team have faced multiple hurdles over the past year, including working on garments for weeks only for the fabric to disintegrate or stretch after being washed, and struggling to set up payment systems on their website. He says: “I am trying to set up a positive story here, to show that we’ve reacted to an economic and political situation to come up with something fun and accessible, but it is menacing.” He eventually managed to set up a PayPal account for Buzigahill, but services such as Instagram shopping are not available for Ugandan products. “If I ever read the phrase ‘not available in your country’, again, I will die!” But he adds: “When I’ve been completely frustrated at these processes, I’ve had to have some compassion, and to understand that what we’re doing is actually quite absurd [sending secondhand clothes back to the global north]. For me as well, this isn’t what I always intended to do.” Kolade is half-German, and could have dodged some of these challenges by setting up his company in Europe and distributing the clothes from there. “But that’s not the point. If we are dedicated to value addition in Uganda, then I want the funds to come directly to Uganda, and I want us to set up the systems.” He is passionate about Ugandan-made products, and has set up a non-profit called Aiduke, which promotes Ugandan fashion products to the local market, with the aim of expanding into global markets. Buzigahill has a 10-year plan to build small, specialised factories across Uganda, not only for repurposing used clothing but also for hand-woven textiles and artisanal production, and Kolade hopes to expand to neighbouring countries too. “We have an opportunity here to start really thinking about the whole recycling, upcycling, repurposing industry, as opposed to only focusing on raw materials,” he explains. “Waste has already become a commodity, but it’s going to become an even more important one. So the sooner we’re able to create industries using this waste as a commodity, the more progress we’re going to make as a region.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/World news,Right back at you: the Ugandan designer returning the west’s cast-offs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/ugandan-designer-who-is-returning-the-wests-cast-offs
4/27/2022,"You would expect the most interesting characters in a culture-clash comedy described as “East meets Wigan” to be one of the two leads. It would be Ashraf, the Egyptian-Muslim taxi driver, trying to uphold tradition in the manner of Eddie Carbone in A View from the Bridge or Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof. Or it would be Ashraf’s daughter Shazia, in the Juliet role, trying to claim her independence while dating a white special-needs teacher who is as nice as he is culturally clueless. It turns out to be neither of these two, despite warm-hearted performances by Dana Haqjoo and Shamia Chalabi, who co-wrote the play with Sarah Henley. They make a believable father-daughter couple, each too fond of the other to let their differences get in the way. But however truthful their relationship, it is one with little dramatic conflict. It is hard to believe the genial Ashraf would pose a threat to Shazia’s marital plans, nor that his “habibti”, or darling, could not charm her way to winning him around. The stakes are low, which is why the temperature rises a notch on the arrival of Ashraf’s new wife, Yasmin. Arriving from Egypt, the willing partner in an arranged marriage to an older man, she looks set to introduce some cross-cultural tension. Played by Houda Echouafni, wearing a head scarf and speaking no English, she seems to fulfil the expectations of orthodox conservatism. Only then does she turn the cliches on their head. Intelligent and empathic, this is a woman who stays true to her values without discriminating against others. Sadly, the more this becomes apparent, the less there is to play for. With so little to be won or lost, we get squabbles instead of arguments. Despite some second-half interjections by director Sepy Baghaei – a punch-up here, a dance routine there – the play drags its feet to an easily won happy ending.

4/27/2022,"Almost two thirds of us try to choose the “healthier” option when we’re eating and drinking – picking cereal bars instead of chocolate, for instance, or opting for fizzy citrus waters rather than sugary sodas. But the truth is that many of our everyday food choices – including the ostensibly better ones – can end up contributing to teeth and gum issues. “What you eat, when you eat it, and whether you effectively clean away any debris makes a big difference in how much plaque builds up in your mouth,” says Elaine Tilling, clinical education and product manager at TePe, a brand that specialises in products that help keep mouths healthy. “A buildup of plaque can lead to tooth decay, and the bacteria from it can also cause gum disease.” Many of us will get gum disease at some point in our lives and it can cause a whole heap of problems including red, swollen and bleeding gums. Left untreated, it can cause your gums to recede from your teeth and destroy the protective tissues that hold teeth in place – in some cases contributing to tooth loss. Sweet harmonyThe kingpin of a healthy smile is a healthy diet. “A wide, balanced diet that contains all the colours of the rainbow will give you all the nutrients you need to keep your teeth and gums healthy,” says Tilling. There are no prizes for guessing that sugar isn’t beneficial, but you may be surprised to hear that “healthier” versions can be just as troublesome. “Sugar is sugar,” says Tilling. “It doesn’t matter if it’s white, brown, honey, agave, maple syrup or fruit sugar – all sugars are equal, and the bacteria that feeds on the sugar in your mouth can cause plaque that forms on your teeth and under gums.” After you eat sugar, acid is produced by the plaque in the mouth, which attacks the enamel, your teeth’s protective coating. Hidden sourcesWhat makes it tricky is that sugar isn’t always easy to spot. The word sugar might not be on the ingredients list of a packaged food, it might even say “no added sugar” on the label, but the sugar may be labelled in a different way. The way to spot hidden sugar sources is to know that they are often listed as syrups or end in -ose (for example, fructose, sucrose, glucose, dextrose), and the higher up they are on the ingredients list, the larger the amount a product contains. The advice from the NHS is that you shouldn’t eat more than 30g a day of these added sugars, the equivalent of seven sugar cubes. It’s also worth knowing that a high-sugar food is classified as containing more than 22.5g per 100g, and a low-sugar food contains less than 5g per 100g. However, although it’s smart to be mindful of sugar, particularly added sugars, this doesn’t mean you need to shun all your favourite foods. “If you want to have chocolate occasionally, have it, but ideally enjoy it after a meal when more saliva is being produced,” says Tilling. “This is because saliva neutralises the acids on the tooth’s surfaces that occur when sugar-containing foods are consumed.” The same goes for dried fruit such as raisins, dates and apricots. These contain nutrients, but they’re still high in sugar and can stick to your teeth, so are best enjoyed at mealtimes rather than as a snack. If food does get stuck in your teeth? Reach for an interdental brush, which removes stubborn food debris that can make bacteria, tooth decay and gum disease more likely. Watch the grazeAnd it’s not just what you eat that matters, but when you eat it. “Grazing on sugary snacks throughout the day means your teeth are under constant attack – you’re essentially keeping them in a sugar bath,” says Tilling. “When you have something sweet, within 30-40 minutes your saliva is working hard to neutralise the acidity, but it can’t do that if you’re always snacking.” So, if you can, stick to three meals a day, and if you must snack, eat the food in one go rather than picking at it for prolonged periods, so the saliva in your mouth can work its magic. Smile savioursAnother trick is to have a piece of cheese after eating something sweet, as the cheese helps to counteract the acidity, bringing the mouth’s pH levels up to alkaline. Chewing foods such as fruit, vegetables and sugar-free gum after meals stimulates saliva flow and could also be beneficial to your oral health. “Fibre-rich foods that require a lot of crunching may have a mechanical effect – almost like a natural toothbrush – on the teeth,” says Tilling. “Try celery, carrots, peppers, or radish, which are all high in nutrients but low in sugar.” Healthy hydratorsWhen it comes to drinks, it’s not just sugary soda you need to watch out for. Sugar-free fizzy drinks can be more problematic than flat drinks because the dioxide in the bubbles is acidic, which can cause erosion. Meanwhile, fruit juices and smoothies are high in enamel-damaging sugars and acids. Having these drinks occasionally with a meal is your best bet. “Drinking through a straw also helps the drink bypass your teeth,” says Tilling. Mind the gapThe best way to have your cake and eat it is to remember that diligent brushing (think twice a day for two minutes with a fluoride toothpaste) as well as regular dentist checkups is non-negotiable. However, it’s worth knowing that brushing cleans only up to 60% of a tooth’s surfaces. The secret to getting to the other parts is to use an interdental brush that scrapes away the debris and bacteria from in between your teeth and under your gum line, helping to reduce plaque and your chances of gum disease. So keep an interdental brush in your kitchen, bathroom, at work, in the car, and in your bag, and you can keep your teeth and gums clean, fresh and happy, whatever you’ve been eating. Now, that’s something to smile about.

4/27/2022,"Within our bodies lies the miraculous power of renewal: even if you’ve been around for 40 years or more, most of the cells in your body are no more than 10 years old. But as we age, the body’s ability to replace and refresh our tissues declines, affecting almost every part of us – and the mouth is no exception. When you factor in the daily stresses our mouths withstand, it’s clear that in middle age and beyond, they require extra care to remain healthy, gleaming and disease-free. Wear and tear“Our teeth are protected by enamel, which is a hard, protective coating, but damage over time can cause it to gradually wear away,” says Amanda Sheehan, clinical and educational support specialist at TePe, a brand that specialises in products that help keep mouths healthy. “When this happens, the dentine underneath is exposed. Dentine has a naturally yellow colour so you may also appear to lose whiteness, and your teeth may be less stain-resistant, so coffee, tea, and other high-coloured food and drinks are more problematic.” But that’s not all. “With age, you may also start to notice some gum recession, exposing the base of the tooth,” says Sheehan. “This makes it easier for plaque bacteria to build up, causing bleeding, swelling and potential soreness of the gums, which is known as gum disease.” How to youth-boost your smile: watch your consumption of fizzy drinks and fruit juices, as these contain acid that can wear away enamel. Brushing your teeth cleans only up to 60% of the tooth’s surfaces, so it’s important to floss with interdental brushes to clear the damaging, hard-to-reach bacteria from the interdental spaces in order to keep your gums healthy. Changing hormonesThe perimenopause and menopause can cause a whole heap of major changes in your body, but did you know the shift in hormones could also raise your risk of dental problems and gum disease? This is because declining oestrogen levels can decrease the amount of saliva in your mouth. “This matters because saliva has protective qualities,” says Sheehan. “It cleanses the teeth and rinses away cavity-causing bacteria, with buffering capacity to help neutralise the acid levels in your mouth, so having less saliva will lead to a dry mouth, which increases your risk of decay.” On top of this, lower oestrogen puts you at a higher risk of bone loss, and losing bone in the jaw can lead to possible gum recession, which could expose the recession of your teeth to increasing risk of decay. How to youth-boost your smile: drinking plenty of water is a sure way to alleviate a dry mouth in the short term, while chewing sugar-free gum encourages your mouth to make more saliva. And make sure you brush your teeth before you go to bed. “Be particularly diligent about cleaning before bed, as saliva levels naturally drop at night,” says Sheehan. And to help keep your bones strong, ensure you’re getting adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is effective in preventing bone loss associated with the menopause, so talk to your specialist nurse or GP about whether it might be beneficial for you. Stress levelsThe demands of mid-life – such as supporting older children and helping ageing parents – can be stressful. And stress could lead to potential teeth grinding, known as bruxism, which can occur while you’re awake or asleep. “This can cause multiple problems including wearing down tooth edges, a loss of enamel and cause sensitivity,” says Sheehan. How to youth-boost your smile: if you think you’re grinding your teeth, talk to your dentist, who may recommend that you wear a custom mouthguard at night. However, this won’t make the grinding stop, so you need to tackle the causes of stress and anxiety. This is often easier said than done, but stress management techniques such as regular exercise, breathing exercises and meditation may be beneficial. Acid refluxThe upward movement (acid reflux or regurgitation) of stomach acid towards the throat and mouth is a common, but very much unwanted, digestive disorder. It can become troublesome with age for various reasons, which may include increased weight, dietary choices and higher stress levels. When stomach acid creeps its way into the mouth, it potentially bathes the teeth in acids, leading to loss of the fluoride-rich enamel layer and can lead to increased risk of tooth decay. How to youth-boost your smile: Acid reflux can be treated with medication, but it’s smart to take dental precautions, too. Your dental professional may recommend using a specialised toothpaste to help protect and strengthen enamel. Identifying triggers can help too, whether it’s caused by acidic foods such as fruit juices or spicy dishes, or alcohol. “You may be tempted to reach for the toothbrush more often, but don’t brush your teeth after you’ve had acid reflux or within 30 minutes of eating or you’ll risk damaging the enamel that’s already been weakened by the acid,” says Sheehan. Rinsing with water, or a fluoride-based mouth rinse, will help protect the teeth further.

4/27/2022,"From the polar oceans to tropical jungles, the planet is filled with all manner of habitats for diverse life. But we don’t have to look far to find places teeming with critters. We have one within our bodies: our mouths. Second only to the gut, the mouth is the most fertile habitat for life in the human body and is home to many types of viruses, fungi, protozoa, and more than 700 species of bacteria. To these tiny lifeforms, your mouth is a thriving landscape where different zones, such as your teeth, tongue, palate, cheeks and gums provide hard and soft terrains with varied niches for bacteria to cluster in and compete to survive. We may be told from a young age that microbes are disgusting and dangerous, but their presence in our bodies is extremely important. The oral microbiome, communities of microorganisms living in our mouths, plays a fascinating and often symbiotic role in maintaining overall oral health, as well as systemic health. In fact, its presence not only assists with breaking down food and maintaining oral hygiene, but also controls more harmful organisms that enter the mouth. When everything is in balance, the microorganisms that support the mouth’s normal functions are able to live in harmony. It is therefore worth getting to know some of the more important critters that live in our mouths and how to create a healthy home for them. Welcome to the oral safari … The first group of organisms on our tour is a genus of fungi called Candida. In healthy bodies, Candida colonises the mouth, throat and gut, and can live in mucous membranes without causing harm. If conditions change, such as when a host’s immune system is weakened or antibiotics affect the natural balance of microbes in the body, they can multiply out of control and cause oral candidiasis. This is typified by an unpleasant taste in the mouth, sore tongue and gums, difficulty eating and drinking, and a characteristic white-stippling appearance that you may know as oral thrush. While treatments can be bought from a pharmacist, healthy mouths are home to another fungus that helps control Candida populations under normal conditions. In the past 10 years, research has suggested that Pichia, a little-known yeast-like fungus, produces an antifungal chemical that interferes with Candida growth. It achieves this by stopping the more harmful fungus from creating biofilms, sticky mats that form multi-layered matrixes that allow them, and many other oral organisms, to adhere to their chosen surface. Lots of species of bacteria also create biofilms to colonise the mouth. This is the stuff plaque is made of, which is often produced by bacteria that convert sugar particles into acids. Plaque is natural and contributes to the normal development of the mouth’s physiology and defences in a healthy mouth. If the balance is disturbed, such as when we consume too much sugar, carbohydrates, or fizzy drinks, then it too can become an issue. In an unhealthy host, the acid produced by bacteria lowers the mouth’s natural pH levels, allowing more harmful acidogenic and acid-tolerant bacteria, such as Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus, to become dominant. Left unchecked, plaque continues to build up and hardens into tartar. The acid produced by the bacteria then weakens teeth and gums, contributing to tooth decay and cavities by gradually dissolving the enamel and dentine that protect them. Similarly, gum disease is caused by anaerobic bacteria called Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, which live in the plaque and cause the gums to become inflamed and prone to bleeding during brushing. If left untreated, the plaque buildup will cause gingivitis, which may lead to periodontitis, where the natural gap between the tooth and gum deepens due to increased inflammation to form pockets. Over time, these gaps fill with more plaque and can become infected, and can lead to tooth loss. The key to preventing this and for maintaining the correct balance in your mouth’s ecology is a good oral regime. Amanda Sheehan, clinical and educational support specialist at TePe, a brand that specialises in products that help keep mouths healthy, says: “The most important thing we can do is to have an effective oral hygiene routine – brushing twice daily.” One of those cleans should ideally take place before bed, Sheehan says. “When we sleep our saliva flow decreases, leaving the mouth more vulnerable to the effects of acid attacks.” But regular brushing is just part of the process, as it only cleans up to 60% of the tooth’s surfaces. “We need to use an interdental brush to clean the interdental spaces to reach up to the 40% surface area that regular brushing alone can’t reach.” By using interdental brushes, such as those produced by TePe, we can mechanically remove plaque and reduce the need to use harsh chemical products for the same purpose. These more extreme dental interventions may help clean our mouths, but they can also kill both the “good” and the “bad” organisms living there. Without our tiny protectors, our mouths are vulnerable to opportunistic infections and invasive species. So with an effective brushing routine, as well as a healthy lifestyle and diet, we can maintain an ideal environment where our personal microbiomes continue to thrive.

4/27/2022,"Keli is a three-part audio drama about brass band contests and their connection to former mining towns. If that sounds like a history lesson on the legacy of Britain’s industrial past, it is, to some extent. An audio montage of sorts, it begins as part documentary, part fable, part story-in-the-making, all these threads set to the rumble of brass sounds (music by Whitburn Band). It is co-created by Wils Wilson and composer-writer Martin Green and we follow Green’s intermittent narration across Scotland. He combines his year-long research into brass band music with a fictionalised story of a working-class teenager, Keli (Anna Russell-Martin). She is a talented tenor horn player who has grown up caring for her mother, and Green builds her character, and voice, alongside various others. Directed by Wilson, the metafictional framing sucks the life out of the first episode, which sounds like a series of confusing stops and starts. It is hard to keep track of Keli’s burgeoning story amid the jumble of other voices; there are snatches of vox pops from former mining towns spliced with Keli’s voice and parts of a fable (about a stranger in a village). Green inserts his narrative alongside all of these layers, adds interjections and whimsical reflections. His words – occasionally self-indulgent in their lyricism – sound like waffling interruptions. “If I need a story, I need a protagonist. Who is this player?” he says, and later gives us a brief history of a power station when Keli takes refuge in it. It is hard to navigate the patchwork of voices at the start and it is not always clear what is happening, or who is talking. But by the middle of the second episode the narrator’s voice begins to melt away, and the layers of music and dialogue become orchestral. The piece becomes more gripping as Keli’s story takes centre stage, and this story has none of the bonhomie or light, fuzzy edges of Brassed Off; it is a hard story about the limitations placed on some working-class lives, capturing teenage desperation, depression and fulfilment through music. There are powerful flashpoints and tensions between characters and the combined forces of dialogue, music and folklore harmonise to a riveting final episode that is wholly worth the wait. Keli is available online from the Royal Lyceum theatre, Edinburgh, until 27 April.",Arts/Stage,"Keli review – music, mining and a maelstrom of emotions in brass band drama",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/27/keli-review-brass-band-drama
4/27/2022,"The government policy towards care homes in England at the start of the Covid pandemic has been ruled illegal, in a significant blow to ministers’ claim to have thrown a “protective ring” around the vulnerable residents. The high court judgment was sought by two grieving daughters, Dr Cathy Gardner and Fay Harris, who lost their fathers to the virus in care homes in spring 2020. Michael Gibson died aged 88 in Oxfordshire on 3 April 2020 while Don Harris died aged 89 in Hampshire on 1 May 2020, both after outbreaks in their care homes. More than a quarter of all deaths among care home residents in March and April 2020 involved Covid-19 – more than 12,500 people. Lawyers for Gardner, 60, and Harris, 58, had argued in a judicial review the government did the “very opposite” of the claim by then health secretary, Matt Hancock, that “right from the start we have tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes”. After an almost 22-month crowdfunded legal challenge to the legality of policies advanced by the health secretary, Public Health England and NHS England, the verdict was handed down on Wednesday. Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Garnham said: “The decisions of the secretary of state for health and social care to make and maintain a series of policies contained in documents issued on 17 and 19 March and 2 April 2020 were unlawful because the drafters of those documents failed to take into account the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from non-symptomatic transmission.” As ministers and officials pushed to free up space in hospitals by discharging 25,000 hospital patients into care homes, government guidance issued on 2 April 2020 said negative tests were not required prior to transfers. The daughters had argued the failure to protect care home residents was among the most “egregious and devastating policy failures in the modern era”. During proceedings government lawyers denied any policy failure and told the court that scientists did not advise of “firm evidence” of asymptomatic transmission until mid-April 2020. They said fears of hospitals becoming overwhelmed were “far from being theoretical” and that ministers had to balance competing harms amid enormous challenges. The judges said the risk of asymptomatic transmission had been highlighted by people including Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, in a radio interview as early as 13 March. “Non-symptomatic transmission would mean that one elderly patient moved from hospital to a care home could infect other residents before manifesting symptoms, or even without ever manifesting symptoms,” they said. “The judges found that it was irrational for the DHSC not to have advised until mid-April 2020 that where an asymptomatic patient (other than one who had tested negative for Covid-19) was admitted to a care home, he or she should, so far as practicable, be kept apart from other residents for 14 days.” The court dismissed the other aspects of the case brought by the claimants, including claims under articles 2 and 8 of the European convention on human rights, and a claim against NHS England.",News/World news,"Covid: discharging untested patients into care homes was unlawful, says court",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/covid-discharging-untested-patients-into-care-homes-was-unlawful-says-court
4/27/2022,"Swedish designer Carolina Härdh has a good philosophy for her creative process: “As a designer, I need to take responsibility for my decisions in terms of material choice and manufacturing. Because, whatever I create, it will live on longer than I will do, so I want to make sure it’s not toxic. Using design as a tool for change has become my way of understanding myself, nature and sustainability.” For Härdh, this means making furniture out of food waste. But it’s an idea that Syrian artist and architect Mohamad Hafez might relate to. He makes beautiful, intricate miniatures of Middle Eastern streets which are created not just to enchant but also to understand himself and what has happened to his homeland. Design can be a great tool to make sense of the world as well as shape it. For more news on architecture, sustainable living, art, fashion and new ideas, sign up for our monthly newsletter here When fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld was a child, he found an old magazine in his family’s attic in Hamburg and fell in love with the pictures and illustrations on its pages. Unsurprisingly for Karl Lagerfeld, it turns out his taste was exceptional: the magazine was a rare pre-first world war edition of Simplicissimus, a satirical German weekly. The find ignited a delight in German posters and graphic design and, over his lifetime, Lagerfeld collected a unique archive of prints, mainly created between 1905 and 1920, in a style known as Plakatstil or Sachplakat, which is typified by bold type and strong, graphic colours. German designers of that time respected the national industries and work ethic, and worked hard themselves to produce imaginative designs to sell mundane products. The Karl Lagerfeld collection includes poster art by artist Lucian Bernard who pioneered the Sachplakat or “object poster”. His ability to transform adverts for mundane objects into works of art is clearest in his pieces for Adler typewriters and Manoli cigarettes. There are also key works by Ludwig Hohlwein, a prolific poster artist whose designs transformed ordinary objects, such as light bulbs, typewriters and tools, into striking graphic images. Lagerfeld was an insatiable collector who amassed fantastic assortments of everything from art and furniture to luggage and more than 200 pairs of his trademark fingerless gloves. Since his death in 2019, Sotheby’s has held auctions of Lagerfeld’s possessions, separating the spoils of his obsessions into lots. This May, his German poster art collection will be one of the final events to disperse the personal effects of the designer and creative. If you find yourself bidding on one of these gems without perhaps the funds to cover the extravagance, remember what Lagerfeld himself said: ​​“If you throw money out of the window, throw it out with joy. Don’t say: ‘one shouldn’t do that’ – that is bourgeois.” Sotheby’s Cologne holds a number of auctions of Lagerfeld’s Estate 29 April – 6 May. The sale of his poster collection takes place on 4 - 5 May Syrian born architect Mohamad Hafez started making his mesmerising dioramas because he was homesick. He travelled to the US in 2003 on a single-entry visa to study architecture, and realised he wouldn’t be able to visit home until he finished his course in case he was barred from re-entering. He didn’t see Damascus for eight years. To compensate, he made miniature Middle Eastern streetscapes from sketches of his homeland. Since the start of the Syrian War in 2011, his motivation has become more complex. His tiny world now reflects the devastation of conflict ripping through the beautiful architecture and communities of his home. Hafez hopes his sculptures will help humanise the victims of the war. “I want to remind people of Syria’s rich cultural history that is being eradicated through war,” says the artist. “I want to share the stories, to show what is so rich about the region and what is so devastating that somebody could risk all their family in a little float over the Mediterranean. How bad does it have to be for somebody to risk the lives of their own kids on a little inflatable?” British audiences can see Hafez’s emotional and beautifully skilled work for the first time at his current exhibition in Brighton. Americans can check out his latest project in Connecticut. Hafez has opened Cafe Pistachio in New Haven which he calls “a community safe space”. It serves Syrian coffee and Middle Eastern desserts and, hopefully, a side order of cultural education. The cafe is furnished with the old-fashioned radios, art and mosaic tables that, to him, represent Syrian homes. The venue is Hafez’s attempt to entertain people in the style of his homeland at a time when it’s hard for them to travel there. “I truly believe in architecture’s power of touching spirits and changing minds,” he says, explaining that he wanted to see if the nostalgia of his miniatures could work on a grand scale. Journeys From An Absent Present to a Lost Past by Mohamad Hafez is at Fabrica, Brighton, until 29 May. Pistachio’s opening hours are on the cafe’s website Swedish designer Carolina Härdh has taken the concepts of local, zero-waste and the circular economy to their logical conclusion with the furniture range she’s made for Japanese restaurant Vrå in her hometown of Gothenburg. It’s all made from the food waste created by the restaurant. Härdh uses a mix of rice starch, kombu, fish bones, and oyster shells to make a version of terrazzo. The oysters are a local crop – Crassostrea gigas or Pacific oysters which originated in Japan but are abundant off the Swedish west coast. All the other ingredients were plentiful in the restaurant’s dustbins. “It’s important that we search for local materials that we have to hand,” explains Härdh, “whether that’s a typical kind of wood, a food ingredient or harvest byproduct or something that’s ended up on at local dump. We need to take responsibility for what already has been produced and see what resources we already have.” Instead of the cement base used to bind the marble or granite fragments of traditional terrazzo, Härdh’s biomaterial uses ground shells and is bound together with fish glue. It’s strong enough to be used for restaurant benches, tables and chairs. Any waste is used to make chopstick rests, or used as fertiliser for Vrå’s rooftop vegetable garden. And when the furniture reaches the end of its lifespan, it will either biodegrade or recycle. Härdh hopes to make circular, zero-waste principles tangible and understandable for the restaurant’s guests. “As a designer, I need to take responsibility for my design decisions in terms of material choice, manufacturing. Because, whatever I create, it will live on longer than I will do, so I want to make sure it’s not toxic. Using design as a tool for change has become my way of understanding myself, nature and sustainability.” London Craft Week returns in May, featuring work by more than 765 artists and makers working in every area from heritage skills to material innovation. This year’s programme celebrates the international craft community – including the launch of country pavilions. This first year, they’ll focus on Malaysia and Norway. Other themes include artistry in fashion (including a hook-up with the V&A Museum and the excellent Menswear exhibition) and sustainable and digital craft. The Fabricant – maker of the first digital-only dress – will lead a workshop on the creative possibilities of digital fashion during LCW. The winner of the inaugural John Smedley Craft Prize will also be announced and there will be a maker’s market at The Royal Exchange to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee and the work of the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust. The New Craftsmen gallery also celebrates 10 years with its exhibition, Plant Explorations. “From the first LCW, we wanted to be a practical showcase of what we call the Iceberg of Creative Talent,” says Guy Salter, chairman of LCW, “which means championing less well-known artists and household names. The last two years have seen their numbers grow but they remain undiscovered and undervalued. So this year we redouble our efforts to draw as much attention as possible to men and women in workshops, studios and at home creating quite exceptionally special things.” London Craft Week runs 9-15 May. For details of talks, exhibitions and workshops, go to the London Craft Week website This year marks the 150th anniversary of Nordic design company Fritz Hansen. The original Hansen was a cabinetmaker from Nakskov, Denmark. Right from the start, the company made innovative designs. The founder’s office chair from 1878 was one of the first to have a plywood back and laminated veneer. Hansen also spearheaded the steam bending wood technique for furniture, working with the method’s inventor, Michael Thonet, in the Scandinavian market.The desire to modernise continues to this day with launches such as the NO2 Recycle chair made from plastic household waste. Over the years, Fritz Hansen has collaborated with some of the most prestigious names in Scandinavian design, as well as championing new young talent. While greats such as Arne Jacobsen, Hans J Wegner and Verner Panton are a key part of the company’s history, Nendo, Jaime Hayon and Cecilie Manz have created recent masterpieces. To celebrate its first 150 years, the house is releasing some of the most famous designs using special fabrics, colours and materials including the Egg, the Lily and the Swan chairs by Jacobsen, and a PKO chair and PK60 table by Poul Kjaerholm. As Josef Kaiser, CEO of Fritz Hansen, says: “Ours is a story of exquisite design created on a foundation of craftsmanship and innovation. The anniversary designs convey the modern-day relevance of each design.” An unusual design show takes place in London’s Mile End Pavilion over the next month. The exhibition displays works inspired by University College London (UCL) research and created in collaboration with artists and communities based around the university’s new UCL East campus in Olympic Park, which is currently under construction. The Trellis project started in 2018 and this latest exhibition showcases a year’s work between six artists, nine researchers and numerous partners based in east London. The projects are as different as they are fascinating, ranging from work around local food poverty and AI discrimination to raising awareness of cancer. Bubble Worlds – a cocoon installation which looks like it’s breathing – comes from the experiences of local refugees during lockdown. It’s created by the refugee community from Code Your Future, collaborating with artist Duncan Paterson and UCL roboticists. UCL Cancer Institute research fellow, Dr Ayse U Akarca, and jeweller Kassandra Lauren Gordon collaborated with people from Great Ormond Street hospital with experience of cancer, to co-create Tailor Made, a collection of jewellery designs inspired by cancer cells. Gordon was a community worker and domestic violence professional before she became a jeweller. Giving voices to communities is important to her. “I believe that art can change the world and improve lives,” she says. “Jewellery is already used to mark major points in people’s lives, like marriage. In this project we are using jewellery to break social taboos about disease and health, and to help people reclaim their narratives.” UCL head of public art Sam Wilkinson says of the exhibition: “Trellis is important, it offers visitors a unique chance to hear the voices of those who are rarely heard. These artworks are evocative, surprising and eye-opening.” Trellis is at The Art Pavilion, Mile End Park, until 8 May",Lifestyle/Life and style,"March design news: cancer jewellery, food furniture, Karl Lagerfeld",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/27/march-design-news-cancer-jewellery-food-furniture-karl-lagerfeld
4/27/2022,"Manchester City had 60% of the ball. They had 16 shots to Real Madrid’s 11. They won on xG, taking a consensus of various algorithms, about 3.1 to 1.6. And yet they will go to the Bernabéu next week leading only 4-3 and, probably, with a grim sense of a familiar history being played out. Madrid have won four Champions Leagues in the past decade. They have rarely, if ever, been the best side in the world in that period. In Cristiano Ronaldo’s nine years at the club, they won only two La Liga titles. They couldn’t produce consistently enough to dominate the league and yet, somehow, in the Champions League, in what had always been their tournament, they got results. Sometimes it was down to rivals, often Atlético, but also at times City and Wolfsburg, freezing at key moments. Sometimes it was down to freakish errors from opponents: Pep Guardiola going gung-ho in 2014, Mehdi Benatia’s daft foul on Lucas Vázquez in the 2018 quarter-final, then the Loris Karius aberration in the final. Often it was down to brilliant individuals – Ronaldo, Luka Modric, Gareth Bale, Sergio Ramos – doing something brilliant. They found a way. This season, the tendency has been brought to new heights. This is madridismo in excelsis. Madrid have lost at home to Sheriff Tiraspol. They have been largely outplayed for long spells by Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. They have repeatedly seemed on the brink of conceding the goal that would, at last, bring reality to bear. But, like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction, they somehow cannot be finished off. Thibaut Courtois keeps making remarkable saves. Luka Modric keeps playing remarkable passes. Opposing goalkeepers keep making remarkable mistakes. And, most of all, Karim Benzema keeps scoring remarkable goals, 14 of them now in the competition this season, nine in five knockout games. This shouldn’t work. The midfield is too old. Dani Carvajal looks shot. David Alaba seems an elderly 29. Whenever a team press them, they look rattled, like a dowager aunt flustered by the cheek of a gang of urchins she’s unexpectedly encountered in the street. And then Benzema wraps his foot in front of his marker and guides a speculative cross in off the inside of the post with a volley of extraordinary deftness, precision and subtlety and the dynamic of the game has changed utterly. At some point, surely, conviction in your ability to do something sensational will not be enough. At some point opponents will not miss the sort of chances that Riyad Mahrez did (twice) and Phil Foden did (twice) and Aymeric Laporte did. At some point, Madrid will suffer a defeat from which there is no coming back. And yet, again, they have come through a battering having sustained relatively minimal damage. Guardiola is a rationalist. He studies and researches. He speaks of the need for control. There is a constituency that admires his football but finds it a little cold, too rarefied, too cerebral. He will look back over that first leg and know his team could have won by three or four. He will think of the shot Mahrez sliced into the side-netting when he could have squared it. He will think of Foden’s sidefoot towards an otherwise empty net hitting Carvajal. He will think of how Vinícius Júnior would never have outpaced Kyle Walker the way he did Fernandinho for the Madrid second and know his side should have better balance with the probable return of both first-choice full-backs for the second leg. He may reflect on how unfortunate it was that the ball struck Laporte’s hand after glancing off his head for the penalty, and may be relieved that the away goals rule no longer exists. He will know that if his side play to the same level in Madrid, they should reach a second consecutive Champions League final. But what must lurk deep within is a knowledge that this kind of thing keeps happening to his side against big teams in big games. This is why he overthinks, because again and again over the past dozen years his sides have played brilliantly in big games, missed chances and then been undone by opponents who seem always more ruthless. It happened for his Barcelona against Inter in 2010 and against Chelsea in 2012. It happened for his Bayern against Atlético in 2016. It happened for his City against Monaco in 2017 and against Tottenham in 2019. Again and again, his side have played stunning football for spells of key games and not progressed. That’s why Guardiola doesn’t just send his side out to play in their usual way any more. History suggests being better is not enough. That’s why he expends so much effort in trying to find ways to prevent the opposition countering. That’s why he espouses a doctrine of control. It’s a conclusion to which experience draws a lot of managers, that in big games it’s safer to win the shot-count 5-0 than 20-5. And yet football, this beautiful, cruel, infinitely complex phenomenon, replete with ironies, paradoxes and checks and balances, that continues heroically to defy the attempts of money to render it docile, cannot allow that: it has made it so that every attempt Guardiola makes to stave off risk rebounds upon him and brings about his downfall, the overthinking against Liverpool, Lyon and Chelsea. Rationality says that City have a lead, that they’re the better team, and that Madrid cannot keep pulling off the same trick in Europe. But with Guardiola in Europe, rationality rarely seems to have much to do with it.",Sport/Football,What Real Madrid do shouldn’t work but yet again they are still standing | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/what-real-madrid-do-shouldnt-work-but-yet-again-they-are-still-standing-manchester-city-guardiola
4/27/2022,"Unions are demanding an immediate end to the New South Wales government’s public sector wage cap after inflation rose to 5.1%, amid ongoing industrial action across multiple industries. The head of the nursing union has also accused the government of attempting to “divide and conquer” unions after the NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said teachers who planned to strike next week were being selfish for demanding a pay rise beyond what nurses have received – despite that sector also calling for a raise. On Tuesday, the NSW Teachers Federation voted to walk off the job next Wednesday if the government did not increase wages and address staffing shortages. The union executive also voted to allow teachers to leave school grounds if an MP visited – an action which dozens carried out when the premier, Dominic Perrottet, visited Marsden high school in western Sydney on Wednesday. The premier has flagged there will be measures in the upcoming budget to address some of the issues raised by unions, but has resisted calls from Labor and the union to make any announcements before June. “I can’t commit that they’re going to be happy with the outcome … but I believe we will come up with a fair and reasonable approach,” he said. Perrottet said he wanted teachers in NSW to be “paid the very best” of all the states. But the teachers union boss, Angelo Gavrielatos, claimed the government had been disingenuous in its dealings with the union and had not sat down with him for a formal negotiation since last October. “When it comes to teaching and the health of the teaching profession, we are in a crisis,” he said. “What is at risk here is the right of every child to be taught by a qualified teacher. This crisis will worsen for as long as the government continues the gimmickry and lies.” Teachers are calling for pay rises of between 5% and 7.5% to address severe shortages and increased overtime. On Tuesday, Mitchell said the demand was akin to “blackmail” and compared teachers with nurses, saying “the union is now asking for more than nurses and other frontline workers who have all worked tirelessly during the pandemic”. Nurses have also been calling for a significant wage increase, as well as the introduction of nurse-to-patient ratios, and have gone on strike twice this year. The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association general secretary, Brett Holmes, said that nurses and teachers both deserved to be treated better. “Those are [the government’s] tactics – to divide and conquer,” Holmes said. “The education minister shows the level of disrespect which she wouldn’t be prepared to do to nurses, otherwise the community would be in uproar. And the community should be an uproar about the level of disrespect to the teachers as well.” On Wednesday, Mitchell said the government was committed to “reaching a fair and reasonable outcome in the Industrial Relations Commission”. “The government is following a clear and agreed process for negotiating awards. We are simply asking the union does the same,” Mitchell said. Paramedics are also calling for a rise above the cap to keep NSW competitive with other states so young workers aren’t lost to other states. “We need a significant pay rise – not only because we deserve it but we’re now losing staff to other states,” said the NSW delegate for the Australia Paramedics Association, Brett Simpson. Simpsonintensive care paramedic said it was a “miscalculation” for the government to “play unions off against each other”. “It unities us in anger,” he said. Unions NSW secretary, Mark Morey, said Wednesday’s inflation jump to 5.1% was proof “everything is going up except wages” and demanded Perrottet scrap the cap that was introduced during the pandemic.“As the nation’s largest employer, the NSW government’s tight-fisted austerity is also holding back workers in the private sector from getting a pay rise that keeps pace with the cost of living,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “NSW is going to struggle to stop key workers from fleeing to other states where the cost of housing is lower and the prospect of a decent pay rise is greater.” Rail workers have also been locked in heated negotiations with the government over conditions and pay after industrial action that led state authorities to shut down the Sydney rail network earlier this year. “We are comfortable with where the negotiations are at this point [but] we do understand that the difficult part will be when they have to start talking about money,” RTBU secretary, Alex Claassens, said. He was hopeful that he could present members with a new agreement sometime next month, or would be forced to consider further industrial action. The state opposition leader, Chris Minns, has called for the government to be clear with the unions about what to expect in the budget to avoid further actions that will affect thousands of families. “If there’s a chance to avoid industrial action between now and the budget day, let’s pursue that opportunity,” he said.",News/Australia news,Unions point to 5.1% inflation in calls for NSW government to drop public service wage cap,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/unions-point-to-51-inflation-in-calls-for-nsw-government-to-drop-public-service-wage-cap
