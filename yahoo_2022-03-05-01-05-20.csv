3/5/2022,"The founder of a leading algorithmic fund in Russia pulled out a bottle, drank to the “death” of the country’s stock market and said he planned to pivot to a career as a dress-up Santa Claus during a live broadcast on a Russian financial channel Wednesday. Alex Butmanov, CEO and founder of DTI Algorithmic, which trades stocks and ETFs on global financial markets in Russia as well as the U.S., Europe and Asia, was a guest on “Trading in a New Way,” a special program on the RBC Investments YouTube Channel. Anchor Elina Tikhonova expected it to be a typical interview. It quickly became apparent that wouldn’t be the case. https://twitter.com/tjournal/status/1499300107837128704 When greeted, Butmanov said he would not say “good afternoon” in return, noting he did not see a future in his industry, due to the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European countries. (Russian stock markets have been closed for the past four days.) She asked if he planned to stay in his profession. He said he was “going to work as a Santa Claus, like 25 years ago”. Then it got especially strange. Butmanov reached down below the desk and grabbed a bottle that he claims was soda. He screwed off the top and toasted the demise of Russia’s stock market. “Jokes aside, let's get this done quickly,” he said, according to a Google translation. “I send my regards to Sergei Usichenko, who drank 13 years ago to the death of the stock market. Today I drink soda. Dear stock market, you were close to us and interesting. Rest in peace, dear comrade.” Tikhonova looked on with shock, eventually concluding the interview—or at least the portion that made it online—by saying “I'm not going to comment on this flash mob.” Curious who Sergei Usichenko was? In 2008, as the market crashed during the world financial crisis, he too took to the airwaves and toasted the death of the markets—only he did so with vodka in a coffee mug. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtELvvr-0L4 Usichenko, ironically, is now Deputy CEO at Epicentr K, a national chain of home improvement stores in Ukraine.

3/5/2022,"When building a retirement portfolio, you have many options to choose from. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can all be part of a basket of investments that will help you make sure you're able to take care of yourself once you are done working. Annuities are a bit more complex than some other investments, but they provide guaranteed retirement income that can come in very handy in your retirement plan. It isn't always easy to know exactly what an annuity will pay, though, so here let's take a look at what a $100,000 fixed annuity will pay each month in your retirement. Evaluating an annuity as a potential part of your retirement plan? Consider a financial advisor's help. Finding one is easy with SmartAsset's free financial advisor matching service. What Is an Annuity? An annuity is a financial contract between you and an insurance company that requires the insurance company to make periodic payments to you over a period of time. It is sometimes a source of retirement income when you want or need a guaranteed source of income without worrying about market fluctuations. It's possible to calculate the value of an annuity on your own using one of several methods. The variables that you need to know are the interest rate payable on the annuity and the length of time for which you will receive the periodic payments. You can also use a financial calculator to calculate the payment on an annuity in addition to the two methods shown. The insurance company from which you buy the annuity will have tables you can look at for a variety of combinations of interest rates and time periods. Calculating Payments on an Annuity: Two Methods Method 1 An annuity is an equal stream of payments over a given time. You can use the present value of an annuity formula, solving for payment, or an Excel spreadsheet. The formula for calculating the payment on an annuity is the following: Payment = Principal x i (1+i)^n / i (1 +i)^n – 1 where i = monthly interest rate and ^n = number of payment periods expressed as an exponent Imagine that you have paid $100,000 for an annuity that will make payments to you monthly for 10 years. The interest rate you were promised in the annuity contract was 3%. You want to know how much you are paid each month: Payment = $100,000 x 0.03/12 (1 + 0.03/12) 10 x 12 / (1 + 0.03/12)10 x 12 – 1 = $965.61 Method 2 Using an Excel spreadsheet, you solve for payment. Here is the formula you use: =PMT(I, N, PV) In this equation, the following values are used: i= interest rate/number of payment periods N = number of years multiplied by number of payment periods PV = present value of the annuity In this case, enter the following in one cell: =PMT (0.03%/12, 10 x 12, 100,000, 0) = $965.61 where i is the 3% interest rate divided by 12 monthly payments, N is the number of payment periods or 10 years times 12 monthly payment periods in one year and $100,000 is the present value of the annuity. The monthly payment on a $100,000 annuity if the interest rate is 3% and the time period is 10 years is $965.61. The present value of an annuity is based on the principles of time value of money. It is defined as the present value of the future cash flows generated by the annuity at a given interest rate and for a given time. The monthly payments on an annuity increase if the interest rate increases or the term of the annuity decreases. The monthly payments would decrease if the interest rate decreased, or the term of the annuity increases. The Bottom Line It's possible that you may want to include an annuity as part of your retirement planning. It depends on your risk preferences, your time horizon and your investment goals. It is generally a good idea to meet with a financial advisor and allow them to help you decide if an annuity fits within your financial plan.

3/5/2022,"All in all, the stock market is hanging tough in what has been a turbulent two weeks for humanity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 600 points on Wednesday as of this writing. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are nearing gains of 2%. All three major indexes are nicely off the lows hit by the close of trading on Feb. 23, a mere hours before Russia invaded Ukraine. Every member of the FAANG [Facebook/Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google/Alphabet] cohort has gained in the last five trading days as luck would have it, paced by a nearly 7% increase in Alphabet. And believe us, there are many things trying very hard to bring the major stock indexes to their collective knees. Oil prices ripped through $110 a barrel on Wednesday as the war between Russia and Ukraine intensified. Western company after Western company are saying see you later to Russia in light of its action. One of the latest names is credit card giant American Express. These actions by the West has some Wall Street strategists telling Yahoo Finance Live the Russian economy is poised to nosedive into a deep, protracted recession. Meanwhile top emerging market investors such as Mark Mobius tell us Russia may be uninvestable for more than a year, and putting money to work in other emerging markets like China and Brazil are not without heightened risk. And as oil prices spike — and it can be considered a spike (leading to a potential super-spike as Goldman Sachs chief commodities strategist Jeff Currie explained to us) — gas prices in America keep on rising, rising and rising further. The average price of petrol in California is approaching $5 a gallon, the highest in the country. The extra money gas inflation will siphon out of the pockets of consumers is real. That's money that could be spent at Macy's for a new pair of jeans. That's extra money it will cost a FedEx to ship a package due to higher fuel expenditures. And what is FedEx likely to do about it? Jack up prices further on the beat-up wallets of consumers. Despite the litany of issues — which naturally could hammer corporate profits in 2022 — there is the good ole' stock market hanging tough. Why is that the case you ask? I am glad you did ask. Market pros say that investors are looking beyond all the headline chaos and remain fixated on the king daddy of factors that tend to upset stock price valuations. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Weird stuff, right? ""One of the reasons why the stock market has held up so well is belief that the Fed will not be as aggressive in their new tightening policy as some were thinking they would be before the crisis in eastern Europe erupted. So if we get some positive reinforcement on this subject, the stock market could hold up (or even bounce) for a while,"" said Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley. Maley is on the mark here, judging by the positive reaction in stock prices to fresh commentary from Fed chief Jerome Powell in his testimony to lawmakers today. “The bottom line is we will proceed but we will proceed carefully as we learn more about the implications of the Ukraine war,” Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. Yahoo Finance Fed correspondent Brian Cheung points out Powell said he supports increasing short-term interest rates by 0.25% in the next policy-setting meeting on March 15 and 16. Coming into March, most market experts were bracing for a 50-basis rate hike at the March meeting followed by eight to 10 more increases in rates into year-end. But Powell has officially reset the narrative, and investors love it. So there you have it, folks. Inflation is running rampant. Profit margins are under attack. Vladimir Putin is playing terror to the world. And yet, there are markets fixated on rate hike comments from one of the most powerful people in the financial industry in Powell. No one said investing made sense. It doesn't make sense now, and it will unlikely make sense tomorrow. Rest assured, however, that at some point soon markets will move beyond rate hike fears and refocus on geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. When that happens, those aforementioned Feb. 23 lows for stocks could be in play. You have been warned. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
