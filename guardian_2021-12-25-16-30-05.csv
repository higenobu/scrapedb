12/25/2021,"In 2015, Saturday Night Live spoofed the rancorous political arguments besieging American social life.  Cast members seated around a dining table to celebrate Thanksgiving passed the side dishes and threw invective. The verbal heat rose and rose until a young girl pressed play on a cassette player and the Adele song Hello washed over the room. The combatants instantly ceased fire and began lip-synching the lyrics. Their rapture escalated until they physically entered a re-creation of the music video. A Thanksgiving Miracle aired before the Trump presidency and its violent subversive conclusion. This holiday season, it’s hard to think of a song capable of transporting Americans into a state of blissful unity. Masks and vaccines have become an issue and assault weapons have cropped up as accessories on congressional Christmas cards. But there is an alternative to mutually assured bad-mouthing. Americans can meet clandestinely among the like-minded, not just to commiserate but also to plan and participate in election campaigns. Emily Van Duyn, a political communications scholar, embedded with one such group in Texas in 2017. Her book chronicles the journey of 136 liberal women living in a rural and thus predominantly conservative Texas town who, determined to resist Trump, organized themselves into what Van Duyn anonymizes as the Community Women’s Group (CWG). They were middle-aged and senior white women (save one who was Black), afraid to speak their minds and put up yard signs. The author interviewed 24 of them multiple times, attended their monthly meetings on a dozen occasions, and examined meeting minutes from November 2016, when they were in tears and shock, until December 2020, at which point their politicking had yielded higher vote totals for Democrats in the previous month’s election, though not enough to prevail anywhere on the ballot. Van Duyn also conducted a national and statewide survey in 2018, from which she concluded that more than one in five American adults felt the need to hide their politics, and just under one in 10 operated in similarly self-obscured conversational settings. The study explains how social, geographic and political causes shaped the communication practices of the CWG. “[T]he growing animosity between and within parties, the uncertainty about truth, the growing intersectional animosity around ideology, race, class, and gender, made for a political context that was not only unpleasant but risky.” Trump palpably threatened their sense of security as women. Locally, they feared ostracization, loss of business (especially the real estate agents), defacement of property and being run off the road by men in trucks with guns who noticed liberal bumper-stickers, as happened at least once and was talked about often. Van Duyn excels at detailing the evolution of CWG’s communications practices, a mix of private and public facing activities conducted through physical as well as digital channels. Many members had grown up deferring to men about matters political. But a week after Trump’s victory one of them sent an email to eight neighbors: “I would like to suggest that we get together for support and see where that takes us.” That got forwarded, and 50 showed up at the first meeting. In a remote location, with the blinds closed, they wrote a mission statement and formed committees by issue to educate themselves. That super-structure soon fell by the wayside. Their formalized confidentiality agreement held, however. Between meetings they relied on a listserv to communicate among themselves with a brief detour into a secret Facebook group. In their darkened space (the book title inverts the slogan of the Washington Post) they opened each meeting with talk about their fears. A few started sending letters to the editor of the local newspaper using their individual identity, often to register dissent with and fact-check other letter writers. Over the two years of the study, about half emerged as open Democrats. They worked on mobilizing other Democrats (even though not all were registered or comfortable with the party), leaving the heavy labor of persuasion to formal campaigns. Their work shored up the party in their county: they ran phone banks, filled district chairs, updated voter files and raised money. The group had served as a safe harbor to develop political skills and confidence. CWG falls into several political traditions, including the voluntary associations that De Tocqueville valorized, the hidden minorities who have suffered the weights of oppression and, for that matter, the collectives of oppressors and cultists. Women are a demographic majority in America, and the political positions of CWG would fit in the national mainstream. But these women were neither in the contexts of their lives. Even so, by the end of the period Van Duyn examines, their politicking mirrored that of more open demographic counterparts such as the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, a group that helped first-time candidate Abigail Spanberger turn a central Virginia seat Democratic in 2018 – one that she now has to decamp for a newly re-drawn district. Some Republicans at holiday gatherings this year will continue to relish the opportunity to bait liberals (a practice that goes both ways). They may emulate Trump’s style of discourse, centered on a barrage of lies, exaggerations, accusations and taunts. Or they may not do any of these things; as Trump said about southern border-crossers in 2015 “some, I assume, are good people”. Indeed, some Republicans may feel intimidated by progressive majorities in workplaces and on campuses. All told, the risks of escalated, energy draining crossfire between America’s political tribes have risen and intensified. So this holiday season is no time for engaging others in political matters, for disputing the veracity of their claims and integrity of their motives. Far better to smile wanly, deflect provocations, change the subject, and then join or form a political support group. As Van Duyn’s book shows, good things can follow from going underground.

12/25/2021,"I’ve always had a fairly complicated relationship with Christmas. My father left when I was two. He always promised we’d spend Christmas together, but he never came. There were fun and loving Christmases with my mum and brother, David. We had very little money, but my mother would manage to fill pillowcases with presents, and we’d have a tin of Quality Street and a little tree. My mother would cook a roast dinner and we’d watch movies together. Christmases with Corky Ballas, my second husband and dance partner, and his family were a big deal – the tree, opening gifts, playing games and singing songs. Those were quite thrilling Christmases, but not what I was used to. Later, when I had our son Mark, and Corky and I were working as professional dancers and competing, we missed about five Christmases because we were away for months at a time. Mark would stay with my mother, and I felt huge guilt about it. As Mark got older, I realised that you can’t replace that time with a child – the time when Christmas is at its most magical. They’re times I’ll never get back and I regret that.  Then for many years, I barely celebrated Christmas at all. In 2003, my brother took his own life. David, who was 44, had been depressed for a few weeks, but we didn’t know how unwell he really was – and we didn’t know much about mental health. It happened on 5 December. Most people spend the month getting into the festive spirit, but after that I dreaded the anniversary of his death, and the idea of celebrating Christmas without him was too painful. Because we had grown up without our dad, David was more than a big brother. He was very much the protector of the family, the one who stood fast behind me, and then suddenly he wasn’t there. There was no way my mother or I could enjoy Christmas without him. That first year, I couldn’t believe he wasn’t there, eating treble helpings of Christmas dinner and working his way through a box of chocolates. After that, my mum threw away all her Christmas decorations. In the years afterwards, Christmas felt like something we just had to get through. We always set a place for David at the table, but it felt indescribably sad. The turning point came in 2018. I was in a pantomime for the first time, in Liverpool. Instead of dreading December, it felt exciting. Mark and his wife flew over from the US to watch the show, and we had an early Christmas dinner at my mother’s house – lots of guitar-playing, games, and Mark singing and dancing with my mum. We raised a toast to David, who had helped my mum raise Mark while I was away all those Christmases. It was during that December that I got to know Daniel Taylor, another cast member. We would go out and Liverpool would be glittering with lights and people celebrating. I liked Danny, and for the first time I felt I wanted to get into the festive mood, although it still felt painful. David and I grew up in Merseyside, and Liverpool was a place that my brother loved – everywhere I went was a reminder of him. But the city was such a beautiful place to be at Christmas, and I was falling in love with Danny. On the day itself, he joined me, my family and friends for lunch at a hotel in Liverpool and it was the happiest Christmas I’d had in many years. It felt like a switch was turned on – I realised that life moves so fast, and we should embrace the time we have. Since then, my mum and I have celebrated Christmas properly – we put a tree up, and decorations, and my whole aim is to make sure that we have a special day together. Danny is joining us this year, but even when it is just my mum and me, there is a feeling of warmth and Christmas spirit that we haven’t had since David died. We still always set a place for David at the table and although it’s always emotional, it feels less sombre. Christmas is a celebratory time, but that can heighten people’s feelings of loneliness and sadness. It’s important to check in on people who are alone at Christmas, because it can be an incredibly difficult time. The loss of my brother never goes away and things remind me of him daily. It’s not as if that special Christmas changed everything – life doesn’t go from feeling all that sadness to suddenly being all great. But it gave me permission to feel that it’s OK to celebrate Christmas, even if David is not here.

12/25/2021,"Despite surging Omicron cases of the coronavirus in the US, Joe and Jill Biden made an unannounced joint visit to a children’s hospital in Washington DC on Christmas Eve. The US president’s visit to Children’s National Hospital was a surprise for patients and staff, the White House reported, and was believed to be the first visit to the institution by a sitting president.  Barack Obama made a holiday visit to the hospital in 2018, almost two years after he’d left office. Pictures on Friday showed the first couple with young patients, everyone wearing face masks to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. Children at the hospital were making paper lanterns and some read the Bidens their Christmas wish lists. “You’re bringing us some joy,” Biden told the patients, and he also thanked medical staff. First ladies traditionally visit the hospital around the Christmas holiday, dating back to first lady Bess Truman during the post-second world war presidency of Harry Truman, and includes reading a book to patients, the White House reported. Jill Biden, a community college educator, sat by the Christmas tree and also read aloud to children at the hospital. The book was Olaf’s Night Before Christmas, based on the Disney musical Frozen. Joe Biden joked that he reads the story at bedtime, alongside his presidential briefing papers. The president also knelt to speak to a young boy sitting in a wheelchair and one girl explained to the Bidens that she has been a patient at the hospital for a month and a half. Both Joe and Jill Biden gave accounts to children of the new “first puppy” who has come to live at the White House – Commander, a German shepherd dog, following the death of the Bidens’ old dog, Champ, and the removal of their younger dog, Major, following biting incidents. Joe Biden showed a child a picture of the dog on his phone and Jill Biden told a patient the puppy had eaten one of her slippers that morning. The White House reporting pool had earlier reported observing Commander being exercised on the south lawn in Christmas Eve sunshine.",News/US news,Bidens make unannounced visit to Washington DC children’s hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/joe-jill-biden-make-unannounced-visit-washington-dc-childrens-hospital
12/25/2021,"Everyone in society, from Cabinet ministers to rough sleepers, has faced “uncertainty, uncontrollability and unpredictability” during the Covid pandemic, the archbishop of Canterbury is expected to say in his Christmas sermon. Justin Welby, who will lead the Christmas Day service at Canterbury Cathedral, will add that the past 22 months has also shown people’s capacity for compassion and generosity.  In particular, he is expected to praise those who have rescued refugees crossing the Channel to reach the UK, and volunteers who have welcomed and cared for people seeking a new life. He will tell the congregation: “As a nation we have been … faced collectively as never before with our limits – our fragility, the contingency of life and our mortality. Millions have faced suffering and loss. “We all face uncertainty, uncontrollability and unpredictability, from Sage and Cabinet to each one of us, from huge companies to those sleeping rough. But, he will add: “There is no doubting our human capacity to solve problems and show great kindness. The volunteers welcoming and caring for refugees arriving on the beaches so close to this cathedral are amazing people, especially the crews of the RNLI and the other rescuers such as the Border Patrol cutters’ crews. “Volunteers today in food banks and other places of comfort help show this country at its best, a beautiful sign of compassion, of generosity, of living out the saying ‘it’s not about me’.” The Christmas story, he will say, “shows us how we must treat those who are unlike us, who have far less than us, who have lived with the devastating limits of war and national tragedy – those who risk everything to arrive on the beaches, who suffer want and poor housing, little food, endless worry, health injustice, all over this, our country.” People have been wondering for months whether Christmas would be “saved” amid the continuing pandemic and the Omicron variant of Covid, he will say. “But let’s get this straight – it’s not we who save Christmas, it’s Christmas that saves us. We cannot save ourselves. But God can – the gift of salvation is not just offered to some people, but to all,” the archbishop is expected to say. Some churches cancelled Christmas Eve and carol services this year amid worries about Covid infections, despite there being no government restrictions on indoor gatherings. The Church of England launched its first virtual reality carol service aimed at people unable or unwilling to attend a service in person.",News/UK news,Justin Welby sermon: Covid makes all of us face unpredictability,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/25/justin-welby-sermon-covid-makes-all-of-us-face-unpredictability
