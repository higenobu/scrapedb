5/17/2022,"Greater Manchester police have referred themselves to the independent complaints body after it emerged that officers had had previous involvement in the case of a three-year-old boy killed by a dog. The child died on Sunday after what police described as a “tragic, devastating incident” at a farm property on Carr Lane, Milnrow, near Rochdale. The boy was outside with a number of dogs when the attack took place. The ambulance service and police were called at around 1.15pm and the boy was taken to hospital, where he died a short time later. Police said several dogs were subsequently seized and one was humanely destroyed. It has been reported that police investigated previous attacks on people by dogs from the property, which is close to the M62. Greater Manchester police assistant chief constable Scott Green confirmed that there had been previous contact. He said: “A thorough investigation is ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident and review other incidents of note. “Due to previous contact, GMP’s professional standards branch is making a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.” Police were continuing to carry out an investigation at the property on Monday, with the area cordoned off and officers standing guard at the entrance. Signs at the farm entrance were clearly visible saying: “Dogs are loose. Do not leave your vehicle. Beep or call,” and gives a telephone number. Another sign says: “Warning. Beware of the dogs. They bite.” A number of dog walkers told ITV News that they avoided the area where the attack took place because of previous incidents. No arrests have been made and the name of the victim has not yet been released. Green said: “Our thoughts, of course, remain with the loved ones of the young boy who so sadly died following yesterday’s incident. Specially trained officers have been deployed to support them. “It goes without saying that this news will have had an impact on the community. I can reassure members of the public that any criminal offences identified by our inquiries in relation to this incident will be dealt with accordingly by ourselves and our criminal justice partners. “We are aware of speculation on social media and ask that members of the public and the media refrain from engaging in speculation at this time until our investigation is complete and any subsequent criminal proceedings have concluded.” The force confirmed that it received a report on 9 April that a 17-year-old girl had been bitten by a dog on Carr Lane, Milnrow. A 48-year-old man was arrested and released, facing no further action.",News/UK news,Police force refers itself to IOPC over boy killed by dog near Rochdale,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/police-force-refers-itself-to-iopc-over-boy-killed-by-dog-near-rochdale
5/17/2022,"America on Monday was picking up the pieces from a weekend of gun violence that – outside the cost of lives – has refocused the country’s leadership on the toxic interplay of political ideology and easy access to handguns and battlefield weapons. In the most recent case, two people were killed Sunday and at least three others hospitalized after a shooting at a large Houston, Texas, flea market. In California, also on Sunday, at least one person died and five were wounded – including four listed in critical condition – after a shooting at a church with a predominantly Taiwanese congregation in Orange county, south of Los Angeles. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot enacted a weekend curfew for unaccompanied minors at a city park after a 16-year-old boy was killed there. At least 33 people were shot, five fatally, in weekend violence across the city, police said. The shootings, each horrific in their own way, punctuated the weekend’s main horror: an 18-year-old espousing white supremacist ideology who went to an African American neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday and – in less than two minutes – gunned down 13 people at a grocery, killing 10. That shooting – one of the deadliest racist massacres in recent memory – has renewed scrutiny on internet-promulgated hate speech, access to assault-style guns and body armor, and the inability of law enforcement authorities, elected politicians, religious leaders and the commercial sector to stop such violence from recurring. In the Buffalo shooting at Tops Friendly grocery, white suspect Payton Gendron is accused of specifically targeting a Black neighborhood and taking aim at Black victims – shoppers, grocery workers and a security guard. He had purportedly made threatening comments that brought police to his high school last spring, raising questions about whether authorities botched an opportunity to short-circuit Saturday’s killings. Gendron was never charged with a crime, and investigators had no further contact with him after his release from a hospital where he was mentally evaluated for about 36 hours. Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said the threat Gendron had made was “general” in nature and unrelated to race. “Nobody called in,” he said. “Nobody called any complaints.” New York is one of several states that, in recent years, have enacted “red flag” laws which are intended to prevent mass shootings, but they rely on a legal petition to temporarily seize people’s firearms, or prevent them from buying guns. Federal authorities, led by the FBI which is investigating the attack as a hate crime, have said they are working to confirm the authenticity of a racist 180-page document, purportedly written by Gendron, that laid out a plan to terrorize nonwhite, non-Christian people. In a Twitch livestream video of the attack, Gendron allegedly trains his gun on a white person behind a checkout counter before apologizing and moving on. A purported screenshot of the video circulating online showed the N-word scrawled in white, along with the number “14”, which is an apparent reference to this 14-word white supremacist phrase: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” Gendron, the Buffalo police commissioner Gramaglia indicated, planned to continue his assault in the surrounding neighborhood. But he was apprehended outside the grocery after removing his body armor and setting his Bushmaster rifle with an extended 70-round magazine, down. “This individual came here with the express purpose of taking as many Black lives as he possibly could,” the Buffalo mayor, Byron Brown, said Sunday. Representing families of the massacre victims, renowned civil rights attorney Ben Crump told reporters at a news conference Monday that cable news pundits who have spoken fawningly of the same extremist ideology embraced by the alleged shooter should be held accountable. The manifesto attributed to Gendron talks about the racist theory that Democrats are pushing open immigration policies to “replace” Republican voters with people of color and retain control of the country’s levers of power. Crump called pundits airing the ideology on mainstream news channels as “accomplices”. “Even though they might not have pulled the trigger, they loaded the gun,” he said. Released, recorded radio transmissions between emergency services showed the speed of the Buffalo massacre and how little time authorities had to intervene. Police had Gendron in custody within six minutes of being alerted to the attack, yet 10 were still killed. “Radio, send as many cars as you possibly can,” a responding officer says at about 2.33pm. Less than 30 seconds later, firefighters radioed in that there were at least three people down on the ground and that police “have him” about 20 ft from where they were. At 2.36pm, police reported they had arrested suspect and confiscated a gun. But the shooting has brought, as many times before, questions about what authorities can do to confront individuals espousing violently racist intentions before they act on them. And it’s brought pressure on social media platforms to flag content posted on their sites. Before both the 2018 massacre of 17 students at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and the killings of more than two dozen people at a Texas church in 2017, authorities had received information indicating the assailant’s violent intent or history. On Sunday, New York governor Kathy Hochul promised action on hate speech that she said spreads “like a virus”. President Biden is expected in Buffalo on Tuesday to meet with victims’ families. Those slain included an 86-year-old woman who had just visited her husband in a nursing home, a man buying a cake for his grandson, and a church deacon helping people get home with their shopping. As political figures visited the area over the weekend, some said it was urgent to separate the bonds between gun ownership and religious faith or extremist ideologies. But for many in the targeted Buffalo community, Gendron’s intent wasn’t the salient question – how the shooting was rooted in US social history. “The present is the past – same thing,” community activist Marietta Malcolm said. “Don’t think like this is an isolated incident, or act like we haven’t had 300 years of it. Every time people say racism doesn’t exist, somebody does something to prove that it does.”",News/US news,US gun violence over weekend puts focus on easy access to weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/america-shootings-gun-violence-buffalo-houston-los-angeles
5/17/2022,"The collapse of a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency called terra has sparked a wave of “fear, uncertainty and doubt” across the sector, leading some, like Coinbase’s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, to suggest the industry is heading for another “crypto winter”. But how did one coin stumbling cause such panic? And could a downturn spill into the wider economy? The term cryptocurrency covers a broad swathe of digital assets all based on the same fundamental structure as bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control. Advocates argue it allows for a truly censorship-resistant economy and, thanks to successor platforms such as ethereum, a new version of the web that allows for payments and ownership to be built in at the base level. Critics counter that, more than a decade after bitcoin was created, the sector has yet to spawn an actually useful product, instead merely enabling the creation of a wave of speculative bubbles and zero-sum gambling that has lost some retail investors as much money as it has made for others. Both sides agree the recent collapse in the crypto market is evidence of waning interest, but the real question is whether it is simply temporary or a more permanent crunch that will expose the sheer quantity of scams and frauds that pervade the sector. Almost half the sector’s entire value, $582bn (£475bn), is still tied up in the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Half again, $250bn, is in ethereum, a more programmable successor to bitcoin, which provides the infrastructure that underpins many other projects. Then there are stablecoins, the biggest examples of which, such as tether ($80bn) and USD Coin ($50bn), are effectively the sector’s banks, taking customer deposits, holding them as reserves, and issuing tokens that are supposedly guaranteed to have a fixed value relative to conventional currencies. The projects that sit on top of that infrastructural layer are comparatively small. That includes non-fungible tokens, or NFTs – unique assets used to denote ownership of assets such as digital art. According to analytics firm CoinMarketCap, the entire NFT sector is worth $10bn. Meanwhile the “decentralised finance” (DeFi) sector, which aims to mimic traditional banking services such as foreign exchange, current accounts and loans, is worth less than $70bn. Despite hopes among adherents that cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, would act as a counter-cyclical investment and a hedge against inflation, the sector started contracting at the same time as the wider selloff in tech, with bitcoin slumping from $48,000 in March to less than $38,000 by the beginning of May. However, last week the collapse of the terra stablecoin precipitated a much steeper plunge. Unlike larger rivals, terra did not have customer deposits backing it – instead, its stable value of $1 was based on faith in its underlying algorithm, which maintained its value by printing a sister cryptocurrency, luna. But over the course of Monday and Tuesday that faith was shattered when terra “depegged” from the dollar, and slipped into a “death spiral”, automatically printing ever more worthless luna, which crashed the price further. By the end of Thursday, the market capitalisation of the project had fallen from $41bn to $6.6m, “the largest destruction of wealth … in a single project in crypto’s history,” according to Charles Hayter of the analytics firm CryptoCompare. By Monday terra was trading at just $0.11. Terra’s initial collapse sparked a further wave of selling, knocking 15-25% off the value of most of the major cryptocurrencies. The rush to exit the market hit stablecoins particularly hard, causing tether to depeg for most of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The company has since approved $7.6bn worth of withdrawals that have brought the token back to within 0.1% of parity with the US dollar. Other projects are more directly affected by terra’s collapse. Hayter warns there is “significant exposure” in much of the DeFi sector, as well as traditional finance products relying on terra to provide depositors with high yields. Celsius Network, for instance, offered an 18% annual interest rate on deposits of the stablecoin, while avalanche, a blockchain project, invested $100m in it. On Friday morning, the DeFi protocol Venus announced it had lost $13.5m from its treasury after it accidentally accepted terra using an out-of-date valuation, while Blizz Finance lost its entire holdings due to the same flaw. “We believe it will take time for the market volatility in the ecosystem to subside – in these coming weeks we will find out the true cost of this crash,” says Hayter. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global market strategist at US investment bank JP Morgan, says tether redemptions could cause problems in credit markets because the collateral held by tether includes commercial paper, a form of short-term corporate debt used by companies to cover expenses such as monthly payroll. “It will be a problem for credit markets if a lot of commercial paper is to be sold in a short space of time,” he says. Tether’s commercial paper reserves reportedly amount to just under $30bn. Panigirtzoglou also warns of a risk of a wider asset sell-off by retail investors nursing losses. “Crypto investors who have lost a lot of money and who have also invested in equity markets could decide to de-risk, by taking their money out of equities.” However, he says the prospect of a share sell-off was less likely because equity prices have been depressed in recent months and retail investors might not want to compound their crypto losses. Not as the market currently stands, according to James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING bank in New York. Crypto is nowhere near as systemically important as housing, the trigger of the 2008 financial crisis. He adds, however, that regulators will take note of last week’s gyrations. “It may not be particularly systemically important now, but if the crypto markets were to recover and grow strongly over coming years and then we get a second bust when it is systemically important then regulators would not be able to forgive themselves.” Teunis Brosens, ING’s head economist for digital finance and regulation, said there would be a systemic risk if insurers and banks got more heavily involved in crypto assets – although this is less likely to happen as regulators circle. “Increased participation and exposures by traditional financial institutions [to cryptocurrencies] is mostly limited to asset managers, which pass on any losses to their clients.”",News/Technology,Q&A: the collapse of terra and what it could mean beyond crypto,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/qa-the-collapse-of-terra-and-what-it-could-mean-beyond-crypto
5/17/2022,"Élisabeth Borne, the French minister for labour, has been appointed prime minister – the first woman to hold the post in more than 30 years and only the second female prime minister in modern French history. Borne, 61, an engineer with a long career in government ministries, the senior civil service, public administration and state businesses – was chosen by Emmanuel Macron for the difficult task of delivering his complex policy promises at the start of his second term, against a background of rising inflation and the war in Ukraine. Borne is the first French female prime minister since Édith Cresson, who briefly headed the cabinet from May 1991 to April 1992 under the Socialist president François Mitterrand. “It’s more than time,” Cresson told BFMTV when asked how it felt to see a second woman head the government. Cresson had warned this weekend that French politics remained “macho”. A total of 74% of French people said they wanted a female prime minister, according to an Ifop poll this weekend. Macron, whose government had featured equal numbers of women and men, had nonetheless been accused of surrounding himself with a mainly male group of advisers and confidants. Borne’s first task is to manage the different political factions of Macron’s centrist grouping who need to win a parliamentary majority in elections next month if Macron is to have a free hand for his planned overhaul of pensions and the welfare state. If Macron wins a majority, from this summer, Borne must extend caps on energy prices and introduce further measures to address voters’ concerns about making ends meet amid the cost of living crisis. She is then tasked with leading Macron’s unpopular plans to push back the pension age from 62 to either 64 or 65, which are expected to spark trade union opposition and street protests. Borne will also be given a new brief of overseeing what Macron has promised will be a radical new form of “green planning” to limit carbon emissions and boost environment policy. Borne is a faithful Macron supporter who held three key ministerial jobs during his first term: transport, environment and labour. She earned a reputation for taking on difficult policies and pushing them through, including Macron’s sweeping reforms to the state rail system which saw the biggest strikes in decades. The Macron ally, Christophe Castaner, had nicknamed the straight-talking Borne “minister of impossible reforms made possible”. Macron, 44, registered a solid victory in last month’s presidential election against the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, winning by 58.5% to Le Pen’s 41.5%. But he acknowledged that many French people, particularly on the left, had voted for him to keep out the far right. He has promised to change his top-down, centralised way of doing politics and consult more, broadening his base. Borne, who was in government for the whole of Macron’s first term, symbolises continuity. Macron’s opponents were quick to attack her appointment. Le Pen, who is running for re-election to parliament said: “Emmanuel Macron has shown his incapacity to unite people and the will to continue his politics of looking down on people, deconstructing the state and wrecking the social [security system], of fiscal rackets and laxism.” The radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon tweeted that Borne’s appointment meant “the continuity of the president’s policies”. He tweeted: “A new season of social and environmental mistreatment begins.” Borne’s personal background on the centre left is crucial for Macron, particularly in the run-up to the parliament elections. In his first term, Macron – whose project had been described as “neither right nor left” when he won the presidency in 2017 – had appointed two prime ministers from the right. He is under pressure to win back voters on the centre left in the parliamentary elections. Mélenchon recently persuaded the Socialist, Communist and Greens parties to enter an alliance under his leadership for the parliamentary elections, that unites the left around a common platform for the first time in decades. The left is seeking to increase its seats in parliament. Borne’s long career has included advising key ministers under the Socialist presidents Mitterrand and François Hollande as well as working in Paris city hall when it was run by the Socialist Bertrand Delanoë. She never joined the Socialist party, and she is the first of Macron’s prime ministers to be a card-carrying member of his centrist party, which was recently renamed Renaissance. Borne has described being personally driven by efficiency, not hogging the limelight. “For me, doing politics is not about getting people to talk about me at any price, it’s about dedicating myself to delivering projects in the service of my country,” she told France Inter radio last year. “Politics is not about pushing myself to the front of stage.”",News/World news,Élisabeth Borne becomes France’s first female prime minister in 30 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/elisabeth-borne-becomes-frances-first-female-prime-minister-in-30-years
5/17/2022,"Amir Khan has accused young Asian sportsmen and women of allowing excuses and a poor diet to stop them fulfilling their potential. The 35-year-old former world champion boxer picked out Asian footballers, in particular, for supposedly lacking dedication and allowing racism to undermine their development. Speaking on Monday during a farewell press conference, having announced his retirement from boxing last week, Khan was asked if he was proud of his legacy. He turned professional in 2005, having won an Olympic silver medal the previous year at the age of 17, at a time when there were few high-profile boxers of South Asian heritage in Britain. The situation is very different now and many talented Asian boxers cite Khan as their inspiration. “They all want to try now,” Khan said. “It’s an amazing platform for them to see what I’ve done and that it’s possible for them to do the same and achieve what I’ve achieved. People used to say: ‘We are Muslim, we are Asian, we can’t make it in boxing. We’re not going to be picked.’ It’s an excuse that all Asians use – that we’re never going to be picked. Look at football for example. There are no Asian footballers but guess what they all say? ‘We won’t get picked because we’re Asian.’ I think that’s a fucking load of bullshit, really. It’s a load of bollocks. Asians, when we can’t to a certain extent, give up. We don’t have it in us.” “Look, us Asians are not really meant to be fighters,” Khan continued. “We’re not supposed to be good sportsmen and women. Our diet is appalling. It’s curries. It’s not the right diet to be a champion. If you put us against a lot of English fighters their diet is a lot better. They’re stronger than us. But obviously I changed my way of living. Luckily, I started very young. But not many Asians become sportsmen and women because we don’t have the diet. We don’t have the dedication. But if we see someone doing it, like if they’ve seen me do it, maybe that can inspire and motivate them. If Amir Khan has done it, being Asian and living on chapatis all his life and eating curries, we can do it. But you still have to take it easy on those things.” Khan remembered how his own ethnicity, as a young British boxer with strong family roots in Pakistan, was often attacked. After the terrorist attacks in London in 2005, he chose to speak out and stress that his allegiance lay with Britain and remind people that he had been born and raised in Bolton. “I’m glad I’m a fighter and I can pack a punch and have a little go if I have to,” Khan said from his home in Bolton. “If another Asian had made those remarks, some other Asians may have taken it the wrong way and wanted to start a fight. But no-one started a fight with me. “Look, I only spoke the truth. I am totally against terrorism. I think it’s wrong. All nations should respect each other and be together. Look at my house now. I’ve got a Jewish brother here, an Indian brother here and a Pakistani brother here. I’m a very multicultural brother. When people bring religion or racism into something I think it’s all bollocks. I’ve always been against it and I’ve always spoken the truth.” Khan lost the final fight of his 40-bout career in February when he was stopped by his bitter rival Kell Brook – who also announced his retirement earlier this month. The two fighters made their peace with each other after the fight but Khan suggested on Monday that he knew long before the first bell that his career was about to end. “When I was in training camp I got injuries but I didn’t want to tell people because I didn’t want them to say: ‘Amir is making excuses,’” he said. “I tore my rotator cuff, my tendon split in half in my right arm. It’s still sore now and I can’t lift it up much. Then my knees were hurting in training camp. I was still pushing myself hard and that’s when it hit me: ‘Do you know what? I don’t have it left in me.’ “But I couldn’t let anyone down, especially the fans. I can’t walk away from this fight, so I’m going to go ahead with it. But deep down I wasn’t mentally prepared. I’d trained hard, don’t get me wrong, but I didn’t have it in me. I was already done as a fighter.” Khan insisted that he had “no regrets because everyone would have hated me for not taking that fight. In boxing there is always a winner and a loser and people know I gave them the fight they always wanted. Maybe it might have been a different story if it had been a couple of years earlier, but it is what it is. On that night Kell was the better fighter and he won. “I think I’ll be remembered as a fighter who never shied away from anyone. I tried to give everyone the biggest fights they ever wanted, tried to have them on the edge of their seats and win, lose or draw, it was always an exciting night. I hope people will always remember that Amir Khan was an exciting fighter, who gave his all when he stepped inside the ring.” Khan also let it slip that he will return to reality television later this year – having appeared in I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here in 2017 . “I’ve been asked to do a very, very big show. I can’t give the name to you. But I’ll give you a clue. I’ve been on it before so …” After he burst out laughing Khan said, a little bashfully, “I’m not saying nothing. I’ve been asked to go there. I think it’ll be brilliant. I think people get to see another side of me and it would be nice to do something like that.”",Sport/Sport,"Excuses and poor diet hold Asian athletes back, claims boxer Amir Khan",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/16/excuses-and-poor-diet-hold-asian-players-back-says-amir-khan
5/17/2022,"Andrew Symonds, who has died aged 46 following a single-car accident in North Queensland, played 26 Tests and 198 one-day internationals for Australia when they were the best team in the world at both. In any other era he would probably have doubled his tally of caps, and had he been a little more circumspect in his enthusiasm for post-match revelry might have sat alongside Keith Miller and Richie Benaud as one of his country’s greatest all-round cricketers. Instead, he had to settle for the perch just below. An integral part of two World Cup winning teams, in 2003 and 2007, he kickstarted the first campaign with an unbeaten 143 against a strong Pakistan side. This came the day after Shane Warne had been sent home for taking a banned substance, but Symonds was undaunted. He was certainly built for maximum impact. Standing a muscular 6ft 2in tall and sporting shoulder-length dreadlocks, at least part of the time, and with sunblock applied like warpaint, he looked and made for an intimidating opponent. A superb, athletic fielder, who also bowled useful off-spin and medium-pace, in 1995 he showed himself to be a hard-hitting batsman in striking 16 sixes in an innings for Gloucestershire against Glamorgan. The county cricket record stood until Ben Stokes broke it earlier this season. Symonds’ desire to dominate bowlers did not always succeed but when it did, as with the 156 he scored in the Boxing Day Ashes Test of 2006, the spectacle was pure theatre. This highlight should have been matched by the unbeaten 162 he made against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground at the start of 2008, but that game was marred by an incident in which India’s off-spinner, Harbhajan Singh, was accused of calling him a “monkey”. Of mixed ethnicity – his biological parents were thought to be African- Caribbean and Scandinavian – Symonds had experienced racist taunts growing up as the adopted child of a white couple in rural Queensland. He had also endured it at the hands of Indian crowds during a one-day series a few weeks before that SCG match, so was determined not to let further abuse go unchecked. Harbhajan was banned for three matches for racist abuse but denied the charge. This prompted the Indian Board (BCCI) to threaten to cancel the tour. A judge-led inquiry was set up, but Harbhajan’s ban was overturned on appeal; Symonds’ concerns and dignity were seemingly brushed aside. Players and friends close to Symonds, including Australia’s captain, Ricky Ponting, reckon the incident affected him and he was never the same afterwards. His rebel nature, in abeyance due to an extended run in the team, resurfaced while his personal discipline declined to the point where he missed a team meeting to go fishing. Placed on notice after Cricket Australia made him sign a no-drinking clause in his contract, he was caught breaking it just before the 2009 World T20 in England and sent home. Cricket Australia did not renew his contract and he was dropped from all formats – an outcome he later claimed he did not regret after falling out of love with international cricket. Although let down by the establishment he did not feel embittered. For him it had always been about the simple pleasure of having fun playing with people he liked, and that had gone. Born in Birmingham, Andrew was adopted by Barbara (nee Hemming) and Ken Symonds, both teachers, who already had a son and daughter. When Andrew was three months old the family emigrated to Australia, first to Victoria, then settling in Charters Towers, Queensland, and later moving to the Gold Coast. In addition to school cricket, Andrew played for the Wanderers Club in Townsville. He loved the great outdoors, especially fishing and wild-pig hunting. So enamoured was he of the North Queensland lifestyle that he once turned up to sign a contract with the suits from Cricket Australia wearing a singlet, shorts, flip-flops and an Akubra hat, and stinking of fish bait – cricket’s very own Crocodile Dundee. His place of birth meant he was qualified to play cricket for England, a possibility that gathered momentum after his fine season with Gloucestershire in 1995. To test allegiances, England’s selectors picked him for an England A tour, but Symonds turned down the offer saying he was a “dinky-di Aussie who wanted to play for Australia”. Loyalty was his watchword. He had made his debut with Queensland in 1994, and played 18 seasons with them. In England, he went on to play for Kent and Lancashire. Having dispensed with championship cricket by 2009, he played T20 for Surrey and the Indian Premier League team Deccan Chargers, now defunct, and, from 2011, Mumbai Indians, where, having settled their differences, he played alongside Harbhajan. Not many master cricket well enough to represent their country in Tests, 50-over and T20. Yet, not only did Symonds achieve that, but he fulfilled the criterion of the true all-rounder – which is to have a bowling average lower than your batting average. In 2012, aged 37, Symonds retired from all cricket and turned to TV, where he found a niche commentating on Big Bash matches for Fox Sport. This came after playing himself in a Bollywood movie and appearing in the Indian version of Big Brother. In 2005 he married Brooke Marshall, but they divorced the following year. He later married Laura Vidmar, with whom he had a daughter, Chloe, and a son, Billy; all three survive him.

5/17/2022,"As a public servant, I am expected to consistently remain politically neutral and subservient. While I have bitten my tongue thus far on the fiasco of a government that we are currently subjected to, I can’t any longer (UK ministers ‘picking number out of air’ for civil service job cuts, says union, 13 May). The constant attacks on us by the prime minister and his cabinet are exhausting, unfair and inaccurate. I manage nearly 60 staff, many of whom joined during the pandemic, and the pace, quality and quantity of their work is on a scale I have never before seen. The efficiency we are currently able to deliver is unparalleled. Yet still they want more. Boris Johnson says his experience of working from home involved “an awful lot of time” making coffee and eating cheese. Give us a break. We are a decade deep into cuts and pay freezes and we are tired, fed up and angry. We have held this country together for the last two years and worked tirelessly and thanklessly. The productivity that hybrid ways of working has enabled has, in my view, created an unsustainably high pace of work – I see people working far too hard, not too little. To have to put up with the constant rhetoric about the lazy civil service makes my blood boil. Johnson may be sitting at home eating cheese (and drinking wine) while at work, but I can assure you that the rest of us simply don’t have the time.Name and address supplied  Heather Stewart is right to point to some of the unfortunate side effects of civil service cuts (Boris Johnson’s civil service job cuts are ambitious – and ideological, 13 May). No doubt there are staff in the service who have views that are contrary to the current philosophy, but the convention was (and I am sure still is) that you carried out your work regardless. I worked for many years at the Department of Health, and in the 1990s the then Conservative government became obsessed with reducing the staff headcount. This led to many older staff members being offered early retirement, but this resulted in a significant loss in institutional memory – so many of the new retirees were rehired at consultants’ rates, which defeated the point of the exercise. It also created the illusion that staff numbers were apparently being reduced when, in fact, the overall figure was more or less the same, the hiring of consultants being justified on the basis that they supposedly provided expertise that was otherwise not there. Many of them were hired for short-term cover but stayed on for long periods.

5/17/2022,"The home secretary faces fresh criticism over plans described by chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) as a “power grab”. It comes as the Guardian publishes private documents at the centre of an extraordinary row between Priti Patel and police leaders. The backlash came after an attempt by the government to redraft a written protocol that tries to define where the responsibility lies in policing. The row at the top of the criminal justice system in England and Wales centres on the Home Office’s attempt to revise the policing protocol, which was first produced in 2011 and came into force in January 2012. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, accused the home secretary of trying to micromanage policing around England and Wales from her office in Whitehall. “Priti Patel might think she knows better than the police when it comes to fighting crime, but her abysmal record at the Home Office says different. The fact that so many criminals are getting away with it shows the Conservatives don’t have a clue about the problems our communities face. “This is yet another example of Conservative ministers trying hard to seem tough on crime, but failing even to get the basics right.” The MP added that the home secretary should focus on giving local police chiefs “the officers, detectives and resources they need to prevent and solve crimes”, rather than trying to micromanage them from her office in Whitehall. Until now, the row over the attempts to change the policing protocol has been in private. The first document published on Monday is the full proposed new policing protocol from the Home Office. It was sent to chief constables, commissioners and other stakeholders in the justice system for consultation in March. That closed in May and the responses will now be considered by the Home Office. The dilemma for the government is, given the extensive criticism of their planned changes, whether they should press on or back down. The second document is from the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners and is their response to the planned changes. In parts, it is heavily critical. The government denies the proposals amount to a power grab without seeking approval from parliament. Government stepped out of day-to-day involvement in local policing when PCCs were introduced a decade ago.",News/UK news,Private papers show extent of row between Patel and police leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/private-papers-show-extent-of-row-between-patel-and-police-leaders

5/17/2022,"Sri Lanka’s new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has warned that the financial crisis engulfing the country will get worse and “the next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives”. In his first address to the country since he was appointed as interim prime minister on Thursday, after Mahinda Rajapaksa stepped down from the role amid Sri Lanka’s worst economic crash since independence, Wickremesinghe was blunt as he described the conditions of the country’s finances as “extremely precarious”. “In November 2019, our foreign exchange reserves were at $7.5bn. However, today, it is a challenge for the Treasury to find $1m,” he said. Wickremesinghe said the country had “run out of petrol ... At the moment, we only have petrol stocks for a single day.” He warned that the power outages, which have already lasted up to eight hours a day, were likely to worsen in the next two months. While there are ships carrying fuel in the harbour of the capital city, Colombo, the prime minister admitted that the government could not currently afford to pay for them, even as people queued in desperation for hours outside petrol stations. “We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices and face the challenges of this period” said Wickremesinghe. His speech was the most upfront given by a ruling figure about the financial disaster gripping Sri Lanka, which has spiralled from an economic crisis into a mounting political crisis. With the country’s foreign reserves shrinking to almost nothing, and its foreign debt totalling more than $51bn (£42bn), Sri Lanka is on the verge of bankruptcy. It has been unable to import fuel, food and medicines, leading to dangerous shortages, and has temporarily defaulted on its foreign loans. Wickremesinghe confirmed in Monday’s speech that supplies of 14 critical medicines on the island were running out. The financial crisis has led to a mass protest movement against the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and other members of his powerful ruling family who have been held responsible for catastrophic economic mismanagement. While Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president’s older brother, resigned as prime minister last week, Gotabaya Rajapaksa has continued to refuse to bow to the demands of the majority of the electorate and has held on to power. It was Gotabaya Rajapaksa who appointed Wickremesinghe as the interim prime minister last week with the task of overseeing a cross-party government to help steer the country out of the crisis and secure emergency bailouts from international organisations. While Wickremesinghe, who has been prime minister five times before, belongs to a party in opposition to the Rajapaksas, he is also seen as close to the family as well as being a steady pair of hands for the economy. His appointment angered many protesters who view him as part of the old political establishment and he was accused of propping up the Rajapaksa family by taking on the position. However, Wickremesinghe has insisted he supports the buoyant protest movement and over the weekend set up a committee to look after the protest camp they have set up in Colombo. In his speech, Wickremesinghe also admitted he would have to temporarily continue with some problematic economic policies. “Against my own wishes, I am compelled to permit printing money in order to pay state-sector employees and to pay for essential goods and services,” he said. On Monday, Sri Lanka’s main opposition party said they would offer support for Wickremesinghe’s new government in any progressive policies they put forward, but would refuse to hold any seats in the cabinet until Gotabaya Rajapaksa agreed to step down.",News/World news,Sri Lanka’s new PM warns ‘most difficult months of our lives’ ahead,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/sri-lanka-financial-crisis-new-prime-minister-ranil-wickremesinghe
5/17/2022,"Tesco is to hand pig farmers £6.6m in additional support, taking the total to £10m, after warnings that a slew of producers could go out of business. The UK’s biggest supermarket said farmers would get £6.6m until August on top of £3.4m handed out since March under an “accelerated and enhanced payment plan”, after being criticised for not paying a “fair price” for its pork. Tesco is the latest supermarket to hand farmers extra cash in the face of surging costs of feed caused by the war in Ukraine, after an export slump last year combined with Covid disruption and Brexit-related shortages of abattoir workers. A recent industry poll found that four out of five producers would go out of business within a year unless their financial situation improved. The National Pig Association (NPA) wrote to Tesco asking for help as it said the industry had faced an unprecedented crisis over the past 18 months. It said the price shock caused by the war had turned a “very challenging financial situation to a critical one”. The NPA has said there are 100,000 pigs stuck on farms that should have gone to slaughter, with farmers losing in excess of £50 a pig due to the enormous gap between the cost of production and the price that retailers were willing to pay. It had called on Tesco to act after rivals including Waitrose, the Co-op, Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s agreed to pay more for British pork through their dedicated supply chains. Waitrose, which is less than half the size of Tesco, has offered £16m, while Sainsbury’s offered £7.8m. The NPA chair, Rob Mutimer, said: “We are very pleased that Tesco has responded following our letter to chief executive Ken Murphy, with some much-needed extra financial support for the pig industry. “This is a very welcome boost for beleaguered pig farmers, who are currently facing unprecedented costs of production and need a tangible increase in the price they are being paid in order to stay in business. “We look forward to seeing the pig price rising very soon as a result of this action and hopefully we can begin to stem the flow of producers exiting the industry.” Tesco said that since January it had taken an extra 32,000 pigs, and planned to take a further extra 22,000 in the months ahead as it increased its range of British pork products by 30%. It will add five new British pork options in store and launch an “I Love British” brand for bacon and ham, from which a farmers will receive an additional 5p a pack. Dominic Morrey, Tesco’s commercial director for fresh foods, said: “We fully recognise the seriousness of the situation UK pig farmers are facing and have been working closely with our suppliers to understand what more we can do to support the sector.” But he added: “We know there is more to do, and we will be working with suppliers, farmers and the wider industry to drive more transparency and sustainability across our supply chains and support the future of the British pig industry.” Jim Brisby at Cranswick, a Tesco pork supplier, said: “We’ve been working with Tesco to find a more sustainable way of paying our farmers for pigs, and we are pleased with the progress we have made to increase the availability of British pork to Tesco shoppers, and are continuing to work with the team to significantly increase these volumes even further over the next few months. The announcement today regarding the increased prices paid to British farmers will also help to support those farmers supplying Tesco.”",News/Business,Tesco to pay out more to pig farmers as industry warns of ‘critical’ situation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/tesco-to-pay-out-more-to-pig-farmers-as-industry-warns-of-critical-situation
5/17/2022,"The Blackpool forward Jake Daniels has become the UK’s first professional male football player to come out as gay since Justin Fashanu in 1990. Daniels, 17, admitted to having hidden his sexual identity as a young man “because I wanted to be a professional footballer”. Now he says the “time is right to be myself, be free and be confident with it all”. “Now is the right time to do it,” Daniels told Sky Sports. “I feel like I am ready to tell people my story. I want people to know the real me. I have been thinking for a long time about how I want to do it, when I want to do it. I know now is the time. I am ready to be myself, be free and be confident with it all. “For a long time I’ve thought I would have to hide my truth because I wanted to be, and now I am, a professional footballer. I asked myself if I should wait until I’ve retired to come out. No other player in the professional game here is out. “However, I knew that would lead to a long time of lying and not being able to be myself or lead the life that I want to. Since I’ve come out to my family, my club and my team-mates, that period of overthinking everything and the stress it created has gone. It was impacting my mental heath.

5/17/2022,"England’s red-ball reset has hit a fresh setback with news that Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood has been ruled out for the remainder of the season with a lumbar stress fracture. Mahmood had missed Lancashire’s last three County Championship fixtures, and after complaining of back pain was sent for scans which confirmed a fracture. With England’s newly-appointed red-ball coach, Brendon McCullum, hoping to name a squad for next month’s first Test against New Zealand on Wednesday morning, the selectors’ task becomes ever more complicated as the list of injured bowlers continues to lengthen. Along with Mahmood, McCullum will not be able to call on Jofra Archer, who has not played a first-class game for more than a year because of elbow injuries, Mark Wood, who hopes to return from his own elbow issue in the next few weeks, or Olly Stone, who has not played first-class cricket since sustaining his own stress fracture of the back last summer. Ollie Robinson, after a string of injuries, was suffering with food poisoning during Sussex’s draw with Leicestershire. Matt Fisher, who like Mahmood made his Test debut during England’s unsuccessful tour of West Indies in March, has been sidelined ever since with something his Yorkshire coach, Ottis Gibson, described as “not a stress fracture, a stress reaction”. Sam Curran has publicly targeted the New Zealand series for his international comeback after a long-term back injury, but has so far bowled just 17 overs in four County Championship appearances. The Guardian revealed last week that Durham’s Matthew Potts was among those pushing for a call-up to McCullum’s first squad. The team’s new captain, Ben Stokes, had already revealed that James Anderson and Stuart Broad, both controversially rested for the trip to the Caribbean, were certain to return. Meanwhile the England and Wales Cricket Board are expected to appoint the Australian Matthew Mott as England’s white-ball coach this week, the 48-year-old having overtaken Paul Collingwood in the race for the role following last week’s interviews. Mott has led Australia’s women’s team through a period of global domination, winning successive Twenty20 World Cups, an ODI World Cup and four consecutive Ashes series. He also worked with McCullum during a short spell as assistant coach in the Indian Premier League at Kolkata Knight Riders, when the New Zealander was a player. He previously worked in Britain as head of elite performance at Glamorgan for three years, ending in 2013. The outcome of the recruitment process is likely to be revealed within the next 48 hours. Three of England’s women’s cricketers, Sophie Ecclestone, Kate Cross and Sophia Dunkley, have been signed up as overseas players for the forthcoming Women’s T20 Challenge in India. The three-team tournament, a bridging event to the planned women’s Indian Premier League next year, takes place from May 23-28 in Pune. Ecclestone, the world’s No 1 ranked T20 bowler, has been drafted by Supernovas, the fast bowler Cross will play for Velocity and the batter Dunkley will represent Trailblazers.

5/17/2022,"Earlier today I set you the puzzles below, chosen by Irish mathematician Des MacHale, a prolific writer of joke and puzzle books. You can read some of his jokes here. The puzzles were a mixture of word, number and lateral thinking puzzles. They all give some ‘haha’ with the ‘aha!’. 1. A rich woman dies and leaves her entire fortune of two million pounds between a number of lion tamers. How much did each lion tamer receive? Solution The nub of problem is grammar. The correct usage of ‘between’ and ‘among’ is that ‘between’ is for two people and ‘among’ is for more than two. So each lion-tamer got a million pounds. [Lion tamer is a red herring]. 2. Punctuate this sentence to reverse its meaning: A SMART DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER. Solution A SMART DOG KNOWS IT’S MASTER 3. What is never odd or even? Solution NEVER ODD OR EVEN is a palindrome, i.e. it reads the same back to front. 4. Make this equation correct just by moving the digits about: 26 = 74. Solution 72 = 49. You also needed to turn the 6 upside down! 5. Two objects perform the same task. One has many thousands of moving parts while the other has no moving parts. What are they? Solution One object is an hourglass; the other is a sundial. They both measure time. The moving parts of an hourglass are grains of sand. 6. Why did a person buy an object they didn’t want for £1 and throw it away a few minutes later? Solution They were shopping in a shop where if you spent £50 you got a reduction of £10. The bill came to £49 so they bought a useless object for £1. 7. Why did a man tighten the lids on all the jars in his house and put them in the fridge? Solution He had had a serious row with his wife and she wasn’t talking to him. He knew this was one of the few tasks she could not do without his help. 8. In a locked cabin high up on the side of a mountain, five dead bodies are found. How had they all died? Solution The cabin is the cabin of a jet plane which had crashed into the mountain killing the five people. 9. Why was a person standing at a bus stop with an ordinary kitchen chair in their arms? Solution The person is a DIY enthusiast who is making a chair. They were using superglue and now the chair is stuck to their hands. They are waiting for a bus to take them to the hospital.
