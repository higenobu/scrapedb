5/17/2022,"The rules of “Stat Chat” were simple enough. The game would begin the night after Joe Clarke returned from England Lions duty in the United Arab Emirates. “Got to be freshies,” Alex Hepburn wrote in their shared WhatsApp group, meaning women they had not slept with before. “Names, age, black or white, your rating, their rating.” “No reheats allowed,” Clarke confirmed, meaning women they had slept with before. “Always me dragging the birds back, you raping them,” Hepburn complained. “Just bring a mattress,” Clarke wrote later. “So if we do chop, it will have to be in your bed. Probably will chop … so we’ll have to just both chop in your bed like the good old days!” There is more: some of it graphic, some of it grotesque. But you get the idea. Seeing as Clarke himself described this conversation as “lighthearted chat” during the rape trial of his friend Hepburn in early 2019, we can assume he won’t mind us reproducing it here. And the reason for doing so is that with Clarke on the fringes of playing for England, there are still plenty out there who insist he was guilty of nothing but a little harmless matey banter. Let’s not demean ourselves by debating Clarke’s merits as a cricketer as if they matter. All you need to know is that the Nottinghamshire batter was placed on the standby list for England’s recent tour of the West Indies, had a stellar winter with Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash and was snapped up for a top-price £125,000 by Welsh Fire in the Hundred draft this year. Had it not been for the events leading up to the night of 31 March 2017, he would almost certainly have played for England already. Clarke was never charged with any crime. Hepburn, his Worcestershire teammate, was sentenced to five years in prison for rape and released last October. Handing down his verdict, the judge described the Stat Chat group as “foul sexism” that “demeaned women and trivialised rape”. As a willing participant, Clarke was banned for four county matches, fined £2,000 and given an “official reprimand” by the England and Wales Cricket Board after admitting to bringing the game into disrepute at a disciplinary hearing. He completed a workshop on sexual consent. And for many – including Clarke himself, who apologised “to everyone concerned for his involvement in the WhatsApp group” and spoke of “putting this chapter behind me” – that was the end of it. Certainly the new director of England men’s cricket, Rob Key, was in a clement mood when asked about a potential call-up for Clarke last month. “I see no reason why not,” he said. “You can’t penalise people forever in life.” But of course you can, and as evidence you need only to read the victim statement read out at Hepburn’s sentencing, in which the woman in question set out the manifold ways in which her life had been ruined as a consequence of Hepburn and the squalid game he and Clarke had invented. “I mourn who I used to be,” the victim wrote. She told how she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, blighted by recurring nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety and violent outbursts. The attack had affected her relationship with her loved ones. All of which had been exacerbated by being forced to relive her ordeal in court, her rapist a short distance away, the defending barrister asking her questions such as: “Joe Clarke has a large penis. Did you not notice any difference in the penises?” Before the right-wing press turn this into a cause célèbre, no one is getting cancelled here. If Nottinghamshire and Welsh Fire and Melbourne Stars want to keep paying Clarke to score runs, then, well, whatever. But if Clarke ends up playing for England, then he is no longer simply earning a living or chasing a dream. These are our teams, our players. They represent all of us, the people who play cricket in this country and the people who watch. They are, or should be, the best of us. Clarke can still live up to that ideal. He can take proactive steps to educate young male cricketers on rape culture. He can align himself with charities who deal with victims of sexual assault. Instead he has largely chosen to centre his own suffering, deflected the issue in interviews, urged everyone to move on. To date he has not made sufficient public restitution for his actions. During the trial Clarke was asked whether he still considered Hepburn his best friend. “Yes,” he replied. And of course there are manifold England players from the past who have been racists, sexists, criminals, perverts. It is too late now for any of that to change. But this is one thing that still can. Is it unreasonable to expect the tiny, unfathomably privileged sliver of players who get to represent us to uphold the most basic standards of decency? Is it unreasonable to want proof that a man has changed, instead of taking his word for it? The ECB’s recent diversity plan was entitled “Cricket Is A Game For Me”. Yet the moment Clarke steps on to the field in an England sweater will expose that statement as a bald lie. For in that moment cricket will no longer be a game for any woman who has ever felt objectified or exploited or abused by someone more powerful. For any woman who has been assaulted and not believed. Clarke and Key are probably calculating that after an initial squall of protest, the controversy will eventually die down and the whole thing will simply be forgotten. The depressing part is they are probably right.",Sport/Sport,Joe Clarke played a game that trivialised rape: England cricket should demand better | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/17/joe-clarke-england-cricket-ecb
5/17/2022,"Homophobia cast a long shadow over Callum’s childhood. “Gay”, “bender” and “faggot” were spat at him by classmates with abandon; beaten up in the changing rooms before PE, he was forced to change in the cleaner’s cupboard instead. But the thing is, Callum isn’t actually gay at all: he’s a straight man. That didn’t matter to his assailants – most of Callum’s friends were girls or those also treated as “outcasts”, some of whom were “exploring their sexuality” as teenagers; he hated sport, and loved performing arts. Now, discussing homophobia in the context of straight men may seem like a distraction. “I feel really conflicted about it now – even though I’m absolutely over the bullying, I always feel like I was the victim of homophobic bullying,” Callum tells me. “But how can a straight cis man be a victim of homophobia?” Indeed, he fears “invalidating the experiences of those who are actually gay whenever I talk about this”. But there’s nothing invalidating about his story at all, because Callum was the victim of sustained homophobic bullying, and the same goes for countless other straight men, too. Their experiences aren’t outliers: they are key to understanding what homophobia actually is. When I did a shout out for straight men to come forward with their own experiences of homophobia, I was inundated. For some, it was simply for having long hair, or for their dress sense, or for a job – like being a primary school or drama teacher – or for extracurricular activities deemed to be “unmanly”. “I had the shit beaten out of me at least once a week for being gay, or a ‘poof’, or ‘bent’,” says Matthew, a former choirboy. “If anything was considered outside the ‘norm’, it was considered ‘gay’ when I was in secondary school in the noughties,” says another. “I used to dress in a somewhat gothic way: eyeliner, black nail varnish, and I was on the receiving end of homophobic insults quite a few times. Even if you showed any form of affection towards another man, it was ‘gay’.” Indeed, acts of kindness are frequently cited as provoking homophobic responses. Asking “but what about the straights?” may rankle some LGBT people. A distinction should be made: homophobic bullying is an existential question for a queer person in a way it isn’t for a straight person, because being abused for your actual identity tends to inflict more psychological harm. But that doesn’t mean it can’t have catastrophic consequences for straight men. Whenever Robbie showed any care or kindness as a teenager at his high school, he suffered homophobic verbal and physical abuse, which was compounded by similar treatment from his stepfather. “That led to my long-term, serious mental health conditions, spanning from the age of 11 to my mental breakdown at 23,” he tells me. The 2010 Equality Act included “perceptive discrimination” for a reason: that is, when people are “treated unfairly” on the grounds they have a protected characteristic, whether they actually do or not. And it is these examples that expose the reality of the bigotry in question. For example, a staple response from apologists for Islamophobia is that hatred of Muslims does not qualify as racism, because Muslims are not a race. Yet witness how many Sikh men – on both sides of the Atlantic – have been victims of Islamophobic hate crimes, underlining that anti-Muslim bigotry is based on racialising minorities. Similarly, so many straight men are victims of homophobia because it is principally about policing the boundaries of masculinity, rather than repulsion towards gayness per se. Queer men are normally the biggest sufferers of homophobic abuse and violence precisely because they are seen to be the worst violators of masculine norms. What is deemed more “unmanly” than having sex with other men, after all? This is why the designated term for queer people in Margaret Atwood’s dystopic The Handmaid’s Tale – “gender traitors” – is so apt. But if straight men engage in behaviour deemed to violate the boundaries of masculinity, they are at risk of homophobia, too: from failing to show enough physical aggression, to not objectifying women or treating them as equals, to talking about feelings or showing compassion – coded as a feminine trait – towards others. Homophobia is the bastard child of misogyny: a means of conditioning men into embracing and glorifying traits that menace women and “unmanly” men alike. Eliminating homophobia will principally liberate queer people, but it will free straight men, too, to be themselves. It will mean a society with less violence and more love. And that’s why the homophobic persecution of straight men isn’t a tasteless distraction: to ignore it is to fail to understand homophobia at all.

5/17/2022,"Labor leader Anthony Albanese has defended the party’s decision not to release the party’s costings until Thursday, saying he has been “transparent” throughout the election campaign.But delaying until after the advertising blackout begins at midnight on Wednesday has opened Albanese up to criticism from the Coalition, and triggered a hostile press conference in Perth on Tuesday that saw reporters chase Albanese from an event asking questions. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was also pursued after a press conference in Darwin, with a reporter challenging him on why no one from the Coalition had agreed to appear on the National Indigenous Television network while he was campaigning in the seat of Lingiari which has the highest proportion of First Nations voters in the country. Morrison also flagged for the first time that a new port development at Middle Arm in Darwin could be accessed by the US military as an alternative to the Port of Darwin which is leased to the Chinese. In the clash over costings, Albanese refused to be drawn on whether Labor would post higher deficits than forecast by the government, which the party’s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged may be a “couple of million” different to the Coalition’s balance. “Our costings will be out on Thursday. They’ll be released at the same time that the last time that there was a change of government occurred,” Albanese said. “What we have done during this campaign is be responsible. We’ve been fiscally responsible in all of the statements that we’ve made, including today’s announcements. “We said what dollars would go, and we have done that throughout this campaign. We have a couple more announcements to go. We have until Saturday, but we will be releasing our costings announcement on Thursday,” Albanese said. Labor’s decision to release costings on the Thursday before the election is in line with when the Coalition released its costings in 2019 and in opposition in 2010 and 2013. Albanese was pursued out of the press conference by journalists after they objected to the Labor leader not answering questions. “We are following you for answers Mr Albanese and you are just not giving them,” one reporter said. “You have to answer eventually.” Albanese said he would answer more questions when he appeared at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, pointing to the fact that Morrison has refused to take part in the traditional pre-election event. The final week of the campaign is expected to be dominated by questions over the economy and cost of living, with updated data on the wage price index to be released on Wednesday, and labour force statistics to be released on Thursday. Ahead of the release of the latest wage figures which will show whether the Reserve Bank’s prediction of an increase in pay has materialised, Morrison said he would welcome a pay increase, despite saying a union wage claim for a real wage rise for those on the minimum wage would add to inflationary pressures. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said Labor’s decision not to submit any of its policies to the parliamentary budget office or to Treasury for costing showed the opposition was shielding itself from scrutiny. In Darwin, Morrison faced questions about the government’s proposed new Middle Arm port development, a $1.5bn wharf expansion to allow the export of gas, including hydrogen, and critical minerals. When asked if the Americans needed access to a port in Darwin that was not Chinese owned and whether the budget commitment supported that, Morrison said that “it does.” “That was in the budget. In terms of the development of significant port facilities here in the Territory. It’s all part of the middle arm program. It’s a very significant program,” he said. “This is one of the biggest investments in the Northern Territory that we’ve ever seen. This is going to revolutionise the Northern Territory with the infrastructure that is going to be built here, opening up the wealth of the Northern Territory and it’s going to see the Northern Territory go through a golden period.” The Coalition is hoping it can flip the seat of Lingiari with the retirement of long-serving MP Warren Snowden, despite Labor’s 5.5% margin. It has made at least $187m in local announcements for the seat since the beginning of the year.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese defends delaying release of policy costings until two days before election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/anthony-albanese-defends-delaying-release-of-policy-costings-until-two-days-before-election

5/17/2022,"Australians might have been sitting down for dinner about 7pm on Monday, or tuning in to the news, but for those living in marginal seats there was a chance they were interrupted – by the former prime minister John Howard. “Hello it’s John Howard calling from Sydney for the Liberal party,” were the words voters in seats such as North Sydney, Wentworth and Hughes heard when they answered their landlines and mobile phones. Since losing the 2007 election, Howard has maintained a fairly low profile, especially compared to some of his successors. However, this election campaign, the Liberal party is wheeling out its former leader to spearhead a last-ditch push in key marginal seats it fears losing. There have been robocalls and letterbox drops. On Tuesday, Howard told the Guardian he was responding to a plea from the Liberal party to “campaign extensively”. He does not plan to slow down his appearances between now and election day on Saturday. “The Liberal party has asked me to campaign extensively, which I will continue to do,” Howard said. His campaigning message differs depending on the medium – calls, letters and in-person appearances – and the electorate. But his visibility in Liberal-held seats threatened by teal independents is in stark contrast to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who appears to be avoiding the inner-city seats. Liberal party sources admit party research shows Morrison is unpopular in these areas. On the other side of the campaign, Labor has deployed Kevin Rudd to some seats, including in Melbourne, and he spoke at a party event in Brisbane on Sunday. Julia Gillard has been ever quieter this campaign, intervening only to endorse the Australian Capital Territory senator Katy Gallagher amid concern the progressive vote in Canberra could be split. The Liberal party is hoping Howard will trigger a positive response from people who formerly backed the Coalition. Inviting Howard to vulnerable seats has worked well for the Liberal party in the past – most recently he joined the campaigns that saw the party win the New South Wales and federal elections in 2019. However, this election, the 82-year-old has been traipsing across the country, from Perth to campaign launches in Sydney. On Tuesday, having previously visited Chisholm and Higgins in Melbourne, Howard appeared alongside the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, campaigning in Kooyong, the traditionally blue-ribbon seat that a slew of polls predict could fall to the teal independent Monique Ryan. His message in Kooyong is more tailored. “You may not think that everything Josh or the government has done is perfect, but how could it be?” his letter to voters states. “In these very uncertain times, he and the Liberal team are the best choice to ensure a strong future for our wonderful nation.” In his NSW robocalls, Howard tells voters there’s “a lot at stake” this election and the Coalition government saw Australia “emerge stronger than most countries” from the coronavirus pandemic. “Just as we’re turning a corner, now is not the time to risk change. Mr Albanese simply has not presented a credible alternative. And to vote for an independent could risk a hung parliament, which would mean gridlock and be disastrous for our country,” Howard said. In his mail-outs, Howard rallied further against the teal independents, suggesting the candidates were “not being upfront about their real intention, which is to bring down the Liberal government”. In an interview on Sky News on Tuesday, Howard sought to play down Morrison’s popularity, and explained he was “working hard for the Liberal party both to repay the enormous support it gave me for many years”. “But also because I believe in it and I believe in the prime minister and I believe in his deputy, Josh Frydenberg, who’s been a great treasurer for our country and I want to see him continue for years and years into the future as the member for Kooyong.”",News/Australia news,‘Hello it’s John Howard calling’: former PM says Liberal party asked him to ‘campaign extensively’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/john-howard-says-liberal-party-asked-him-to-campaign-extensively
5/17/2022,"The UK will not “shy away” from legislating to change the Northern Ireland protocol without agreement from the EU, the Northern Ireland secretary has said, as Liz Truss prepares to tell the Commons about plans to unilaterally lift checks. The foreign secretary will tell MPs of plans to bring forward the draft legislation after a cabinet discussion on Northern Ireland. However, the timetable for the draft laws has slipped, with the text now only promised before the summer break, according to Whitehall sources. Brandon Lewis denied plans had been delayed after an alarmed response from Dublin and Washington, saying there had been no intention to put the full legislation before parliament this week. “Something like that this week was never on the cards. We’re still debating the Queen’s speech and won’t finish debating the Queen’s speech and voting on that until later this week, later tomorrow, so in that sense it was never on the cards,” Lewis told Sky News. “But what we have always said is that we will not take anything off the table. We will do what we need to do to ensure that products can move to Northern Ireland in the way that they should be able to move to Northern Ireland from Great Britain as part of the United Kingdom internal market, something the protocol itself says it will respect but at the moment is not working properly. The plans to take unilateral action were causing a “wobble” in Westminster on Monday night after the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, went further than before in a press interview and warned he would not go back into the Stormont executive until new laws were “enacted” . Truss is expected to tell MPs of plans to legislate before the summer should renewed negotiations fail. Lewis said legislation remained the fallback option and the government hoped to return to talks. “We would like to do that by agreement with the EU but we reserve the right to do what we need to do to do the right thing for the people of Northern Ireland and the wider United Kingdom,” he said. Lewis said there were companies unable to operate under the current rules. “There are too many companies, including major supermarkets, at the moment who have no stores in the Republic of Ireland, who are moving their products from their depots in Great Britain into Northern Ireland for sale and consumption in Northern Ireland, but going through checks as if they were going into the EU,” he said. “That just doesn’t work and there are products that can’t travel that way.” He said there was an urgency to find a new solution because the EU proposals would increase the bureaucratic burden. The UK has already acted unilaterally to increase grace periods. “What sometimes gets missed in this is that what the EU is proposing now is that some of the checks we’ve had grace periods for – we are at a standstill at the moment where we are not fully applying some of the checks the EU wants – they actually want to bring those in, so they want to make matters materially worse for the people of Northern Ireland, and that’s just not viable,” Lewis said. Johnson said on a visit to Belfast that the UK did not want to scrap the Northern Ireland protocol, but believed it could be “fixed”. He told broadcasters: “We don’t want to scrap it. But we think it can be fixed. And actually five of the five parties I talked to today also think it needs reform.”",News/UK news,"UK will not ‘shy away’ from unilateral protocol change, says Brandon Lewis",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/uk-not-shy-away-unilateral-northern-ireland-protocol-change-brandon-lewis
