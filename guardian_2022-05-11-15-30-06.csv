5/11/2022,"Representing your country in one sport is quite an achievement. Doing so in two is exceptional. Precious Marange plays both cricket and rugby for Zimbabwe’s women’s teams – while holding down a full-time job, being a mother and supporting her wider family. Marange, 39, is one of the older players in the Eagles women’s cricket team and a role model for a new generation of Zimbabwean sportswomen. At Sunrise Sports Club, about three miles west of central Harare, her voice can be heard bellowing instructions to players bowling under the watchful eye of their coach. The match begins with Marange thrown into the bowling attack; rapturous applause reverberates around the pitch. She claims her first wicket, giving the Eagles an edge over the visiting Mountaineers. “I’m one of the senior players here and it is encouraging to see youngsters rise through the ranks,” Marange says. “My passion is to see them grow into international cricketers like myself.” Over the past decade, there has been a steady rise in the popularity of women’s cricket in Zimbabwe, and Marange – a single mother – has inspired many others to take up the sport. She was working as a housemaid when she first saw a game of cricket on her employers’ television. When they went out, she would switch it on to watch matches as she worked. “It was 2004, and the television set was still black and white, but it was all cricket,” she says. A few weeks later, she was walking past Takashinga cricket club in Harare, where women’s cricket had just been introduced. One of the first black cricket clubs, Takashinga is where most of Zimbabwe’s leading players have emerged from. Marange doesn’t know what gave her the courage to go in and tell the coaches she wanted to play, but she did. They soon discovered she had a talent. “I was still working as a maid in Highfield,” she says. “I used to sneak out for practice. This continued until I got my first break in 2006 to travel with the team to Botswana and an African qualifier the same year. “I remember walking for more than 10km with my friend Modester [Mupachikwa] to the training ground. The love I have for the game fuelled my drive.” In 2008, Marange boarded her first flight to South Africa for a match against Pakistan. “My coach told me to be an all-rounder to increase my chances of being selected.” It was a teammate, Yvonne Rainsford, who played for Zimbabwe, who suggested Marange might want to try rugby. She says: “Yvonne encouraged me to try the sport because of my physical fitness, and I made the national team for a regional tournament instantly. Ever since, I have been playing sevens and 15s rugby.” Schedules can be demanding but Marange says: “Camps do not clash normally. When I finish cricket camp, I just need two days’ rest before joining the rugby camp. I feel proud to be able to represent my country at the highest level.” However, despite being signed to the national teams, she doesn’t earn enough to support her son, mother and extended family and has a day job at a steel manufacturing company. “I played for 10 years for nothing,” she says. “I just wanted to be the best I could be in the sport. “As you know, money is never enough. I always need more to be able to take care of my big family. My boss is a former rugby player, so she understands when I have games. She encourages me to go and play. I can even go for a month away from work, but whenever I come back, I work hard.” Zimbabwean women’s cricket is now producing several players for overseas teams, says the national team’s new coach, Gary Brent. “I’m impressed with the standard,” he adds. “There is nothing stopping us. What we need is to get the talent out of the players on the big stage.” Marange wants to be known not just as a sportswoman but as a pioneer who helped nurture young talent. “I still have more playing days, but when I retire, I’d like to work as a fitness trainer. My desire is to inspire young players to become better. I want the youngsters to see a role model in me.” Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:",News/Global development,"‘I finish cricket, have two days’ rest, then switch to rugby’: Precious Marange on her Zimbabwe caps",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/11/precious-marange-zimbabwe-cricket-rugby-caps
5/11/2022,"They walk among us. Seemingly ordinary people leading seemingly ordinary lives, who like to wake up in the morning and put disgusting wet things in their mouths. I’m sorry for kink-shaming but there are lines that should never be crossed: putting orange juice on your cereal is one of them. I’m all for unusual food combinations – I will eat peas with anything, even popcorn, but there really are basic standards we should all adhere to. Orange juice, I’m afraid, should only ever be consumed in a cup or glass. Alas, it seems an awful lot of Americans disagree. According to a very scientific study conducted by Tropicana, 15 million Americans have tried pouring OJ over their breakfast cereal. Instead of publicly condemning these people, the purveyor of orange-based beverages is encouraging them: it recently came out with a new cereal designed to be eaten with juice rather than milk. The cereal, Tropicana Crunch, was launched on 4 May, which also happens to be a holiday made up by big citrus called National Orange Juice Day. Tropicana is not the first brand to try to drum up some free PR by creating a disgusting-sounding foodstuff – gimmicky mashups are a tried and tested marketing tactic. Last year, for example, Van Leeuwen, a fancy ice-cream brand, teamed up with Kraft for a macaroni-and-cheese flavour ice-cream. This was a promotional stunt to honour … you guessed it, National Mac and Cheese Day. There has also been a pumpkin spice version of Cup Noodles. This, by the way, was to celebrate the brand’s 50th anniversary, rather than a made-up day. Speaking of which, it seems that today is National Eat What You Want Day. So, go ahead, you OJ-and-cereal-scoffing-barbarians – you get a free pass on Wednesday. On Thursday, however, maybe try experimenting with toast?

5/11/2022,"I am acting on behalf of a family of four Ukrainians who are trying to apply for visas via the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme. Each family member has to apply individually and the visa decision is sent by email only. Unlike other nationalities, Ukrainians can’t track their applications via the government’s UK Visas and Immigration website. One has received their permission to travel letter, but the other three have had their email accounts blocked or suspended, possibly for security reasons because they have been accessed from different places in different countries over a short space of time. They are therefore unable to receive their visa decision. I’ve rung the helpline and was told that there is no alternative other than contacting the email providers, hoping they resume the service.KK, Grays, Essex This stumbling block in an already shambolic system has also been raised by Londoner, SH, who is sponsoring a Ukrainian mother and her eight-year-old son under the government scheme. “They applied for visas on the day that applications opened three weeks ago,” she writes. “Since then they have received no updates on the son’s status. The Home Office helpline told me there were problems with their email systems. Since decisions are communicated by email, individuals who have had visas approved may not even know.” The Home Office confirmed to me that Ukrainians were unable to check the progress of their visa applications via the government website, although it would not give the reason. Instead, those who hold a valid passport must wait up to three weeks for emailed notification that their permission to travel letter has been issued. Since the government has warned them not to make travel arrangements to the UK until the letter arrives, thousands are in limbo with no information about when they can expect to hear. A spokesperson said that those unable to receive or print the letter should call the dedicated helpline, which both KK and SH did to no avail. The government has previously admitted that call centre staff have no access to the status of applications because Teleperformance, the French multinational contracted to run the helpline, has been barred from the government database for security reasons. KK’s sponsored family finally received its visas after she persuaded the chief executive of their email service provider to reinstate their accounts. The Refugee Council told the Observer that it was deeply concerned by the bureaucratic hurdles that had delayed Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK. “We are hearing that visas for all members of a family who have applied together are not always processed together, causing significant delays to their ability to travel to the UK. We are also hearing that people are having real difficulties with receiving emails at all, or they are receiving emails at different times from others in their family, all of which is causing huge distress and delays,” said chief executive Enver Solomon. “It amounts to putting paperwork and bureaucracy before people who have no choice but to leave their homes.” Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

5/11/2022,"Channel 4 is to make available 1,000 hours of hit shows from Location, Location, Location to SAS: Who Dares Wins on YouTube in the widest-ranging commercial deal the Silicon Valley giant has struck with a UK broadcaster. Channel 4, which has struck the lucrative content and commercial partnership as it makes a last-ditch effort to stave off privatisation, is aiming to reduce its dependence on traditional TV advertising and target young audiences as a digital-first broadcaster. The partnership with YouTube, which is used by 98% of 18- to 34-year-old internet users each month, includes Channel 4 selling advertising around the programmes, which will be available to viewers for free – the first time the Google-owned video-sharing platform has relinquished control of ad sales to a broadcaster in the UK or Europe. The deal also potentially marks the start of a new era of commercial deals between TV broadcasters and Silicon Valley, in a similar vein to those being struck between Google, Facebook and newspaper publishers such as News Corporation, owner of titles including The Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2009, Channel 4 became the first broadcaster in the world to make thousands of hours of programming available on YouTube. However, the deal fell apart in 2014 with the broadcaster saying that the best way to get a return on its programming investment was to focus on making its shows available only on its own online and on-demand services. For the best part of the last decade, most UK broadcasters have used YouTube only for promotional purposes, and none have agreed a wide-ranging programming deal, with Sky and BT dabbling with free-to-air distribution to boost audiences for some pay-TV programming such as the Champions League final. “Innovative strategic partnerships are Channel 4’s specialty and this new relationship with YouTube is another which will ensure we continue to keep growing our reach with young audiences and build on our unrivalled digital success,” said Alex Mahon, chief executive of Channel 4. “Together with YouTube we have created a powerful consumer channel full of our brilliant Channel 4 content. This will engage even more viewers through the enhanced reach and digital scale of YouTube.” Last year, about a fifth of Channel 4’s total £1.2bn revenues came from digital advertising. The broadcaster forecasts that this will rise to 30% by 2025. The deal will involve a combination of popular archive catch-up programming and new releases – after a 30-day window on Channel 4’s on-demand service All 4 after first being broadcast on TV – made available on YouTube starting from later this month. “As an open platform, YouTube is where UK audiences of all ages and background come to watch what they want to watch, when they want to watch it,” said Ben McOwen Wilson, managing director of YouTube UK & Ireland. “It is fantastic to drive innovative partnerships such as this, to enable leading broadcasters to contribute to the diversity of content on the platform of choice for young viewers.”",News/Media,"Channel 4 strikes deal to air 1,000 hours of hit shows for free on YouTube",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/11/channel-4-strikes-deal-to-air-1000-hours-of-hit-shows-for-free-on-youtube
5/11/2022,"The ear, nose and throat consultant sits at his computer reviewing the footage of my laryngoscopy – a camera on a wire pushed up my nostril and down my throat. I sit with my hands in my lap. ​​The wait is terrible. I thought I had experienced various forms of “desperate” in my life but now I know what it truly means. If it turns out he can’t help, if he can’t tell me anything, then I will have to continue in this version of hell where tying my shoelaces or walking and talking leaves me gasping, starved for breath. And the hell isn’t even the extreme exhaustion, the incapacitation or the loss of the things I might yet have done as a healthy 40-year-old woman. Hell is knowing I, my body, is letting down my beloved 16-month-old son. I cannot bear it. Then, the consultant waves me over to his computer. On the screen is a video of my trachea. The film is faintly obscene, my vocal cords pale and pulsating above the fleshy windpipe. Of course, even I know it shouldn’t be fleshy: there should be strong rings of cartilage, but mine is overgrown with scar tissue. Finally, he turns to me and gives me an answer. I have idiopathic subglottic stenosis, a rare disease affecting about 1 in 400,000 people, especially women aged between 35 and 45. My windpipe has narrowed to 6mm. There is a major surgery available, he says, a resection, involving cutting out the affected area and, sometimes, reconstructing it with a piece of rib. When he tells me he would want to incorporate a temporary tracheostomy breathing tube, my composure slips. I bring my hand protectively to the soft skin of my neck: “Oh. I really don’t want that.” “Yes, but it’s better than suffocating.” We decide they will do a smaller, interim surgery first, using a laser to cut away the scar tissue, a surgical balloon to dilate the windpipe. He is pragmatic. “This surgery will be temporary. Maybe you’ll get a few months of good breathing, maybe more. It’s …” “… a Band-Aid. I understand. I don’t mind. I just need to look after my baby.” “Well, you need it immediately. You know, if you get a respiratory infection it could …” We both say it at once. “Kill you.” “Kill me.” This moment has been two years in the making. When I got pregnant I assumed my constant difficulty breathing would be fixed when I no longer had a giant foetus playing Twister in my uterus. Then I assumed it was just the rigours of sleep deprivation and carrying extra baby weight. Finally, when I could no longer climb a flight of stairs, I went to a doctor, who told me, conclusively, that it was asthma. Both the illness and the appointments escalated in the next six months: a battery of breathing and blood tests, an inhaler that made me worse, reflux medicine that made me so violently ill my husband begged me to go to A&E (I did not). An ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor misdiagnosed me with an extremely rare condition called tracheomalacia – so for two weeks I believed I would spend the rest of my life wheeling around an oxygen tank. Another ENT told me that, in fact, I had a tumour in my windpipe. Then there were the biopsies, CT scans and lung X-rays, all done in different clinics across Prague, where I live, and navigated in my broken Czech. This is not unusual. What I have is so rare most people are initially misdiagnosed. Indeed, it’s a credit to the excellent professionals in the Czech healthcare system that I was diagnosed within months, and not years or even decades like so many others. Finally, I got an appointment with this ENT consultant, one of the best in the country. But the earliest he could see me was in three months, and all the while my breathing, my exhaustion, got worse. For the hour a day I was able to be out of bed, I prioritised bringing whatever energy and joy I could to my son. Then I retreated to bed to write when I could. If I did not move at all, then I could stay awake and work for 40-minute stretches at a time. My childhood, which could be summarised politely as poor and traumatic, has given me extraordinary gifts in resilience, but this final blow, the idea this might be my life, and my son’s and husband’s life, too, was almost too much to bear. We had been through an immigration, a pandemic pregnancy and the beautiful-brutal first parenting year and, although my husband is as kind as anyone could wish for – the strain on our relationship was becoming overwhelming. One night, I said it would be better if I wasn’t here at all, and that same night, in desperation, I emailed the consultant, begging him to see me earlier so I could “be at full strength to care for my child”. Back in the consulting room, it isn’t a surprise to hear that my condition, idiopathic subglottic stenosis, could have killed me. I have been dimly aware of, and ignoring, that close-to-death feeling for months now. But hearing him say it is validating. I am suddenly calm. It’s not in my hands any more. Here I am with a doctor, and this doctor will not let me die. Indeed, he might even make me better. He has to go to his next surgery before he can schedule the emergency surgery. He walks me down to wait in the cafe – a busy hub of young medical students, patients in towelling dressing gowns and tired-looking visitors. He comes back with my medical notes, a small square picture of my murderous windpipe and instructions to come on Monday, the earliest they can get me into an operating room. “Thank you. Thank you so much.” I call my husband from the taxi. His absolute unconditional love has been astounding in the face of what our life might have been like. I realise, ironically, my broken body has helped to mend the stress fractures threatening our relationship. Or his response to it has. He sounds relieved. He sounds scared. He tells me to hurry home. He and our baby miss me very much. To order a copy of Lowborn Growing Up, Getting Away and Returning to Britain’s Poorest Towns, by Kerry Hudson, for £8.36, go to guardianbookshop.com.

5/11/2022,"Aperegrine falcon swoops over grazing cows. A giant Stars and Stripes is painted on wood with “Bundy for governor” and “No trespassing” attached. Up a gravel drive, past an upturned wheelbarrow, is a red, white and blue Bundy campaign bus and a sign that declares: “Keep Idaho Idaho.” Ammon Bundy’s compound is situated under rolling green hills and a broad Idaho sky. From his five-bedroom farmhouse, the far-right activist gazes out at his 240 apple trees along with cherry, peach and pear trees. He points to the homes of two neighbors, both military men – and both flying the American flag upside down. “It’s a sign of distress,” Bundy says. “I’m not influencing them in any way but, if there is going to be some type of civil war, I think it will be the military fracturing. I hope not. I believe more in a separation, if it was needed.” The bearded 46-year-old, notorious for armed standoffs with law enforcement that landed him in prison, has no chance of becoming governor of Idaho. But the mere fact that, during a year in solitary confinement, he wrote in his journal about a plan to run for elected office is indicative of a change in the political wind here. Idaho has long been one of the most conservative states in America with its fair share of extremism. Now, critics warn, the extremists are being normalised. Once dismissed as backwoods fanatics, the far right have entered the political arena and identified a path to power. That path leads through a state Republican party that has long exploited tensions between independent-spirited Idahoans and the federal government, which manages two-thirds of the state’s land, and more recently embraced former president Donald Trump’s culture of grievance. Trump beat Joe Biden with 64% of the vote here in the 2020 election. Democrats have not held the governor’s office since 1995 or statewide elected office since 2007. Most elections for the state legislature do not even feature a Democratic candidate. Chuck Malloy, a columnist and former communications adviser to the House Republican caucus, said: “Sure, we have a two-party system: it’s Republican and more Republican. Idaho is shifting more to the right every day.” In the Republican primary election for governor on 17 May, incumbent Brad Little, a stalwart conservative by national standards, is portrayed as a Republican in Name Only (Rino) by his even more extreme challenger, Lieutenant Governor Janice McGeachin (Bundy dropped out of the Republican race and is running as an independent). McGeachin has sought to grab attention by issuing executive orders banning coronavirus mask and vaccine mandates when Little was out of state only to see them overturned on his return. But the political grandstanding appears to have backfired. Opinion polls suggest that McGeachin is heading for defeat. Little, who can boast of a record $1.9bn budget surplus, could not be described as much of a liberal saviour, however. He made a pilgrimage to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida only for the former president to endorse McGeachin four days later. As the state party’s centre of gravity shifts right, he is shifting with it. The governor recently signed one of the most extreme abortion laws in the country, banning the procedure after a foetal heartbeat is detected and allowing family members of rapists to sue providers. He also signed a bill banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports. Malloy observed: “Little can’t come across as looking pro-abortion in any way, shape or form so he signs this bill and makes the comments, well, I think it’s unconstitutional, but I’ll sign it anyway. He doesn’t want to go into a Republican primary election by being soft on the abortion issue or guns. He’s been picking his fights.” He added: “Democrats can’t be crazy about Brad Little. But to at least some people it’s a matter of do I vote for sane or insane?” Lauren Necochea, chair of the state Democratic party and a state representative, confirmed that she is unimpressed by the governor. She said: “The difference between Little and McGeachin is really more style than substance. She personifies the far-right extremism while he panders to it.” Although Little is likely to retain the governor’s mansion, elections for other offices of state are more competitive between the hard right and harder right. Priscilla Giddings, a McGeachin ally, is running for lieutenant governor, while Dorothy Moon, a member of the far-right John Birch Society, is a contender for secretary of state. Raúl Labrador, a former member of the influential US House Freedom Caucus who once proclaimed “Nobody dies because they don’t have access to healthcare”, is among the candidates for state attorney general. The extremist faction has also been expanding its influence in the state house and senate, recently attempting to block government funding for healthcare and television and to criminalise librarians for “disseminating material harmful to minors”, though the measures were ultimately thwarted. House member Chad Christensen, for example, proudly declares on his webpage his membership of the Oath Keepers, a militaristic, anti-government group whose founder, Stewart Rhodes, is facing charges of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Scott McIntosh, opinion editor of the Idaho Statesman newspaper, said: “When I moved here in 2006, the Republican party was very much dominated by reasonable Republicans. Brad Little would be in that category. All they were worried about was running a good small state government. “They’re still here but the Republicans who are getting elected, particularly in the past 10 years, are more interested in coming to the state capitol and pushing transgender rights, abortion, library criminalisation bills that are more culture wars they see going on in other parts of the country that they want to stop from happening here in Idaho.” Perhaps most insidiously, a new far-right generation is targeting and taking over Republican central committees at county level. It means that the election for governor might be less important than it seems since the winner will find themselves tugged to the right by a radicalised state government. Shea Andersen, a marketing consultant who has worked on political campaigns, agreed: “They’ve figured out that the real power in Idaho is not to hold the governor’s seat necessarily – though certainly it would send a great message for them – but any sort of fringe political viewpoint is better served by fanning out and getting your positions represented in more day-to-day operations, whether that is state legislature or county commissioner races or even races for treasurer and secretary of state.” The trend is especially pronounced in northern Idaho, a region infamous in the late 20th century for Richard Butler’s effort to establish a “white homeland” from his 20-acre Aryan Nations compound. Butler was eventually bankrupted by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the compound was burned in June 2001. Chris Fillios, a moderate Republican seeking re-election as a county commissioner in Kootenai county, has observed extremists on the march there. “They have been told, infiltrate at every level: school board, county, city offices, anywhere and everywhere they can, state level, federal level, infiltrate, infiltrate.” Fillios sees a connection with “alt-right” figures such as Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist in the Trump White House. “If we start from the national level and we look at Steve Bannon having identified his so-called 40,000 ‘shock troops’, the most fertile ground that they could find would be northern Idaho. If they can get a foothold here, they could use it as sort of a launch pad for the rest of the country.” A driving force is the Idaho Freedom Foundation, a thinktank that vets legislation and legislators for their conservative and libertarian credentials. Approached for an interview, the foundation emailed a one-word reply: “Nope.” Approached in person at its office near the state capitol in Boise, the foundation’s staff gave a brusque refusal. Tellingly, the foundation’s website asks: “Are you a refugee from California, or some other liberal playground? Did you move to Idaho to escape the craziness? Welcome to Idaho. We’re glad to have you here. You are one of the new Idahoans. The people who came to the Gem State seeking a home that reflects their values: small government and a freer life.” This is a trend that has been called “right flight” as conservatives pour into Idaho from liberal, racially diverse states. It could be seen as part of the grand sorting of American national politics as liberals move to places where they will find like minds and conservatives do likewise, meaning that blue states turn bluer and red states turn redder. Stephanie Witt, director of the Applied Research Center at Boise State University, said: “The newcomers aren’t liberals. They’re as conservative or more conservative than the people who are here.” “I remember one woman I met at a county women’s forum. She was a recent transplant from southern California and she’s just like, ‘We can’t let California happen here.’ She felt like she was really holding a line.” California is the most diverse state in America; Idaho is 93% white. But Tom Luna, the first Hispanic person elected to statewide office in Idaho as superintendent of public instruction, denies that race is a motivating factor. “I don’t see ‘white flight’ as a reason at all for people moving here. I don’t know the numbers but I’ve met a lot of new people that have moved here and I see quite a diversity that identify themselves as Republicans.” Luna is now chair of the state Republican party. He rejects the notion that it has gone rogue. “This is the same party that has led for the past 20 years resulting in now one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest-growing, state in the country, and one reason is because of quality of life.” But among the new arrivals is Bundy, who grew up in Utah and lived in Arizona before moving to Idaho seven years ago. The father of six children settled on farmland outside Emmett – also the home of Governor Little, a third-generation sheep and cattle rancher – about an hour north-west of Boise. Bundy was infamous for standoffs with federal agents near his family’s ranch in Nevada in 2014 and at the Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016, which left one man dead. He served prison time but denies that he was leading armed rebellions and claims he won the “PR battle”. “The federal government has been attacking the land users – ranchers, loggers, miners and other people,” he said in an interview, wearing a checked shirt and paint-flecked jeans and sitting near a baby grand piano. “There’s been this almost theological battle that’s been going on for decades and decades over the land in the west.” He articulates the small government ideology of many far-right Republicans here: “I believe that we should become independent. We’ve got plenty resources and we should be able to stand on our own and not be dependent on the federal government to pay our medical bills and to build our buildings and all of that. But we’re like welfare junkies. We can’t seem to get off of it.” Bundy has been arrested multiple times in Idaho. Once such incident occurred in 2020 because he refused to leave a statehouse auditorium while protesting against pandemic legislation after officials ordered the room to be cleared. Earlier this year he was involved in protests that helped force a hospital into temporary lockdown. The rise of such tactics by extremists, which has included harassing and intimidating Republican legislators deemed too moderate, and storming into school or district health board meetings, sometimes with AR-15 rifles, has raised the specter of political violence in the state’s future. McIntosh of the Idaho Statesman said: “I only see it getting worse. I don’t see a way out of it.”",News/World news,‘Republican and more Republican’: Idaho shifts ever rightward,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/iowa-right-wing-republicans
5/11/2022,"The lifting of zero-Covid policies in China would see a “tsunami” of infections and almost 1.6 million deaths, a study claims, citing in part China’s low vaccination rate of elderly residents. China’s government remains committed to a zero-Covid policy, employing resource intensive mass testing and case surveillance, and enforcing lockdowns, strict quarantine and isolation. A speech last week by the president, Xi Jinping, reaffirmed the commitment, despite the challenge posed by the Omicron variant which has already overwhelmed other countries’ zero-Covid policies. The peer reviewed study by Shanghai’s Fudan University, published in the Nature journal, said a decision by Chinese authorities to lift such measures could see more than 112 million symptomatic cases of Covid-19, five million hospitalisations, and 1.55 million deaths. “We find that the level of immunity induced by the March 2022 vaccination campaign would be insufficient to prevent an Omicron wave that would result in exceeding critical care capacity with a projected intensive care unit peak demand of 15.6 times the existing capacity,” the paper said. However it also said that with access to vaccines and antivirals and “maintaining implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions”, authorities could prevent the health system being overwhelmed. It suggested these factors could be more of a focus in future policies. While the government message is that the zero-Covid policy will prevail over the highly transmissible variant, health officials have said they cannot open up now because vaccine coverage is insufficient and health resources too uneven across the country. Health experts agree, but China analysts are also concerned the authorities have backed themselves into a corner with no political exit ramp for the policy without admitting failure. Case numbers are dropping in China but remain spread across multiple provinces. On Wednesday authorities reported 1,905 cases including 302 symptomatic. The bulk of cases are still being found in Shanghai, which has been under lockdown for more than two months. On Tuesday authorities announced new guidelines for people to home quarantine. Part of the change specified that among other requirements, the homes must have ventilation and drainage systems that “won’t contaminate those of other households”, a report in the Global Times said. Other requirements include separate bathrooms and bedrooms, and the ability to care for oneself – in line with home isolation arrangements in other countries. However the prospect of allowing some asymptomatic people and close contacts to stay home has ignited debate among epidemiologists and health officials, and comes in stark contrast to the enforcement of measures on the ground, especially in Shanghai. Since Xi’s speech last week, enforcement in the city appears to have hardened further. Social media is awash with videos of health workers and police officers in full protective equipment zealously enforcing regulations. There appears to be growing frustration with how the rules and regulations are being enforced, with many questioning how it compares to recent moves by authorities to take people into quarantine facilities if they live on the same or an adjoining floor as a confirmed case. Shanghai authorities on Tuesday said officials were making judgments and risk assessments on a case by case basis. “The policy is policy, the implementation is implementation, the two are separate,” said one commenter.

5/11/2022,"An SAS soldier who denies allegations that he murdered a handcuffed prisoner with Ben Roberts-Smith in Afghanistan has told a court he felt “incredibly hurt” when another soldier – his close friend and the best man at his wedding – alleged he did participate in killing the unarmed man. Person 11, called by Roberts-Smith as a witness in his defamation trial against three newspapers, has given evidence about a critical allegation against Roberts-Smith: over the death of a man named as Ali Jan, in the village of Darwan in September 2012. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith kicked Ali Jan, bound in handcuffs, off a cliff into a dry creek bed, before the injured man was dragged into a cornfield and shot dead, allegedly by one or both of Person 11 and Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith and Person 11 have both denied the allegation, telling the court consistently they killed the man – an insurgent spotter – after they discovered him hiding in a cornfield and carrying a radio. However, Person 4, serving alongside both men that day, has given evidence for the newspapers he saw Roberts-Smith kick the handcuffed man off the cliff and was ordered by Roberts-Smith to drag the injured man, with Person 11, into the cornfield before he was shot. Person 4 said Roberts-Smith and Person 11 had a conversation before “a number of shots rang out”. He testified he saw Person 11 with his rifle raised in a firing position after he heard the shots. Person 11 told the court Person 4 had been the best man at his wedding, a close friend and mentor, but that he had severed their relationship over the allegations of what had happened in Darwan. “In 2018 I was made aware again of allegations that had been put to me, I was aware in 2018 that Person 4 had said certain things which had given rise to these allegations, and I felt incredibly hurt that someone who was so close for a number of years, who had been a mentor and good friend, not just professionally but also personally, would say such things that would cause such grief and heartache.” He told the court he phoned Person 4 to tell him that, while they were then still serving alongside each other in the SAS, “on a personal level, our relationship was over”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The alleged murder of Ali Jan is the most notorious allegation of a sprawling and complex defamation case, which has spent nearly a year before the federal court. The newspapers allege as part of their defence the murder was a “joint criminal enterprise” between Roberts-Smith and his subordinate, Person 11. Under extensive cross-examination from Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, Person 11 defended his account of the man’s killing, saying he and his patrol were moving from the dry creek bed up into the fields – towards a helicopter extraction point – when he observed the man carrying a radio and moving in a way that was suspicious “trying to maintain concealment”. He told the court he saw the man 15 metres away through “thickly vegetated” crop that was between five and seven feet high. He opened fire, closely followed by Roberts-Smith who was to his “right rear”. Person 11’s version of events largely aligns with that of Roberts-Smith. But the two soldiers’ versions of events are not identical. Person 11 said the man shot in the cornfield was “15 metres away”. Roberts-Smith, when he gave evidence last year, told the court, he climbed the embankment to confront the man, “he was two metres away”. On Wednesday, Owens asked Person 11: “How is it that you could have seen an insurgent through 15 metres of thickly planted crop that was five to seven feet high?” “Because I could,” Person 11 replied. “You couldn’t could you?” “That’s not true.” “Because there was no one there?” “That’s not true.” Owens put it to Person 11 that “there was no spotter in that cornfield” and that he and Roberts-Smith had “concocted a false story” to cover up the fact they had unlawfully killed a ‘PUC’, a ‘person under a control’. “That’s not correct, Mr Owens,” Person 11 said. “I have come here in good faith to tell the truth.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Owens put it to Person 11 that the radio photographed on the body of the slain man was placed next to his corpse after he was killed, as a post-facto justification for his killing. Person 11 denied this, saying he saw the man carrying the radio and assessed him to be a spotter – a forward scout who relays troop movements to other insurgents. Owens showed Person 11 pictures of the slain man’s body, whose arms and hands were covered in blood, but which also showed a stripe of clean skin on his wrist where there was no blood. “I want to put to you that the very straight line on his wrist where there is no blood is consistent with the man wearing flexicuffs when he was bleeding.” “I disagree with that Mr Owens,” Person 11 said. Owens said: “I want to put to you clearly: when you shot this man his hands were handcuffed behind his back, correct?” “That is incorrect,” Person 11 replied. Person 4, Person 11’s former friend, has been a key witness in the year-long defamation trial brought by Roberts-Smith. He has given critical evidence about the mission in Darwan. However, Person 4 has also been accused of participating in the execution of an unarmed prisoner, also involving Roberts-Smith, during an earlier SAS operation in the village of Kakarak in 2009. The newspapers allege Person 4 was ordered to execute an elderly Afghan man discovered hiding in a tunnel in a compound known as Whiskey 108 and who surrendered to Australian troops. Person 4 allegedly obeyed the order. The court has heard Person 4’s patrol commander gave the order to kill the unarmed man. While Person 4 gave evidence about the Darwan mission, he objected to answering questions about Kakarak “on the grounds of self-incrimination”.

5/11/2022,"There’s an acrid smell in the air and an unsettling crunch underfoot as we step over the metallic black and gold detritus of war. Ahead of us, framed by tree branches amputated by tank shells and mortar fire, the sky is reflecting brilliantly on the shimmering flood waters. After negotiating more than a dozen army checkpoints within the thick forests of Kyiv’s outer boundary, we have reached the flooded village of Demydiv on the Irpin River and the long-lost wetland basin, which has returned after the dam was opened by Ukrainian troops defending the capital from Russian army units, and was later struck by a missile. The newly restored wetland basin in Demydiv, Ukraine The breaching of the Irpin dam at the end of February held back the Russian soldiers and tanks, and reflooded 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of wetlands that were drained by the Soviets in the 1960s. Until the outbreak of war, the floodplain was due to be become the foundations of a massive new housing development. But with the waters possibly back for good, the future of the fragile ecology – and that of local communities – is uncertain. Local ecologist Volodymyr Boreyko is calling for the Irpin River to be given the title of “Hero River”, and for Ukraine to follow the precedent set by Ecuador in 2008, when it became the first country in the world to recognise the rights of nature in its constitution. “I think the Irpin River should be awarded the title of ‘Hero River’ and be given strong environmental protections, because this year the Irpin, in tandem with the UAF [Ukrainian armed forces] and territorial defence forces, played one of the most important roles in the defence of our capital for the last 1,000 years,” says Boreyko. The damaged Irpin dam and the flooded landscape around the village of Demydiv, which remains underwater, although the waters are gradually receding The large construction projects previously approved for the Irpin floodplain should be cancelled, he adds. The battle for Kyiv wasn’t the only time the Irpin has saved the city and, without it, he says, Kyiv would be left vulnerable to attack in the future. “A thousand years ago, in the days of Kyivan Rus, the Irpin River repeatedly protected Kyiv from the north and north-west from the attacks of the Polovtsians and Pechenegs. It is 162km (101 miles) long, and its floodplain is so wide and swampy, enemy cavalry could not pass. “If Putin had attacked in a year or two from now, the river Irpin would not have been able to defend the capital because its entire floodplain would have been cemented over and the river itself would be hidden in a collector and be no obstacle whatsoever to enemy tanks.” The aftermath of the war in the town of Hostomel, which was occupied by Russian forces unable to push forwards due to the floods, during the assault on Kyiv Before Soviet occupation, says Bohdan Prots, head of plant ecology at the National Museum of Natural History and director of the Centre for Environmental Studies and Nature Conservation, the Irpin floodplain was a biodiversity hotspot, a kind of Ukrainian Amazon, with vast wetlands composed of bogs, swamps and marshes that thrived along riverbanks of thick reed beds and dunes of golden sand. “It was 5 metres deep in places, and full of giant catfish and sturgeon, as well as now-missing wetland bird species and birds of prey, like the white-tailed eagle.” The remnants of a rocket in an agricultural field near Hostomel According to Prots, Soviet dams on the Irpin and Dnipro had a catastrophic impact on the ecosystems of the Irpin and its many tributaries that once thrived here. Many housing developments were built on the old floodplain, putting further pressure on the dying river ecosystem. “Wetlands can’t be restored just like that,” says Prots. “They [the Soviets] created huge environmental problems by damming and adding locks to the Irpin, which over the years steadily reduced the volume and flow velocity of water, which encouraged excessive algae that in turn reduced water oxygenation to the point where big fish could no longer breathe. “Just because the water has returned it doesn’t mean we are looking at a new wetland rich in biodiversity. The ecology has been very badly degraded over many, many years. It would need many years for ecological improvements to be observed,” he adds. Although the water has returned, it will take years for biodiversity to be restored The sudden re-flooding of the old Kyiv-Irpin wetlands, which was also used as a first defence by Ukrainians defending Kyiv against the Germans in 1941, is very unlikely to have the kind of ecological benefits a carefully managed rewilding project would produce, he says. “War doesn’t do rewilding – there was no research, there was no planning or mitigation. It might have helped us defend our capital, but before long there will be pressure to redrain this area. Can you imagine how many trillions of mosquitoes will be here this summer?” Clockwise from top left: The flooded village of Demydiv was mainly swamp and marshland until dams were built in the Soviet era; water is pumped from Demydiv village; the village of Rakivka is still without power; local municipal workers remove containers, possibly containing oil or chemicals Prots says he thinks the local government will come under pressure to rebuild the Irpin dam. But while the war is still raging and the Kyiv region still littered with mines, it could be some time before any attempt could begin. “I think there’s a good chance it [the dam] will be rebuilt eventually, but right now all our energies and thoughts are on defeating the invaders, because this is an existential issue for us. Until it is resolved and the Russians are kicked out of our lands, we can’t properly address this issue.” A black-headed gull searches for food on deadwood beside the Dnipro River, of which the Irpin is a tributary Alexey Vasilyuk, biologist and founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group (UNCG), says he is hopeful the reflooded Irpin wetlands will remain. “First of all, these waters are now serving in the defence of Kyiv, so until we are sure Russia won’t try to seize Kyiv again, I don’t see how we can justify completely draining this area again. Secondly, I think it will be extremely difficult or maybe impossible to reverse what has happened. “Hypothetically speaking, it might become a very good spawning ground for fish that have dramatically declined here over the last decades, and also become an important breeding ground for many species of rare wetland birds,” he says. A flooded area near Kozarovychi town, north of Kyiv But, says Vasilyuk, the return of the water could pose as many problems as opportunities. “The local ecosystem of the Irpin River basin was in a bad way before the dam burst,” he says. “And now, a lot of Russian tanks and military equipment are underwater here. The mixing of chemicals and oils from fuel tanks with pollution from inundated landfills is a big threat,” he says. “Right before the war, many parts of the land were sprayed with pesticides and fertilisers, so there are many threats for humans and wildlife that should be resolved.” Despite the hazards and dangers, Vasilyuk remains optimistic that solutions can be found, and that Kyiv’s ancient wetlands may be back for good. “While the soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting to stop the genocide of the Ukrainian people, we think that the environmental front should take care to prevent ecocide,” says Vasilyuk. “This is possibly the most precious and important wetland in Ukraine, not because of its fragile or unique biodiversity, but because without this swampy barrier, the battle for Kyiv might have had a very different outcome.” A bird of prey flies over the Irpin River floodplain Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Ukraine’s ‘hero river’ helped save Kyiv.

5/11/2022,"Australian cities are falling short on walkability and other measures of healthy and sustainable lifestyles when compared with some lower-income countries, new research suggests. A Lancet Global Health series, launched on Wednesday, analysed urban design, transport and health outcomes for 25 cities in 19 countries, including Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. It found most Australians live in areas that do not meet density and walkability thresholds in line with World Health Organization physical activity targets. “The worst performing cities for walkability were in high-income countries including the USA, Australia, and New Zealand. These cities were developed primarily in the 20th century under a car-centric planning model,” the research found. “Our results show that older, compact cities had better walkability, irrespective of economic development status.” Between 37% and 44% of the population in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide live in neighbourhoods with above-average walkability, a measure of how accessible amenities in a city are by walking. This compared with 97% of people in São Paulo, 96% in Hong Kong, 92% in Chennai and 87% in Mexico City. Australian cities were also let down by lack of frequent access to public transport. While 87% of Melbourne’s population had access to any public transport, only 49% had access to stops with weekday services every 20 minutes – less than the average for cities in high-income countries, which was 55%. In comparison, 94% of São Paolo residents and 93% of people in Lisbon lived near frequent public transport. Lead researcher Prof Billie Giles-Corti, director of the Healthy Liveable Cities Lab at RMIT University, said Australian cities were particularly low density. “You need density not for density’s sake, but because density means … there’s enough people to support shops, services and public transport. “Only 18% of Melburnians live in neighbourhoods that have density thresholds that are enough to encourage walking for transport to achieve … World Health Organization targets,” Giles-Corti said. “Fifty-one percent of people in Sydney do, and very few people in Adelaide.” She said it would be a challenge to retrofit cities to improve liveability outcomes. “How do we create 15 or 20 minute neighbourhoods in our existing cities so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of living in a healthier, more sustainable community?” Australian cities also scored poorly for access to fresh food – less than quarter of the populations live within a 500 metre walk of a healthy food market, compared with 70% in Bern. The effects of the pandemic were not included in the study, but were likely to “have a big impact on CBDs of our cities”, Giles-Corti said. “More people are working from home and doing so more often.” Figures released last week by the Property Council of Australia show that while office occupancy in major central business districts has increased since the beginning of the year, they are still only a fraction of pre-Covid levels. CBD office occupancy at the end of April was highest in Adelaide, at 59% of pre-Covid figures, followed by Brisbane (51%) and Perth (50%). Melbourne, which underwent the longest cumulative period in lockdown, was the lowest at 36%. Transport changes due to the pandemic have shown “that we can work in a different way”, Giles-Corti said. “We could have people living and working more in their communities as well as to travelling to work.” The pandemic has also led to other changes globally, such as road space being allocated to walking, cycling, commerce and recreation. In Europe, 2021 research into the rollout of pop-up bike lanes found that it was linked to significant increase in cycling. Some such bike paths introduced in Sydney and Melbourne during the pandemic are set to become permanent fixtures.",News/Australia news,Australian cities among worst performing on walkability and public transport access,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/australian-cities-among-worst-performing-on-walkability-and-public-transport-access
5/11/2022,"Coldplay have been branded “useful idiots for greenwashing” after announcing a partnership with the Finnish oil company Neste to halve their touring emissions last week. Neste claims to be the world’s largest producer of sustainable biofuels, but the firm’s palm oil suppliers cleared at least 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) of forest in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia between 2019 and 2020, according a study by Friends of the Earth. Carlos Calvo Ambel, a senior director of the Transport and Environment campaign group (T&E) said: “Neste is cynically using Coldplay to greenwash its reputation. This is a company that is linked to the kind of deforestation that would appal Chris Martin and his fans. It’s not too late, they should drop their partnership with Neste now and focus on truly clean solutions instead.” The award-winning rock outfit announced plans to shrink their touring footprint after Martin accepted that a “backlash” against their emissions record was justified in a BBC interview last year. A tree will be planted for each ticket sold on Coldplay’s current “music of the spheres” world tour, which includes a kinetic-powered dancefloor and other green features. A statement from the band said: “When we announced this tour, we said that we would try our best to make it as sustainable and low carbon-impact as possible, but that it would be a work in progress. That remains true. We don’t claim to have got it all right yet.” “Before we appointed Neste as supplier of these biofuel products, we received their guarantee that they do not use any virgin materials in their production – most especially not palm oil. It’s still our understanding that they use renewable waste products only, like cooking oil and byproducts from wood pulp manufacture.” Hanna Leijala, a spokeswoman for Neste, insisted that the firm “do not accept any sustainability violations in our own operations.” “For our collaboration with Coldplay, conventional palm oil was not used as a raw material” she said, adding: “Neste plans to reduce the share of conventional palm oil to 0% of its global renewable raw material inputs by the end of 2023.” At present, crude palm oil makes up 7% of the firm’s fuel inputs. Its jet fuel is blended from used cooking oil, animal fats and other wastes and residues. But Neste declined to say what percentage of the jet fuel mix is made up by palm fatty acid distillates (PFADs), citing “contractual and competitive reasons.” PFADs are considered a byproduct of palm oil refining by the UK, Germany and most EU countries, but not by Finland. T&E argues that it is “dubious” to consider used cooking oil as sustainable when studies suggest that most EU supplies are imports from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and China. Higher EU prices for used cooking oil incentivises adulteration and EU auditors have criticised Europe’s capacity to verify the source of these imports. The use of animal fats also raises questions of agricultural methane emissions, as most fats come from industrial farming, T&E says. Coldplay’s world tour has been separately criticised for collaborating with BMW, which is providing 40 rechargeable electric vehicle batteries to power the shows. BMW is an influential lobbyist for the German car industry, according to a report by Influence Map. “Coldplay have been taken for a ride,” said Eoin Dubsky, the senior campaign manager for Sum Of Us. “BMW is lobbying to prevent the EU from setting a deadline of 2035 for vehicles to be zero emissions only and they have been able to use Coldplay.” The band’s statement said that they had approached other electric car manufacturers but “BMW were the ones that offered to help”. “We have no connection to or influence on their corporate policies,” the release continued. “We just need their batteries so that we can power our shows with renewable energy.” “We are doing our best, and always genuinely welcome suggestions as to how to do it better,” the band said. Dubsky was sympathetic to their predicament. “Not many rock bands hire in a sustainability consultant, so credit to them,” he said. “But I think that they should take greater care when doing their due diligence,” he added.",News/Environment,Coldplay labelled ‘useful idiots for greenwashing’ after deal with oil company,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/coldplay-labelled-useful-idiots-for-greenwashing-after-deal-with-oil-company
5/11/2022,"A mechanism allowing universal credit payments to be cut by up to 25% is driving people into poverty and debt, a report by the Lloyds Bank Foundation has found. Cuts to benefits are often to recoup advances given during the set-up period and to settle outstanding debts – but they are not means-tested. Here, one person tells how it has affected them: River Olivia Rose has never received the full universal credit payment that she is entitled to. “This month I got £658 – but bear in mind that £515 of that is my rent. I’m meant to get £325 a month on top of my rent but I never do,” she said. Rose, who recently got a job for the probation service but has not yet started work, made her latest universal credit claim in November last year, and took an advance of £840 to keep her going until the first payment in January. She had previously claimed benefits and has two lots of deductions made which seem to be related to past payments. One is to cover £3,000 the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said she owed for child tax credits. She says she does not know what the other is for. Each month £35 is taken to repay the advance and £46 goes towards the two “debts” – a total of £81. Last month she had done some paid work for a charity so there was a further cut in her payment. Rose’s rent includes household bills, but there is still food to buy and transport to pay for. She has to attend hospital appointments and said she had been forced to walk because she cannot afford the bus. “I have lost weight – I’ve gone from eight stone to six-and-a-half – I am wearing children’s clothes and they are too big,” she said. She has been referred to a food bank twice, but can only get one more referral before the year is out. “I have got to be really vigilant about when I use it,” she said. Rose has been through a lot. Her children do not currently live with her and cannot visit because of her housing association. She has spent time in prison. “The deductions are a huge part of keeping you in this state,” she said.",News/Society,Universal credit deductions ‘driving claimants into poverty’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/universal-credit-deductions-driving-claimants-into-poverty
5/11/2022,"Say what you like about Amber Heard – no, seriously, do. You can say that the actor took a bump of cocaine while on the stand during one of the most high-profile defamation cases of the century. You can say she stole lines from The Talented Mr Ripley and recited them in court while testifying about her relationship with fellow actor Johnny Depp. On social media, you can say both of these baseless, untrue things, and many others besides. In the past week, both of these unfounded claims have been spreading faster than wildfire. For those of you unfamiliar with the saga of Depp and Heard, bear with me: in June 2018, Depp sued News Group Newspapers – the company that publishes the Sun – after the paper alleged he was a “wife beater”. Later that year, Heard published an op-ed about sexual violence in the Washington Post (Depp wasn’t mentioned in the piece). Depp lost his libel battle against the Sun in London’s high court in November 2020, after the judge found the majority of alleged assaults made by Depp against Heard were “proved to the civil standard” (on the balance of probabilities). He is now suing the Washington Post in Fairfax, Virginia, for defamation over Heard’s op-ed. The internet has consequently turned feral. It is ironic that a defamation trial could prompt so much flagrant defamation. Constantly rolling cameras in the courtroom have allowed a complicated, intimate case to play out like a spectator sport. Endless clips of the trial have been hashed and rehashed online for a braying audience. On social media, people are saying whatever they like about Depp and Heard, with disturbing, unhinged results. One recent TikTok trend involved people making aroused facial expressions over an audio clip of Heard testifying about her alleged sexual assault by Depp (the audio clip has since been removed from the site). Another saw TikTokers acting out Heard’s abuse testimony, twisting and turning like pantomime actors in an attempt to point out supposed inconsistencies in her account. Regardless of whether an individual believes Heard’s testimony, they should believe that nothing good can come from minimising and mocking descriptions of abuse. The trial has made it clearer than ever that a culture of toxic fandom has poisoned our brains. On Etsy, fans can buy “Justice for Johnny” T-shirts and “Fuck Amber Heard” mugs. On social media, you are either Team Depp or Team Heard; very few people seem to be on the side of the justice system. Why wait to see what the judge and jury have to say, when you can easily pick a side from the comfort of your own home? For many, the case has become a source of comedy. On TikTok, cry-laughing emojis abound on courtroom clips with titles such as “Funniest witness moments so far” and “Johnny Depp funny moments part 3”. One user put a filter on footage of Heard’s testimony so that her nose protruded like Pinocchio’s. On YouTube, anyone and everyone is weighing in: a video entitled “Woodworker Attorney DEBUNKS Amber Heard’s ‘Broken Bed’ Testimony!” has more than 277,000 views. News websites have repeated unfounded claims in uncritical articles with hands-off headlines like “Viewers notice …” and “People are saying …”. Is it asking too much that we treat a sombre issue sombrely? That we don’t turn a serious and sensitive trial into content for our feeds? In an ideal world, even the most salacious celebrity court case would be covered in a dignified, respectful manner. Even the biggest, most ardent, most invested fan would put aside their hero worship while a jury deliberates if their idol sexually assaulted a woman with a liquor bottle. But fandom has never drawn the line at the courthouse door, and we are all poorer for it. Screaming fans have been filmed throwing gifts through Depp’s car windows as he departed from the Virginia courtroom. No trial should be treated like a concert or a meet-and-greet, and a court case should never be an opportunity to wave a homemade sign in a celebrity’s face. Fans need to be aware that their own behaviour around celebrity trials is under scrutiny. In theory, anyone can be sued for libel for what they write on social media (though in practice, the cases we read about involve tweets from those with high public profiles, such as TV doctors, rightwing provocateurs, and comedians). Even without the threat of a lawsuit, people need to be far more careful about what they post online. Fans may believe wholeheartedly that their idols are innocent, but serious accusations need to be taken seriously. Descriptions of abuse shouldn’t be made into jaunty comedy clips. Otherwise, we risk creating a world where people turn to TikTok videos for the final word on the truth, instead of the courts.

5/11/2022,"From a stage in the heart of Silicon Valley, London mayor Sadiq Khan called on tech companies to rein in hate speech, speaking about his own experience of abuse amplified by one of the most powerful figures on social media. He was referencing Donald Trump, who frequently used the mayor as an online punching bag, calling Khan “a stone-cold loser” and “very dumb”. Khan, whose family are from Pakistan, said the amount of racial abuse he received on social media increased by 2,000% under Trump and required him to receive police protection. “The worst thing globalization has brought to social media is the proliferation of hate speech,” said Khan, speaking at Stanford University as part of his first visit to the US since the pandemic began. Khan emphasized the power that companies have to act, saying that in the year after Twitter banned Trump over his role in inciting the attack at the US Capitol, he received “the least racial abuse of any time over five years”. Abuse directed at Khan declined by 75% in 2020, the year Trump lost the election, and a further 40% in 2021 after the ban from Twitter, according to statistics from London’s city hall. The speech came just hours after Elon Musk, who is poised to take over Twitter, announced he would allow the former US president to return to the platform. Khan stopped short of condemning Musk’s plans, saying he believes “passionately in freedom of speech” and trusts that those who lead Twitter will “make sure that you aren’t seeing messages that are inciting hatred, that are amplifying division”. “The question is whether Donald Trump has learned his lesson,” Khan said. “Everybody should be entitled to be rehabilitated. And if it’s the case that Donald Trump is going to use Twitter in a responsible way, then it’s all well and good. But if he breaks the rules, there needs to be consequences.” Musk has been vocal about his plans for Twitter after he revealed on 4 April he had become a majority stakeholder in the company and then rapidly negotiated a deal to buy the company for $44bn. He called the decision to ban Trump “morally bad” and “foolish in the extreme”. Khan called on tech companies on Tuesday to “act rationally” and introduce new algorithmic measures to preemptively crack down on hate speech and misinformation. He called the current landscape “lawless”. “On the one hand, social media, Facebook, Twitter – great,” he said. “On the other hand, [the abuse] is the consequence of a lack of control and lack of regulation.” Earlier in the day, Khan spoke from a startup funding center on how Brexit has threatened London’s standing as a growing tech hub, and said his mission in California was, in part, to encourage links between Silicon Valley and London. Khan acknowledged the UK’s decision to leave the EU threatened to erase the “huge advantages” of having a single market – one that allows free movement of goods, services and talent. “We have seen some flight, and that is one of the reasons why I’m in the USA banging the drum for London – we can’t be complacent,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. The referendum result has led many companies to flee the UK: more than 440 financial firms left the country after 2016, one 2021 study showed, and those that stayed are facing increasingly confusing fees and paperwork for international trade. However, London has attracted more international tech investment than any other global city, Khan said, citing a study from the promotional group London & Partners. From 2017 to 2021, London saw 251 US tech companies set up there, creating almost 9,000 new jobs, the same study showed. But while statistics show that the “worst fears” have not materialized, Khan said, the new landscape has underscored the need to keep pushing forward. “We have to understand post Brexit that we live in a very competitive world,” he said. “We have to show our strength is not just the tech, but the geography, higher education, and more. That attracts people to come in the first place and keeps them there as well.”",News/Politics,‘Has Trump learned his lesson?’ Sadiq Khan urges big tech to stop hate speech,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/sadiq-khan-big-tech-silicon-valley-trump
