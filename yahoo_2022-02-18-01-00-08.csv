2/18/2022,"The Felicity Ace, a cargo ship designed to transport vehicles, was reportedly evacuated Wednesday as it was in transit near the mid-Atlantic Azores Islands following reports of a fire aboard the ship, according to The Washington Post. All 22 crew members have been rescued, but the Porsches, Volkswagen, and other brand-new cars left on board, which were set to be delivered to North America, might not be so lucky. The 656-foot long ship departed from its origin port in Emden, Germany on February 10, and was set to arrive at its destination port in Davisville, Rhode Island on February 23. On February 16, the vessel let out a distress signal after a fire broke out in the cargo hold. Shortly after, a Portuguese navy patrol boat, along with four merchant vessels, responded to help with the rescue. There's an ongoing effort to bring the situation back under control, according to The Drive, though a photo taken from aboard one of the assisting merchant ships and shared by Greek publication Naftika Chronika on Wednesday shows the Felicity Ace seemingly ablaze from a distance. The Felicity Ace was built in 2005 and has a total load capacity of 17,738 tons. That translates to a maximum load of nearly 4000 vehicles—a non-insignificant amount, especially considering the market's ongoing supply shortages. When reached for comment by Road & Track, a Volkswagen spokesperson told us the company was aware of the situation and was working with local authorities and the shipping company to investigate the cause of the incident. Porsche gave the following statement to The Drive: We believe a number of our cars are among the cargo on board the ship. No further details of the specific cars affected are available at this time—we are in close contact with the shipping company and will share more information in due course. We've also reached out to the firm that owns the Felicity Ace, though we have yet to receive a response. It's unclear right now what will happen to all of the cars aboard the now-abandoned cargo ship as it continues to float through the Atlantic. Buyers waiting for their cars to be delivered have shared their concerns both on Porsche forum Rennlist and Volkswagen forum VWIDTalk, while people on 718forum.com are reportedly receiving a message from the company's ""Track Your Dream"" service notifying them the company is aware of the Felicity Ace situation, and to contact their dealer for more info. Matt Farah, Road & Track contributor and founder of The Smoking Tire, confirmed with his dealer a Porsche Boxster Spyder he recently ordered is aboard the Felicity Ace. He tweeted on Wednesday saying he planned to send the car to DeMan Motorsports to have the firm's 4.5-liter engine upgrade and shorter gearing installed. If things don't improve, though, he might not have a car at all. Not all hope is lost for the buyers of extra-special Porsches, though. Back in 2019 Porsche restarted production of the 911 GT2 RS after four of the last allocations were lost on a sunken cargo ship.

2/18/2022,"Donald Trump said in court Monday that he doesn't know anything about the Trump Organization's finances. But in a statement Tuesday, he said the Trump Organization ""has among the best real estate and other assets anywhere in the world."" The New York Attorney General's office pointed out the discrepancy ahead of a hearing Thursday. Former President Donald Trump said in a court filing Monday that he ""denies knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth"" about his company's finances. A day later, he issued a blistering 1,100-word statement in response to his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA dropping the Trump Organization as a client and claiming it could no longer stand by a decade's worth of tax documents. Trump waxed lyrical about his company's ""fantastic assets"" and said prosecutors should give consider giving Hillary Clinton the death penalty instead of investigating the Trump Organization's finances. ""My company has among the best real estate and other assets anywhere in the world, has significant amounts of cash, and has relatively very little debt, which is totally current,"" Trump said in the statement Tuesday. The discrepancy was pointed out in a court filing Wednesday from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James. Her office is set to face off against Trump in court Thursday and ask a judge to enforce a subpoena that would force him to sit for a deposition. ""It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,"" wrote Austin Thompson, a lawyer for James's office. ""But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading — let alone one day after the pleading was filed. That is what Mr. Trump has done here."" Since 2019, James has been overseeing an investigation into whether the Trump Organization broke financial laws by keeping two sets of books for property valuations in order to receive generous tax, loan, and insurance rates. It's running parallel to a criminal investigation, which James is running in tandem with the Manhattan District Attorney's office. In order to try to enforce the subpoena, James filed more than 100 pages of documents last month revealing new depths of the Trump Organization's finances. They outlined numerous ""fraudulent or misleading"" business practices. On Monday, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, both of whom James is also seeking to depose, filed arguments to try to block a subpoena as well. They similarly argued they did not have ""knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth"" regarding the attorney general's claims about the company's finances. Thompson said the claims were nonsense. ""It is not plausible that neither Mr. Trump, nor Donald Trump, Jr., has sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to Mr. Trump's relationship with the Trump Organization, the key entities that hold its assets, or the Revocable Trust,"" he wrote. ""Such denials of information can and should be treated as admissions.""

2/18/2022,"While figure skater Kamila Valieva unraveled, NBC commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir stayed on point at the Beijing Winter Olympics on Thursday. The two excoriated the Russian officials around her while offering a glimmer of sympathy for the drug-tainted 15-year-old, whose numerous mistakes dropped her from first place to fourth in the final. As they did in the short program, the broadcasters mostly kept their distance during her routine, letting Valieva’s meltdown speak for itself. They sharpened their analysis while Valieva awaited her fate from the judges. “I can’t imagine how tough this has been on Kamila and it makes me angry that the adults around her couldn’t make better decisions,” said Lipinski, who won gold at age 15 in 1998. “She’s the one now dealing with the consequences. And she’s just a teen and that’s not fair. ... That being said, she should not have been allowed to skate in this Olympic event.” Weir called it “the destruction of a young person.” As Valieva cried, Weir offered: “On a human level, I can’t imagine going through what she has been through. But that doesn’t change the fact that she should have been nowhere near this competition.” Valieva was cleared to compete despite testing positive for a banned heart medication said to boost endurance. She also disclosed taking two other heart drugs that aren’t specifically banned. The medal ceremony was to be put on hold for the women’s figure skating event if Valieva finished in the top three, but that is moot now. “Thank God,” Weir said. The Russian athlete was inconsolable. “Again, I blame the adults around her,” Lipinski said. Weir commended “all of the athletes who competed here cleanly, but it is heartbreaking.” The former Olympian said people around her “should have shielded her from this, kept her from competing here.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/18/2022,"Two people are facing criminal charges after police in Vermont say they left their child alone in a freezing car to go skiing. The Killington Police Department says it received reports of the unattended child on Tuesday, Feb. 8, at the Killington Resort, which describes itself as a “four-season destination on 3,000 acres in the heart of Vermont’s Green Mountains.” The car where the 2-year-old child was left was turned off and Killington Police told McClatchy News it was approximately 28 degrees that day. Police say they later spotted the parents’ car on a nearby road and stopped them to investigate. The pair were eventually charged with cruelty to a child, according to a news release. Police say the driver looked like she was under the influence of alcohol and was also charged with a DUI. After further investigation, police say both were found to be employees of the Killington Resort. Both accessed the loading lift gates 10 times during that day, police say. The Killington Resort did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News. “They both ultimately admitted their involvement in leaving their child alone in their vehicle while skiing,” police said. “(They) advised they checked on the child immediately after each ‘run’.” Police say both the Vermont Department of Children and Families and the New York State Department of Child Protective Services have been made aware of the situation. The parents are scheduled to appear in court at a later unspecified date, according to police. Earlier this year, a 4-year-old girl had spent about seven hours in a daycare van in Rochester, New York, after a daycare driver left her there “due to a lack of protocol,” as previously reported by McClatchy News. The girl, Makyia Artis, was only discovered after fellow children at the center were put in the vehicle to go home at the end of Jan. 7, Sara Dunbar, owner of Living Waters Childcare, told McClatchy News. She added that two daycare workers were immediately fired. The child’s grandmother, Brenda Powell, told WROC that Makyia was in the van for hours and that it was snowing all day. “The bus seats are leather, and windows had to have been covered in snow, where she couldn’t even see out because it snowed all day long. So she just slept balled up in a ball on a cold leather seat for nine hours,” Powell told the outlet.
