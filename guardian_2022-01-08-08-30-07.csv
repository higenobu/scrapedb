1/8/2022,"With at-home Covid tests running scarce during the Omicron surge, the price gouging has begun, and everyone from restaurants to pet food stores appear to be trying to cash in. Recent reporting by Vice found a Manhattan deli advertised an Abbott BinaxNOW rapid test (retail: $24) on the Seamless delivery app for $80. Meanwhile, an online-only pet store, Pet Foods by Village Farm, offered to deliver the same type of test for $50, and a liquor store was selling a “Covid fighter pack”, including rapid tests and hand sanitizer, for more than $100.  There have been reports across the country of vendors charging double or triple the normal costs of at-home Covid tests. One New York restaurant worker paid $180 for four test kits, the Los Angeles Times reported. And a Covid testing site in San Francisco’s Mission district is reportedly charging between $99 and $250 for rapid tests. Authorities have warned that this is a growing problem. In a December statement, New York attorney general Letitia James encouraged people to report price hikes. “Fraudsters are on notice that if they attempt to price gouge during this new surge, we will not hesitate to take action,” she said, adding that her office had already seen reports of test kits “being unlawfully sold for more than $40 and up to $70 per package”. A pack of two at-home rapid Covid tests should cost around $25. This week, Walmart and Kroger are raising prices for BinaxNOW rapid tests to the market price after a temporary government-mandated $14. The Biden administration has tried to alleviate the situation by announcing plans to purchase and distribute 500m free rapid tests, and said today that at-home tests will be reimbursed by insurers starting next week. But, with pharmacy shelves picked clean and lines at testing sites stretching for hours, people may be more willing to pay a premium to get tested. The situation is reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic, when the onset of Covid unleashed a wave of price gouging for personal protective equipment, such as $70 hand sanitizer and N95 masks. But how much of this is legal? According to the United States Public Interest Group, a nonprofit focusing on consumer issues, “Businesses are allowed to increase prices for critical supplies during an emergency, but they are not allowed to raise the price of products excessively to take advantage of the current pandemic.” The laws vary from state to state, but raising prices by more than 20% could be considered price gouging, the group said. In California, that number is lower. Markups of 10% may be considered price gouging. Violators are subject to fines up to $10,000 and up to one year in jail. “You should not be increasing prices during a state of emergency, as people need critical supplies to keep people safe,” said Jenn Engstrom, state director for California Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization. Engstrom suggests that those who see suspected price gouging file a complaint to their state’s attorney general – most have a phone number to call or online submission form. California expanded its definition of price gouging in 2020 to protect against the tactics seen early on in the pandemic, such as hoarding hand sanitizer and gloves to resell on Amazon. The new legislation closed a loophole in state law that prevented prosecuting new vendors, which includes these online resellers. “No one should be ripped off, especially on critical supplies during a pandemic,” Engstrom said, “and price gouging of Covid-19 tests is totally profiteering and shouldn’t be tolerated.”",News/World news,Rapid at-home Covid tests going for $80 in US amid the Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/covid-rapid-test-price-gouging-omicron
1/8/2022,"Antonio Conte will continue to deliver uncomfortable truths to his Tottenham players because “with good lies, you don’t have a long time to live”. The manager, who has lost Son Heung-min to a muscle injury for the remainder of the month, poured out his frustrations after Wednesday’s dismal 2-0 Carabao Cup semi-final, first-leg defeat at Chelsea. Conte said the tie had highlighted how far Spurs were from the top level and added that “there is not only a problem of mentality here”, pointing out how Chelsea had invested heavily last summer on the back of winning the Champions League. “This is enough to understand the difference at this moment between us and them,” he said.  Conte wants to strengthen his squad this month and he has a strong interest in Wolves’ Adama Traoré, who can play at right wing-back or further forward on the flank. He also likes the Brighton right-sided player Tariq Lamptey, although the 21-year-old could prove to be too expensive. Conte is focused on drawing the best from his existing players, based in part on a man-management approach of brutal honesty. “When I was a player I hated the coach that told me good lies to keep me calm and in a good relationship,” Conte said. “If players want to improve, it’s important they listen every time to the truth. I was very clear after Chelsea. It was not only the tactical aspect but also the mentality. “After a loss, you can learn more than after a win and my players know very well that I’ll tell them always the truth because with the truth you can improve. With good lies, you don’t have a long time to live.” Son felt a reaction in a leg muscle after the Chelsea game and Conte said the player would not train before the winter break which begins on 24 January. It means Son will miss Sunday’s FA Cup home tie against Morecambe, the return leg against Chelsea and Premier League matches against Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea. Harry Kane will be rested against Morecambe after playing six times in 17 days and Dele Alli is set to start in a heavily rotated line-up. Spurs are open to moving on a number of players, including Matt Doherty, Joe Rodon, Alli and Steven Bergwijn. Rodon, an £11m signing from Swansea in October 2020, is more likely to be loaned than sold.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte vows to deliver harsh truths to Tottenham players,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/antonio-conte-vows-to-deliver-harsh-truths-to-tottenham-players
1/8/2022,"Arsenal will let Mikel Arteta spend significantly to improve his squad in this transfer window if the right players become available, but they face a battle to land the Fiorentina forward Dusan Vlahovic.  Arteta wants a midfielder and a striker, with depth in the former position a priority after Ainsley Maitland-Niles was allowed to join Roma on loan for the rest of the season. The addition of Vlahovic, a hugely sought-after centre-forward who has scored 16 goals in Serie A this season, would be a more extravagant flexing of Arsenal’s muscles and they are making efforts to exploit the Serb’s precarious situation in Italy. Vlahovic has rejected an extension to his contract, which expires in 2023, and Fiorentina will need to cash in on their prize asset before next season. Interest in Vlahovic from Europe’s wealthier clubs is significant and, even if Arsenal put together a viable package this month, they would face several obstacles in completing a potentially complicated deal. One of them is that Vlahovic would need persuading to join a club in their fifth season without Champions League football, although they are fourth in the Premier League and poised to push hard for a return to Europe’s elite competition. Asked on Friday whether Arsenal would try to close a deal for someone of Vlahovic’s standing in the current window, Arteta said: “I think with the amount of things, and the way that we want to evolve the squad, we have to maximise every window in many different ways and we are alert. Edu [the sporting director] and his team are working very hard, as we know exactly what we need to do. Whether we can accomplish that in January or the summer is a different question as it is related to other stuff. “If it is the right player and we can afford it, and we can do what we want to do, we will discuss it and make the best possible decision. We are open.” Arsenal’s need for a striker has been heightened by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s exile from the squad, although the fact Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette will be able to leave for free in the summer had already made it a key position to strengthen. If necessary Arsenal can postpone an attacking arrival until the summer but it is not so simple in midfield, where Maitland-Niles’s departure and the participation of Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny at the Africa Cup of Nations mean Granit Xhaka and Albert Sambi Lokonga are the only senior players available. “We are going to move and look for options because we are very short there,” Arteta admitted, although he ruled out a short-term deal for Jack Wilshere. The former Arsenal midfielder is training at the club but, despite a clamour among sections of the fanbase, will not be signed as cover. “I think I was very clear with the situation with Jack and the role that he was going to have being around here and we continue the same way,” he said. Arsenal visit Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round on Sunday and will wear a one-off all-white kit as part of their “No More Red” initiative to combat knife crime. Any benefit from three more days’ rest after the postponement of Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg with Liverpool may be minimal. Arteta said a mixture of “Covid and injuries” would restrict his options and that his squad was “really short in numbers” but they intend to play the tie.",Sport/Football,Arsenal will let Mikel Arteta spend but face battle to land Dusan Vlahovic,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/arsenal-will-let-mikel-arteta-spend-but-face-battle-to-land-dusan-vlahovic
1/8/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has revealed that Chelsea could try to sign a right wing-back after losing Reece James to a torn hamstring. The European champions are already seeking cover at left wing-back after Ben Chilwell was ruled out for the rest of the season. James is expected to be out for at least two months, leaving César Azpilicueta as Chelsea’s only right-sided defender, and Tuchel is worried about his lack of options.  “If we play in a back five it is Azpi who replaces Reece James,” Chelsea’s manager said. “If we play a back four we may need a bit more of a defensive full-back – it is also Azpi. Maybe it is Trevoh Chalobah, but Trevoh is out with an injury. We are running out of options. If you talk about Christian Pulisic or Callum Hudson-Odoi, they can only play wing-back. It’s not their preferred position and they cannot play full-back. You lose options not only in personnel but in tactics. “I will not comment on detail in the market. We check our options and it needs to make sense. If we had a full squad I would love to answer this question and say we need nothing. But we have the issue and that’s why we look into it.” Chelsea, who host non-league Chesterfield in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, want to cover for Chilwell by ending Emerson Palmieri’s loan at Lyon. They are also monitoring Everton’s Lucas Digne and Barcelona’s Sergiño Dest. A daunting fixture list could inform the club’s recruitment. Chelsea play the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Wednesday, go to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup next month and face Lille in the last 16 of the Champions League. Chelsea, who were interested in Kieran Trippier before the right-back’s move to Newcastle, need more depth. Tuchel, who could recall the 22-year-old right-back Dujon Sterling from his loan at Blackpool, will not hesitate just because James should return soon. “If you don’t know how fast the process is for coming back you can lose a lot of matches,” the German said. “You can lose Club World Cup matches, you can lose Champions League matches, you can lose crucial Carabao Cup matches and league matches. If you are out for four or five weeks you can lose 10 or 12 matches. It can be too much.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel forced into transfer market by Reece James injury at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/thomas-tuchel-forced-into-transfer-market-by-reece-james-injury-at-chelsea
