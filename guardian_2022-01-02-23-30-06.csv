1/2/2022,"Oxfam India has said its work in the country will be imperilled by the government’s refusal to renew a licence that permits it to receive funds from abroad. Oxfam is on a list of thousands of NGOs, according to local media reports, whose licence has not been renewed. Without the licence, these organisations can only use donations and contributions from within India.  “Oxfam India will reach out to the Ministry of Home Affairs and urge them to lift the funding restrictions to ensure vulnerable communities keep receiving the support they need at this critical time of the pandemic,” said the Oxfam India CEO, Amitabh Behar, in a statement. A few days ago, it emerged that Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity, which works among lepers, the dying, abandoned sick children, people with Aids and the destitute, has also been barred from receiving foreign funds. The home ministry said it had detected some ‘adverse inputs’ in the audit of its accounts. The drying up of funds is expected to have a major impact on the work of both organisations, along with many others whose licences have also not been renewed. Some donations will continue to come in from Indian philanthropists and charitable organisations but it will not cover the gigantic shortfall. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party has been waging a campaign against NGOs and social activists, particularly those working among the rural poor, forest dwellers, the low castes, and the marginalised and on issues of inequality. BJP leaders including the prime minister, Narendra Modi, have derided social activists as ‘anti-nationals’ and ‘urban naxalites’ (a reference to revolutionaries fighting in the jungles of India to overthrow the state). They have also accused some NGOs of having links with extremist groups. Analysts say the government sees NGOs, which by the very nature of their work speak out on its policies and human rights record, as a source of undesirable criticism. “It’s inevitable that given how Oxfam and the others work among the poorest of the poor, the most deprived communities, that their reports on India will not show the government in a good light. This government has always struggled to accept criticism and this taking away of foreign funds can be seen as a way of arm-twisting NGOs into acquiescence,” said political analyst Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr. The most prominent example was the government’s targeting of human rights organisation Amnesty International, which prompted Amnesty to close its offices and stop its operations last year. It took the decision after its offices were raided and its bank accounts frozen. Amnesty accused the government of a ‘witch hunt’ and of seeking revenge for its reports criticising human rights violations. Since 2014, the government has been making it harder for NGOs to function. It has altered the rules of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act under which they receive foreign contributions to make it harder for them to receive donations from abroad. In 2018, the licences of nearly 20,000 NGOs were cancelled. Nonetheless, the failure to renew the licences of such internationally known names as Oxfam and the Missionaries of Charity has come as a shock.",News/World news,Oxfam says its work in India is imperilled by ban on foreign funding,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/oxfam-says-its-work-in-india-is-imperilled-by-ban-on-foreign-funding
1/2/2022,"At the cafe that doubles-up as a newsagent in Galliano di Mugello, a medieval hamlet in Tuscany, there are no pings from mobile phones, people aimlessly browsing the internet or uploading pictures of their cappuccino to Instagram. Instead, customers read the newspaper – their main source of information on the outside world – or talk to each other. Surrounded by Tuscany’s postcard perfect cypress trees and rolling hills, Galliano di Mugello, would be a haven for those wanting a digital detox. But the absence of mobile phone coverage is a much less endearing quirk for the 1,300 or so inhabitants, who are starting to rise up against not being able to make a call, send a text or search for something on Google on their handsets.  “Look at this,” said Daniela Suggelli as she pointed to the signal strength icon on her screen. “There are no bars. It is an absolute nuisance.” Galliano di Mugello became a symbol of Italy’s digital divide after a report from the ministry of innovation and AGCOM, the communications watchdog, placed it high among the 204 areas in Italy classified in the report as a “very white zone” because of its nonexistent mobile phone coverage and patchy internet service. Although people can access the internet at home via ADSL or through the more recent arrival of fibre broadband, connection is often disrupted, especially when the weather is bad. Almost everyone has a mobile phone too, but they cannot use it when they are out and about in the hamlet. It even captured the attention of Netflix, which earlier this year used the hamlet in a trailer for the Italy promotion of The Mitchells vs the Machines, an animated comedy film about a wacky family fending off a robot apocalypse as technology takes over the world. “In Galliano di Mugello, robots will never rebel,” was the slogan for the Mitchells vs the Machines trailer, which stars some of its residents and goes on to describe the hamlet as a place unburdened by “noise, traffic, long queues … or technological problems”. While the promotion of the scenery and charms of Galliano di Mugello, which falls under the municipality of Barberino di Mugello, was embraced, the publicity generated by the trailer also presented the ideal opportunity for the mayor, Giampiero Mongatti, to revive his battle to get the hamlet online. Bridging the digital divide is a top priority for prime minister Mario Draghi’s government, with a significant proportion of the more than €200bn (£170bn) that Italy is receiving from the EU’s post-coronavirus pandemic recovery fund set to be spent on digitalisation. “Mobile phone companies don’t invest in Galliano because they don’t think it’s worth the cost,” said Mongatti. “But with the EU recovery fund money, the government should now pay them to invest. It is true that there is a strong sense of community in Galliano and you never see people in the street staring at their phones. All of this is very nice, but at the same time citizens want to be connected and shouldn’t be treated as second-class.” Mongatti, whose office is based with the rest of the town hall in the better-connected Barberino, argued that mobile phone coverage was now a basic necessity, especially in an emergency situation. In December 2019, when the area was struck by a strong earthquake, he was unable to communicate safety procedures to people in Galliano. “We sent out a series of messages on social media, but the thing was that everyone was out on the streets and so couldn’t read the messages,” he said. “I had to send police patrols to tell people what to do.” Marika Batisti, who runs an agritourism farm, was left in a frightening situation in January after a couple of burglars entered the premises during the night. She was unable to go downstairs to use the landline to call the police, as that’s where the burglars were. So she ventured out on to the terrace, and after waving her mobile phone around for some time, managed to get enough signal to make the call. “It was a nightmare, not even the internet was working,” she said. “It’s essential now for security – how are we supposed to call the police or an ambulance if something happens?” The bad internet connection also proved to be an issue when students had to follow online lessons at home during coronavirus lockdowns, with some being forced to take their handsets to the car park of a restaurant perched on a nearby hill, from where a signal can sometimes be found. “We need the internet for everything nowadays, even to book our Covid-19 vaccines,” said Suggelli. “Although I’m a pensioner, and so the problems don’t affect me so much … but what about people who need it for work or study?” Suggelli tried to put the Guardian in touch with a young female inhabitant to interview, and popped into the butchers, owned by Andrea Guasti, to ask to borrow his landline. “I can’t get through,” said Suggelli. “She probably has no reception – you see the issues it causes?” Guasti, one of the stars of the Netflix trailer, is used to people asking to borrow his phone. “I have a landline here and at home, as well as a mobile phone, which makes everything very costly,” he said. Mongatti said the thing that makes Galliano stand out from other towns or villages with no or precarious internet access is its sizeable population. Neither is it remote – Galliano lies close to the Apennine mountains and is just an hour away from Florence. The area is popular with hikers and even featured in a video for the Madonna song, Turn Up the Radio. But Mongatti refuses to promote it as a holiday destination for those seeking to detox. “When I went to the beach for 15 days in the summer, I turned off my phone,” he said. “But the true liberty isn’t about not having a signal, but about being able to choose when to switch off. And we need to give the citizens of Galliano that choice.”",News/World news,The Italian hamlet that gives a glimpse of life before the web ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/the-italian-hamlet-that-gives-a-glimpse-of-life-before-the-web
1/2/2022,"Once again we start a new year with the country in the grip of Covid-19. But as 2022 dawns, the UK should have been better prepared for the disruption of a new variant.  In March 2020, the TUC and unions pressed the chancellor to adopt our detailed proposals for a furlough scheme – an emergency response to the first wave of the pandemic. It was a huge success – protecting millions of jobs, keeping businesses open, making the reopening smoother and quicker and making sure families all over the UK could pay their bills. Now, as we face Omicron, we’re having the same old argument about whether government should step in and protect working people’s livelihoods in a crisis. It’s been clear for months that the UK needs a permanent short-time working scheme, learning from the success of furlough, to protect jobs during periods of economic turbulence. Such schemes are common across Europe and help keep businesses afloat when there is a sudden temporary collapse in demand. But ministers have chosen not to listen. After cutting off furlough prematurely in the autumn, the government watched as Omicron hammered our arts, hospitality and aviation sectors in the run-up to Christmas. While the chancellor’s 11-hour rescue package for pubs, restaurants and theatres will help some, serious damage has already been done to pay packets and to livelihoods. We need to end this stop-start approach to managing our economy. Businesses and working families shouldn’t be put through an emotional rollercoaster every time the pandemic flares up. They need financial certainty and stability so that when better times return our economy can bounce back fast. Having a permanent short-time working scheme in place, conditional on upskilling and retraining, will ensure that if new restrictions have to be imposed again there is support ready to go. But we can’t stop there. We need to build an economy that can help working families face the future with confidence. There are huge challenges on the horizon. Alongside Covid, climate change is already causing global chaos and threatening jobs in energy intensive industries like steel and manufacturing. The longer we put off getting to net zero, the more jobs will be put at risk. And let’s not forget the looming cost-of-living storm. The last 11 years have been the worst period for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. And this has come at a huge cost to people’s living standards. Over half of families in poverty today are working families. And many of our key workers – keeping hospitals and public services running – are still earning less in real terms than in 2010. It’s a national disgrace. Without action, the pressure on UK household budgets will only get worse in 2022. This spring, working families face a triple whammy of skyrocketing bills, cuts to universal credit and a hike in national insurance contributions. We urgently need a long-term economic plan for getting wages rising. And the best way to start is by getting more workers covered by collective agreements, sector-by-sector – so they can negotiate a fair pay rise with employers. Giving trade unions greater access to workplaces is the key to boosting pay and employment standards across the country. And it’s not just me saying this. The OECD and governments across the world, from America to New Zealand, have recognised the key role collective bargaining can play in reducing inequality and giving people security at work. Committing to industry-wide fair pay agreements would transform the lives of millions by setting minimum standards – on pay, training, health and safety – and prevent good employers from being undercut by the bad. And fair pay agreements would help ease staffing shortages in under-pressure sectors like logistics, food production and social care, by making those industries better places to work in. Whether they can boost living standards and working conditions is the acid test of the government’s levelling up agenda. Alongside campaigning for a pay rise for working people, we are still waiting for the employment bill Boris Johnson promised over two years ago. Tackling insecure work, outlawing fire and rehire and banning zero-hours contracts – all are long overdue. As too is fixing our broken sick pay system. It beggars belief that we are heading into another wave of the pandemic with millions unable to afford to self-isolate. This year is a crossroads. Beset by pandemics and climate chaos, we can keep reeling from crisis to crisis, unleashing rampant insecurity and inequality anew. Or we can harness the power of active government – in partnership with unions and employers – to create a fairer and more resilient economy. In this age of anxiety, working people are crying out for security. That is my wish for 2022.

1/2/2022,"Although she will be best remembered for playing the naive Rose Nylund in the hit comedy The Golden Girls (1985-92), Betty White, who has died aged 99, was for seven decades one of the best-loved performers on US television, a consummate professional who won eight Emmy awards, the first and last separated by more than 60 years. She was also a pioneer, in the 1950s one of the first women producing television, and, 30 years later, the first female game show host, dubbed a “femcee”. All four lead actors on The Golden Girls won best actress Emmys, but White’s came first, in 1986. This may be because she played against type; Rose was the opposite of her role on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, as Sue Ann Nivens (1973-77), who hid her conniving nature beneath a sugary surface, while performing as the Happy Homemaker at the TV station where Mary worked.  From 1983 to 1986 White and Rue McClanahan played together in Mama’s Family, a spinoff from the Carol Burnett Show; when they left to join The Golden Girls, McClanahan, who had been the naive foil to Bea Arthur on Maude, was cast as Rose, with White set to play the man-chasing Blanche. The director Jay Sandrich suggested the two should swap parts, and the chemistry was immediately successful. Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Betty moved with her parents, Horace White, an engineer, and Tess (nee Cachikis), to Los Angeles during the Depression, and graduated in 1939 from Beverly Hills high school; her colleagues in school theatre included the future film star Rhonda Fleming. She performed on an experimental Los Angeles television channel that year, but made her formal acting debut at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre. During the second world war she served in the Women’s Voluntary Services, making her movie debut in Time to Kill (1945), a short produced to inform servicemen about military educational programmes; the cast included Jackie Cooper, George Reeves (later TV’s first Superman), DeForest Kelley (later Bones on Star Trek) and Barry Nelson. She also was married, briefly, to Dick Barker, an Air Corps pilot. After parts in radio shows such as Archie and the Great Gildersleeve, she got her own local programme, the first of four Betty White shows in which she would star. In 1947 she married the agent Lane Allen; they divorced in 1949. That year another local radio star, Al Jarvis, was presenting a variety show called Hollywood On Television, and hired White as his “girl Friday”, playing records and doing commercials and interviews. When Jarvis left the show in 1952, White took over as the host. She also joined the writer George Tibbles and producer Don Fedderson in a production company, trying to create shows from the sketches in which she acted on her programme. Life With Elizabeth debuted in 1952, and, syndicated around the country, became an immediate hit, winning White her first Emmy. As a co-producer, White followed Lucille Ball, but it could be argued she had more creative control over her product than Lucy did in Desilu. Life With Elizabeth ran until 1955; during 1954, White simultaneously presented her own variety show, her second Betty White show. She created another sitcom, Date With the Angels, in 1957; when her co-star Bill Williams left in 1958, it too became The Betty White Show before it was cancelled. White turned to game shows and late-night talk, particularly as a frequent guest on Jack Paar’s show, a forerunner of The Tonight Show, and a regular on Password, with whose host, Allen Ludden, she had acted in summer stock. Ludden also hosted the GE College Bowl, from which University Challenge took its format. White and Ludden were married from 1961 until his death in 1981. In 1962 she made her feature film debut, playing a senator in Advise and Consent, but although she turned in a solid performance, it would be 36 years before White returned to the big screen. In the meantime, her friendship with Password’s creator, Bob Stewart, and its producers, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, kept her busy on their other shows, such as What’s My Line?, To Tell the Truth, and Password’s many successors. She remained in demand as a guest star, and in 1971 produced and hosted a syndicated show featuring interviews with celebrities and their pets, called The Pet Set. Her career was reborn in 1973 when she debuted as Sue Ann in the Mary Tyler Moore Show’s third season, hired because she and Ludden were friendly with the show’s producer Grant Tinker, who saw that the script called for Sue Ann to be played by “an icky-sweet Betty White type”. She won Emmys as best supporting actress in 1975 and 1976. When the show ended in 1977, she began her fourth Betty White show, a sitcom which co-starred John Hillerman, but lasted only one season. She acted in a number of TV movies before, in 1983 , becoming the first woman to host a game show with Just Men!, in which a panel of men helped women win cars. She picked up a daytime Emmy, her fourth overall. She had a recurring role on The Love Boat before making her mark again in Mama’s Family, which led to The Golden Girls. With the show’s success White published her first memoir, Betty White In Person (1987). When Bea Arthur left The Golden Girls in 1992, the other three leads continued in The Golden Palace for two seasons. White showed no signs of slowing down, as indicated by the title of her second book, Here I Go Again: My Life In Television (1995). She took a part in the Marie Osmond series Maybe This Time (1995-96) and was busier than ever as a guest, winning her sixth Emmy as best guest-star on The John LaRoquette Show (1996). In 1999 she began two seasons of playing mother to a single father (Alfred Molina) in Ladies Man. She appeared as Catherine Piper in David E Kelley’s series The Practice and its spin off, Boston Legal, and in 2006 made her soap opera debut on The Bold and the Beautiful, as the mother of the show’s matriarch. She proved so popular her role was extended for three seasons, until 2009. She began another TV sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, in 2010, at the age of 88, and it ran for five series. She won a Primetime Emmy for this appearance and in 2015 an Emmy lifetime achievement award.” Meanwhile she returned to the big screen in Dennis the Menace Strikes Again (1998). Among the films that followed, her best roles were in Lake Placid (1999) and The Proposal (2009). In 2010, after a Facebook campaign, she became the oldest person to host Saturday Night Live, quipping that at her age she contacted old friends not with Facebook but with a ouija board. Outside the entertainment industry, she was active in animal charities and the Los Angeles Zoo - Betty and Friends: My Life at the Zoo, was published in 2011. She told the Chicago Sun-Times that, as well as for her acting, “I also want to be remembered as a lady who helped the animals.”  Betty Marion White, actor and producer, born 17 January 1922; died 31 December 2021",Arts/Television & radio,Betty White obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/02/betty-white-obituary
1/2/2022,"This year promises to be an important one for space exploration, with several major programmes reaching the launch pad over the next 12 months. The US is to return to the moon, undertaking a set of missions intended to establish a lunar colony there in a few years. China is expected to complete its Tiangong space station while Europe and Russia will attempt to land spacecraft on Mars, having failed at every previous attempt. India, South Korea and Japan are also scheduled to put a number of missions into space.  Particular interest is going to focus on Nasa’s mighty new space launch system (SLS). This is the most powerful rocket it has ever designed and has been built to carry astronauts to the moon and beyond as part of the agency’s Artemis deep space exploration programme. With these missions, Nasa intends to reopen the solar system to investigation by humans – rather than robot probes – and regularly carry astronauts to the lunar surface. The programme’s first launch is scheduled for February when an SLS rocket – standing more than 300ft high – will carry an unmanned Orion capsule on a trajectory that will enter a highly elliptical orbit round the moon. At its closest, the spaceship will sweep within 62 miles of the lunar surface before soaring 40,000 miles above it, a distance that will take it further from Earth than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown. Crucially, Orion – designed to carry between four and six astronauts when fully operational – will be fitted with a European service module that will provide the capsule’s power and propulsion for manoeuvring in orbit. This will give its manufacturer – the European Space Agency – the opportunity to become a key partner in future Artemis missions. If February’s mission succeeds, a crewed trip around the moon will take place in 2024 and this will be followed by a lunar landing in 2025 – a gap of 53 years since Apollo 17, the last crewed moon mission, touched down on the Taurus-Littrow valley in December 1972. This time the crew will include at least one woman and the mission will mark the beginning of a programme aimed at establishing a lunar colony where astronauts would work on months-long missions and develop technologies that could be used by future colonies on Mars. A prime target for the first lunar outpost is Shackleton crater, near the moon’s south pole, which is believed to hold reservoirs of ice. Water will not only provide precious sustenance for astronauts, it can be exploited as a source of hydrogen and oxygen – by electrolysis – that can be combined as rocket fuel. As part of its preparations to establish a lunar colony, Nasa will also start a massive programme of robot missions through the agency’s $2.6bn commercial lunar payload services (CLPS) initiative. This will involve sending a flotilla of robot spacecraft to the moon, with the first missions beginning this year. Built by private companies with Nasa backing, these probes will attempt to map underground water deposits, study the moon’s deep interior and release robot rovers to investigate the lunar surface. Fledgling space company Astrobotic will send its newly designed Peregrine lander to Lacus Mortis – “the lake of death” – a plain of basaltic rock in the north-eastern part of the moon. It will carry 11 different payloads of instruments and will be followed by another US company, Intuitive Machines, which is sending a spacecraft carrying six payloads to Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms. A further 12 CLPS missions are scheduled for the next three years, though head of Nasa science, Thomas Zurbuchen, has warned that these privately funded efforts each face a high risk of failure. As many as half could go wrong, he said recently. For good measure, Russia and India are both planning to launch their own lunar landers next year, while South Korea is scheduled to place a satellite in moon orbit to study its mineral composition. The hunt for alien life will take a step further this year with the launch of the joint European-Russian ExoMars mission, which will land a robot rover on the Oxia Planum, a 125-mile-wide clay-bearing plain in the planet’s northern hemisphere. The rover – named after Rosalind Franklin, the British chemist and DNA pioneer – will be fitted with a drill capable of probing several feet below the Martian surface, where it is hoped primitive lifeforms may survive or at least the remnants of extinct organisms. The 660lb rover was built by Airbus Defence and Space, at the company’s UK facility in Stevenage. Launch is scheduled for 22 September and touchdown is expected on 10 June 2023. Hopes of success for the mission are guarded, however, as neither Russia nor Europe has had any luck in landing on Mars. Nineteen Russian and Soviet missions and two European bids to land on the red planet have all failed – including Europe’s Schiaparelli lander, which was intended to be a trial run for the current ExoMars mission but which crashed on the planet in 2016. Easily the most spectacular mission to the asteroids will be Nasa’s bid to test an anti-asteroid defence system for Earth. Launched last year, the double asteroid redirection test (Dart) spacecraft will crash into the moonlet Dimorphos in September. Hurtling into its target at 15,000mph, the 1,340lb probe – the size of a small car – will try to change the orbit of Dimorphos, a lump of rock the size of a football stadium, around its parent asteroid, Didymos. If successful, Nasa and other space agencies will be encouraged to follow up the mission by developing craft that could deflect a larger asteroid heading towards Earth – and so avert an Armageddon-style impact, say astronomers. Should an asteroid the size of Dimorphos crash on Earth, it would trigger an explosion equivalent to 400-600 megatonnes of TNT. “A city like Manhattan would be completely obliterated,” Elena Adams, Dart’s systems engineer, told the journal Science. “This is to demonstrate a technique to save the world.” Nasa has plans for several other asteroid missions next year, including the launch of the probe Psyche. Scheduled for lift-off in August, the spacecraft will visit an asteroid called 16 Psyche that is thought to be the leftover core of a planet. This vast chunk of nickel and iron is the remains of a violent collision with another astronomical object that stripped off the planet’s outer layers and left its metallic innards exposed. Studying 16 Psyche will give scientists an unprecedented opportunity to examine a planetary core. It will also afford them a chance to explore a new type of world – one that is made of metal. Boeing will attempt to get its Starliner crew capsule into orbit so that it can begin to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). A 2019 flight failed to reach the station and another attempt last year was called off at the last minute when fuel valves failed to open. Boeing now plans to launch a crewless Starliner in early 2022, followed by a test flight with astronauts later in the year. The capsule will then be used – along with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spaceship – on a rota to ferry astronauts to the ISS. For its part, China is expected to complete its space station Tiangong – Heavenly Palace – after launching the first of its three main modules, Tianhe, in April. Modules Mengtian and Wentian will be added this year. China has said it hopes to keep its space station – which is considerably smaller than the ISS – inhabited continuously by three astronauts for at least a decade. A key task for crewmen will be to service the Xuntian space telescope, which will be launched in 2024 and which will orbit in formation with the Tiangong station. Fitted with a mirror roughly the same size as the Hubble space telescope, Xuntian’s tasks will include investigations of dark matter and dark energy as well as galaxy formation and evolution.

Cavani’s future is in doubt after Cristiano Ronaldo’s signing in the summer. The Portuguese is first-choice striker and United’s top scorer with 14 goals, his most recent coming in Thursday’s 3-1 win over Burnley. Cavani’s season has also been hampered by injury and having to quarantine for Covid. The 34-year-old has made 10 appearances, with the Uruguayan’s start against Burnley a first in the league since 30 October. Rangnick said: “We had a few conversations in the last couple of weeks – probably the player with whom I have spoken most. I told him from the first day that he is a highly important player. He is probably the only one who can play as a striker back to goal and face to goal. “His professionalism, his work ethic is amazing and I told him that I desperately want him to stay until the end of the season. He also knows how highly I rate him and respect him, and that was also the reason why I played him from the beginning together with Cristiano [against Burnley]. “He knows that I will definitely not let him go. I would rather have another Edi on top of that but for me it’s clear that Edi has to stay. With regard to the other players [leaving in the transfer window], yes, our squad is maybe a bit big with regards to numbers but we still have Covid, we have three competitions.” Rangnick wants Donny van de Beek to remain despite the Dutchman making only two league starts in 2021. “He’s got a top mentality, works hard in every training session,” the interim manager said. “A team player through and through and there will be games where he will get his chance. I also had a longer conversation with him about that and of course it’s difficult for him right now because he also wants to play for the national team. But I still believe that we should keep him, definitely until the end of this season.” United host Wolves on Monday night and Rangnick is confident Ronaldo can start a third game in eight days. “I didn’t see any reason why he shouldn’t be able to play another game,” he said.",Sport/Football,Rangnick says Edinson Cavani ‘definitely’ staying at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/rangnick-says-edinson-cavani-definitely-staying-at-manchester-united

She says that discovering the truth – that her partner, and all of the other characters created by Bhogal, did not exist – was devastating. “Imagine somebody really close to you had suddenly died, and it’s not one person, it’s all of them. I had lost everybody. Normally, even if you lose a boyfriend, your girlfriends come and look after you.” And then there is the fact that many from within Assi’s own community have chosen to not believe the story, or to ask how she could have “let it happen”. But the breathtaking extent of the con was exposed as a result of Assi’s angry determination. She remains the very opposite of the stereotype of a naive victim – she is razor sharp, witty and has an easy charm. “For me, victim shaming is a big thing in this, it’s what shuts people up,” she says. “Please focus on the perpetrator. Why did she do this?” The deception began in 2009 when Assi, a 29-year-old radio presenter on a Punjabi station, was contacted on Facebook by Bhogal’s ex-boyfriend, JJ, asking for help on how to win her back. They began to message each other, then when Assi was told JJ had died from an allergic reaction, Bhogal gave her the details for JJ’s brother, Bobby, so she could send condolences. He was someone Assi knew of from the west London Sikh community. As Assi was “getting to know” Bobby, Bhogal ingratiated herself into her life, and became her confidante as the relationship developed, and, later, went horribly wrong. After five years of messages over Messenger, Skype and WhatsApp, Assi fell in love with Bobby, and considered herself in a relationship, “after much pressure and emotional guilt tripping”, she tells me. But there were many obstacles from the outset. Bobby claimed he was in a witness protection programme having been shot in Kenya. He also apparently developed many life-threatening illnesses as a result, which meant he was stuck in hospital in New York. He was manipulative, and, despite her doubts and being told he would only live a matter of months, Assi became emotionally entrapped. “There was always an excuse why he couldn’t come to London,” says Assi. “When we tried to have a video call, he told me his phone was broken and came up with extraordinary excuses for why he couldn’t get a new one. I said, ‘I’m not turning my video on either’. That was me being angry. He would then say, ‘Just turn it on for a minute, just so I can see you,’ because he wanted to make sure I was sitting in my room.” Bobby began to exert more control over Assi, monitoring her movements and dictating her choices. “Bobby would be like, ‘Where are you? Why aren’t you at home? Why aren’t you in your room?’ I didn’t understand why I was sitting at home if he wasn’t here. It was not like me at all.” Assi tells me: “He used to test my reactions to things all the time, it was part of him torturing me. One day he asked, ‘If I joined Isis, would you come with me?’ What was I supposed to say? If I said ‘no’, he is going to pick a fight with me, but he might have a heart attack (remember his life-threatening medical condition). But saying ‘yes’ didn’t feel right either.” When Bobby was supposed to be in London, three years into their relationship, Assi became suspicious of the real reason why he still refused to see her. She discovered real Bobby’s last known address was actually in Brighton, and so confronted him there. After the horrendous events this confrontation unleashed, Assi turned to Bhogal telling her what had happened, and made the decision to report the deception to the police. “I told them, ‘I’m scared, I want something on record just in case something happens.’ [Bhogal] sat next to me and verified everything to the police.” The next day Bhogal confessed to the scam. “She said, it was me, I was Bobby, I was all of them.” But when Assi reported Bhogal to police they told her: “You’re not the victim, [the real Bobby] is.” Police have told Assi that what happened to her is not a crime, which she refuses to accept. Having won a substantial settlement in her civil case against Bhogal for harassment, misuse of private information and data protection breaches, Assi is continuing to challenge the police decision to not pursue her for coercive control, stalking and harassment. “It was a slow destruction of everything I had. Bobby targeted every part of my life – my career, my dreams, my hopes, my relationship with family, with friends, my studies,” says Assi. “I could have met someone real, had a baby during that time. But the other impact has been on my mental and physical health.” Assi is understandably upset that she is viewed as gullible by some who do not understand the lengths Bhogal went to in order to dupe her. “She could make up whatever she wanted as she was obviously stalking [the real Bobby] and his family and his wife’s family,” says Assi. There is no law against catfishing but Assi believes there should be. “Such a law would serve as a deterrent,” she says. “It’s shocking how common it is.” What does she think motivated Bhogal’s behaviour? “I think she enjoyed power; she enjoyed me being a challenge,” says Assi, who is slowly rebuilding her life. She is back on her old slot at the radio station, is working in freelance marketing, and hoping to be in a position to move out of the family home and in to her own place soon. I ask Assi how she would feel if she bumped into Bhogal. After all, they live only 20 minutes apart and share an extended family. “I don’t want to see or speak to her again for the sake of my health,” she says. “I just want her to be held accountable for her actions and to take responsibility. And if she needs help with her mental health, she should get that, too.” Sweet Bobby, a six-part podcast, is available now at Tortoise Media",News/Media,"Kirat Assi: ‘Bobby tried to destroy my hopes, my dreams, every part of my life’",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/02/kirat-assi-sweet-bobby-podcast-catfish-justice
