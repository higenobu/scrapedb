""Almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000,"" he said in an interview. Musk aims to send about a million people to create a city on Mars in coming decades. Elon Musk said that a $100,000 hypothetical price point for a ticket on his shuttles to Mars should be affordable for most people. Musk's company SpaceX plans to build a self-sustaining city on the red planet in the coming decades. In a conversation with the head of TED conferences Chris Anderson published Monday, Musk was asked about the price of a journey. Anderson asked if it could get as low as a few hundred thousand dollars. Musk said the price point would be determined partly by economics but also a need to make Mars travel affordable enough to attract around a million of the kinds of people needed to build a city on Mars. ""If moving to Mars costs, for argument's sake, $100,000, then I think almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000 and be able to go to Mars if they want,"" Musk said around minute 46. ""We want to make it available to anyone who wants to go,"" he said. The scenario Musk described seemed predicated on people selling homes and other assets to go. In the interview Musk mentioned other possible funding sources, like being sponsored by governments or taking out a loan. Musk previously ballparked a round trip to Mars between $100,000 and $500,000. â€”Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 11, 2019 In 2020, Musk said he hoped to build 1,000 of SpaceX's Starships over the course of 10 years in order to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050 to build a city on Mars, Insider previously reported.

4/19/2022,"By Philip Pullella ROME (Reuters) -A Ukrainian mayor described hours of ""hard"" interrogations when held for almost a week by Russian forces last month and said he had appealed to the pope for help to stop a war that had wrecked swathes of his city in southern Ukraine. ""It was a dangerous six days because I understood that for Russians my life and the lives of civilians were worth zero,"" Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol which is now under Russian control, said in Rome on Sunday, a month after his release. Ukraine said Fedorov was abducted on March 11 after Russian forces seized Melitopol, which lies west of the besieged city of Mariupol in a southern region that Russia seeks to control. Kyiv announced Fedorov's release in a prisoner exchange on March 16. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"", has made no comment about the mayor's detention or the prisoner swap reported by Ukraine. Fedorov, who met Pope Francis and Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin on Saturday before attending an Easter eve service, said he had asked the Vatican to intercede with Russian President Vladimir Putin to guarantee humanitarian corridors for Mariupol, which has faced devastating bombardment. Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine's 36th marine brigade which is still fighting in Mariupol, also appealed to the pope for help in a letter posted on Telegram on Monday. ""I don't have much time to describe all the horrors that I see here every day. Women with children and babies live in bunkers ... Every day the wounded die because there are no medications. No water, no food,"" he wrote. ""Help save them."" Describing his detention by Russian forces in Melitopol's police department, Fedorov said in an interview: ""They came to me at night with five or seven soldiers and spoke for about four or five hours, hard dialogue."" 'HALF MY CITY IS WRECKED' ""They wanted to make an example of me about what would happen if we did not agree to what the Russians wanted,"" the mayor told Reuters and the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero, saying he had faced ""psychological"" but not physical torture. ""Russian soldiers assumed that they would be welcomed but they were not ... and that is why the Russians were very, very angry,"" he said. ""There is no food in my city. There is no pharmacy. Half of my city is wrecked. More than 200 people have been kidnapped. It is not safe to walk the streets,"" he said. Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects what Ukraine says is evidence of atrocities, saying Kyiv has staged them to undermine peace talks. Moscow says it launched its military action almost two months ago to demilitarise Ukraine and eradicate what it calls dangerous nationalists. Seizing Melitopol, Mariupol and the southern coast would give Russian forces a land link between pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine and the Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. Russia has said it almost has full control of Mariupol. Fedorov, who said he remained in regular contact with the people of Melitopol, said he had invited the pope to visit Ukraine because ""maybe he can stop this war"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also invited the pope, promising to guarantee his security. Pope Francis has implicitly criticised Russia, calling for an end to a war that involved unjustified aggression and invasion. Addressing Fedorov and other Ukrainians in the Easter eve service, the pope said: ""Have courage, we accompany you"".

4/19/2022,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused Ukraine and an unidentified EU country of being behind a series of hoax bomb threats against Air Serbia planes. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February, more than a dozen Air Serbia flights have been forced to return to Belgrade or Moscow due to bomb threats, and Belgrade's airport was evacuated at least three times. ""Foreign (intelligence) services of two countries are doing that. One is an EU country, and Ukraine is the another one,"" Vucic said late on Sunday, without providing evidence. In a statement, Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, dismissed Vucic's remarks as ""baseless"" and ""untrue"". He also said Ukraine was disappointed with Serbia's refusal to join EU sanctions against Russia. ""We call on Belgrade to stand up for the truth and fully join in support of Ukraine and in upholding the values on which united democratic Europe is founded,"" it said. Serbia, a candidate for EU membership, is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas and oil. It refuses to impose sanctions against the Kremlin and it maintains regular flights to Moscow. ""We are continuing these flights literally out of principle, because we want to show that we are a free country and we make our own decisions,"" Vucic said. ""Do not decide for us when to cancel flights."" In recent weeks Belgrade has voted three times for UN resolutions that condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and suspended it from the main U.N. human rights body. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a special military operation to denazify the country.
