5/17/2022,"Arecurring conversation I have with a healthcare worker friend is that if you had no conscience, an easy way to make money would be to peddle innocuous but inutile items by marketing them as wellness products. Scientific language can be so impenetrable that a few vaguely therapeutic-sounding buzzwords are often enough con people into parting with their money – in the case of alkaline water, for example, or IV vitamin drips, or vitamin supplements in general. A beauty trend I have found equally amusing and bemusing is gua sha (刮痧), which has exploded in popularity recently – Google searches spiked worldwide last year. It has been described, incorrectly, in the New York Times as “a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves gliding a flat crystal over the meridians of your face with gentle pressure”. Videos with the hashtag #guasha have recently surpassed 1bn views on TikTok, the vast majority showing young women delicately sliding lopsided heart-shaped implements over their faces. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Gua sha tools have become a staple in the arsenal of facial massage implements, with the added bonus of purportedly ancient authenticity. The technique has been linked, with scant scientific basis, to a myriad of benefits: smoother skin, jaw sculpting, acne reduction, wrinkle prevention. “There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that facial massage has benefits for the skin and possibly improves some signs of ageing,” says Dr Cara McDonald, a dermatologist and director of Complete Skin Specialists in Melbourne. “Unfortunately, there are not many randomised controlled trials, which are the gold standard in scientific research to give real evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment.” Perhaps more surprising than the limited evidence for efficacy is the trend’s origin story: In traditional Chinese medicine, gua sha is not performed on the face. What it instead involves is vigorously scraping the skin of the back and shoulders, a practice that causes blotchy bruising. Soup spoons and other items such as coins are commonly used to perform the technique. The results can be so visually confronting that gua sha marks have been misidentified as physical abuse. “Gua” (刮) translates to scrape, while “sha” (痧) is a term used in traditional Chinese medicine that refers to acute disease – proponents of the technique believe it promotes blood circulation and releases “stasis” from tissues. But high-quality scientific evidence for the technique is thin, partly because it’s difficult to come up with convincing placebo treatments. One small study suggested the technique could alleviate chronic neck pain, but a research review has found “weak evidence supporting the benefits of the therapy in isolation”. In Australia, the technique is not specifically regulated. I have had gua sha done once: as the result of a near-pathological tendency to be agreeable, I accidentally assented to it during a massage without realising what it was. It felt less like self care and more like having my back mauled by a cat. It has been entertaining, then, to see gua sha appropriated by the wellness industry and parlayed into the skincare technique du jour. To be clear: the facial version of gua sha, which some have described as a “gentler form” of the technique, is a commercial fabrication. A friend told me her grandma used to perform gua sha using a porcelain spoon on her back. “Certainly not on the face,” she said, incredulously. “There has certainly been an increased awareness of gua sha over the last year or two with it trending on social media,” McDonald says. Many of her patients want to know whether it will help them fight the ageing process. “The reality is that when compared to other interventions available such as lasers, LED light and microcurrent devices, it’s unlikely to be able to compete.” The facial technique isn’t inherently harmful, even if there is little evidence for its benefits. “If you have a gua sha and enjoy using it then by all means continue to do so,” McDonald says. Facial massage more broadly can even alleviate muscular symptoms: “Firmer massage and pressure points can be used for those with significant tension in their muscles of the face, jaw and scalp,” McDonald says. “Deep sweeping pressure with the palm is also good for swelling and lymphatic drainage.” “Massage devices may be useful … particularly for those who suffer with inflammation or swelling in the face,” McDonald says, but she warns of “too much of a good thing. Excessive massage can cause skin inflammation or irritation and will have negative effects in sensitive skin types.” Gua sha facial tools have been around for a few years, but I haven’t been able to pinpoint the mercenary genius who first realised you could sell women coloured rocks to rub on their faces by dubbing it an ancient Chinese technique. As the result of extensive Googling, however, advertisements for gua sha implements – always in jade-like turquoise or pale pink “rose quartz” – will follow me around the internet until I die.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Gua sha: from blotchy bruising to a beauty trend de jour,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/17/gua-sha-from-blotchy-bruising-to-a-beauty-trend-de-jour
5/17/2022,"Elon Musk has suggested that he could seek to pay a lower price for Twitter, as the social media company’s would-be owner expressed further concerns about the presence of fake accounts on the platform. The Tesla CEO said reducing his agreed $54.20 per share offer wouldn’t be “out of the question”, days after putting the $44bn ($36bn) deal “on hold” after he queried the number of spam accounts on Twitter. Musk told the All-In Summit in Miami that the deal going through depended on Twitter’s response to his concerns about fake accounts.“It really depends on a lot of factors here,” he said in comments reported by the Financial Times. “I’m still waiting for some sort of logical explanation for the number of sort of fake or spam accounts on Twitter. And Twitter is refusing to tell us. This seems like a strange thing.” Twitter has repeatedly stated in its quarterly results over the years that fewer than 5% of its users are spam or fake accounts. Using a term that can be cited when companies want to reprice or scrap deals, Musk said it might be a “material adverse misstatement” if it emerges that Twitter’s fake or bot accounts amount to far more than 5%.“Like if you said, OK, I’m going to agree to buy your house,” he said. “You say the house has less than 5% termites. That’s an acceptable number. But if it turns out it the right per cent is 90% termites, that’s not OK.” Lawyers have questioned whether Musk can walk away from the deal – or seek a new agreement at a lower price – by focusing on the bots issue. The deal agreement includes a $1bn break fee if Musk walks away, although Twitter can also enact a clause that could force Musk to complete the deal at $54.20 per share. Twitter shares closed Monday down just over 8% at $37.39, below where the stock was just before Musk disclosed that he was Twitter‘s largest shareholder. Meanwhile, Musk’s relationship with Twitter’s management reached a new low on Monday after he tweeted a poo emoji at the platform’s chief executive. Musk was responding to a detailed Twitter thread posted by his Twitter counterpart, Parag Agrawal, explaining the company’s policy on spam accounts. Musk has disputed Twitter’s assertion that less than 5% of its users are fake or spam accounts and has said he will carry out his own audit. Agrawal explained that tackling automated spam accounts was a “dynamic” process that required fighting “sophisticated and hard to catch” actors. He added that some accounts that appear to be spam are in fact operated by real people. “The hard challenge is that many accounts which look fake superficially are actually real people. And some of the spam accounts which are actually the most dangerous – and cause the most harm to our users – can look totally legitimate on the surface,” he wrote. He added that estimating Twitter’s fake account numbers could not be done externally because the process required access to sensitive data such as IP addresses and phone numbers. Agrawal ended the thread with a link to a company blogpost on spam accounts, while revealing that Twitter had discussed how it estimated its spam number with Musk a week ago and that the company looked forward “to continuing the conversation with him”. Musk responded with a poo emoji, followed minutes later by asking how advertisers on Twitter knew what they were getting for their money. 💩 “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” he tweeted. On Saturday Musk tweeted that Twitter’s legal team had accused him of violating a non-disclosure agreement by revealing that the sample size for the social media platform’s checks on automated users was 100. Last month, Musk engaged with tweets criticizing Twitter employees, despite the entrepreneur agreeing not to “disparage” the company or its representatives while he completes the deal to acquire the social media platform. Musk’s behavior, underlined by his comments in Miami, has prompted speculation that he is laying the groundwork to reprice the deal or walk away from it, which would carry the cost of a $1bn break fee for the world’s richest man. Some experts doubt whether the multibillionaire is serious about buying the company. “I honestly don’t know if Elon wants to buy Twitter,” said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer on finance at Cornell University. “At first, I thought he wasn’t serious. Then he paired with banks and financiers and came up with a legitimate acquisition plan. Now he’s called a timeout about an issue that is both well known and should have no bearing on his future plan for the company. If it’s attention he’s seeking, he has it. But does he want to own Twitter? Did he ever?” The Associated Press contributed to this report",News/Technology,Musk says he could seek lower price for Twitter as he focuses on fake accounts,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/elon-musk-twitter-ceo-poop-emoji
5/17/2022,"Infertile men may be twice as likely to develop breast cancer than those without fertility issues, according to one of the largest ever studies of the disease. Breast cancer in males is less common than in females and its relation to infertility had previously been investigated only in small studies. The new research was published in the journal Breast Cancer Research. Experts at the Institute of Cancer Research, London (ICR) said the findings indicated further work was needed to understand the underlying causes of male breast cancer, which remain largely unknown. “These are important findings linking infertility to breast cancer in men,” said the study’s author, Dr Michael Jones, a senior staff scientist in genetics and epidemiology at the ICR. “Our study suggests that infertile men may be twice as likely as those without fertility issues to develop breast cancer. “The reasons behind this association are unclear, and there is a need to investigate the fundamental role of male fertility hormones on the risk of breast cancer in men. We hope this could lead to insights into the underlying causes of male, and possibly even female, breast cancer.” The new research from the Breast Cancer Now male breast cancer study looked at 1,998 men newly diagnosed with the disease in England and Wales over a 12-year period. It is one of the largest studies ever undertaken on male breast cancer. About 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the UK, and because male breast cancer is rare, research into the disease is usually limited to a small number of patients. Studying a larger group of men enabled the team to show a statistically significant association between infertility and risk of male breast cancer. The men were asked whether they had biological children, if they or their partners had ever experienced problems conceiving, or if they had visited a doctor or clinic for fertility concerns. Researchers directly compared the fertility of the men with breast cancer with 1,597 men with no history of the disease. While the biological reason is unclear, they discovered that men diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to report fertility issues. Scientists also found there were significantly more men with no children among those who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Dr Simon Vincent, the director of research, support and influencing at Breast Cancer Now, said: “Many people don’t realise that men can get breast cancer, because incidence is much lower in men than women. However, every year in the UK around 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer, and around 80 men die from it and it’s vital that we support anyone affected by breast cancer. “Discovering a link between infertility and male breast cancer is a step towards us understanding male breast cancer and how we could find more ways to diagnose and treat men – and possibly women – with this devastating disease.”",News/Society,"Infertile men may be twice as likely to develop breast cancer, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/infertile-men-may-be-twice-as-likely-to-develop-breast-cancer-study-suggests
5/17/2022,"The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant. The troops have fulfilled their combat mission, the general staff of the armed forces said. Ukraine’s deputy defense minister has said an “exchange procedure will take place” to bring evacuees home. Ukraine’s Joint Forces Task Force said on Monday that 20 civilians, including a child, were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”. The Russian leader is reportedly so personally involved he is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas. Ukrainian officials claimed that Ukrainian troops in the country’s north-east had pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia. Ukrainian forces in the east of the country could be slowed by Russia’s ally Belarus, which is mobilising special forces along Ukraine’s northern border, British intelligence has warned. Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. After Sweden and Finland yesterday confirmed plans to join Nato, Sweden is seeking to quell Turkish opposition by sending diplomats to the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Turkey will not approve the bids, and that delegations from the countries should not bother coming. Vladimir Putin said Russia had no issue with Finland and Sweden, but that the expansion of military infrastructure on their territory would demand a reaction from Moscow, as the Nordic countries move closer to joining Nato, which Russia has branded a mistake with far-reaching consequences. Hungary has been accused of “holding the EU hostage” over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin’s ability to wage war. American fast-food giant McDonald’s will exit the Russian market and sell its business in the increasingly isolated country, the company said on Monday.

5/17/2022,"A mobile phone app has been launched that will help social media users to detect fake profiles and speed up their removal. The Think Before You Link app will help people to spot characteristics of fraudulent profiles used by spies and other malicious actors, according to the Cabinet Office and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. Last year MI5 warned that at least 10,000 people in the UK had been approached by spies posing behind fake profiles on LinkedIn with the intention of obtaining and sharing secret information in the last five years. The government has said that more than 10,000 people in the UK had been targeted on LinkedIn and Facebook in the last year. The director general of MI5, Ken McCallum, said malicious profiles were being used on an “industrial scale”. Current and former civil servants are often attractive targets because of their experience, and can be sent fake offers of consultancy work if they connect with unknown users. Research by the University of Portsmouth has indicated that the threat of “economic espionage” is often forgotten by users, who are more aware of the chances of trolling and fraud – but 75% of people say they have received requests from profiles they find suspicious. The app has been developed in cooperation with behavioural scientists, and includes features such as a profile reviewer, which will help users identify fake profiles and report anything suspicious. McCallum said: “MI5 has seen over 10,000 disguised approaches on professional networking sites from foreign spies to people up and down the UK. Foreign spies are actively working to build relationships with those working in government, in high-tech business and in academia.” Steve Barclay, the lead government minister for cyber security, said: “The online threat via social media is increasing, with fake profiles on sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook being created on an industrial scale. “Many of these profiles are established as an elaborate ruse for eliciting details from either officials or members of the public who may have access to information relating to our national security. “It is therefore crucial that we do all we can to protect ourselves and our information, ensuring those who we connect with online are who they say they are. This new app will be an important tool in that endeavour.”",News/Technology,‘Think Before You Link’: app launched to help social media users detect fake profiles,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/17/think-before-you-link-app-launched-to-help-social-media-users-detect-fake-profiles
5/17/2022,"Hard-up families are skipping meals, wearing coats indoors to stay warm, and living in the dark because they can’t afford to switch on the lights, according to a leading children’s charity. Action for Children said in one case a boy it worked with had been off school with sore feet caused by chilblains. The boy told charity workers that the house was cold all the time because the heating was not on, and he and his siblings were wearing coats inside and sharing beds at night to keep warm. In another case, a parent told charity workers she would take her toddler to bed with their tea when they got back from nursery “just to keep warm”. Other clients described being unable to afford school uniforms, struggling to afford food, and trying to heat a room with a single gas hob. Current levels of severe and persistent hardship among families supported by the charity’s children’s centres, triggered by cuts to universal credit and rising energy bills, were among the worst it could remember, said Action for Children’s director of policy, Imran Hussain. “The worst pain and misery of the cost of living crisis is being felt by children in low-income families, yet the government is refusing to target help for these children or accept that it needs to rethink its huge cut to universal credit,” he said. Ministers have refused to commit to extra direct help for families despite an average annual £700 rise in household fuel costs since April, and rising food insecurity. Families face the fastest fall in living standards this year since the 1950s, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. A children’s hardship fund set up by the charity two years ago to provide one-off help to struggling families during the pandemic has evolved into a “permanent crisis fund” helping thousands of families, it said. Since October it has helped almost 2,500 families with grants of about £250 each, half of which were spent on food. Leanne, a mother of two and finance officer from the West Country, said she had needed food vouchers from the Action for Children crisis fund because she could not keep up with rising food and energy costs. “It was a struggle anyway, but things are now so much worse … A lot of people think that food banks are just for people who don’t work, but people who work like me need them now,” she said. Analysis of the crisis fund showed that half of families accessing it for help reported stress, anxiety or mental health concerns among the adults or children. One in five applications highlighted the £20 cut in universal credit last October as a trigger for the families’ difficulties. Iceland Foods Charitable Foundation, which has donated £300,000 to the fund since November, said that while it was “thrilled” to help there were limits to its philanthropic work. It said government “especially” had a key role to play in offering a lifeline to families in crisis. Paul Dhaliwal, the trading director of Iceland Foods and a trustee of the foundation, said: “We know that lots of our customers are facing real hardship. Many were badly impacted by the pandemic, and the soaring cost of living has only added to their difficulties.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending £22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. “For the hardest hit, we’re putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and our household support fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials.”",News/Society,"Poor families skipping meals and unable to afford heating, charity says ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/poverty-families-cost-of-living-crisis-action-for-children
5/17/2022,"Women with invasive breast cancer could be injected with a magnetic marker liquid to tell doctors if their disease has spread, according to a recommendation by the government’s health advisers. The substance, called Magtrace, has been shown to locate the presence of sentinel lymph nodes, which show if the cancer has progressed beyond the breast. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which advises ministers and the NHS on which treatments represent value for money in England and Wales, has issued draft guidance endorsing the use of Magtrace in conjunction with a probe called Sentimag. Magtrace is a non-radioactive brown liquid that acts as a magnetic marker and visual dye. It is injected into the tissue around a cancerous tumour in the breast. Particles are absorbed into the lymphatic system, follow the route that cancer cells are most likely to take when they spread from the original site of the disease and become trapped in sentinel lymph nodes. Once inside the patient, its progress is tracked using the Sentimag probe. It emits sounds of different pitches as it moves over the skin when it passes over the Magtrace, similar to the way a metal detector locates metal objects in the ground.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Once the sentinel lymph node has been located, surgeons remove it and undertake a biopsy during which a pathologist checks if any signs of cancer are present. If so, they may carry out further surgery to remove more lymph nodes. Nice has recommended the procedure as an alternative to the existing way of identifying breast cancer that has spread, which involves the injection of radioactive isotopes and a blue dye. “People with breast cancer want to know if their cancer has been isolated or has spread to the rest of their body. The earlier this is established, the better the potential outcomes will be,” said Jeanette Kusel, Nice’s acting director for medical technology and digital. The agency said adoption of the system would help the NHS reduce its reliance on radioactive isotopes, which are imported, and enable any hospital to offer it, not just those with nuclear medicine facilities to use isotopes, which may make care more convenient for patients. The health and social care secretary welcomed Nice’s decision.“This promising research could provide a new tool for our scientists to track and slow the spread of breast cancer, the most common cancer in the UK,” Sajid Javid said.“We are always on the lookout for innovative treatments to speed up diagnosis and improve survival rates and we will outline more in our 10-year cancer plan, due this summer”.” But Nice warned Magtrace could produce side-effects and adverse events. These include the staining of a patient’s skin and their ability to have an MRI scan in future, and “so use of Magtrace should be considered carefully for people who are likely to need follow-up MRI studies”.",News/Society,Magnetic marker liquid could be used to show if breast cancer has spread ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/magnetic-marker-liquid-breast-cancer-spread-nice-magtrace
5/17/2022,"A seething Granit Xhaka laid into his Arsenal teammates after their disastrous defeat at Newcastle and said they did not “have the balls to play” as their Champions League hopes all but disappeared. Arsenal must beat Everton on Sunday and hope Tottenham lose at relegated Norwich if they are to make the top four; they were soundly beaten at St James’ Park by a Ben White own goal and a late clincher from Bruno Guimarães, and Xhaka’s extraordinary intervention was almost certainly born of frustration at letting a golden opportunity slip. “From the first minute to the 90th we didn’t deserve to be on the pitch today,” Xhaka said. “What happened was a disaster performance and like this you don’t deserve to play Champions League, you don’t even deserve to play Europa League. It’s very hard to take at the moment. I don’t know why we’re not doing what the coaches ask for. “If someone isn’t ready for this game, stay at home. It doesn’t matter the age. If you’re not ready or you’re nervous, stay on the bench, stay at home, don’t come here. We need people to have the balls to come here and play. We knew this game was maybe the most important for us but, with a performance like this, it’s not acceptable.” Arteta’s outlook was no sunnier and the manager admitted his side had never got started. “Normally I sit here and I can defend [the team],” he said. “Today Newcastle were 100 times better than us in every department from beginning to end and it is very hard to accept it. We didn’t cope, we didn’t compete. We never got into the game. We put ourselves in trouble, we lost every duel. Newcastle deserved to win the game, probably by a bigger margin.” He stopped short of saying he felt let down by his side, which has been stretched to the bare bones by injury. “No, I am the maximum responsible,” he said. “If someone has created an expectation this year, it is those players and I will always defend them. But [tonight] that is a really difficult thing to do.” Eddie Howe could bask in a performance he called “our best by some distance since I was at the club” and a first win over top-six opposition for Newcastle this season. “It’s a step forward, definitely,” he said. “I think you saw a progression and evolution to how we played.”",Sport/Football,Granit Xhaka claims some Arsenal teammates lack ‘balls to play’ after loss,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/granit-xhaka-rages-at-arsenal-teammates-for-disaster-performance
5/17/2022,"The families of two young men with disabilities who were abused by a carer have told an inquiry they never received a formal apology or compensation from the provider. The disability royal commission on Monday began a five-day examination of the programs offered by Afford, a large national disability insurance scheme provider with several services in New South Wales, as well as other states. The inquiry is looking at the experiences of three men with disability – known to the commission as Jason, Simon and Toby* – at a day program run by Afford in western Sydney. It heard two of the men, 24-year-old Jason, who is autistic and has an intellectual disability, and Toby, 22, were among a number of men abused by a lifestyle support worker employed by Afford. After police found images of clients taken during their personal care on the carer’s mobile phone, he was charged with offences connected to the abuse, pleaded guilty and was jailed for three years, the inquiry heard. Under questioning by counsel assisting Ben Fogarty, Jason’s mother, Sally*, said she had received an initial phone call from Afford but no formal apology or compensation. She said no funds they had spent on services were returned to them. “I felt, the day he was arrested, for Afford, [it was] ‘wash my hands of him, he’s been arrested, that’s it, we don’t need to deal with anything else’,” Sally told the hearing. Sally said the family first learned of the abuse from the police, before getting a call from the chief executive from Afford the following day. She said the chief executive apologised during the phone call and then insisted he had “stayed back late” and checked the paperwork to ensure the offending carer had been employed “properly”. “And that really stuck in my mind because I’m thinking, at this stage, I’ve just found out that my child’s been abused at the hand of one of your workers and it’s more important for you to tell me that you’ve employed him properly,” Sally said. “I was in shock … after I got off the phone I remember saying, ‘I don’t understand that phone call at all’.” Aside from taking intimate images of clients over 2019 and 2020, the carer also taunted and hit the clients. Suzie*, the mother of Toby, who lives with Down syndrome, said their family had also not received a written apology or compensation. Nor had their payments been refunded. The inquiry heard that after the carer was arrested Suzie received a short phone call in which the chief executive apologised, though she described it as “pretty perfunctory”. Suzie and Toby’s fatherwere horrified when they learned of the abuse and developed a deep mistrust of people caring for their son, the inquiry heard. Simon*, 26, received care on at least one occasion from the Afford worker. By the time man was charged, Simon was no longer receiving care from Afford. Simon’s mother Lilly* told the inquiry that Afford never informed her that the carer had been charged and she learned about it when another parent shared a news story about the case on Facebook. Lilly said Afford staff had declined to discuss the matter with her, citing privacy and confidentiality. There was no evidence Simon had been abused, but Lilly said: “It was a bit devastating and it’s always in the back of your mind – did anything happen to my child?” The inquiry heard the parents of the three men had complained about the quality of care and invoices that had been issued. Suzie withdrew Toby after the family was sent an invoice for services that did not occur because he was on holiday with his family in New Zealand. The inquiry heard that Afford had grown significantly since the rollout of the national NDIS. According to its annual report, in 2020/2021 it supported more than 6,000 clients with disability and had a yearly revenue of $145.6m after growing from only 898 clients in 2016-17. Afford will give evidence later in the week along with the NDIS watchdog.

5/17/2022,"After a season of gentle optimism, global improvement and reasons to believe, it felt as if it was all going to come down to this. The question was if Mikel Arteta’s best José Mourinho impression after the North London derby, ostentatiously avoiding explicit comment and covering for his Arsenal players by making himself the story, was to have the desired effect. In a season of the Spaniard’s team providing half-answers to many, they did it again at St James’ Park. They had the guts but they lacked the nerve required of them on a Monday night that was always going to be more challenging than some suggested. Tottenham’s follow-up win, laboriously prised from Burnley at Sunday lunchtime, had knocked the ball flush into their court. The schedule and the occasion demanded and, if ever there was a night for Arsenal to show they really had changed and were becoming a team of substance, then this was it. If they were looking for an idyllic retreat to recover from Thursday’s ordeal, though, this was never going to be it. This was not quite the bear pit they had faced (and which had initially inspired them) in N19 last week but it was not a million miles away from it as the game kicked off, in an arena brought back to its buoyant best since the late autumn exit of Mike Ashley – with a crowd ready to hail its Newcastle United side’s sharp revival in 2022 ahead of a summer full of unfamiliar optimism. The home fans chanted with insistence and the visitors could have done with some of their certainty. The suspicion was Aaron Ramsdale’s heartily-cheered slip in the opening seconds, when making his inaugural clearance of the evening, pointed the way to forthcoming mishap and Arsenal began nervily. The inclusion of Ben White and Gabriel in defence had increased pre-match optimism that they arrived in the north with poise and fortitude, even if there was a suspicion that Arteta was taking a justifiable gamble on their fitness. The creaking joints of the back four, it turned out, were elsewhere. In the early stages Takehiro Tomiyasu peered warily over his shoulder at the lurking Allan Saint-Maximin and, if he was gazing in the right direction, it was perhaps at the wrong man, as the home side exploited all sorts of space behind the right-back through an advancing Matt Targett and Callum Wilson. It was in this corridor of uncertainty that the returning White picked up an eighth-minute booking after he failed to spot the run of Wilson quickly enough and clipped him over. It was clear that Newcastle were not here to milk the acclaim gently, as a testy exchange between Wilson and Gabriel in the far corner before the 20-minute mark had emphasised. They pushed their visitors back with increasing rhythm and one wondered how Arteta might have appreciated a player of the personality of Newcastle’s newly-crowned club player of the year Joelinton in the centre of the pitch, ball-winning and driving his team forward with vigour. What Arsenal did do is defend with heart, with White clearing from in front of the line from a low Emil Krafth delivery. The early ring rust gave way to genuine resolve, even if the ability to provide threat at the other end was thin on the ground. Arsenal repelled the home side’s first-half set-pieces with courage and conviction, which was a good job as there were plenty of them to face. At the other end a couple of typically rapid bursts from Bukayo Saka were the Gunners’ best way of escaping their own half and moving up the pitch, with the England winger their sole means of attacking threat. Dan Burn’s block from a Saka cross shot was the first time that Arsenal made a truly threatening sortie into the home side’s penalty box before he again cut in and drew a save, albeit a comfortable one, from Martin Dúbravka. The Arsenal manager decided early in the second half that there was certainly not enough of the required invention with Gabriel Martinelli promptly introduced to replace the near-invisible Emile Smith Rowe, and immediately the Brazilian added some zest to his team. Yet Wilson’s opener, created by the inexorable Joelinton’s burst down the left – in the gap left by the struggling Tomiyasu, who had exited late in the first half - and craftily snaffled at the near post, snatched the momentum from under them. Arteta, a typically twitchy presence on the touchline throughout, threw the kitchen sink at it, with the introduction of Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepé leaving his team with something resembling a front five. Urgency did not equal fluency and it was the home side, arguably the worst side in the division until one of the more sensible and incisive January transfer windows in recent memory, who found the greater clarity and carried the more menace. Worse was to come when Bruno Guimarães, an erstwhile Arsenal target, heroically blocked a Martin Ødegaard shot at one end and almost immediately tucked in a second after Ramsdale had foiled the excellent Wilson. Arteta and company were sunk and, if there could be little doubt over their will, they were taught a lesson in canniness by a side still forging their own personality.",Sport/Football,Arsenal are washed away as resurgent Newcastle ride wave of fan fervour | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/nervous-arsenal-washed-away-on-tide-of-newcastle-optimism
5/17/2022,"Labour aims to put ministers on the spot over the cost of living by forcing a Commons vote on a windfall tax for North Sea energy profits, amid some signs of increasing support for the policy on Conservative benches. Before the vote, to be instigated by an amendment to the Queen’s speech on Tuesday, Labour released calculations that forecast North Sea oil and gas profits for 2022/23 would be greater than all UK households have paid in increased energy bills. The government was “simply running out of excuses” to not impose a one-off levy on profits boosted by high energy prices, money that could be channelled to help with bills, said Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy secretary. While the Labour amendment refocuses attention on an issue proving increasingly uncomfortable for ministers, and the party has had recent success with other parliamentary procedures such as humble address motions, an amendment to the Queen’s speech is highly unlikely to pass. The wider idea of the tax is nonetheless gaining some momentum among Conservatives, with public supporters including Robert Halfon, the senior backbencher who is a leading Tory voice on cost of living issues, and Mel Stride, the former minister who chairs the Commons Treasury committee. Zac Goldsmith, the peer whose ministerial role covers the environment department and Foreign Office, argued that a windfall tax would help both with reaching net-zero targets and cost-of-living pressures. Goldsmith told the Guardian that people “need something they actually feel – directly”, adding: “So many are struggling at the moment.” At least one other junior minister has told colleagues they back the idea. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is the most vehement cabinet opponent of a windfall tax. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, does not support the idea, but has indicated it could be necessary if energy firms do not sufficiently reinvest the additional money. The Labour amendment would add wording saying that MPs “respectfully regret that the Gracious Speech fails to announce a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas producers, in order to provide much needed relief from energy price increases for households”. Labour’s calculations, based on estimating future North Sea profits based on tax receipts for 2022/23 projected by the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest that total profits for the year will be £19.5bn, up from £11.75bn the year before. The 2022/23 total is less than the estimated £18.8bn cost to the UK’s 27.8m households of a price cap rise of £680. “It’s time the government dropped their threadbare excuses, did the right thing and put a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to deliver real help for families and pensioners,” Miliband said.",News/Politics,Labour to try to force Commons vote on North Sea windfall tax,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/labour-commons-north-sea-windfall-tax-cost-of-living-tory
5/17/2022,"Well played, Jake Daniels. Applause, please. And thank you for your leadership. Football, sport, male environments and, indeed, the wider world have all become slightly more sane places with the news that Daniels has decided to discuss publicly the fact that he is not only a professional footballer but a gay man. The first part of this is, of course, not remarkable. The second part is. To those unfamiliar with football’s internal workings it might seen genuinely loopy that this should even be news, that a trailblazer is required, and indeed that this should turn out to be a teenager who made his debut for Blackpool two weeks ago. But make no mistake this is both a remarkable moment for men’s professional football and a sterling show of courage from a 17‑year‑old, yet to establish himself in his industry; but unwilling, as he says, “to pretend”. For men’s football – and indeed men’s sport, professional and amateur – this is the sound of a wall being torn down. It is 32 years since Justin Fashanu became the first and until now only male British professional footballer to come out as gay, in his case via a salacious newspaper splash. Fashanu played on for seven years in various leagues, but he suffered terribly at the hands of his sport, his family and the wider public. Thomas Hitzlsperger, a Premier League player and German international, revealed in retirement that he is gay. The Australian Josh Cavallo came out last year, aged 22, and is playing regularly for Adelaide United in the A-League. Beyond this women’s sports have shown the way on this front. Openly gay players and indeed managers are a part of the everyday landscape in women’s football. The England women’s cricket team has a long-term couple in it. Men’s cricket had a flash of light when Steven Davies came out while he was still an England player 11 years ago. Davies is still going strong. But he is yet to be followed by anyone else. And this is the real significance of Daniels’s openness, and indeed why none of this should be taken lightly. It is temping to shrug and tut at football, to chide it for lagging behind the more liberated sections of society. But the fact is football does, as ever, reflect its environment. And there is a massive problem still with homophobia in Britain and the wider world, from everyday abuse and violence, to the anxiety young people might have over coming out to parents and friends, to institutional and religious intolerance. Daniels’s courage will speak to all those other footballers – and there have of course been plenty – who have lived through that narrow culture. It will provide a different model, a different version of the future for young people playing the sport now at any level. But it will have resonance beyond, too. People do need role models. The backing for Daniels from his club, the FA and the PFA is significant and not just within the sport. Yes, normal life is simply being normalised here. Slow handclap, football. What kept you? But society is not always nice or liberal or progressive. This is football using its platform in a good way. It will, of course, be far from straightforward. Daniels will face other barriers. There will be kickback and resistance, from misguided banter to genuine abuse; to moments of awkwardness and doubt, the micro-adjustments others will have to make in this deeply ritualistic male industry. Things are never as easy as we might hope. But listening to him speak it was impossible not to feel proud and also protective. It has required remarkable strength and clarity of mind to take this step aged 17. Football will now goggle a little, scratch its head and search for the right words. The best response is, as ever, support, admiration and the freedom from here just to play.",Sport/Football,"Thanks for your leadership, Jake Daniels: a gay man and professional footballer | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/16/thanks-for-your-leadership-jake-daniels-a-gay-man-and-professional-footballer
5/17/2022,"Special constables will be given access to stun guns as part of a flurry of crime initiatives, the home secretary will tell the Police Federation on Tuesday. Speaking at their conference in Manchester, Priti Patel will announce that part-time special constables will be allowed to use electroshock weapons – if properly trained and with the authorisation of chief officers. But Amnesty International UK’s policing expert warned that arming volunteer officers is “dangerous” and will inevitably lead to “more instances of misuse, serious harm and death from Tasers”. It is part of a range of measures included in “Operation Sceptre” – the name given to the government’s crime-fighting week. A controversial measure announced on Monday will allow officers to stop and search people without reasonable grounds. Police chiefs say they did not ask ministers for such changes. The government announced that changes to stop and search without suspicion, so-called section 60 stops, would now be made permanent. Section 60 stops have huge racial disproportionality, with black people 18 times more likely to be stopped than white people, according to an analysis of official figures by the Liberal Democrats. A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) told the Guardian: “While we have regular conversations with government about our powers, this was not directly asked for by the National Police Chiefs’ Council. “It is our responsibility to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities, learning from instances where we have not always got the balance right. “Section 60 powers to stop and search anyone within a designated area can be effective when there have been violent incidents or officers believe there is a high risk of violence occurring. Senior officers authorise them with the intention of saving lives and preventing people from coming to any harm. “We will work with the government to consider how any change to the powers can be used in practice, in a proportionate and consistent way. Section 60 is not a new power for policing, but this provides clarity on how the legislation can be used.” A 2021 report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary about stop and search highlighted concerns about section 60. It said: “Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are 6.7 times more likely to be searched under section 60 than white people, and black people are 18.1 times more likely. Forces need to analyse their data to understand why.” Under section 60, police can declare people in an area as being subject to searches without officers needing reasonable suspicion. Curbs were put in place in 2014 when Theresa May was home secretary. Stop and search remains a fault line between police and communities. Now police can use section 60 with the threshold changing from the belief that serious violence “will occur”, to “may occur”. But in a press release published last night, the government said restricting section 60 has “limited when officers could use the vital power and hindered their ability to rid the streets of dangerous weapons … By making it easier for the police to seize more weapons, the government is backing forces to drive down knife crime and save more lives.” Section 60 authorisations can stay in place longer, be authorised and extended by an officer of lower rank than previously, and the public do not have to be told that it has been enacted. Compared with when David Cameron and Theresa May were in power, the current Conservative government believes police should do more stops and with fewer restrictions, citing thousands of weapons taken off the streets as a result. Most people who are stopped are found to have nothing on them that is illegal. Leaked documents show that most of the public do not believe ministers’ promises to tackle crime, the Guardian reported last month. Polling carried out for the government showed that, despite fear of crime being high, few trusted ministers to be able to get to grips with it. Only one in three of those surveyed had faith it could tackle crime, its own document notes: “Current initiatives to tackle crime are not cutting through to the public – only around a third (35%) say they have confidence in the government’s handling of crime and justice, and awareness of the beating crime plan is low.”",News/UK news,Special constables to be given access to stun guns in new crime measures,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/special-constables-to-be-given-access-to-stun-guns-in-new-measures
5/17/2022,"Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah will be fit for the Champions League final, Jürgen Klopp has confirmed. The manager said the pair would miss Liverpool’s trip to Southampton on Tuesday but could return for the Premier League finale against Wolves. Liverpool’s influential defender and leading goalscorer were substituted during the FA Cup win against Chelsea with knee and groin issues respectively. Both will be absent at St Mary’s Stadium, where a Liverpool win would reduce Manchester City’s lead in the title race to one point with one game to play, but there are no concerns over their involvement against Real Madrid on 28 May. Klopp planned to rest Van Dijk at Southampton before injury intervened. Klopp, asked whether Salah or Van Dijk could feature on Tuesday, replied: “No. Virgil definitely not. That was pretty much clear before the game already. We thought this was the game [to rest him] because he played really a lot. Saturday-Tuesday again was clear. “They are both OK. The target for both would be that they could be involved again at the weekend. Properly involved. On the bench and on for a few minutes or start – we will see with that because that would be perfect for the [Madrid] game. If not, we take each day afterwards. It is very positive and we have no doubt about the Champions League final but we are pretty realistic about the Wolves game. But tomorrow, not.” Klopp has reiterated that the financial package it would take to sign Kylian Mbappé is beyond Liverpool’s means. The France international is expected to join Real Madrid when his contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires next month, although there have been reports of another club entering the race for the striker. Klopp, who tried to sign Mbappé from Monaco, insists it is not Liverpool. “Of course we are interested in Kylian Mbappé; we are not blind,” he said. “I have nothing to say about that [a reported approach] but between Kylian and Liverpool it’s all set, it’s all fine. We of course like him and if you don’t like him then you have to question yourself but, no, we are not, we cannot, be part of these battles. There must be other clubs involved and that is fine. He is a great player.” Klopp, meanwhile, has said there must be good reason why fans of the club booed Abide With Me, the Duke of Cambridge and the national anthem before the FA Cup final on Saturday. “In these situations I think it’s always best to ask the question: ‘Why do they do it? I know our people well enough that they would not do it if there was no reason. I am not here long enough to understand the reason. It’s for sure something historical, and that’s a question you can answer better than I ever could. “Our fans, and I know a few fans from other clubs see it slightly differently, the majority are wonderful people, smart and go through lows and highs, suffer together. They wouldn’t do it if there was no reason. That’s what I know. Maybe we should ask this question.” The Liverpool manager’s stance drew criticism from Boris Johnson’s official spokesman, who said there was no reason to boo the national anthem and it was a “great shame” given the FA Cup is meant to “bring people together”.",Sport/Football,Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah to miss Liverpool’s trip to Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/virgil-van-dijk-and-mohamed-salah-to-miss-liverpools-trip-to-southampton
5/17/2022,"Alan Bennett once defined a classic as a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have. For a modern bestseller, the formula needs rejigging only slightly – a book everyone feels they have read, even if they have gone out of their way to avoid it. Even if Bridget Jones’s Diary or The Da Vinci Code are not your bag, you absorb so much by osmosis that it becomes irrelevant whether or not you have scanned the pages. As such, most people know the basics of The Time Traveler’s Wife, Audrey Niffenegger’s debut that – aided by a 2009 film adaptation – has sold in its millions since it was published in 2003. A librarian called Henry has a rare genetic disorder that causes him to travel through time at random, landing dazed and naked wherever the cosmos takes him. He learns to find his feet (and some clothes) a little faster each time. In the course of his many unchronological journeys, he meets his soulmate, Clare. They are wrenched repeatedly from each other’s arms to reunite weeks, months or years later in more or less romantic scenarios, depending on their ages at the time. It is, in short, guff of a high order. But the new six‑part adaptation (Sky Atlantic) by Steven Moffat (a longtime fan of the book, which he used as inspiration for the Doctor Who episode The Girl in the Fireplace) does it proud. He takes the melodrama down a notch and salts the schmaltz with wit where he can. Nonetheless, an emetic framing device remains. Each episode opens with Clare (Rose Leslie, joyfully channelling the spark of Game of Thrones’ Ygritte, rather than the drippiness of The Good Fight’s Maia) and/or Henry (Theo James, acquitting himself well after many years paying dues in Divergent films) talking wistfully about their lives. It is an unnecessary few minutes of marking time while they say things such as: “The future is something that turns up when you’re looking for something else,” and: “For everyone else, the past is over. For me, I’m still trying to survive it.” Once the action kicks in, though, Moffatt keeps a tight hold on the reins. He allows Henry’s appearances, disappearances and reappearances to create a choppy energy rather than chaos. The great trauma of Henry’s past (and future, as he returns to the scene at various ages, always powerless to avert his mother’s fate) is unpacked, while troubles are foreshadowed from different angles and eras before they come to pass. James makes credible Henry’s evolution from brash young “asshole” – Clare’s word – to god among men, even if the camera panning mournfully across the piles of clothes he leaves behind every time he vanishes is always inescapably amusing. The feet thing – I shall say no more for fear of spoilers – raises similar issues. It is a good story, well retold, but it has two intrinsic problems to overcome – and hurdles one more successfully than the other. The first is the ick factor occasioned by Henry’s many visits as a grown man to Clare as a child. This raised eyebrows in 2003 and sensitivities have only increased since. Moffatt confronts it head-on by having Henry acknowledge the viewer’s potential discomfort (via a line from Clare about grooming her My Little Pony), but a queasiness remains inevitable. The other problem is more deep-rooted. Niffenegger’s story is built around Clare’s passivity. Her life, while not static or unfulfilled professionally, is defined by waiting for Henry. Her happiness depends on his random visits. More profoundly, her whole being and sexuality are shaped around him from the very earliest days. It reminds me more of the terrible messaging in Twilight – subsume thyself, woman! Don’t knock true love off its course by being yourself! – than an adult romance. It is slightly depressing, chiming more with the elements of society that would like women to make themselves smaller and quieter and cede space and rights to louder others than with the elements that encourage them to strike the board and cry: “No more!” I would rather a series that felt as if it was with those who want to push us forward, rather than back in time.",Arts/Television & radio,The Time Traveler’s Wife review – far too much ick factor to be truly great,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/the-time-travelers-wife-review-far-too-much-ick-factor-to-be-truly-great
5/17/2022,"At the end Mohamed Elneny, Ben White, Martin Ødegaard and Aaron Ramsdale all sank to their knees, while most of their teammates gazed vacantly with hands on hips. Mikel Arteta completed his formalities in short order before disappearing down the tunnel, knowing Arsenal’s Champions League prospects had almost certainly slipped away too. That old “Spursy” joke will be tested to the limit now: either of the north London teams could still make it but it would take a barely imaginable stumble for Tottenham to let fourth place go. What a time this was for Arteta’s players to turn out arguably their worst performance of the season. If the manager had been tempted to raid the cupboard for complaints, as he was after they were swept aside in last Thursday’s derby, then he would have found it completely bare. Arsenal simply did not turn up, wilting in another white-hot atmosphere against opponents who must wonder what 2022-23 will bring if they continue operating with this verve. St James’ Park pulsated throughout, bouncing to the tune of an entirely superior Newcastle team that could have scored several more. In fairness to Arteta, he accepted the obvious: that offerings like this are nowhere near the level required. He was downcast afterwards and that is no surprise given, for long periods of the run-in, Arsenal have been in the driving seat for a place among the elite. When the dust settles he will rightly reflect that fifth, where they will surely finish, represents admirable progress and that a young team has reinvigorated a previously torpid club. But that does not have to let off a spineless showing in which a mid-table Newcastle showed far greater hunger, appetite and quality. The suggestion after a dominant but toothless first half from the hosts was that Newcastle had expended a bucketload of energy achieving relatively little. Allan Saint-Maximin, who roasted Takehiro Tomiyasu until the right-back was withdrawn through injury, had drawn a sharp save from Aaron Ramsdale but otherwise their ferocity in the challenge and crisp certainty of their passing had wrought few clear openings. Perhaps Arsenal would gather themselves, take advantage of any lull in tempo and impose themselves during the second half. Bukayo Saka had attempted to enliven them with a couple of mildly threatening sorties but it was the thinnest of gruel. The warning signs that this would be a long night were evident from the opening moments. If Ramsdale and White are off beam then trouble generally follows. Ramsdale’s taste for brinkmanship almost got the better of him early on but, when Miguel Almirón charged down his attempt to pass out, the ball rolled away from goal; White, passed fit along with his defensive partner Gabriel Magalhaes, was booked for a tug on Callum Wilson and was uncharacteristically sloppy in possession. Ten minutes after the interval it was White who unwittingly steered things emphatically away from Arsenal. Arteta had just introduced Gabriel Martinelli in an effort to instil at least a modicum of urgency, but Newcastle surged forward yet again and Joelinton had acres of space to attack down the left. A delicious cross looked bound for Wilson and White could not be blamed for stretching every sinew to intervene; he could only succeed in sending the ball skidding past Ramsdale, though, and from there it was hard to see a way back. Arteta flung on more attackers but Arsenal could have been picked off several times after that. Ramsdale denied the substitute Jacob Murphy twice and Wilson, starting for the first time since December after recovering from injury but leading the line brilliantly, was inches off target from long range. The visitors remained unable to fashion a serious opportunity, Ødegaard having one of those games where a formidable football brain cannot compensate for a deficit of aggression while Elneny and Granit Xhaka barely competed in midfield. While Xhaka was the spokesman afterwards for Arsenal’s flop, he could certainly not claim to have risen above the mean. Newcastle finished the job when Ramsdale rushed out to thwart Wilson but could not gather and Bruno Guimarães knocked in the loose ball. Guimarães was the best player on the pitch by some way; he and Joelinton, also highly impressive, were the game’s heartbeat and fed off a din from the stands that rarely let up. The excitement here was for Newcastle’s obvious forward momentum and the fact that other players of Guimarães’ quality will surely follow him here this summer. They will be celebrated locally, to the extent that consciences allow; at full-time the co-owner Amanda Staveley congratulated Eddie Howe’s players and, joined by the new Saudi director Majed Al Sorour, lapped up the end-of-season festivities on the pitch. The evening had been about Arsenal’s shot at the Champions League but few would seriously expect Newcastle not to have theirs soon. Arteta must cling to the slim hope that, if his charges do the necessary against Everton, Tottenham somehow fall flat at relegated Norwich. “In football anything can happen,” he said, but Arsenal have spurned a glorious opportunity to keep control of their destiny.",Sport/Football,Bruno Guimarães caps Newcastle win to leave Arsenal’s top-four hopes in tatters,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
5/17/2022,"Pressure on the government to help those hardest hit by Britain’s cost of living crisis has intensified after the head of one of the country’s leading employers’ groups said immediate support was a “moral imperative”. Tony Danker, the director-general of the CBI, said Rishi Sunak should step in to provide assistance to households skipping meals as a result of rising food and fuel bills. Figures on Wednesday are expected to show the annual inflation rate rising above 9%, and Danker said it was “unacceptable” that people were faced with the choice of whether to heat their homes or eat. Sunak has pledged to provide more support for people affected by the latest sharp rise in energy prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Danker called on the chancellor not to wait until the autumn before acting. While urging caution about bowing to demands from some Tory MPs for a tax-cutting summer mini-budget, the head of the CBI said Sunak should move on two fronts at once. “The first is to help people facing real hardship now; it’s the moral underpinning of our economy and society,” Danker said. “Recent surveys suggest more than one in 10 households have skipped – or had smaller – meals in the past month because of a lack of affordability, while about half a million more households are expected to face choices between heating and eating. Putting pounds in the pockets of people struggling the most should not be delayed. “Secondly, start stimulating business investment now – we will need to ensure that there is economic growth in the pipeline to avoid any downturn in our economy that could worsen or prolong the cost-of-living crisis.” Danker said many of the people running UK businesses had never experienced the current combination of high inflation and weak growth, adding that confidence in boardrooms and among investors had been hit. Danker called for a five-point plan to boost investment: cashflow support for firms; a commitment to green growth; setting out a roadmap for infrastructure; ensuring money already announced flowed into the economy; and unlocking investment in digital. “The chancellor’s clear intention to use a forthcoming budget to cut taxes on business investment should become a firm commitment now,” he said. “It will ensure that any firm pausing on investment now will be bold, decisive and back their original plans. This matters for everyone because it guarantees that any slowdown in growth will have a short and shallow shelf life.” Danker was more cautious about backing a fully fledged mini-budget, expressing concern that a big stimulus package would further fuel inflationary pressure. “We do need to avoid big injections to economic demand that might worsen inflation, and focus on getting the supply side of our economy moving. So big economic boosters should be deferred until safe to do so. Government should stay flexible and support the economy in the right way at the right time.” The CBI is opposed to financing a support package through a windfall tax on North Sea energy companies, but would back Sunak if he decided to target poorer households through a one-off payment or an increase in universal credit. Energy bills for the average household rose by almost £700 to just under £2,000 a year in April, and the Bank of England is expecting a further £800-a-year rise in October.",News/Business,Cost of living crisis: immediate support from Sunak a ‘moral imperative’ – CBI ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/cost-of-living-crisis-immediate-support-from-sunak-a-moral-imperative-cbi
5/17/2022,"A day ahead of Joe Biden’s visit to Buffalo, the leading civil rights attorney Ben Crump said federal officials should define the mass shooting at a grocery store in the city on Saturday as an “act of domestic terrorism”. “We can’t sugarcoat it, we can’t try to explain it away talking about mental illness,” Crump said of the attacked allegedly perpetrated by Payton Gendron, 18, who is in custody on one charge of first-degree murder awaiting arraignment on Thursday where additional charges are likely to be filed. “No,” Crump said. “This was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a young white supremacist.” Ten people were killed and three wounded in the shooting. Representing the family of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old woman who was among those killed in the two-minute attack, Crump said leaders “at the highest levels must be responsive to this”. “This was an act of domestic terrorists and America responds to terrorism at every level and they have to do that here,” Crump said as he stood before several members of the Whitfield family, some of whom wept quietly. “Just because it was a Black grocery store doesn’t make it any less than any other massacres, whether its Columbine or the Oklahoma City bombing.” Whitfield was killed after making a daily visit to her husband, Garnell Whitfield, in a nursing home. On Monday, Garnell Whitfield had not yet been told that his wife of 68 years was dead. Their son, the Buffalo fire commissioner, Garnell Whitfield Jr, said for his mother to be “taken from this world by someone full of hate for no reason, it’s very hard for us to handle right now”. “And you expect us to do this over and over and over again, forgive and forget,” he said, “while the people we elect do their best not to protect us, consider us equal, not to love us back? What do we do with all of this pain?” Crump has been involved in representing the families of George Floyd, Jacob Blake, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, all victims of police violence. He called on authorities to investigate how the Buffalo gunman developed hateful beliefs, including examining if “race replacement theory” played a role in the attack. But Crump also called out “accomplices to this mass murder”, which he identified as websites, politicians and cable news pundits. “Even though they didn’t pull the trigger, they did load the gun for this young white supremacist,” he said. Crump said federal legislators must pass a hate crimes bill before Congress – a reference to the George Floyd Justice in Policing bill, currently stalled – and that Biden must use his influence to secure such progress. “Black America is suffering right now,” he said. “And we need to know that our top leader in America reacts and responds when we are hurt.” The US justice department has said it is investigating the Buffalo massacre as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism. Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will visit Buffalo on Tuesday. The George Floyd bill is likely to be discussed, alongside the the first’s family’s expressions of condolence to grieving families and the community at large. Attorneys co-representing the Whitfield family said they could file lawsuits against Bushmaster, maker of the assault-style weapon used in Buffalo, following successful legal actions against the makers of weapons used in mass shootings.The attorney Ken Abbarno said “all of the signs and red flags were there” to monitor the suspect and stop him acquiring a gun, including threatening comments that brought police to his high school last spring and triggered a mental health evaluation. Another attorney, Terry Connors, said he planned to help the Whitfield family get answers about how the shooting happened and how it was possible for an 18-year-old with such a history to purchase such a weapon, cross state lines and buy bullets. According to the Erie county sheriff, John Garcia, the suspect was visited last year by state police after he turned in a high-school project about murder-suicides. Buffalo police have said authorities are examining a 180-page manifesto Gendron appeared to have written and posted that referenced racist replacement theories. Also on Monday, the Buffalo police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, revealed that Gendron did not plan to limit his rampage to one branch of Tops Friendly Markets. “He was going to get in his car and continue to drive down Jefferson Avenue and continue doing the same thing,” the commissioner said. Gendron reportedly drove to Buffalo from his home several hours away on Friday to do “reconnaissance” of the area. At least one witness claims to have met him that day. Law enforcement found another rifle and a shotgun in the suspect’s car. As details of the planning of the shooting become clearer, so do its apparent motives. A screenshot posted on Crump’s Twitter account showed the alleged gunman had the number 14 stenciled on the barrel of his weapon, an apparent reference to a 14-word white supremacist phrase: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The attack has also focused attention on social media livestream services. “Live streaming this attack gives me some motivation in the way that I know that some people will be cheering for me,” the suspect said as the attack was in progress. Amazon-owned Twitch, which hosted the suspect’s livestream via the account “jimboboiii” to roughly 20 other users, has said it has erased the video from servers. “The user has been indefinitely suspended from our service and we are taking all appropriate action including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content,” a Twitch spokesperson said. Clips of the attack were available on other platforms. One clip, uploaded to Streamable, was reported to have had 3m views before it was removed.",News/US news, Civil rights lawyer Crump: investigate Buffalo shooting as domestic terrorism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/ben-crump-buffalo-shooting-domestic-terrorism
5/17/2022,"Flares usually signal danger but for the pitch-invading Huddersfield fans they are a sign of hope. They are one game away from a Premier League return after Jordan Rhodes came off the bench to score his fourth and most significant goal of the season to send them into the Championship playoff final at Luton’s expense. Huddersfield were lucky to be still in the game when Rhodes poked home a free-kick with eight minutes to go to edge the tie but what matters in football is taking chances and, despite a barren season, the 32-year-old striker still knows how to get things done when it matters, a trait Luton lacked. The visitors, missing eight first-team players, should have taken the lead in the 11th minute when Kal Naismith drifted into space on the left and sent a low cross into the box for Harry Cornick to tap home but he sidefooted the ball from six yards straight at Lee Nicholls, much to the relief of the majority in the ground. Unlike in many playoff semi-finals there was little caution shown by either side. Huddersfield looked to play with great intensity to get through Luton, while the visitors’ pressing was causing problems for the hosts when they attempted to play out from the back. Luton moved the Huddersfield defence around to create gaps in wide areas. Robert Snodgrass took advantage to cut in from the right and curl a shot towards the corner which Nicholls palmed straight out to Amari’i Bell, who could only jab the rebound wide. Huddersfield going so close to conceding ramped up the tension inside the ground. Danny Ward almost relieved it with a mazy run into the Luton box but he was stretching to shoot and failed to garner sufficient power in his jabbed effort, allowing Matt Ingram to palm it away. Injury meant it was Ward’s final action, with Rhodes coming on to replace him before the break. Huddersfield looked unable to cope with the occasion, wanting to take too much time on the ball and being repeatedly caught out by Luton. The visitors maintained their intensity and almost took the lead when Allan Campbell got to the byline to chip a cross to the back post from the right but Bell put his header across goal and wide. The only thing that looked to cause Luton problems was a lack of discipline creeping into their play. Jordan Clark was booked for a lunge on Rhodes, while Campbell received a lengthy talking to for a nibble at Lewis O’Brien after a free-kick had already been awarded to Huddersfield. Naismith joined Clark in the book for going through the back of the substitute Sorba Thomas. Huddersfield finally came to life in the 74th minute, forcing Ingram to make two fine saves in quick succession. For the second he failed to gather properly and clashed with Harry Toffolo in the box as he attempted to collect the ball. Everyone in stripes demanded a penalty but the referee shook his head, earning the ire of the stadium in exchange. The fans were probably right, the referee wrong on this occasion. Thomas had provided dangerous deliveries since coming on to the pitch. He swung in a free-kick from the left to the back post, where Rhodes showed his experience to hold off the challenge of Bell and slide the ball back across Ingram to bring delirium to Huddersfield which did not abate until the final whistle, nor will it in the town until they visit Wembley on Sunday 29 May where they will face Nottingham Forest or Sheffield United. “It was a very, very difficult goal,” Carlos Corberán, Rhodes’ manager, said. “Only a striker with a lot of goal instinct can score.” Huddersfield rode their luck to make it through. Bodies were put on the line throughout. “Without the character of the players, it would be possible to be sitting here celebrating going to Wembley,” Corberán said. Not everyone enjoyed the pitch invasion. “The fans were an absolute disgrace,” Luton’s manager, Nathan Jones, said. “The stewards … I don’t know why they turned up, it took them hours to get on to the pitch. “We won’t complain because football fans are like that. Some are idiots, they didn’t paint Huddersfield Town as a good club in terms of how they were. They’d won the game, go celebrate with your players, go celebrate something wonderful, but they were more concerned with obscene gestures. I saw a mother with a little kid; if it was my wife I’d be disgusted.”",Sport/Football,Late Rhodes goal sends Huddersfield to Wembley final after win over Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/huddersfield-luton-championship-playoff-semifinal-second-leg-match-report
5/17/2022,"Good morning. It’s crunch time for politicians on the home stretch of campaigning to sway undecided voters. And the US is reeling from a weekend of gun violence, with a refocus on the rhetoric pushing extremism and access to deadly weapons. The Labor frontbencher Penny Wong is being deployed to campaign in Liberal-held seats where voters are dissatisfied with Scott Morrison and there is a lack of teal independent to back. Strategists say Labor’s internal polling points to opportunity in four Liberal-held seats – Brisbane and Ryan in Queensland, Bennelong in Sydney and Higgins in Victoria. A new poll has predicted the independent Allegra Spender is on track to take the seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east from the Liberal MP, Dave Sharma, based on preference flows. And in the seat of Groom, which has been held by conservatives since federation, Labor and independent candidates are shaking up the race. The massacre by a white supremacist gunman of Black shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store in the US and a spate of gun violence at the weekend has refocused attention on the toxic interplay of political ideology and easy access to handguns and battlefield weapons. The Buffalo shooting, in which 10 people were murdered, has drawn renewed scrutiny of Republican figures who have embraced the racist “great replacement theory” he is alleged to have used as justification for the murders. The extremist ideology expounds on the view that immigration will ultimately destroy white values and western civilisation. After Sweden and Finland yesterday confirmed plans to join Nato, Sweden is seeking to quell Turkish opposition by sending diplomats to the country. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said he will not approve Finland and Sweden joining the alliance and that delegations should not bother coming to Turkey to try convince him otherwise. Meanwhile, 20 civilians, including a child, were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Australia has quietly shut down a taskforce set up to counter violent extremism online after the Christchurch terror attack. The white 18-year-old charged with the murders of 10 people at a convenience store in Buffalo cited the manifesto of the Christchurch shooter in his own manifesto. Uber drivers have warned that there will be a mass industry exodus if base rates don’t increase to sustainable levels. The rising cost-of-living pressure and fees and charges are making rideshare services unprofitable for drivers. Mount Isa has been named the most polluted postcode in Australia, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation. Mount Isa Mines is responsible for 91% of the city’s emissions, despite having an “industry-leading air quality management framework”. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has sought to block federal funding for a Gold Coast light rail expansion that would run directly past an investment property she co-owns with her husband. Élisabeth Borne has been appointed France’s prime minister – the first woman to hold the post in more than 30 years and only the second female prime minister in modern French history. Boris Johnson has said a legal move to ditch parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is only an “insurance” policy as it emerged that the legislation has been delayed for some weeks. The financial crisis engulfing Sri Lanka will get worse and “the next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives”, the country’s new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has warned. “Apocalyptic” food prices caused by Russia’s invasion could have a disastrous impact on the world’s poor, says the Bank of England governor, who has blamed the war in Ukraine for the highest inflation in the UK for three decades When it comes to getting more votes, political alignment and marketing razzle-dazzle are key. Let’s say that every person has some innate political preference – left, right or somewhere in between. The argument was that people vote for the party who is the closest to their position. Over time, Australians have become more likely to identify strongly with one side or the other. Yet it is still true that we are most likely to be centrists, and sit on the fence – at least in our own reckoning. So, what wins more votes: making speeches, kissing babies or digging holes? Ask a visible mender to explain why they love to repair clothes using patches or colourful darning and the response will usually include storytelling. Most menders pride themselves on adding to the history of a garment: a cleverly patched hole is evidence of something saved from landfill. They’ll also insist it shouldn’t be perfect. The charm of the visible mend lies in the character of its flaws, so the important thing is to have a go. Here’s some advice from expert visible menders on how to get started. “When I lost a parent to suicide, there was a week or two of numbness,” writes Isobel Beech. “I suppose it was shock. And then I began pretending everything was fine. I began writing my book, Sunbathing, in the winter of 2019 while attending a writing residency in Italy … I wrote late into the night. I wrote about fear and grief and what being left behind feels like. I wrote about relationships and regrets and what we’re supposed to do with the knowledge that people can exit this earth willingly, and it will sometimes feel like your fault. In writing, I found that there was a whole room of things I needed to say.” This week more than 1.2 million people are voting for the first time – a cohort made up of young people and new citizens. But a Plan International report has found three-quarters of young women voting for the first time don’t feel politics is an equal space for women and people of colour. In today’s Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to two women voting for the first time about the significance of casting their vote, and reporter Matilda Boseley breaks down what first-time voters need to know.

5/17/2022,"My mother, Gloria Randall, who has died aged 91, was a social worker who was attuned to the particular needs of Jewish refugee clients, having fled Nazi persecution aged eight. As a pioneer in the social work field of the new NHS, she was also a team leader in complex family care cases. Born in Hamburg, Gloria was the daughter of Sascha (nee Rares), an actress, and Fritz Mangold, a solicitor. The family’s assimilated status was no protection from the Nazis and Gloria had to wear a yellow star before being excluded from school. Thanks to the sponsorship of a relative in London, the family made it to Britain just before the outbreak of the second world war. Gloria grew up in Leatherhead, Surrey, and attended Sutton high school. She took a certificate in social science at Edinburgh University (1951), followed by an Institute of Medical Social Work professional qualification (1954). As an assistant medical social worker she had posts at a number of hospitals around London, starting with the Prince of Wales hospital, Tottenham. These services had been provided by charities before the NHS was founded and one outraged client demanded to know what happened to his “lady almoner”. Gloria worked her way up the medical social work grades in the 1950s and 60s, with a break in 1963, when she lived in Israel for a couple of years, taking up archaeology, living on a kibbutz and working as a medical social worker at Bet Loewenstein rehabilitation hospital. In 1965, back in the UK, she became a senior medical social worker at University College hospital, London, attached to obstetrics, and then went to work as a social worker for Enfield council. She also lectured and supervised students studying at University College hospital, the Institute for Medical Social Workers and the North Western Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University). From 1977 to the late 80s she worked at Haringey social services. Gloria’s career culminated in the 90s in assessing accommodation for increasingly frail former refugees with the charity Jewish Care. She was particularly moved when one concentration camp survivor said she always carried her passport in her handbag because “you never know”. She retired in the mid-90s. Though she never described herself as a survivor, her formative years directed her formidable energies towards those who were displaced. She was an active member of the Association of Jewish Refugees and curated her family’s wartime letters for the Weiner Holocaust library. Devoted to her family, Gloria also maintained a wide circle of friends. She loved the opera, and her theatre group shared her passion for new productions and good meals. She married David Randall, a mathematician and civil servant, in 1969. He died in 2011. Gloria is survived by me, a granddaughter, Miriam, her brother, Tom, and three nieces.",News/Society,Gloria Randall obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/gloria-randall-obituary
5/17/2022,"The world of football has united to offer praise and support to Jake Daniels, after the 17-year-old Blackpool forward came out as gay. The Football Association said Daniels, the first male professional footballer in the UK to come out since Justin Fashanu in 1990, was “an inspiration to us all”. In a statement the FA said: “We fully support your decision to be open about this part of yourself. Football is a game for all, with diversity at its heart, and this is a hugely positive step as we strive to build an inclusive game that we can all be proud of. We are with you and hope your story will help to give people across the game the strength and encouragement to be their true self.” Daniels has also received support from several prominent footballers, former players and pundits, after making the announcement on Monday with the help of his club, Stonewall and Sky Sports. “Massive credit to you and the way your friends, family, club, and captain have supported you,” wrote the Tottenham and England forward, Harry Kane. “Football should be welcoming for everyone.” The Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, praised the teenager for his “amazing courage and bravery”. “It’s been a brilliant season for you on the pitch, and now through your bravery, off the pitch too,” the BBC Match of the Day host, Gary Lineker, wrote. “I’m sure you’ll receive huge love and support from the football community and many others will follow your path. Good luck to you.” The former United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted: “Massive respect for this brave decision. Let’s all help create a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ+ people in football and beyond!” Thomas Hitzlsperger, who came out as gay shortly after his retirement, wished Daniels a wonderful career and said he was glad to see he had the support of his club and Stonewall. Ferdinand’s former teammate at United, the ex-England defender Gary Neville, said on Sky’s Monday Night Football programme that Daniels’s announcement “will go down in history” and could change the dressing-room culture in men’s football. “What he has just done takes incredible courage,” Neville said. “In a dressing room, that would seem like the unthinkable to announce you are gay. I can’t imagine how difficult that has been. All I would say is it’s a day of great importance for Jake and his family, but also for English football. It is a big, big moment for football. “The game has not dealt with this issue well at all. We know that now it is something that is acceptable from a fan point of view, but it’s not yet got into the dressing room. A dressing room can be an evil place … you think about the peer pressure and vulnerability. The way in which Jake spoke was absolutely incredible.” Neville’s colleague, the former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, said: “I know the [Blackpool] manager Neil Critchley, I had a relationship with him at Liverpool. Neil will be a huge support mechanism for Jake because he will need that going forward. It’s not just about Jake, it’s about the football club and their role within it and it’s an example going forward for other clubs.” ""It's a day of great importance for English football""Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher discuss Blackpool's Jake Daniels coming out as gay - the first UK professional footballer to do so publicly since 1990pic.twitter.com/bZDhTylCVp Elsewhere, the Professional Footballers’ Association said it was “extremely proud of Jake … he has the complete support of everyone at the PFA”. The EFL chief executive, Trevor Birch, said: “We hope this moment helps take us forward to a time where LGBTQ+ representation at all levels of the men’s game is the norm.” Tony Burnett, chair of the anti-discriminatory campaign group Kick it Out, said football has “a renewed responsibility to [Jake] and the LGBTQ+ community at large … to ensure that he receives the right support now, and can continue on his footballing journey like any other 17-year-old”. Burnett said: “This is a big story, and a historic day in English football, but we need to remember that there is a young man at the heart of it. A young man who should not have to be defined by this one moment, or this one part of his identity. We wish Jake a long and successful career in football.” Stonewall, which will continue to offer Daniels and Blackpool “ongoing support”, said: “We are proud that Jake has felt able to share his truth with the world. Football is ready for this moment and we believe it has been for some time. This is an opportunity for everyone to support Jake and show football is everybody’s game.” In their own statement, Blackpool FC said they were “incredibly proud [Jake] has reached a stage where he is empowered to express himself both on and off the pitch”. The club added: “It is vital that we all promote an environment where people feel comfortable to be themselves, and that football leads the way in removing any form of discrimination and prejudice.”",Sport/Football,World of football unites in support for Jake Daniels after he comes out as gay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/jake-daniels-support-reaction-fa-efl-kick-it-out
5/17/2022,"Vladimir Putin has become so personally involved in the Ukraine war that he is making operational and tactical decisions “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”, according to western military sources. The Russian president is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas, they added, where last week the invaders suffered a bloody defeat as they tried on multiple occasions to cross a strategic river in the east of Ukraine. The sources added that Putin is still working closely with Gen Valery Gerasimov, the commander of the Russian armed forces, in contrast to claims made by Ukraine last week that the military chief had been sidelined. “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,” the military source said, referring to the ongoing battle in the east of Ukraine. Moscow’s armies have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough in the Donbas, where they have been mounting an offensive for a month that has failed several times encircle the smaller Ukrainian forces. No further detail to back up the statement was provided, although it was implied the assessment about Putin’s close personal involvement was based on intelligence that had been received. Colonels in the US army and brigadiers in the British army typically command a brigade, units made up of a handful of battalions – the latter of which is equivalent to the smallest operating unit in the Russian army. Russia’s military operates in a more top down fashion compared to western counterparts, with instructions typically sent to generals in the field. But Moscow’s faltering invasion has meant that it has been forced to send generals closer to the frontline, where up to 12 have been killed, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. Ben Barry, a former brigadier in the British army, and a land warfare expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said: “A head of government should have better things to do than make military decisions. They should be setting the political strategy rather than getting bogged down in day to day activity”. Last week’s failed attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets river at Bilohorivka led to the destruction of more than 70 Russian vehicles, and the loss of at least one batallion’s worth of equipment, according to estimates based on aerial photography of the battle site. The defeat was so serious it led some Russian military bloggers to comment “on the incompetence of the Russian military to their hundreds of thousands of followers”, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a rare sign of internal dissent. In the past 24 hours, Russian forces shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Monday that Russian strikes had hit a hospital in the city over the weekend, killing two and injuring nine, including a child – and several other locations had been targeted. Ukrainian forces repelled 17 attacks on Sunday, he added, and destroyed 11 Russian armoured vehicles. The Russians are gradually mounting an assault on Severodonetsk, an industrial city that had a population of 100,000 before the war, as the effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine’s defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. Ukrainian forces also continued to push Russian forces back from Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, with Volodomyr Zelenskiy congratulating soldiers who erected a new border post on Russia’s border north of the city. “I’m very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,” he said in a video message. “I’m very grateful to all the fighters like you.” Russia’s withdrawal is a fighting retreat, however, with the outlying northern villages around Kharkiv being peppered with shelling on Monday, with one person confirmed killed in Tsyrkuny, 17 miles from the city centre and four injured in the districts of Shevchenkivskyi and Saltivka. Ukrainian officials said that Russian forces were concentrating on “maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border”. Britain’s chief of defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said he believed that Ukraine was now winning the war because Putin had wanted to “subjugate the whole of Ukraine” and “impose his own rule on that country” and had failed. Giving a speech in to a parliamentary audience in Westminster, the head of the UK armed forces said Ukraine was winning because it had fought off “an existential threat” and that “its nation is going to survive,” he added. The Institute for the Study of War said it believed “Russian forces have likely abandoned the objective of completing a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian units from Donetsk City to Izium” in favour of capturing the remainder of the Luhansk region, of which Severodonetsk is part. A second smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas – the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and around Kharkiv to the north. Haidai said battles were taking place on Sunday to the north and south of Severodonetsk, which is one of the few locations held by Ukraine on the east side of the river. Analysts believe there may be a long struggle for the city. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, which specialises in open source intelligence, said he believed the capture of Severodonetsk was weeks away. “Moscow … does not have the appropriate manpower and equipment levels to take the city swiftly,” he said in a weekly review of the fighting.",News/World news,"Putin involved in war ‘at level of colonel or brigadier’, say western sources",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/putin-involved-russia-ukraine-war-western-sources

5/17/2022,"The noises coming out of No 10 ahead of the prime minister’s visit to Northern Ireland had been rather more conciliatory. Obviously, there was no admission from Boris Johnson that he had actually negotiated and signed the deal involving the NI protocol, but that was always going to be a step too far. There’s only so much reality the Convict can take at any one time. And the bigger the truth, the harder he finds it to accept. But at least Johnson had this time bothered to get someone with a working knowledge of some of the sensitivities endemic to Northern Ireland to write the 2,000-word opinion piece on his behalf for the Belfast Telegraph. Normally, he’d have just scribbled something off the top of his head in about 30 minutes. This time there was an awareness that he needed to produce something that in some way acknowledged the presence of both the nationalists and the unionists. Not to mention the EU. Allowing Liz Truss to sound off about unilaterally deciding to trigger article 16 and torpedo the protocol – initiating legislation to break the law was a new level of idiocy even for a paid-up member of the wankocracy – hadn’t gone down well in mainland Europe or Ireland. So now the Convict had been sure to keep things vague. Let’s forget he’d ever mentioned article 16 and just hope that somehow a compromise fudge might emerge. After all, with the economy tanking and inflation predicted to rise above 10% by the end of the year, now was probably not the time to start a trade war with your biggest and nearest trading partner. Just how screwed the UK economy really was soon became apparent at a meeting of the Treasury select committee where Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, deputy governor Dave Ramsden, and Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel, two economist wonks on the monetary policy committee, were giving evidence. The committee chair, Mel Stride, got things rolling by asking why the Bank of England had got its inflation forecasts so hopelessly wrong and whether it should have taken more action on increasing interest rates to ease the pressure. Bailey is a man who epitomises dullness. Someone not even his close friends and family find it easy to stay awake for. He speaks with the golden voice of a man who chews half a dozen Mogadon before he leaves the house in the morning. So for him to sound even slightly panicky is enough to set alarm bells ringing. It was like this, he said. At least 80% of the underlying causes of inflation he had no control over. He could only sit back and let the rise in energy prices and the war in Ukraine do its worst. He was powerless. Accept the things he cannot change. Yes, but ... Stride was not happy with this at all. He needed more certainty. He needed to know that the Bank of England had a clue what it was doing. Bailey looked him in the eye before slowly replying. You could summon all the hindsight you wanted, but even then you could drag in a couple of punters who knew nothing about economics from the street and they probably wouldn’t do any worse than the MPC. It wasn’t just that 80% of the economy was a lawless jungle, far removed from any pathetic monetary levers he might try to use. It was also that he didn’t really have much of a clue about the 20% he would normally have some chance of controlling in times of less magical thinking. There was Covid in China. He had no idea how that was going to play out. And he had no idea why so many people had left the labour force. It could be that they all had long Covid. Or it could just be that hundreds of thousands had reckoned everything was so shit under the Tories that once lockdown ended they couldn’t be arsed to go back to work. Far better to put their feet up and take their chances at home. Might as well die happy. “I don’t want to panic you,” Bailey said. But he clearly did, because he then went on to point out that there would soon be a food crisis. Wheat prices had gone up 25% in a matter of months. We were all going to starve. And the least we could all do is to not ask for a pay rise. That way the least well-off would be the first to go. Call it natural selection. And all the more nosh for him. Though he was at pains to point out that he too had taken a wage freeze. Somehow he’d struggle by on £575,000 a year. Labour’s Rushanara Ali wondered how the MPC felt about being scapegoated by Liam Fox and other rightwing Tories for not having done more to combat inflation. Bailey shrugged. He could live with it. If the Tories really wanted to undermine the Bank’s independence and let the chancellor have a go, they could be his guest. Though nothing Rishi Sunak had done on the cost-of-living crisis should have given them any reason to think he had any answers. The man was even more useless than him. The session meandered on for the best part of two hours with everyone in a state of denial. No one really wanted to acknowledge just how fucked the economy was or that no one had a clue what to do about it. Just hope things would return to normal at some point in the future and that some of us would be alive to see it. Don’t talk about the 80%. Or the 20% for that matter. Try to think of a happy place. And definitely don’t mention Brexit. The Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake tried to get Bailey to quantify the Brexit effect. “La, la, la,” said Bailey, putting his fingers in his ears. He wasn’t going to talk about Brexit. It was too difficult to disentangle from Covid. But it might have had some effect? Yes, no, maybe. Ramsden, the deputy guv’nor, eventually put Bailey out of his misery. Brexit was going to cause a 3.75% hit to GDP in the long term. But they’d already said that a long time ago, and it was too painful to repeat. There was an embarrassed silence. Ramsden looked around guiltily, as though he’d messed himself. One of the biggest acts of self-harm and even the Bank of England and the Treasury select committee can barely bring themselves to mention it. Truly, we are screwed.",News/Business,Bailey sets alarm bells ringing while barely mentioning the B-word,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/andrew-bailey-bank-of-england-economy-sketch
5/17/2022,"Babis Anagnostopoulos: clever; photogenic; charistmatic; successful – all traits that perhaps allowed him to think he could fool the world. On Monday the game was up. Justice caught up with the helicopter pilot who finally admitted it was he who had suffocated his British wife, Caroline Crouch, just over a year ago. And justice was unsparing. At the end of a dramatic trial, whose every twist and turn had gripped Greece, a mixed court of jurors and judges unanimously agreed that the 34-year-old should receive the toughest penalty possible under Greek law: a life sentence for the premeditated murder of his partner; a jail term of 11 years and six months for the brutal killing of the family’s pet dog; and a fine of €21,000. Anagnostopoulos, who for almost six weeks had sought to pin the murder in the couple’s dream Athenian home on a gang of ruthless foreign thieves, will likely remain behind bars for several decades. After sentencing was passed, even his lawyer appeared to justify the judgment, saying the verdict was “expected”. But in truth, the story of Crouch’s death has made waves precisely because it confounded expectation. At barely 20, the young mother’s tragic end struck a chord at a time when the Mediterranean nation has also been hit by a wave of femicides. When the UK-trained pilot emerged dishevelled and distraught from the very building in suburban Athens where Caroline had taken her last breath – telling reporters he hoped no family would endure the same fate that his had been forced to bear – there was no one in Greece, or abroad, who did not sympathise. Against a backdrop of rising crime in the capital’s suburbs, a visibly shocked civil protection minister announced a €300,000 bounty to help unearth the culprits. As the weeks passed, with no evident breakthroughs, the story intensified – along with the public’s interest. In the role of grieving widow, Anagnostopoulos pandered to Greek fears: he wasn’t sure where the thieves were from, but he was convinced they were foreigners. Potential suspects were pulled out of police line-ups with the aviator deliberately suggesting Georgians or Albanians were behind the murder. Other props would be used to maintain the fiction that he was a loving family man who had fallen victim to heinous crime. Attending Crouch’s funeral, he mourned by the side of her grave, clutching the couple’s baby daughter, Lydia, for more than four hours. Weeks later, when it became clear that the doting father had in fact been the perpetrator who had placed the 11-month-old child next to her dead mother’s body, the backlash was instant. Following his shock confession, sympathy turned into shock and then revulsion. Across the country, Greeks felt hoodwinked, not only by Anagnostopoulos’ lies and hypocrisy, but by the knowledge that, like the police, they had been fooled by a consummate actor who had played on their deepest fears.",News/World news,Babis Anagnostopoulos: how a murderer fooled the world for months,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/babis-anagnostopoulos-caroline-crouch-murderer-fooled-world
5/17/2022,"Culture wars are “not just an ugly political phenomenon … they’re deeply dangerous”, Sayeeda Warsi has told the fifth annual Jo Cox memorial lecture at the University of Cambridge. The lecture was set up to memorialise the Labour MP who was shot and stabbed in a politically motivated murder in June 2016. Cox was struck while campaigning in her Yorkshire constituency during the European referendum campaign, in which she supported remain. Speaking to a capacity audience at Pembroke College on “culture wars” and societal fault-lines, the former chair of the Conservative party said: “I’m increasingly of the view that culture wars are sapping our energies and stopping us from solving the real issues of the day. “A divided country may help win elections, but it doesn’t win a nation,” Lady Warsi added. She recalled when, some years ago, Cox had reached across the political divide and suggested an event together. Describing Cox’s philosophy as in “stark contrast” to culture wars, she said Cox “achieved in 13 months in parliament what so many do not [at all]”. Cox gained a place at Pembroke College in the 1990s, where she studied human, social and political studies. The memorial lecture was held in the Old Library, where a portrait of Cox by the artist Clara Drummond was later revealed in the hall by her sister and MP, Kim Leadbeater. Her husband, two children and parents were in attendance. Combining her academic achievement with political experience, Cox was considered a rising star within the Labour party. In the Commons, she had established herself as a critic of the policy in Syria. She believed there was a lack of “moral compass” in British policy and described the approach as a “masterclass in how not to do foreign policy”. She also argued in favour of allowing more refugees into the UK. “Culture wars in the end are a struggle to defend who we are,” said Warsi. The lecture arrived at a time when much of the so-called “culture wars” was being inflamed by politicians, commentators and social media. Boris Johnson has come under fire for inflaming culture wars from his former race adviser, Samuel Kasumu, who resigned because the Conservatives were pursuing a “politics steeped in division” and warned of another Cox tragedy should the government continued down that path. “There are some people in the government who feel like the right way to win is to pick a fight on the culture war and to exploit division,” Kasumu previously told the Guardian in an interview. “I worry about that. It seems like people have very short memories, and they’ve already forgotten Jo Cox.” In the lecture, Warsi said what defines a nation is “deeper than flags and fanfare” and that the focus should not be on correcting past injustices or the toppling of statues such as in Bristol. “If you have a statue [of a person] who is controversial,” Warsi said, “leave them there, but have a clear indication of who that person is. Let it stay, but let it stay honestly.” Warsi added that while the UK had not hit as dark a phase as the US, which has recently experienced a Capitol riot and attempts to overturn elections, she added: “Sadly, where the US goes on culture wars, the UK often follows.” Cox’s killer, Thomas Mair, uttered the words “Britain first” and “Keep Britain independent” as he carried out the attack. He was later given a life sentence for murder, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and grievous bodily harm to a second victim. The unemployed gardener, then 52, was alleged to have accessed online sites about Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, the Waffen-SS, Israel, matricide and serial killers in the days before she was killed. Nazi memorabilia and far-right books were later discovered in his home. Mair was charged with Cox’s murder‬, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and grievous bodily harm to a second victim, the passerby Bernard Carter-Kenny. Cox was 41 and the MP for Batley and Spen when she died, and is survived by her two children and husband. In response to her death, Pembroke College alumni and students raised funds for a Jo Cox scholarship. Warsi, a daughter of Pakistani immigrants, defected from the leave campaign in 2016, accusing it of “hate and xenophobia” just days before the referendum. In a 2016 tribute to Cox, Warsi said: “It takes a certain kind of Labour politician to convince the ex-chairman of the Conservative party to share a platform with her weeks before the general election, and to praise her for the work that she was doing. But that was Jo; working above the fray, across the political divide.” In 2021, the lecture was delivered by the former home secretary and chair of the Jo Cox Foundation, Jacqui Smith.",News/Politics,"Culture wars ‘deeply dangerous’, Warsi warns at Jo Cox event",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/culture-wars-deeply-dangerous-warsi-warns-at-jo-cox-event
5/17/2022,"Doctors from overseas working in the NHS are more likely to be suspended or struck off when they have no lawyer to represent them at a disciplinary hearing, new figures show. The findings have raised fresh questions about whether the General Medical Council (GMC) displays “systemic racial bias” in its treatment of foreign-born medics accused of wrongdoing. When doctors who graduated abroad do not have legal representation upon attending a tribunal hearing, more than four out of five (83%) end up being suspended from work or struck off from the UK medical register, GMC figures show. That is significantly higher than the 55% of suspended or struck off overseas medical graduates who had representation. The hearings fall under the responsibility of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), the GMC’s disciplinary arm. Similarly, while the MPTS panel decided that only 8% of those without representation should face “no impairment” of their medical practice, the figure was much higher – 27% – among those who did have a lawyer with them. In addition, many in the latter group received nothing more than a warning, in which doctors are told that their conduct is below the acceptable standard. A total of 37% of UK doctors who trained abroad do not have legal representation when they attend an MPTS hearing, compared to 25% of doctors who qualified in the UK. The GMC figures, which cover the years 2018–21, were obtained by the Medical Protection Society (MPS), which represents doctors whose conduct has drawn complaints from members of the public, using freedom of information laws. Dame Jane Dacre, the president of the MPS, said: “The fact that so many doctors coming to work in the UK have no one to defend their interests, provide legal advice and guide them through what is a lengthy, stressful and complex regulatory process, is worrying. I am deeply concerned for them. “The difference in outcomes when an overseas graduate has legal representation at their tribunal is stark and shows just how essential it is. Those without are clearly greatly disadvantaged, coming out of the process facing significantly harsher sanctions, which can so often be career-ending.” Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said many overseas-trained doctors were unaware that they are only covered by the NHS’s collective insurance policy for alleged medical negligence, and not for complaints about their personal behaviour. “It’s very unfair that these doctors aren’t properly informed and therefore aren’t properly represented” because they have not joined a medical defence organisation, he added. Dr Jenny Vaughan, the chair of the Doctors’ Association (DAUK), said: “This research by the MPS shows the injustice of what is happening to overseas graduates who come to this country and provide a vital service for our patients. “As a country, we cannot have it both ways. We should not expect our health service to be propped up by overseas graduates and then just let them face such serious consequences without proper support.” The GMC has pledged to eradicate “disproportionate complaints from employers about ethnic minority doctors”, after complaints that the disciplinary system was racist. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of council at the British Medical Association, said that the GMC’s bias against ethnic minority doctors had been proven last year when the regulator was found to have discriminated against Dr Omer Karim, a cancer surgeon, on the grounds of his race. “It’s a tragedy to think that the NHS might already have lost talented professionals” because of the large number of foreign-trained doctors who have been struck off when they faced an MPTS hearing alone, added Nagpaul. The GMC said that any doctor who faces a hearing without legal representation is at risk of a negative outcome, regardless of where they are from. A spokesperson said: “Our own published peer-reviewed research shows that any doctor who doesn’t attend their hearing or have legal representation is more likely to receive more serious outcomes at hearings. That same research shows that tribunal outcomes are unrelated to whether doctors qualified in the UK or not. Non-attendance or lack of legal representation puts any doctor at a disadvantage.”",News/Society,Overseas-trained NHS doctors more likely to be struck off without lawyer at disciplinary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/overseas-trained-nhs-doctors-more-likely-to-be-struck-off-without-lawyer-at-a-disciplinary
5/17/2022,"In MI5’s London headquarters there is a top secret grid, on which is ranked the top terrorist plots absorbing the attention and resources of the security services and police. While 15 years ago it was dominated by Islamist plotters, in recent years the most severe threats to the country’s national security feature people planning atrocities linked to extreme rightwing ideology. The official figures are sobering. They reveal that the United Kingdom faces twin threats of terrorist violence, from Islamists such as adherents of Islamic State, and from a far more disparate extremist far right, trying to trigger a race war to further their ideology. Since March 2017, counter-terrorism police and the intelligence services have stopped 32 plots they assess as aiming to cause mass casualties on British soil. Of these they assess 18 were Islamist related, and 12 were triggered by extreme rightwing terrorist ideology. The other two were linked to category known as left, anarchist or single-issue terrorism (LASIT). The last one to get through and kill was Darren Osborne, who drove a van into worshippers outside Finsbury Park mosque in north London in 2017, leaving one person dead. In his van was a note setting out his grievances. The investigation by police and MI5 discovered that he radicalised himself in a month, starting with mainstream material. His note talked about grooming gangs, and police believe the catalyst for Osborne’s descent into hate was seeing a BBC drama about a sexual abuse scandal involving Muslim men, screened on a Sunday evening. That issue about grooming gangs was then used in online extremist propaganda against Islam. Osbourne read internet propaganda from Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League and material from Britain First, another extremist hate group. The ratio of counter-terrorism investigations is still roughly six Islamist for every one from the extreme right wing, covering everything from plots to financing to propaganda. In March, assistant commissioner Matt Jukes, head of counter-terrorism, said that 19 out of 20 children who were arrested in the previous 12 months for terrorism offences were linked to an extreme rightwing ideology. Those falling for rightwing hate and then breaking terrorism laws were younger than those falling for Islamist hate, with techniques including online content based on violent video games shaped to indoctrinate them. Jukes said that 41% of counter-terrorism arrests in 2021 were of extreme rightwing suspects. Although the death toll in the UK from the extreme right wing has numbered single victims so far, including the assassination of Jo Cox MP in 2016, mass murders in Christchurch and now Buffalo give the lie to any notion the ideology is any less effective at delivering carnage. The government review of Prevent was hoped to refresh and save it. The national security imperative was to find a way of diverting recruits to terrorism, before it was too late. William Shawcross’s appointment as chair of the review was greeted by a boycott from human rights group and Muslim organisations because of his past comments. But his appointment was also feared by some in counter-terrorism over concerns his findings would be so extreme they would kill what credibility Prevent had left, if they were enacted.",News/UK news,Terrorism in the UK: the rising threat of far right extremists,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/terrorism-in-the-uk-the-rising-threat-of-far-right-extremists
5/17/2022,"Awhite teenager and avowed racist beelines to a Black neighborhood and fatally guns down 10 supermarket patrons. But what most troubled the pure minds of the right’s leading thinkers? Baby formula, among other things. For the most prominent conservative voices, the major takeaway from last Saturday’s shooting in Buffalo, New York, was not it being one of the worst hate crimes in American history. Or an indictment of gun control legislation. Or an impetus for tighter controls around online forums that provide quarter to bigots and their unhinged plans of mass destruction. No, their major takeaway was literally anything else. Tucker Carlson – who has openly discussed the idea of whites being replaced, a point that was raised in the shooter’s manifesto – could not even be bothered to weigh in on the shooting over the weekend; his Twitter feed was stuck on a Friday post about the baby formula shortage and included a clip from his rant about it on his Fox News show. Laura Ingraham was far more prolific on Twitter, but kept the conversation to her pet subjects: the Putin problem, the “wokeism” crisis and larger leftist conspiracy. Charlie Kirk, a 28-year-old talkshow host who routinely promotes conspiracy theories, stuck to a familiar script too – banging on about how Ukraine is getting all the government funding that should be going toward building a wall, when he wasn’t wondering why the recent firebombing of a Wisconsin pro-choice clinic had not been categorized as a hate crime. Republican lawmakers have been similarly loth to acknowledge the obvious. Per usual, it’s fallen to Wyoming’s Liz Cheney to scold her party for tacitly inflaming white nationalist and antisemitic rhetoric. “History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse.” Still, her peers’ lack of words for the Buffalo massacre is telling, a departure from the usual round of thoughts and prayers. After years of being sharply criticized for those empty gestures, apparently conservatives now think it wiser to say nothing at all. But there’s a difference between keeping mum out of respect and talking around the subject seemingly out of spite. And given the shooter’s tight embrace of the fringe notions that have been mainstreamed by the right – not least, the great replacement theory – perhaps the right’s most outspoken members have reason to change the subject. To the baby formula shortage. To soaring fuel prices. To war in Ukraine. To any other crisis, real or imagined, except the most urgent one. When it comes to the sanctity of life in gestation, of course, they’re happy to fume freely about that … but when that loss occurs outside the womb, in a mass shooting? Well, ain’t that America. Nothing to see here than just another tragedy in a depressingly long line that traces back to the Charleston shooting, to the 16th street Baptist Church Bombing, to the Tulsa Masscare – to the very founding of this country. And saying something constructive or otherwise risks light on a painful subject that, sadly, is nowhere close to changing.",News/US news,"After Buffalo race massacre, rightwing pundits focus on … anything else | Andrew Lawrence",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/right-wing-conservative-reaction-buffalo-shooting
5/17/2022,"A man who stalked women in the woods has been found guilty of bludgeoning a police community support officer to death. Callum Wheeler chased and ambushed Julia James, 53, with a 3kg metal railway jack as she walked her dog near her home in Snowdown, Kent, in April last year. The 22-year-old, who was described by police as a “loner”, was convicted of murder after a six-day trial at Canterbury crown court. The court heard James had twice spotted Wheeler lurking in the woods in the months before the murder, telling her husband that she had passed “a really weird dude”. In February 2021 the couple saw him loitering in the same place. Several witnesses also spotted Wheeler acting suspiciously in the area in the days leading up to the brutal attack on 27 April. In that same period, Wheeler visited pornographic websites 42 times and searched the word “rape”. There was no evidence of sexual assault but the prosecutor questioned why Wheeler’s DNA had been found near the breast area of a vest James wore under her jumper and coat. On Monday, Wheeler refused to stand and had to be held up by members of staff as a jury of eight women and four men returned its verdict in one hour and 10 minutes. Wheeler, who is being held at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital, was carried into the dock earlier in the day. Speaking outside court, James’s daughter, Bethan Coles, 33, fought back tears as she said: “It’s surreal, it’s been like an out of body experience sometimes to be hearing these awful things and it to be your mum. It’s very difficult. “I think [Wheeler’s] just a vile excuse for a human being. He needs to be held accountable for what he’s done to my mum but I think what is important is that he clearly is a threat to women so it’s important in keeping other women safe.” James’s son Patrick Davis, 24, branded Wheeler a “monster”. Her husband, Paul, heaped praise on his wife for helping people, particularly victims of domestic violence, through her work. He said: “She was just amazing – I was so proud of her. The work she did was just amazing, to help so many other people, women who were in danger from men, bad men.” The 58-year-old hypnotherapist said Wheeler would have gone on to kill again, saying: “For a lot of other people that would have got worse had Julia not died.“What that guy was intending to do in my opinion, he was going to hurt many, many women, do lots of bad things.” Officers from Kent police also paid tribute to James, a “dedicated and devoted” officer, who joined the force in 2008. Deputy chief constable Tim Smith said the case was “extremely poignant”, adding: “Many of our staff knew Julia intimately as a friend. The impact on us has been far more profound than any other murder in the county. Julia was very much loved and known by staff of all ranks and roles. “There is a very personal impact on us as a force. We miss her greatly.” In her closing speech on Monday, the prosecutor, Alison Morgan QC, described Wheeler as “an angry, violent, strange, highly sexualised man” who waited in Ackholt Wood in Snowdown for “a lone female” to attack. “There is no mental health defence available to him,” she said. But the defence barrister, Oliver Blunt QC, questioned whether Wheeler had the “requisite intent” to kill. After his arrest on 7 May 2021, he exposed himself to female police officers and tried to masturbate in front of them before asking to be “spanked”. He told custody staff that James deserved to die and said that if he was released he would rape and kill women. He said: “You can’t go into the woods and expect to be safe.” He said he would go back to the scene of his crime and “have sex with women without their consent”. James, a mother of two, had been walking her jack russell, Toby, to an area of Ackholt Wood she knew as “butterfly corner” when she spotted Wheeler. Her Apple smartwatch revealed how her heart rate and pace increased dramatically as she ran for her life. But Wheeler chased her down and struck her over the head with a railway jack, inflicting what a pathologist described as “unsurvivable injuries”. The random nature of the attack led police to believe Wheeler may have killed again. He spent the days after the attack roaming around the area with the murder weapon – a 97cm-long cylindrical bar used to lift train tracks – protruding from his bag. It was later found in his bedroom. The senior investigating officer, Det Supt Gavin Moss, said: “The level of resources used was justified because we cannot know that he wouldn’t have done it again.” Born in Southwark in February 2000, Wheeler is the youngest of three sons. He had a history of mental health problems and dropped out of school at 15, failing to achieve GCSEs. He moved to Aylesham, Kent, with his father and younger brother about two years ago after his parents separated. Police described Wheeler, who has no previous convictions or cautions, as an “absolute loner” who did not even have a relationship with the brother he lived with. Moss said: “Wheeler wasn’t studying. He wasn’t working. I would describe him as a complete and utter loner … This was somebody who had a life that existed of absolutely nothing. He’d spend most of his time watching TV in his bedroom. “He had no friends … Even his mobile telephone had very few contacts, so we knew very little about him.”",News/UK news,Julia James killing: man found guilty of murdering PCSO in Kent,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/julia-james-killing-man-found-guilty-of-bludgeoning-pcso-to-death
5/17/2022,"The US will send up to 500 soldiers back on full-time deployment to Somalia, to train the country’s army to combat the increasing threat posed by al-Shabaab militants. The White House insisted that the move, deepening the US long-term military commitment in an intractable foreign conflict, did not contradict Joe Biden’s overall policy of disengaging from “forever wars”, which underlay the withdrawal from Afghanistan. The decision does not affect overall deployments in the region, officials said on Monday, but replaces a rotating deployment with a “persistent” presence – longer tours by the same special forces soldiers. They argued the deployment should not be called permanent, as that implied the soldiers would be there forever. The move marks a reversal of Donald Trump’s abrupt decision, in the last weeks of his presidency, to withdraw 750 US troops who had been stationed in Somalia until then. A senior administration official called Trump’s decision “irrational”. “It was an abrupt and sudden transition to a rotational presence,” the official said. “Since then, al-Shabaab, the terrorist group in Somalia that is al-Qaida’s largest, wealthiest and deadliest affiliate, has unfortunately only grown stronger. It has increased the tempo of its attacks, including against US personnel.” The official said that having a rotational presence had increased the security risks to US troops as they moved in and out of the country, and had disrupted the training of Somali forces by constantly changing the US trainers. The White House said that the deployment would be “fewer than 500” soldiers. The New York Times reported that the cap would be 450. The aim will be to boost the capacity of Somali forces to disrupt al-Shabaab sufficiently so the group is not able to plot attacks against the US, such as the January 2020 assault on the American airbase at Manda Bay in Kenya. That same month, US prosecutors charged a Kenyan national with involvement in an al-Shabaab plot to carry out a 9/11-style attack on a US city. The Kenyan had been trying to learn how to fly large planes in the Philippines when he was arrested. The Pentagon proposed the change some months ago, and Biden is reported to have approved the decision earlier this month, but the timing of the announcement was determined in part by the re-election by the country’s parliament on Sunday of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, ending months of uncertainty. Outgoing president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed’s term ended in February 2021 without an election. The protracted dispute that followed turned violent at times and caused divisions at the highest levels of government. On Monday, the United Nations, the African Union, the EU and diplomats congratulated Mohamud and expressed hopes that his election would enable political reconciliation. “This is someone with whom we are familiar given that he served as president 2012 to 2017,” the senior US official said. “Maybe even more importantly, I would say that across Somali leadership there is consistency in terms of support for collaboration on counter-terrorism.” The official suggested the decision had taken time because of Biden’s caution over sending US troops into a conflict zone. “He takes seriously his obligation to ask tough questions and to make sure he understands the full ramifications – the risks as well as the potential benefits,” the official said. “Once he worked through that process, once he had his questions answered, he was ultimately comfortable approving this proposal from the secretary of defence.”",News/US news,Biden reverses Trump withdrawal of US army trainers from Somalia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/us-military-somalia-al-shabaab-biden-trump
5/17/2022,"The government’s counter-terrorism programme has been too focused on rightwing extremism and should now crack down on Islamist extremism, according to leaked draft extracts from a landmark review of the Prevent strategy. In one particularly provocative recommendation, seen by the Guardian, the review claims there has been a “double standard” approach to tackling different forms of extremism, with individuals targeted for expressing mainstream rightwing views because the definition of neo-nazism has expanded too widely, while the focus on Islamist extremism has been too narrow. The leaks, from the government-commissioned Prevent review being carried out by Sir William Shawcross, are likely to be deeply controversial. They come days after a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where a self-confessed white supremacist shot 11 black and two white victims in what authorities described as a “racially motivated hate crime”. Sir Peter Fahy, the former police lead for Prevent, said the review extracts suggested Shawcross’s findings were an unwarranted attempt to “politicise counter-terrorism policing” and it was “quite dangerous to play off one ideology against another”. The draft Shawcross review also claims that: a renewed focus on Islamist extremism is needed, including when individuals do not yet meet the terrorism threshold. individuals have been referred to Prevent, the government’s anti-extremism programme, to access mental health support even when there is no evidence of extremism. some Prevent-funded groups have promoted extremist narratives including support for the Taliban. The long-delayed review by Shawcross, which was delivered to the Home Office at the end of April, has already drawn criticism from civil society groups, dozens of whom have declined to participate. Shawcross, a former head of the charity watchdog, has made controversial comments about Islam. In 2012, as a director of the neoconservative thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, he said: “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future. I think all European countries have vastly, very quickly growing Islamic populations.” The number of referrals to Prevent relating to far-right extremism exceeded those for Islamist radicalisation for the first time last year. Referrals for far-right threats from the Prevent programme to Channel, which provides more intensive intervention, had already outstripped Islamist radicalisation since 2020. In Shawcross’s draft review of the Prevent programme, he argues that its purpose must be refocused and says its first objective, to tackle the causes of radicalisation and respond to the ideological challenge of terrorism, “is not being sufficiently met”. It argues that the programme must re-engage with individuals who are not yet posing a terror threat but who can “create an environment conducive to terrorism”. One extract says Prevent has a “double standard when dealing with extreme rightwing and Islamism”. It says the programme has taken an expansive view on rightwing terror, which has “been so broad it has included mildly controversial or provocative forms of mainstream, rightwing-leaning commentary that have no meaningful connection to terrorism or radicalisation”. However, it says a more hardline approach should be taken towards Islamist extremism, and that the programme has concentrated on proscribed organisations, “ignoring Islamist narratives”. The draft review is also critical of Prevent-funded civil society organisations and community projects, suggesting funding is misallocated to “generic” projects and few “could be seen to publicly contest extremist discourse”. It found that some Prevent-funded programmes “have promoted extremist narratives, including statements that appear supportive of the Taliban”. The draft says: “As a core principle, the government must cease to engage with or fund those aligned with extremism.” Another extract says Prevent is “carrying the weight” for overstretched mental health services and that vulnerable people have been referred in order to access other forms of support even when they do not pose a terror threat. It is understood that the report has been finalised by Shawcross and his team. It is still to be fact-checked before being subjected to legal checks in case any person or group can claim they have been libelled, which would potentially expose the Home Office, which picked Shawcross for the role despite extensive misgivings, to paying out legal damages. Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police and head of Prevent until 2015, told the Guardian: “There is a danger of policing thought as opposed to the risk of violence. It is not about ideology but about the risk someone will cross into violence. “It is about threat, risk and harm. We know there has been an increase in far-rightwing extremism in the UK. The worst terrorist attack in Europe was by a rightwing terrorist, Anders Breivik. “It sounds to me quite dangerous to play off one ideology against another. There is a danger this is an attempt to politicise counter-terrorism policing. How are the police supposed to judge what is mainstream? Police operate on what is the likelihood of this person being drawn into violence, not whether their views are mainstream.” The draft extracts are also likely to raise eyebrows in the intelligence services. Ken McCallum, the domestic spy agency’s director general, recently warned that extreme rightwing terrorism accounted for one in five of all counter-terrorism investigations, a threat that had “grown and morphed quite substantially over the last five to 10 years”. A particular problem, he said, was the “high prevalence” of teenagers in rightwing terrorism investigations, which he suggested was because youngsters were being swept up in a “toxic ideology” of “online extremists and echo chambers”. The Home Office has proscribed a number of far-right groups in recent years, including the neo-Nazi group Sonnenkrieg Division, members of which have been jailed for serious offences. It also recognised the extreme rightwing group System Resistance Network as an alias of the already proscribed organisation National Action. Prevent came under renewed scrutiny after the murder of the Conservative MP David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency surgery by Ali Harbi Ali, who said he was motivated by Islamist extremism. His murder last year was followed by another Islamist attack on Liverpool women’s hospital. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Prevent remains a vital tool for early intervention and safeguarding. We will not allow extremists or terrorists to spread hate or sow division, and Prevent remains an important driver to help divert people away from harm. “The independent review of Prevent, led by William Shawcross, will ensure we continue to improve our response and better protect people from being drawn into poisonous and dangerous ideologies. The report is currently being finalised and once formally received and after full consideration, the report and the government’s response to it will be published.”",News/UK news,Leaked Prevent review attacks ‘double standards’ on far right and Islamists,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/leaked-prevent-review-attacks-double-standards-on-rightwingers-and-islamists
5/17/2022,"The Duke of Sussex has urged world leaders to prevent social media companies from using children as “digital experiments to make money”, as he supported calls for legislation to rein in tech firms. Prince Harry said the social media industry makes unbelievable amounts of money by “vacuuming” up time and information from users, adding that children should “demand better”. “We want all children to feel empowered to speak up and demand change,” he said at the virtual launch of a global child online safety toolkit hosted by UK campaign group the 5Rights Foundation. “We’re at a critical moment where it will take all of us for children to thrive in the digital world.” Harry said the world needed new digital laws to protect children, such as those being introduced in California, the EU and the UK. In the UK the government is pushing through the online safety bill requiring tech firms to protect children and adults from harmful online content. “We need new laws. We need public pressure. We need strong leadership,” he said. The prince also said there should be research into what information companies are hiding behind closed doors, in an apparent reference to the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who revealed last year that the social media company knew its content was causing harm to young users. Harry added that he and his wife, Meghan, were concerned about their children being part of the “next generation growing up in a world where they are treated as digital experiments for companies to make money and where things like hatred and harm are somehow normalised”. The prince has criticised social media companies in the past for failing to tackle problems on their platforms. Last year he said “time is running out” for the industry to address misinformation which he believes is a threat to democracies.

5/17/2022,"Élisabeth Borne, who has been appointed France’s first woman prime minister in more than 30 years, has a reputation as a technocrat with a long career in many different government ministries and local administrations. She is experienced in negotiating with trade unions, seen as crucial as Emmanuel Macron prepares an overhaul of the pensions and benefits system which could lead to street protests. The 61-year-old engineer, who had previously headed Paris’s state transport company, RATP, was fiercely loyal to the centrist president during his first term, when she served as minister for transport, environment and finally labour from 2020. Borne, who describes herself as a “woman of the left” has been a regular in the corridors of French power for several decades, serving as an adviser to ministers on under François Mitterrand and advising the Socialist environment minister Ségolène Royal in 2014. She also worked on urban planning at Paris city hall under the leftwing mayor Bertrand Delanoë. During Macron’s first term in office, Borne often contested the view that the pro-business president had veered from his stance of “neither left nor right” to firmly centre right. Borne, who describes herself as driven by “social justice and equal opportunities” would repeat Macron’s argument that “helping everyone to free themselves through work is a value of the left”. She told Le Figaro last year: “Social democracy is still alive and it’s the president who is leading it.” Borne was raised in Paris. Her mother was from Normandy and the daily Libération has reported that her father was Jewish with Russian roots, from a family who had taken refuge in France in 1939. A member of the French Resistance, he was deported in 1942 and died in 1972, when she was a child. When Borne served as the first female prefect of the western region of Poitou-Charentes, as she signed her first decree of French naturalisation for a person who had obtained citizenship, she reportedly cited her own family roots which she said symbolised the integration of refugees in France. Known to discreetly vape, even in parliament, Borne was regularly on television at the height of the Covid pandemic to remind French people to work from home and defend the government’s job protection scheme. She has said, however, that she is not interested in putting herself centre-stage, and Ifop poll last month found she was not a household name. Forty-five per cent of respondents said they didn’t know who she was. Borne was admitted to hospital with Covid in March 2021 and was administered oxygen, an experience she described as nerve-wracking. She is said to be precise on technical detail. She is a lover of maths, saying she finds in numbers “something quite reassuring, quite rational”. Agence France-Presse said that behind the scenes in the ministries where she served, she was nicknamed “Borne out” for the demands she made of her collaborators, a play on words with “burn out”.",News/World news,Élisabeth Borne: a long-serving technocrat and ‘woman of the left’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/elisabeth-borne-a-long-serving-technocrat-and-woman-of-the-left
5/17/2022,"The government is concerned that the £4.25bn takeover of Chelsea could collapse because of the alleged refusal by Roman Abramovich to accept a new sale structure proposed by ministers. With the deadline for the deal to be completed less than a fortnight away Whitehall insiders have said there are fears of Chelsea going out of business. The government is determined that none of the proceeds from the club being sold to Todd Boehly’s consortium go to Abramovich, who put the European champions up for sale when he was hit with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Chelsea, whose special operating licence expires on 31 May, require government approval before the deal goes through. But talks over what will happen to Abramovich’s £1.6bn loan to the club have stalled, heightening concerns over the deadline for the sale being missed. The government’s proposal is for a two-stage process in which the £2.5bn from the sale to Boehly’s group would go into an escrow account, where it would be held until it is satisfied the funds will go to a charity for victims of the war in Ukraine. But Westminster sources have said the deal has been held up by the club’s ownership structure. Chelsea’s parent company, Fordstam Ltd, owes £1.6bn to Camberley International Investments, a Jersey-based company with suspected links to Abramovich. The government has claimed that Abramovich and Chelsea want the loan repaid and then frozen before it goes to a charitable foundation. The government is insistent that would break the terms of the sanctions imposed on Abramovich. Whitehall insiders also say they are yet to see legal assurances that the money will not eventually end up going to the Russian oligarch and need guarantees the funds will reach good causes. Chelsea and a spokesperson for Abramovich have been approached for comment. Abramovich’s camp have previously denied claims that the billionaire could hold up the deal by reneging on his promise to write off his loan to Chelsea. Abramovich has insisted the charitable foundation will be an independent organisation and will be run by the former head of a United Nations organisation with no previous connection to him. Chelsea have been represented in talks with the government by the club’s chairman, Bruce Buck, and the powerful director Marina Granovskaia. Buck and Granovskaia, both of whom have long-term ties to Abramovich, are expected to be retained by Boehly’s group.",Sport/Football,Chelsea sale in danger of collapse as talks over Roman Abramovich loan stall,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/chelsea-sale-in-danger-of-collapse-as-talks-over-roman-abramovich-loan-stall
5/17/2022,"Boris Johnson has said a legal move to ditch parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is only an “insurance” policy, as it emerged that the controversial legislation has been delayed for some weeks. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is expected to give a combative statement on Tuesday threatening to bring forward the draft legislation, after a cabinet discussion on Northern Ireland. However, the timetable for the draft laws has now slipped, with the text now only promised before the summer break, according to Whitehall sources. The plans to take unilateral action was causing a “wobble” in Westminster on Monday night after the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson went further than before in a press interview and warned he would not go back not go back into the Stormont executive until new laws was “enacted” . “We’ve come all this way to get them back into the assembly; commit to legislation, risk a trade war and that’s not enough for the DUP. There is now real concern as to whether this strategy will work at all,” said a senior source. The prime minister came under sharp criticism from all sides on Monday when he flew into Belfast in an effort to revive the devolved government at Stormont, amid the continuing row over the protocol. One of the major sticking points is the protocol aligning Northern Ireland’s trade with the EU rather than the rest of the UK, with the DUP refusing to return to power-sharing without major changes. Within the UK’s Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU, the Northern Ireland protocol lays out arrangements that effectively keep Northern Ireland in the single market, drawing a customs border between it and the rest of the UK, with checks on goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That means there is no requirement for checks across the UK's land border with Ireland. The 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal requires keeping the land border open and that there be no new infrastructure such as cameras and border posts. However. both the British government and the European Union recognise that the implementation of this deal has triggered the disruption of supply chains, increased costs and reduced choice for consumers in Northern Ireland.  The rules means that goods such as milk and eggs have to be inspected when they arrive in Northern Ireland from mainland Britain, while some produce, such as chilled meats, cannot be imported at all. This is because the EU does not want to risk them entering the single market over the land border and then being transported on. What is article 16? Article 16 is an emergency brake in the Irish protocol, that allows either side to take unilateral action if the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist”, or diversion of trade. Serious difficulties are not defined, giving both sides leeway for interpretation.  This would launch a process defined in the treaty as “consultations … with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution”. Article 16 is meant to be a temporary timeout, not an escape hatch. During his visit, Johnson said he was committed to negotiations with the EU on the protocol but that he would not be dragging his heels on potential legislation if talks did not result in a solution. He said: “We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west. “But to get that done, to have the insurance, we need to proceed with a legislative solution as well.” Johnson said the UK does not want to “scrap” the Northern Ireland protocol, but believes it can be “fixed”. He told broadcasters during a trip to Belfast: “We don’t want to scrap it. But we think it can be fixed.And actually five of the five parties I talked to today also think it needs reform.” No 10 has not appeared to be as keen as Truss on the option of legislation to undermine the protocol in recent days. One diplomatic source said one of the prime minister’s top aides had been privately telling people that the government was very committed to negotiations and no decision had been taken on pressing ahead with the legislation. Delegations from the five main political parties questioned Downing Street’s credibility and post-Brexit strategy after meeting Johnson in separate back-to-back talks at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. Several hundred protesters outside the castle set the mood by jeering the prime minister’s cavalcade and holding placards saying “Back off Boris!” Downing Street had expressed hope of calming tensions heightened by the DUP blocking an assembly and executive at Stormont in protest at the Irish Sea border. Instead rhetoric escalated, with Sinn Féin, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and Alliance accusing Johnson of not acting in the interests of Northern Ireland. Several delegations questioned the point of the visit. Downing Street had signalled hope that a move towards potentially overriding parts of the protocol would encourage the DUP to make a swift return to Stormont but the party leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, insisted only actions, not words, would revive the Good Friday agreement institutions. “The DUP has a mandate to see the protocol replaced with arrangements that restore our place within the UK internal market. Our mandate will be respected.” The tone reinforced signals from DUP sources who said the party will need more than an announcement of legislation to override the protocol – it will need legislation to clear hurdles at Westminster and appear on track to become law. While the DUP publicly doubted the value of Johnson’s word, Sinn Féin accused him of complicity with the DUP in obstructing devolved government. “The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,” said the party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, after meeting the prime minister. She said he gave “no straight answers” during a “very tough meeting”. Most of the protesters outside Hillsborough were nationalists who demanded that Johnson protect the protocol. Others were campaigners for an Irish language act and for justice for relatives of people killed during the Troubles, two additional controversies confronting Downing Street. Johnson put on a brave face after the meetings. “Everybody should be rolling up their sleeves and getting stuck into the government of Northern Ireland,” he told reporters during a visit to Thales, an air defence manufacturer in east Belfast. Naomi Long, leader of Alliance, the third biggest party, said most people and businesses in Northern Ireland favoured pragmatic solutions to the protocol. “Despite this, the foreign secretary will make a statement tomorrow to set the scene on unilaterally making changes to the protocol. That is not the way to business. Trust is the key ingredient and that involves keeping agreements, not breaking them. There is talk about safe landing zones on this matter. But as the pilot, Boris Johnson and the UK government is poised to crash the plane tomorrow.” Colum Eastwood, the MP and SDLP leader, said he had a “robust” meeting with the prime minister. “Boris Johnson’s actions over the last two years and his words today is so great that it makes it impossible to trust the prime minister. He has recklessly used this place to serve his own narrow political interests and once again he is on the verge of overriding the interests of the majority of people here for his own ends.” Another UK source suggested that there was an “a priori” issue with the protocol as it needed to be re-opened for issues such as governance but this was not the same as scrapping it. The UK’s proposal to soften the role of the European court of justice and make an EU-UK arbitration board the first port of call in disputes would require a section of the protocol to be re-opened with new wording approved by each.",News/UK news,"Plan to scrap parts of Northern Ireland protocol is only an ‘insurance policy’, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/plan-to-scrap-parts-of-northern-ireland-protocol-is-only-an-insurance-policy-says-boris-johnson
5/17/2022,"Great news, eh? The energy price cap will rise again in October and then there will be only another three months, rather than six, to wait until the next increase in bills. If that does not seem like an unalloyed benefit, Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, would like you to remember that energy costs can fall as well as rise. The proposed shortening of the timetable for adjusting the price cap would mean “any price falls would be delivered more quickly to consumers”, he said. That is true, of course: the cap works off wholesale prices in the preceding period, so a faster recalculation will reduce the lag effect, whatever the direction of the move. This suits the energy regulator’s purposes, one suspects, because its next worry – when wholesale energy prices do eventually fall – is being blamed for delays in lowering bills. Quicker adjustments may marginally reduce the sense that prices go up like a rocket but come down like a feather. Does the switch make economic sense, though? Probably. But Ofgem would be wise not to overstate matters. There is a benefit to companies in the form of reducing their “volume risk”, as the jargon has it: if wholesale prices were to plunge suddenly, the worry in boardrooms is that customers, for whom energy has been bought at high prices, will desert for cheaper fixed-price deals elsewhere. But the gain for companies, which in theory should be passed on to customers, is not enormous. And a disadvantage for consumers is that new entrants could be discouraged. At this point in the game, we would probably settle for a market in which companies are able to cope with a bout of volatility without falling over like a pack of cards. Twenty-nine suppliers have collapsed so far, shoving about £2bn of cleanup costs on to billpayers. Yet a fiddle with the price cap, which may not have saved a single supplier, is only a minor change. Ofgem’s more important ideas for reform are those that will erect ringfences around customers’ deposits and ensure companies’ balance sheets can withstand financial stress. Those ideas remain the main regulatory event. Ofgem needs to hurry up the hard stuff that some suppliers will not like. The exit of McDonald’s from Russia turns the spotlight on those western consumer giants still continuing to operate in the country. One is Unilever, the Dove-to-Wall’s-ice-cream group. So it was intriguing to see its former chief executive Paul Polman pop on Twitter to laud the McDonald’s move as “courageous”. Polman did not join the dots to his old shop but others will. Why is Unilever still operating in Putin-land? The short answer is that the current chief executive, Alan Jope, takes the view that ceasing imports and exports to Russia, and starving the local operation of capital expenditure and an advertising budget, is a better response. Simply closing four factories would expose employees, especially local bosses, to punishment by the Kremlin, the argument goes. Unilever says it will not profit from its presence in Russia but “will continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country”. Since one of the main products is a local ice-cream brand, the definition of “essential” is being stretched but you get the picture: Unilever’s defence is that it has responsibilities to its employees. But so, of course, does McDonald’s, which said it considered the “dedication and loyalty” of local staff and suppliers but concluded that some things were more important. In other words, operating in Russia is incompatible with being a grownup western business. Nobody should deny the complexities here but Unilever’s stance looks increasingly misguided and isolated. McDonald’s will seek to offload its Russian operations to a local buyer while retaining its trademarks. It is hard to understand why Unilever cannot do the same. For most consumers, a new sofa or kitchen table is a deferrable purchase, so one shouldn’t be surprised that the online furniture retailer Made.com is in the profits warning business. Yet the size of Monday’s alert was extraordinary. As recently as March, the company expected revenues to improve by 25-35% this year. Now its best outcome imagines no growth, and its “lower guidance” foresees a 15% decline. In the process, the arrival of profits (at an “adjusted Ebitda” level, note) has been deferred for another year. Since last year’s £775m flotation, the shares have fallen almost 75% in a straight line, more or less. They will find a floor eventually but the listing price was plainly an exercise in optimism. Made, then as now, has an innovative model that has much to prove.",News/Business,Fiddling with the energy price cap is the tip of the iceberg.

5/17/2022,"Owen Farrell is ready to make his return to the England fold this week with Eddie Jones announcing a squad to begin preparations for this summer’s tour of Australia on Tuesday but it remains to be seen if he will resume the captaincy. Farrell missed out on the Six Nations to undergo ankle surgery for the second time this season but he has demonstrated his form and fitness on his return to action with Saracens. Had Saracens won their Challenge Cup semi-final against Toulon last Saturday, Farrell would have been busy planning for another major final but Jones is able to pick from all 13 clubs for the camp, which runs from Sunday to next Tuesday, given there are no Premiership sides left in Europe. During the Six Nations Tom Curry and then Courtney Lawes led the side and, though Farrell’s absence was felt in a campaign that yielded just two victories, there are no guarantees he will return to the role. Lawes was thought to be in danger of missing Northampton’s run-in with a gruesome thumb injury that could have put his place on the tour in jeopardy but he has made a remarkable recovery. Though England suffered defeats by Ireland and France under his watch, the 33-year-old flanker is a popular leader among the squad. Henry Arundell, the 19-year-old London Irish full-back who scored a spectacular length-of-the-field try in the Challenge Cup earlier this month, is also expected to feature in a squad of around 36 players. Arundell is also eligible for Wales and Scotland but has represented England at age-group level and Jones recently visited London Irish to cast his eye over the teenager. Elsewhere, after the Sale scrum-half Raffi Quirke was ruled out of the summer tour with a hamstring injury, Leicester’s Jack van Poortvliet is thought to be under consideration for the Australia trip. Van Poortvliet has been carefully managed by the Tigers this season, making only six league starts and featuring predominantly from the bench, but has impressed the coaching staff and, like Arundell, has prospered at U20 level. The camp marks the start of England’s preparations for the three-Test series against the Wallabies. Whether Jones opts to select players such as Anthony Watson and Jonny May – both of whom are nearing their returns from long-term injuries – is likely to be indicative of his summer plans. It is unclear whether Ben Youngs will be available to tour but Jones is expected to go full throttle against Australia with the 2023 World Cup in France looming. There may be some fringe players included on Tuesday however, with a view to the Barbarians match on 19 June, for which Premiership finalists will not be available. It is also thought that the England management has been monitoring Mako Vunipola, who has not played for his country at all this season, having been one of the senior players omitted in September. Vunipola has, however, only just returned to action with Saracens following an ankle injury so the mini-camp may come too soon for the 31-year-old loosehead prop. Curry sustained an ankle injury in Sale’s last outing against Racing 92 in the European Championship Cup quarter-finals but it is not thought to be serious.",Sport/Sport,Owen Farrell to make England return from injury but captaincy undecided,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/16/owen-farrell-to-make-england-return-from-injury-but-captaincy-undecided
5/17/2022,"The images of a besuited Ferdinand Marcos Jr, clad in a top hat and leaning nonchalantly on a Rolls-Royce, dating from his time in Britain in the 1970s are as you may expect from the playboy scion of a kleptocratic dictator. Yet as the Marcos family returns to power in the Philippines after a landslide presidential victory by Marcos Jr, he is facing calls to stop misrepresenting the circumstances of his studies at Oxford. The university has confirmed that he did not complete his BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics after enrolling in 1975. “According to our records, he did not complete his degree, but was awarded a special diploma in social studies in 1978,” Oxford said in a response to a freedom of information request lodged by a UK-based Filipina supporter of Marcos Jr’s nearest rival in last week’s election. Marcos Jr, nicknamed “Bongbong”, has claimed in interviews that Oxford issued him with a bachelor’s degree, while his official spokesperson has said that the politician and his team “stand by the degree confirmation which was issued by the University of Oxford”. His website states: “He completed his undergraduate studies at Oxford University and graduated with a special diploma in social studies.” But a UK-based Filipina supporter of Marcos Jr’s rival Leni Robredo, who lodged the FoI request, said of Marcos: “He should stop misrepresenting his special diploma, which is clearly not a degree. It’s clear he did not complete undergraduate studies.” She added: “In the grand scheme of things, it may not seem so important, as our constitution states that presidential candidates only have to be literate and be a citizen of a certain age. But it’s a big thing in the Philippines if you have studied abroad and people are impressed by that. What he has been saying about that is a reflection on his personality and character. It’s also a reflection of a pattern of disinformation that a lot of researchers have pointed out recently.” After years of rebranding its image, the Marcos family seems to be back in power. Ongoing counts on Friday also showed that his political allies were set to capture most of the 300-seat House of Representatives and half of the 24-seat senate, which was also up for election. Marcos Jr received more than 31 million votes in the unofficial count, with projections showing one of the largest majorities in decades. The result comes after an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the family and undermine their opponents. The issue of Marcos Jr’s Oxford degree first emerged seven years ago when his profile on the website for the Philippines senate stated that he had obtained an Oxford degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). Newly published letters last year revealed that the envoys for his father had lobbied senior figures at Oxford University’s St Edmund Hall to preserve the son’s academic career after he failed examinations on a number of occasions. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23, and later governor. He was 29 when his father – who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 – was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Previously published documents revealed that Marcos failed two of his three preliminary exams at Oxford in the summer of 1976, later doing only enough to pass one of two resits – failing politics for a second time. Discussions followed between emissaries of Marcos Sr and John Kelly, the principal of St Edmund Hall, who was asked if they could “think of any special circumstances which would warrant the college departing from its normal rule”. A deal was eventually hammered out in which Marcos was allowed to continue his PPE studies but was transferred to a special diploma in social sciences, a programme that has since been discontinued. Marcos Jr is not the only famous person to have presented a well-seasoned CV. Gillian McKeith, the You Are What You Eat presenter, agreed in 2007 to drop the title Dr from her company’s advertising after a complaint to the industry watchdog. The complaint was brought by a Guardian reader who learned of McKeith’s academic credentials from a Bad Science column by Ben Goldacre. Andrea Leadsom, in the midst of 2016 Tory leadership campaign, published a revised CV after claims that she had exaggerated her roles in a City of London career. Former colleagues claimed she had exaggerated the importance of her roles at Barclays and Invesco Perpetual. Mina Chang, a senior official in the administration of Donald Trump, was caught out in 2019 after flaunting a Harvard education that in fact amounted to a seven-week course in 2016. She was also found to have invented herself a role on a UN panel and even created a fake Time magazine cover with her face on it. Craig Butfoy was jailed in March for lying about his flying experience to get a job with British Airways. He is also accused of giving false details on his CV, including that he had held a private pilot’s licence since 1998, and fabricated documents, including a training course certificate. Jeffrey Archer, the author and disgraced politician, was accepted on a one-year course at Oxford University’s Department of Education after claiming he had six O-levels and three A-levels. He actually had three O-levels and no A-levels. The three A-levels that never were saw him accepted for a one-year diploma course at Oxford’s Brasenose college, yet he fostered the impression that he had completed a full degree course. Lee McQueen won a six-figure job in June 2008 with Sir Alan Sugar in the final of the BBC show The Apprentice in spite of his claim that he had spent two years at university, when in fact he spent only four months there.

5/17/2022,"The stark division between British private and state schools is widely recognised by many of those in the centre, as well as on the left of politics, as perpetuating a centuries-old class system. Over recent decades, evidence has piled up of the extent to which fee-paying schools function as a pipeline to elite universities. These in turn function as a pipeline to elite jobs, and the incomes and prestige that go with them. Status is handed down through the generations. This is the reason for the Social Mobility Commission’s existence. Narrowing the gap between the outcomes of private and state-educated children has been an aim of successive governments – although many of the policies pursued since 2010 have worked against it. The pandemic made this task harder. Last year’s GCSE and A-level results in England showed the gap between private and state schools getting wider. There was also a marked disparity between grades gained by pupils in London and the south-east, and the north of England. (Elsewhere in the UK, the SNP has been criticised for lack of progress on attainment.) Given the emphasis that Boris Johnson’s government has placed on levelling up, you might think cabinet members would support efforts at sharing out opportunities more evenly. So it was disappointing to see the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, appearing to criticise the record of top universities that have widened participation. Both Cambridge and Oxford now offer about 70% of places to state-school pupils, up from 62% (Cambridge) and 56% (Oxford) seven years ago. Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, said recently that the proportion of privately educated students would further decrease. But rather than signal approval, Mr Zahawi said admissions should be based on “merit and evidence”. The irony is that merit and evidence already inform current practice. Research has shown that state-school pupils outperform private-school peers in their degrees. This means there is an empirical basis for using contextual data in determining admissions, as Mr Zahawi himself has acknowledged. Given the vastly greater resources spent on the average private-school pupil, compared with the average state-school one, it would be misleading as well as unfair to treat A-level results as the only factor. And young people from fee-paying schools continue to gain a disproportionate share of places at top institutions. Their interests are championed by academics such as the Cambridge historian who said recently that white, privately educated boys are now “disadvantaged”. Mr Zahawi has won praise for his can-do energy since becoming education secretary. But a positive attitude is no substitute for policy. Given that council-run schools outperform academies in Ofsted rankings, the recent pledge to force all schools to join academy trusts looks reckless as well as over-familiar (having been tried before). The more urgent priorities ought to be England’s collapsing school buildings, with a budget for repairs currently being fought over with the Treasury, and further education and training, where rhetoric has still not translated into much needed investment. Cuts have led to teachers’ pay falling 9% in real terms over a decade, and contributed to worsening problems in retaining staff. Warm words about “great outcomes for every child” are all very well. When coupled with barbs at access initiatives, and lack of progress in other areas, they shrink to a soundbite.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the school divide: Zahawi fails a test | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-school-divide-zahawi-fails-a-test
5/17/2022,"According to a poll published in the United States earlier this month, one in three adults believes that an attempt is being made “to replace native-born Americans with immigrants in order to achieve electoral gains”. A similar proportion sees the cultural and economic influence of US-born Americans diminishing as a consequence. The vast majority of those holding these views are likely to be white. From being a fringe notion on the extreme right, “replacement theory” appears to be entering the bloodstream of mainstream political discourse in the US. This should be seen as an insidious, disturbing backdrop to the mass shooting that took place in Buffalo at the weekend. Payton Gendron, the teenage suspect, is charged with shooting 13 people – 11 of them black – in a supermarket in a black neighbourhood of the city. Ten died. The action appears to have been carried out alone, and the suspect reportedly posted an online “manifesto” in which replacement theory is melded with anti-black racism and antisemitic content and tropes. Most of its material seems to have been culled via solitary immersion in far-right websites. Black people, read one passage, were equivalent to immigrants in that they “invade our lands … live on government support and attack and replace our people”. Buffalo joins Charleston, El Paso and Pittsburgh as a site of bloody tragedy, after murderous attacks by lone white attackers. Last year the FBI identified the lethal rise of far-right terrorism aimed at minority ethnic groups as the biggest domestic security threat to America. Inevitably, there will now be renewed focus on President Biden’s stalling gun control programme – the latest to come up against the seemingly insuperable intransigence of Congress and the influence of the National Rifle Association. This was the deadliest mass shooting in America in 2022, but also the 198th to claim the lives of four or more people since the turn of the year. Despite Mr Biden’s commitment to reform, improved background checks and a ban on the kind of assault weapon used in Buffalo seem as far away as ever. Social media platforms will also come under renewed and deserved scrutiny. But there is a wider political context that needs to be recognised. The post-Trump radicalisation of parts of the Republican right has led to the cultivation of demographic and racial anxiety, succouring extremist views. Explicit references to race or ethnicity are usually absent from such interventions, allowing plausible deniability. The Fox News political commentator, Tucker Carlson, who hosts one of the most popular cable news shows in the US, regularly ploughs this furrow: in one show last year, Mr Carlson argued that Democrats are seeking “the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people”, who are “newly arrived from the third world”. Channelling and perpetuating the Trumpian “build a wall” mindset, senior Republican politicians have also used the language of replacement and “invasion” in relation to the southern border. Proposals for immigration amnesties have been conspiratorially framed as a means to secure a permanent liberal majority in Washington. Meanwhile the caricature of “critical race theory” as a pro-black threat to white identity has incubated the fear of a kind of “replacement” from within.

5/17/2022,"In the remote Northern Territory community of Ramingining, election day has already come and gone. The AEC polling booth visited the mostly Yolngu community, 500km east of Darwin in Arnhem Land, for a day last week. On the covered basketball court, a line of people stood patiently in 35-degree heat, to cast their vote in the electorate of Lingiari while CLP and Labor scrutineers looked on. Labor had star power on the court: NT senator, Yanyuwa woman Malarndirri McCarthy, was chatting with locals, in perhaps a sign of how worried the ALP is about the possibility of losing the seat for the first time. Lingiari is huge: 1.3m sq km, covering the entire NT outside of Darwin. It is named for the Gurindji leader Vincent Lingiari, who led his people in the historic walk-off at Wave Hill station in 1966, to protest for land rights and equal wages. Lingiari has been staunchly Labor since it was created in 2001. Retiring MP, Warren Snowdon has held the seat for the entirety of its existence. Snowdon is a territory icon, well known across all the bush communities where Labor dominates. His replacement, Tiwi woman Marion Scrymgour, is a former arts and environment minister in the Martin NT Labor government, and former CEO of the Northern Land Council. During the first weeks of the campaign, many of Labor’s corflutes pictured the two of them – Marion upfront, Warren over her shoulder – to reinforce their connection, presumably for bush voters. There are nine candidates running in the seat, but the race is between the two major parties. Damien Ryan is the CLP candidate, alongside Jacinta Price, whose move into the Senate is all but official. Both are prominent central Australians. Ryan has been the Alice Springs mayor for 13 years. He is campaigning on a platform of supporting business, infrastructure and “funding to grow our Pastoral, Agriculture, Mining and Tourism industry’s [sic]”, Ryan is popular among the locals of townships like Katherine, Tennant Creek and his hometown of Alice Springs, where the Coalition is hopeful he might win enough votes to get them over the line in Lingiari for the first time. Lingiari is one of the least populous electorates in the country, and divided along racial lines. According to the 2016 census, 40% of residents are Indigenous, living in remote and very remote communities, and while only about 40% of the eligible voting population is enrolled, the majority vote Labor. At the last federal election, Labor won 76.4% in votes taken by remote mobile polling teams. The CLP polls well in urban centres like Katherine and Tennant Creek, where Jacinta Price’s tough on crime stance is proving popular. Any election is a logistical feat in the NT, with the AEC relying on mobile polling teams travelling by plane, boat and 4WD, to collect votes in Fifo visits to remote communities like the one at Ramingining. But these blink-and-you’ll-miss-it voting opportunities are a big reason why voter turnout in the bush is so low. Postal voting is almost non-existent, and if people are away from home – for funerals, health business, ceremonial business or visiting family, they often miss their chance. The morning after Ramingining’s election day, AEC officials were heading to the Wulkarimirra outstation, about 20 minutes drive north-east towards the Arafura coast, on a corrugated dirt road, to set up the mobile polling booth.

Gathiya carefully parked the corflutes outside the shed while he went to check in. “Gotta be careful,” he said, “they’ve got a long way to go yet.”  Photographer Isabella Moore’s work in the Northern Territory is being supported by the Judith Neilsen Institute for Journalism and Ideas",News/Australia news,"In the battleground seat of Lingiari, the Coalition hopes to dim Labor’s star power with a first-time upset",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/in-the-battleground-seat-of-lingiari-the-coalition-hopes-to-dim-labors-star-power-with-a-first-time-upset
