3/9/2022,"In The Andy Warhol Diaries, a new six-episode Netflix documentary executive-produced by Ryan Murphy, the familiar details of the artist’s life are mostly covered within the first hour. There’s his tortured youth in Pittsburgh, where he drew portraits of his fellow schoolmates in attempts to stop their bullying; his early fondness for Campbell’s tomato soup; and his eventual escape to New York in 1949, at the age of 20. There, after transitioning from graphic design to fine art, he launches The Factory, his storied and sometimes exploitative studio in Union Square; he exhibits his first soup cans in 1962 and, by 1968, reaches pop stardom. Director Andrew Rossi’s focus, however, is mainly on the inner life Warhol painstakingly hid from view, namely the artist’s fraught relationship with his own homosexuality. “I grew up to understand my sexuality as a bisexual man in a very homophobic environment, and so he was a hero, always,” Rossi tells the Guardian, “but I never knew the details of his life.” In his reading of the original Andy Warhol Diaries, the artist’s titular memoir published in 1989, what he found was “not just a manipulative monster, or a happy fool, but rather a humanity that plays out in these very beautiful and intense romantic relationships”. The resulting documentary unfolds in a collage of found and recreated footage, based primarily on diary entries expressing Warhol’s great love for three main protagonists: the interior designer Jed Johnson, with whom he spent 12 years; the Paramount Pictures vice-president Jon Gould; and the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat. (By all accounts, the artists’ friendship was strictly platonic, but Diaries shows that Warhol’s attraction to Basquiat was partly paternal, partly sexual and partly opportunistic.) The dominant mood is a profound loneliness, as a version of Warhol’s voice, a combination of the actor Bill Irwin and the slightly robotic drone of artificial intelligence, reads passages from his diary. “When I think of my high school days, all I can remember are the long walks to school, past the babushkas and the overalls and the coal signs,” it says, as the camera pans over stunning B-roll of Pittsburgh’s industrial architecture. “I wasn’t very close to anyone, although I guess I wanted to be, because when I would see the kids telling one another their problems, I felt left out.” As far as Warhol’s relationships, “The fact that Andy shared a bed with Jed is something that not a lot of people know,” Rossi notes; the artist had been intensely private about his personal life. The suffocating homophobia that he had fled in Pittsburgh was also alive and well when he arrived in New York, where fellow queer artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns projected an aura of machismo that he could not. “They thought he was too swish,” gallerist Jeffrey Deitch says in episode one, deploying the derogatory slang of that era. Warhol felt a sense of alienation not only in the predominantly straight art world, but in queer spaces, too: “It was all guys with beards and lumberjack shirts and leather pants, and you know and he didn’t qualify within 10 miles of that,” according to critic Lucy Sante. “He was conscious of being unattractive, and that weighed heavily on him, going back to his childhood.” The secondary focus of Rossi’s documentary then becomes Warhol’s efforts at passing, not as a straight man per se, but as artist Glenn Ligon puts it, “the right kind of gay … a nice artist, acceptable gay.” In his immense fame, Warhol had faced relentless questioning of his personal life – “What do you think about sex?” – and in response, he distanced himself from his sexuality entirely. Despite the homoerotic imagery rampant throughout his work, he was able to convince enough people that he didn’t think about sex at all. “The way he presented himself was as asexual,” recounts Fab Five Freddy. “You would hear rumors, but he publicly kept that aspect of his life out of the picture.” The artist spent his life building a glamorous persona, “almost to shield himself” from a litany of gnawing insecurities, says curator Jessica Beck of the Warhol Museum. (As she’s speaking, she’s shown handling the artist’s trademark silver wigs, which he wore out of shame over his receding hairline.) To assuage his incessant fears of ageing and falling out of relevance, Warhol surrounded himself with the young, beautiful, or powerful: following his creation of The Factory in the 1960s, he befriended Keith Haring and Basquiat in the early 80s, just as the meteoric rise of their careers coincided with the decline of his. Early on in his relationship with the Waspy Jon Gould, he also briefly dressed in stylings of the 1981 bestseller The Official Preppy Handbook, a guide that allowed countless rust belt gay men like Andy to pass for middle class. “Within the diaries,” according to Beck, “there are these moments when the performance lapses.” From 1976 to 1987, Warhol would call his longtime friend Pat Hackett on weekdays at 9am, recounting the details of the day before. His intention was mainly to record his expenses for his tax auditors, but what emerged were invaluable glimpses into his honest, private mind. Entries range from mundane accounts of dinner parties – “The first course was crab meat and tomato aspic. You don’t see things like that any more” – to the anxieties that overtook the queer community during the HIV/Aids epidemic. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they started putting gays in concentration camps,” he wrote. Two years after Warhol’s death in 1987, Hackett published these notes as The Andy Warhol Diaries, the source material for the documentary. Despite Rossi’s access to Warhol’s innermost thoughts, mysteries remain where the artist lies or omits information for various reasons. (Gould, for example, had forbidden Warhol from referring to him in his diary, and insisted to his own friends and family that they had a non-sexual relationship.) Filling in the blanks, the documentarian’s talking heads provide what often amounts to speculation – conflicting ideas of how deeply queer themes can be read in his final body of work, or whether Warhol is a suitable gay icon at all. “He wasn’t the protest-march gay, you know, the lobbying Congress gay,” says Ligon. Much of the language of Warhol’s time is problematic today, including his references to Basquiat as “the big black painter” or Aids as “gay cancer”. What is undeniable, however, is Warhol’s impact on popular culture. “The key to Andy Warhol is reinvention,” Rossi says. “In the sort of pain of not being happy with what we are and the aspiration to be something bigger, he gave people permission to become another version of themselves.” The Andy Warhol Diaries is available on Netflix now",Arts/Television & radio,The Andy Warhol Diaries: the inner life of an artist no one really knew,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/the-andy-warhol-diaries-documentary-netflix
3/9/2022,"St Lucia’s independence day seemed a good time to search for this Caribbean island’s national bird: the St Lucia parrot. As its name suggests, this colourful species is found nowhere else on the planet. My guide, Willow, and I had been hearing the parrots’ calls for the past hour but the birds were always hidden in the thick canopy above. Now, at last, we reached a viewpoint overlooking the forest, where we had a real chance of seeing them. On brief excursions during our family holiday, I had already caught up with three of St Lucia’s five endemic species: the brightly coloured warbler, the elusive black finch, and the perky pewee, a type of flycatcher. Later I would also see the island’s eponymous oriole, an apparition in black and orange. But like most visiting birders, the one I really wanted to see was the parrot. We patiently scanned the tree canopy below. Eventually, with a raucous volley of calls, two stocky birds flew over the treetops: pea-green with a blue head, flashes of yellow and bright crimson wing-patches. It was well worth the wait. In 1979, when St Lucia won independence from the UK, there were fewer than 100 parrots. Today, thanks to conservationists, there are more than three times as many. So, exactly 43 years after the island finally achieved freedom, we could celebrate the comeback of this very special bird.",News/Environment,Birdwatch: St Lucia parrot adds colour to independence day celebrations,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/birdwatch-st-lucia-parrot-independence-day-species-conservation
3/9/2022,"Sadiq Khan has called on ministers to grant him powers to freeze private rents in London, amid a push by Labour over cost of living issues which also saw the party reiterate its call for the scrapping of the planned increase in national insurance contributions. The mayor has previously called on the government to allow him to put in place rent controls in London as a way to ease fast-rising costs, but has been rebuffed by ministers. Khan wants to freeze private rents for two years, saying this would save tenants an average of £3,000 during a period when other costs, notably for energy, are rising rapidly. An analysis produced by City Hall, based on estimates from the estate agent Savills, estimated that a rent freeze would halt increases that would average £881 in the first year and just over £2,100 in the second year. Ahead of his push to control some rents, made in 2019 before he sought re-election, Khan argued that such powers, which exist in cities such as Berlin and New York, were needed given the average private rent for a one-bedroom home in London was more than that for a three-bed home in every other region of England. The proportion of Londoners renting privately has more than doubled since 1990. Khan said: “Private renters make up nearly a third of everyone living in the capital and they are set to be hit by a devastating combination of price and bill rises. Too often the needs of private renters are ignored by both landlords and the government. “Rising fuel and energy costs, which will hit renters in energy-inefficient homes the hardest, are already causing anxiety and stress, with a big rise in the energy price cap due next month.” A rent freeze would, he argued, “give people a chance to get back on their feet after the pandemic”. Separately, Labour used its opposition day debate in the Commons on Tuesday to urge Conservative MPs to drop the national insurance rise in April on the basis of the cost of living crisis. A number of senior Tories have expressed public opposition to the rise, including the former cabinet minister David Frost and the Treasury select committee chair Mel Stride. Labour said it wanted to kickstart a renewed debate on the issue, although it ultimately declined to put the motion to a vote. Labour sources said it had been designed as the first move to renew pressure on the government as the spring spending statement approaches and with new fears about the costs of living because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.",Lifestyle/Money,Sadiq Khan renews call for private rent controls in London,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/09/sadiq-khan-renews-call-for-private-rent-controls-in-london
3/9/2022,"Standing in front of Lviv’s Latin cathedral, Lilya Onyshchenko offered her view of the invading Russians. “They are barbarians. They don’t care what they destroy,” she said. “I haven’t met Hitler. I think Putin is worse. He’s a devil, not a human,” she added, standing in the historic centre of one of Europe’s most culturally important cities. Behind her, construction workers were busy erecting scaffolding around a Renaissance chapel. The friezes showing Jesus – in the garden of Gethsemane, being arrested by Roman soldiers – were about to be wrapped up. Around the corner a team perched on a giant crane were boarding up the cathedral’s stain-glass windows. “If we lose our culture we lose our identity,” said Onyschenko, the head of Lviv’s city council heritage protection office. “Lviv has always been multicultural. Poles, Germans, Jews, Armenians and Hungarians built it. It’s Unesco listed.” She said she and her colleagues were working their way through a long list of objects that needed to be protected. Russia’s war on Ukraine has been an all-round disaster. Its army had shelled densely populated cities, killing hundreds. More than 2 million refugees have fled abroad in Europe’s biggest exodus since the second world war. In besieged Mariupol, families have spent more than a week living in desperate conditions without heat, water or power. Alongside this humanitarian catastrophe, cultural assets have been bombed and damaged. They include a museum in the city of Ivankiv, north-west of Kyiv, which housed dozens of works by the Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko, some now lost forever. Last week Russian forces shelled the assumption cathedral in Kharkiv, hurling debris into its knave. In a video recorded early on Tuesday Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Moscow had flattened a 19th-century wooden church in the village of Viazivka, in the western Zhytomyr region. “An act of genocide against the Ukrainian nation,” Olha Rutkovska, a member of the association for the protection of monuments, posted on Facebook. Many Ukrainians believe this vandalism is no accident. In an essay last summer Putin claimed Ukraine and Russia were “one people” and Zelenskiy has argued the Kremlin’s ultimate goal is the “erasure” of Ukraine as an independent sovereign state. That includes its language, people and culture, suppressed during previous eras of Russification. “The USSR was one big totalitarian regime,” Lviv museum director Olha Honchar told the Guardian. “They tried to make everything the same. They had one kind of monument, and one kind of artistic style with socialist realism. Moscow wants to eradicate Ukrainian culture. It’s what defines us and our identity. It’s a memory of who we are.” Honchar – who runs the city’s memorial museum of totalitarian regimes – said Ukrainian artists had resisted domination by Moscow, during communist times and today. Singers, actors and musicians had joined Ukraine’s self-defence forces and were fighting against Russia. The film star Pasha Lee was killed on Sunday in shelling in Irpin, outside Kyiv. A group of museum directors had launched an initiative to send funds to cultural workers across the country. They included museum and library staff living in southern cities such as Kherson, now under Russian occupation. None had been paid, with the stipends from the European Commission and other donors used to buy food, Honchar said. “Russians are used to living in a totalitarian system. They’ve been zombified. We Ukrainians value critical thinking,” she said. “The idea that Russia and Ukraine are the same is a totalitarian myth dreamed up in Moscow. Lenin didn’t invent us. We are different.” Her museum built on the site of Lviv’s Jewish ghetto is closed to visitors, with artefacts tucked away. This week several of the city’s other treasures were hidden. They included a precious wooden alter-piece showing Jesus, Mary and Mary Magdalene. It was removed from Lviv’s 14th century Armenian church and transported to a bunker. The sculpture was last removed from its courtyard spot shortly before the Nazis swept into the city in 1941. Remarkably, Lviv’s historic architecture survived the second world war. On Tuesday city council workers in blue boiler suits rescued four limestone fountains adorned with mythical sculptures. Each occupies a corner of Lviv’s old market square. Neptune and his trident vanished under fire resistant cladding. So did Amphitrite, Neptune’s wife, and Diana and Adonis – the work of neo-classical German sculptor Hartman Witwer. In Kyiv, the situation is more perilous. In the weeks before the war the culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, took few steps to preserve the capital’s heritage. The Zelenskiy government was reluctant to remove exhibits, fearing this would contribute to a mood of panic. Some works are now being withdrawn from galleries, including Kyiv’s art museum with its 19th century Russian masterpieces. Maria Glazunova who works at Kyiv’s national film archive, said the city authorities had started showing some of its collection in metro stations, used by locals as shelter from Russian artillery. They were screening silent films and cartoons, including a popular animation starring the character Petryk Pyatochkin, put on in Dorohozhychi station. Elsewhere in the country the picture is bleak. Concerns have been raised about the fate of a small museum devoted to Anton Chekhov in Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, where the Russian playwright spent time as a youth in the late 1880s. Fighting has been reported close to the museum. An airstrike killed several civilians on Tuesday, including children. Lazare Eloundou, head of Unesco’s World Heritage Centre, said the UN’s cultural body was receiving “more and more reports of the destruction of cultural heritage in several cities”. Of particular concern was Kharkiv, which is designated a Unesco creative city “with a vibrant cultural life” and Chernihiv, where the 11th century city centre had been damaged. “There are many others. The whole of cultural life has been affected, and we have grave concerns about what will happen next,” Eloundou said. Unesco officials were in contact with cultural professionals in Ukraine, he added. “People are taking action to protect cultural heritage. We are providing what assistance we can. We are working with our international partners to monitor damage using satellite imagery. We will continue to bring together cultural heritage professionals to put together an action plan,” he said. Elondou described Ukraine’s heritage as “important for the entire world”. It is the responsibility of the international community to do what it can to protect world heritage sites. As well as protecting cultural heritage for its own sake, it will also help the people of Ukraine to recover from the trauma after this conflict,” he said. Volunteers are identifying and archiving material from Ukrainian cultural institutions to save it for future generations. More than 1,000 librarians, archivists and researchers are involved in Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online, using a combination of technologies to crawl and archive sites and content. Back at the Latin cathedral, the sound of praying could be heard from several side-chapels – together with banging and the whirr of a drill from workers outside. The lavish rococo interior with its gilt and magenta colours is intact – for now. “The world won’t protect our air space. In the meantime we will protect our cultural monuments,” Onyshchenko said.",News/World news,Ukrainians in race to save cultural heritage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/ukrainians-in-race-to-save-a-nations-cultural-heritage
3/9/2022,"The children’s commissioner for England has backed mandatory tracking of youngsters by local authorities, saying no one knows how many children there are in the country. The recommendation came in a report initiated by Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner, which surveyed all 151 English local authorities and found many did not have figures for the number of children being home-schooled or attending independent schools in their region. The survey also found that most councils relied on updated census figures from the Office for National Statistics to estimate how many children were in the local authority, although a few also used GP enrolments or other data. “From the survey we have conducted we have found that [local authorities] do not have an accurate figure of how many children there are in England – let alone the number of children not receiving education,” de Souza said. “It is crucial that we know where all children are, and that we develop the necessary infrastructure to maintain this understanding.” De Souza said that “there are hundreds of children that have never interacted with the education system that we know nothing about”, including children who may have gone missing from care or been trafficked into the UK. The report calls for local authorities to collect and access more regularly updated data on children and their movements, including on immigration from the Home Office. One option would be a “unique identifier” for each child on databases that “would enable [local authorities] to better track children who move around the system. Having a single unique identifier would better enable services to share information on a child, identify where they need help, and allow services to support them back into school.” The Local Government Association said: “We were pleased the government recently acted on councils’ concerns by introducing a register of children not in school, to help councils to ensure that children are receiving a suitable education in a safe environment. “However, the safety net that schools and councils provide to ensure that children do not miss out on their entitlement to education is stretched to capacity, exacerbated by a lack of resources and powers available to councils to fulfil their statutory duties – which worsened as a result of the pandemic. “We would like the government to work to raise the profile of children missing formal full-time education, and to resource councils adequately to fulfil their responsibilities in ensuring all children receive a suitable education.” The Department for Education was contacted for comment. De Souza’s report estimated that 22% of state school pupils, or more than 1.7 million, were “persistently absent” in the 2021 autumn term. That would agree with official data showing hundreds of thousands of children absent from school with confirmed and suspected cases of Covid-19, with more absent ill with Covid symptoms. A pupil is counted as persistently absent if they miss 10% of classes. A child isolating with Covid for seven or more days in one term would be classed as persistently absent. The DfE’s latest figures show that school attendance in England is returning to normal, with just 0.7% of pupils and students absent for Covid-related reasons on 3 March, compared with 2.2% in February. Overall attendance rates in state primary schools was 95% and those in state secondary schools were above 89%.",News/Education,"No one knows how many children in England, says children’s commissioner",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/09/no-one-knows-how-many-children-in-england-says-childrens-commissioner
3/9/2022,"Removing carbon dioxide from the air will now be essential if there is to be any chance of meeting global climate targets, a thinktank has warned. Carbon offset markets will need to be tidied up and managed properly, as offsets will form a critical route to limiting global heating to 1.5C in line with scientific warnings, according to the Energy Transitions Commission, as switching to renewable energy alone will not produce enough carbon savings. Other methods, such as tree planting and carbon capture and storage, will also be critical. Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the CBI and ex-chair of the UK government’s Committee on Climate Change and now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, said carbon offsets and carbon markets were viewed with suspicion as they had been subject to mismanagement and abuse, but that well-functioning markets were possible. “We would encourage the tidying up of what has been an area with loose standards and loose claims,” Turner said. “It would be very unfortunate to take the past problems of the carbon markets and use that to say we should not use them at all. This is potentially a very large flow of money. So we should try to make sure that financial flow, which is valuable, is provided.” The Guardian and others have uncovered numerous instances of questionable benefits from carbon offsets offered for sale on the voluntary carbon markets, so-called because they are not formally regulated by governments. The Energy Transitions Commission report, entitled Mind the Gap: How Carbon Dioxide Removals Must Complement Deep Decarbonisation to Keep 1.5°C Alive, examined ways of removing carbon from the air after it is emitted, in contrast to renewable energy which removes the need to emit carbon dioxide in the first place. Technologies to remove carbon dioxide, such as carbon capture and storage which requires liquefying the gas and pumping it into underground caverns, and direct air capture, using chemicals to suck carbon from the air, are still expensive. Turner warned that these technologies should not be seen as a “get out of jail free card”, which companies and others could rely on to avoid having to switch to renewable energy or finding other ways of cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon removal could not be enough on its own, but would be needed to supplement green energy, he said. An alternative to using these technologies is to grow trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, and which scientists have said must form a key part of any strategy to tackle the climate crisis. Funding to grow forests will be hard to achieve without the use of carbon offsets, Turner said. The ETC report found that more than $200bn (£183bn) a year in total funding would be needed to remove enough carbon to stay within 1.5C, which over the next three decades would amount to about 0.25% of global GDP. The markets for carbon offsets today reduce global emissions by only about 0.1%, according to the ETC. Companies alone would be unlikely to fund the removals needed, and government assistance would also be needed, the report found. Turner said carbon markets should be better regulated, to ensure that the cash they can generate is directed towards projects that provide genuine reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. That could be achieved by modelling the markets on existing financial trading, and by using modern monitoring techniques such as satellites to verify that emissions reductions have taken place, or that trees and forests were still standing. The next instalment of the landmark four-part report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists, is to be published next month. That section of the sixth assessment report, the latest comprehensive update of human knowledge of the climate crisis, drawing on the work of thousands of scientists over the past eight years, will contain sections examining carbon removal technologies and the potential for all carbon-cutting methods, from renewable energy to tree-planting.",News/Environment,"Carbon dioxide will have to be removed from air to achieve 1.5C, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/carbon-dioxide-removed-from-air-carbon-offset-market-report
3/9/2022,"Emails have revealed the high-wire act performed by major banks and the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, as they privately soothe oil industry concerns about their public support for greener investment. In his annual letter to chief executives, BlackRock boss Larry Fink said that pursuing climate action policies was not about being “woke” but was about pursuing profits on behalf of clients. The comments were widely seen as a signal that the asset manager, whose clients have entrusted $10tn to its care, would wield its investment clout to support greener ventures. But emails – obtained via a freedom of information request by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the thinktank InfluenceMap – show that a regulator in oil-rich Texas left a meeting with BlackRock believing the company had undergone a change of heart. After the meeting with BlackRock staff, on 7 January 2022, the chair of the Texas oil regulator, Wayne Christian, wrote to the company expressing his relief. He said he had been concerned by the asset manager’s promotion of investments governed by environmental and social guidelines (ESG), which typically involve selling out of oil and gas stocks. He said that it was “nice to hear that BlackRock didn’t mean – or no longer believes – many of the disagreeable things the company and … Mr Fink have said about the oil and gas industry”. In an attached letter, Christian said BlackRock’s staff had referred to “media misrepresentations” about its environmental stance and had also declared themselves “supportive” of the oil and gas industry. Replying to Christian, a BlackRock employee did not question his interpretation of the discussion but pointed to comments made by Fink, saying that “traditional” energy companies were “part of the solution” alongside environmental investment policies. BlackRock said there was no contradiction between its public statements and its private conversations with Christian. “BlackRock has been clear and consistent since January 2020 that climate risk is an investment risk that will impact returns in investors’ portfolios as companies navigate both the physical and transition risk associated with climate. “Our investment conviction is that sustainability and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to our clients. “In addition, BlackRock has long stated that energy firms play an important role in the global economy and in a successful transition. “We expect to remain long-term investors in carbon-intensive sectors. We do not pursue broad divestment from sectors and industries as a policy. But Anusha Narayanan, climate campaign manager at Greenpeace USA, said it appeared BlackRock was “trying to have their cake and eat it”. “We need to stop falling for this false choice between a healthy planet or a healthy economy. Fossil fuels give us neither. Last week’s IPCC report made it clear that climate change is already causing widespread damages and losses to people and ecosystems around the world, with increasingly irreversible consequences. “Financial regulators are calling the climate crisis an emerging threat to the stability of the US financial system. “For companies like BlackRock, investing in a carbon-free future must mean the immediate divestment from coal, oil, and gas.” While BlackRock walked the line between greener investments and staying on the right side of oil industry advocates, US banks have faced similar pressure from oil-rich states, in one case apparently forcing a change of policy. In November, the treasurers of 15 US states – responsible for more than $600bn in funds – wrote an open letter to the banking industry in which they threatened to withdraw from financial institutions that boycott fossil fuel companies. A second freedom of information request shows that US Bank wrote to the state treasurer of West Virginia, who coordinated the letter, saying it hoped to maintain its relationship with the state, a major coal producer, for many years to come. In a note, Tim Rieder, senior vice-president of US Bank, added: “Personally, I totally agree with the [treasurers’] letter.” US Bank subsequently appeared to change its investment policy, removing a pledge to boycott coal investments. US Bank said it had not changed its policy under pressure from US states and that its investment policy had not prohibited financing coal-fired power since October 2020. However, its 2021 environmental responsibility policy, displayed on the bank’s website until last week, did prohibit US Bank from financing coal-fired power. A host of other banks have also issued reassurances to Texas, after it implemented a law requiring financial institutions to certify that they do not boycott energy companies in order to remain eligible to do business with the state. Barclays, Citigroup, UBS and Wells Fargo were among 39 institutions that made the pledge. Barclays said: “We are aligning our entire financing portfolio to the goals and timelines of the Paris [climate] agreement, on the way to becoming a net zero bank by 2050.” UBS said it supports the goals of the Paris agreement and added: “We view engagement with companies in all industries as fundamental to any sustainable investing approach.” Citigroup said: “Our policies are focused on responsibly managing the energy transition, not boycotting the energy sector. This position has been communicated consistently to all of our stakeholders.” Wells Fargo declined to comment.",News/Environment,BlackRock privately soothes oil industry fears over its new green credentials,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/blackrock-privately-soothes-oil-industry-fears-over-its-new-green-credentials

3/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin bet on a short war because he did not think that Ukrainians would resist invasion. Now he is betting that Russians will tolerate a long war and that the west, amid noisy complaining, will let him finish it. In the first phase, that involves using every weapon at the Kremlin’s disposal with indiscriminate savagery until Russian tanks can roll from Kharkiv to the Polish border. It is possible to conceal the horror of that onslaught from most Russians much of the time, but not from all of them indefinitely. The story told by state-controlled media is a grotesque pastiche of reality, featuring a drug-addled Ukrainian neo-Nazi junta tricking civilians into the line of fire. Truth has been chased off air, designated false by law. Sharing it carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison. But the propaganda seal is not tight enough to keep out all the blood being spilled in Ukraine. Russians who get their information online are less supportive of Putin. That amounts to a generational divide, although the president still has plenty of younger fans. My Russian friends report with sorrow that no surge in demand for regime change feels imminent. They go to the demonstrations, flee when riot police move in and talk about emigration once safely back home. They burn with the shame that Putin is branding on to their country. Those who understand what the Kremlin has started also know what comes next. Ukraine can be seized but not pacified. That means prolonged occupation of a nation that will not surrender. It means a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in which demoralised Russian conscripts are harried by highly motivated Ukrainian volunteers. Putin’s claim yesterday that no general call-up is planned will be heard by many parents across Russia as the opposite: a warning that their teenage sons are being lined up for duty. Putin did not plan that kind of war and has no idea how to end it. Independent analysts think it will be a disastrous quagmire for the Russian military. Credible reports out of Moscow say there are factions around the Kremlin that agree. The same sources say that Putin has insulated himself from dissent. He is high on his own ideological supply. In his nationalist hallucination, post-Soviet borders are wounds inflicted on the Slavic motherland by a malevolent west. The butchery of Ukraine is an act of redemptive vengeance. Aggression of that kind is not swayed by economic arguments. Putin did not anticipate sanctions on the scale that have been imposed, or didn’t fully understand the prospect. He is a graduate of the Soviet school that treats economics as a zero-sum power game between states. The purpose of trade is to assert national strength and exploit foreign weakness. Natural resources are levers for geo-strategic influence, with profits diverted to fund the lifestyles of a kleptocratic elite. An economic model predicated on rulers stealing from the public is incompatible with democracy. The unwritten contract in Russia, inherited from the Communist party and not updated much, is that state revenue and the trickle-down from corruption buy a level of stability. Propaganda and coercion do the rest. When the state gets poorer, the propaganda has to be more hysterical and the hand of coercion has to get heavier. That effect is well under way. Russian politics is degenerating from a thuggish authoritarian system that occasionally mimicked democratic process into something more martial, monolithic, totalitarian. Putin expects repression to silence any dissatisfaction that might grow in an economic crisis brought on by sanctions. The cost will be presented as proof of western hostility and an opportunity to purge society of foreign junk. If Ikea wants to leave, good riddance, say Kremlin cheerleaders. Better to buy authentic Russian furniture. That message has a receptive audience, especially among older Russians. It isn’t yet clear how it will go down with the digital generation. A brain drain is inevitable. Official fear of that is reflected in a decree waiving taxes for tech firms and exempting IT specialists from military service. The Russia that speaks a language of rational engagement with the west is heading into exile. Having withstood the immediate blow from sanctions, Putin now expects economic pain to rebound on to the west. The war is stoking energy prices and fuelling inflation. Disruption of Ukrainian grain exports will affect food supplies. If Russian firms can’t service debts, western creditors take a hit. The underlying bet is that democratic governments are hamstrung by their need to satisfy impatient consumers. The will to maintain sanctions will be depleted by the appetite for oil and gas. That is an extension of the Putinist view that liberalism is a decadent creed. It turns people flabby, feeds them drugs, debilitates national virility with gay pride and other violations of traditional morality. Such societies are expected to blink first in a war of economic attrition when pitted against Russia’s manliness and its historically vaunted capacity for stoicism and self-sacrifice. Putin is hardly the first tyrant to think this way. The doctrine is as hackneyed as might be expected from a 69-year-old former KGB mediocrity who was carried to power on the shoulders of gangsters and then spent so long basking in myths about himself that he forgot they were cynical lies. Dictators underestimate the strength of democracies because they see only weakness in leaders who submit themselves to the risk of regime change in free elections. They see robust oppositions and free press as vulnerabilities to the system, making it harder to control from the top. They do not realise that those are the qualities behind the resilience and adaptability that have made liberal democracy the most successful model for organising society in the history of human civilisation. There is a reason why young, educated Russians with access to the truth are leaving. They know what happens in the end when a dictator stakes everything on a bet that the future belongs to militarised nationalist delusion. It is a bet Putin loses. He loses faster if he is wrong about the willingness of citizens in free democracies to make sacrifices and withstand some economic pain to help their neighbours and defend their way of life.

3/9/2022,"Waving a bright pink vibrator, Sylvia worries about one of her neighbours walking past the window. She is 81, and she and her husband, Paul, who is 73, started to use sex toys about 10 years ago, mainly because Sylvia needed a bit more stimulation to become aroused. The pink vibrator is new. “I haven’t really, to coin a phrase, got to grips with it,” she says, laughing. We speak one evening over Zoom, Sylvia and Paul sitting close together in their living room. They have been married for 32 years, and sex has remained important to them. Paul stresses that he prefers to call it “making love”. “We don’t do ‘sex’ – sex is purely physical – we are genuinely sharing our love for each other,” he says. The first time they made love, he says, “it was a remarkably intense physical and emotional experience.” Sylvia rolls her eyes: “He’s much more romantic than I am.” She has always, she says, “had a very lively libido”. They used to have sex most days, but Sylvia is still feeling the effects of Covid, so it’s down to every 10 days or so. She has, she says, “an arthritic knee, which is a bit of a nuisance”, and arthritis in her wrists can make some previous positions harder. “I think it’s been well over a year since you were on top of me, and it’s a position we both like,” says Paul to Sylvia. “That’s the age impact,” she says. But both agree that their connection, their intimacy, is deeper now. “Over 30-odd years, we’ve learned what works, what doesn’t,” says Paul. “We have a real sense of intimacy.” In the most recent National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, 39% of men in the 65-74 age bracket (the oldest people the researchers surveyed) had been sexually active in the previous four weeks; for women of that age, it was 23%. Meanwhile, a 2018 study of older adults, with an average age of 65, found those who had reported any kind of sexual activity within the last 12 months had better wellbeing and a higher enjoyment of life. “We have, for a very long time, focused on sexuality as something to do with youth and it’s just not true and not helpful,” says psychosexual therapist, Kate Moyle. It is also changing: a recent piece in the New York Times said that sex experts predict that “baby boomers, who grew up during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, age – the oldest are about 75 – will demand more open conversations and policies related to their sex lives”. Desire, says Moyle, “is something that we can have across the lifetime. What we might see is that there is an interruption in the way that arousal used to previously function, the body’s physical ability; but we can adapt.” Kate, 71, says she is having the best sex of her life. She met her partner, Lindy, nearly two years ago. “There is no more pretence any more,” she says. “All the bumps and bruises of our lives, all the experiences, it’s like a fire that burns off all the unnecessary stuff. I think it’s the understanding that this really is the last bit, and to make the very best of it.” After her second divorce at the age of 65, she never thought she would fall in love – or have a sex life – again, until she met Lindy. It’s about, she says, “keeping your heart open and being willing to do things you didn’t even know you wanted to do before.” They have experimented with sex toys, she says, and her partner has discovered a love of dressing up. “Let’s have fun, say what we want, let’s be honest with each other. I think older people are often the most brutally honest.” She thinks, she says with a laugh, they are having “way better sex than my kids or her kids. They seem very tired – kids and careers. Lindy and I just kind of skip around.” They have sex three or four times a week. “Something that never happened before is you get tired, so the idea of late night [sex] is out. Daytimes are great. Lindy’s a terrific cook, but sex after eating is too much. So sex before a big meal is great.” They use, she says, “mountains of lube”. Because it can take longer “to feel momentum”, anticipation has become more important – they will send saucy texts and photos to each other. “We both have hip issues, there are better sides and worse sides. It takes longer to have an orgasm for me. Lindy, not at all – she’s like a racehorse, bang! You just have to be honest and if you don’t have a sense of humour, you might as well pack it in anyway. We laugh a lot.” What has surprised her most about sex at this stage in her life? “That it was still available. That there were women who thought this was valuable and fun, and willing to jump back in – and, if it didn’t work out, have a laugh about it. The good nature of it all has really surprised me. It’s friendly.” We need to be having more conversations about it, she adds. The idea that people in the last decades of their life need to forego sex is wrong. “In care homes, why are you treating these old people like it’s wrong? ‘Here are some tranquillisers and sleep medication’. Also, for many older gay people, you want to go to a care home? Then you can go back in the closet. It’s cruel.” “The need for intimacy and connection doesn’t age,” says Moyle, who also advises the sexual wellness brand LELO: in a recent survey of 1,000 people, it found that although most respondents over the age of 50 were having less sex than when they were younger, nearly a third said the sex they do have is better. There are experiences associated with getting older that can make sex more challenging, she says: “Sex hormones decrease with age.” For women, this can mean vaginal dryness, or reduced elasticity, which can make sex uncomfortable. For men, erectile dysfunction can be a symptom of several issues such as heart conditions or prostate problems, or a side-effect of medication. For some people, it might mean an end to penetrative sex but, says Moyle, that “doesn’t mean that it’s less meaningful. There are plenty of ways to achieve sexual enjoyment – it’s about finding the ways that work for you and it might be about having to think about ways in which that could be achieved differently.” She suggests that lubricant would help many couples and that “with a reduction in sexual arousal, things like foreplay might take longer. You might find, for example, that someone who has difficulties with arthritis, or hip pain, simple things like positioning the body differently, or using cushions for support, can make sex more enjoyable.” Because we don’t get to see representations of older people with an enjoyable sex life, it can, she says, make “people feel like they shouldn’t.” (For those who are meeting new partners, safe sex is just as important, as the rise of STIs in older people shows.) Steve, 72, and Sandra, 73, have been married for 52 years. Both their sex drives have “quietened down” he says, but not by much – they have sex around three times a week, whereas it used to be more like five. What has changed is what they perceive sex to be. Sandra had a hysterectomy, and penetrative sex became more of an effort and not always pleasurable. “We enjoy cuddling and rubbing each other, and lots of massage,” says Steve. “The other thing, as you get older, and certainly for me, is you need a lot more stimulation to get erect. We find that mutual masturbation is better for us than penetrative sex.” It has meant they are probably less adventurous than they used to be, he says. They enjoyed outdoor sex when they were younger, and although they still sometimes manage it, because it takes him longer to get going it’s not as easy. Sex in their 70s, he says, is “different. It’s not worse, but I do miss being able to get rapid erections. It’s just a factor of getting older. About every month or so we’ll do out the bedroom with candles and make it into a pleasure palace. I’ll give Sandra a nice slow, sensual massage, and that tends to culminate in big orgasms for both of us.” But, he adds, an orgasm is no longer the aim in the way it was when they were younger. “It’s nice when it happens but it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t. You need a lot more stimulation to get to orgasm, and sometimes you think, ‘I quite like this as it is’,” he says of their aimless, long, lovemaking sessions that either end with an orgasm, or a cup of tea. “I don’t expect to orgasm as much as I would have done,” says Penny, 79. She and her husband, who is 74, have been married for more than 40 years. “But when I do, it’s better.” When she masturbates, “I can achieve a better orgasm. I think you get to know your own body, but my generation still suffers a bit from shame, and masturbation wasn’t considered a good thing.” They have adapted their positions. “We do a lot more spooning, he would be behind – that’s very easy for us. I need him on top for a good orgasm for me, and that is not quite so easy for either of us now as it once was. Joints and backache,” she says, with a laugh. “I might sit on top of him, and he enjoys that, but it wouldn’t work like it might once have done.” As a therapist, Moyle has seen people in their 70s and over who have anxiety around sex, particularly with a new partner after divorce or bereavement. “They might have had sex with one person for a very long time, and changed a lot during that time,” she says. Her advice is to talk openly about it, though she acknowledges this can feel awkward “because we don’t have a lot of conversations around how the want and need for intimacy and connection doesn’t age. But it’s likely that [your new partner] might have the same kind of anxieties that you do.” For Ronald, married for the third time after the deaths of his two previous wives, being open to a new relationship has paid off – he is having the best sex of his life at 81. “After two bereavements, I could have given up at that point, but to have found a loving relationship at my age, and after a lifetime that was relatively humdrum, is a great bonus,” he says. There wasn’t much sex in his first marriage, which lasted 48 years. “It was a different generation. I think my wife sort of thought, ‘well, I’ve had children and that’s the end of that’,” he says. “I would describe it as mutually unsuccessful.” Ronald gained sexual confidence and experience with his second wife, although, sadly, she became ill. His third wife enjoys sex, and so does Ronald. “I’m accused now of being a bit like a teenager and I don’t think that’s unreasonable. I have somebody with whom I like making love and they like making love with me, and that’s tremendous, so you tend to do it quite often.” Viagra has helped. “I don’t know what happened, whether it was psychological or physical, but getting an erection became a problem, which is more or less resolved,” he says. “The only problem is it has taken the spontaneity out.” Does he feel sad he missed out on sex for all those years? “Yes,” he says. “I could say I’ve wasted a great many years, but I’m very happy with where I am. I’m also quite proud that, given two bereavements, I’m still functioning and able to relate to other people. I haven’t given up on life.” Rosemary knows, she says, “a number of women who stopped sexual relations, when a partner died or the relationship broke up and decided that was it.” She met her boyfriend a few years ago on a dating site and says it was quite daunting to meet someone new, but she likes being in a relationship so it was worth it. They are both in their 70s and she says she is enjoying sex more at this stage of her life. “I’m more comfortable in my own skin,” she says. “This is who I am. If you like it, let’s enjoy things, and if you don’t, well, we shouldn’t be together. I’m just much more relaxed, happier in my body, and also much more able to say what I want. I think that gets easier when you’re older – you know yourself better.” Sex has become slower, she says – sometimes they will stay in bed all day, with the help of (sometimes, but not always) wine, lube and Viagra. “There isn’t the tyranny of the nightly double bed,” she says. “We can have sex in the morning or in the afternoon, when you feel like it.” When she was working and raising children, sometimes the thought of sex at the end of a busy day was one more thing to worry about. “We don’t have that. We can be together whenever we want. Lunch can wait.” They explore comfortable positions, she says. “We still enjoy penetrative sex but we spend much more time just enjoying each other’s bodies,” she says. “There are moments where we’ve just been naked, just cuddled, and for whatever reason, we haven’t had penetrative sex.” It’s partly as a result of getting older, but, she says, it’s also about “learning more about what is pleasurable and moving away from a kind of Hollywood representation. You see sex scenes on TV or films and think, ‘he’s instantly erect? She’s instantly available? Come on.’ Does sex even work like that in your 20s?” Another couple who spend all day in bed, now their children have grown up and are safely out of the house, is Jennifer, 62; her husband is 72. “We have the time,” says Jennifer. “We can spend the whole afternoon at it, no one’s going to disturb us. When we were younger, you’ve got children, you’ve got work, it has to be fitted in, and it’s all very tense, but it’s lovely when you can take your time. We haven’t done that since before we were married, so you sort of come full circle.” Not having to think about contraception makes it “a lot more spontaneous than it used to be”, although, she adds, “there might be slight adaptations: ‘Ooh, my back’s aching a bit today’, joint pains and things. You may take it a bit slower; more foreplay.” After lovemaking, she says with a laugh, they’ll have a cup of tea. Sex, for her, she says, “is an expression of your love for somebody, and, just because I’m older, it doesn’t make my feelings any less.” Some names have been changed.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘We’re having way better sex than our kids!’ The joy of lovemaking in your 70s,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/09/were-having-way-better-sex-than-our-kids-the-joy-of-lovemaking-in-your-70s
3/9/2022,"In the quiet of a wooded gully, I imagine I can hear the sounds of loud yesterdays. Two trees, not felled but fallen, must have created a steeplechase barrier across the track here, for their upper trunks have been cut into three-metre lengths. In the scatter of sawdust, I imagine the roar and the whine of a chainsaw – the ecstasy in the change of pitch as its blade cut through still-living tissue and through the heart of each trunk. It was the sound that I heard all around in those days after the big blow. Here too was the thump of long logs, and the “shush” of a needle-bearing crown, as the warden dragged branches to the right of the path and cast pieces of timber away to the left. The debris lies none too tidily on either side now, for he had already many emergencies behind him and three downed sycamores waiting round the bend. On the afternoon of Storm Eunice itself, the spruce tree which was only metres from our bedroom window thrashed, hissed, flexed, but still held firm. In this gully, just a mile up the road, dozens of spruces must have been whipped up to make a far greater racket, battered this way and that, clashing branches like antlers. Above and below the cacophony came the crack of a conifer shearing off at chest height. The split tree toppled over the heaved-up root plate of a companion conifer of similar age that had dropped hours or minutes earlier. The growth rings from the shattered tree’s trunk tell me that it was just 27 years old. The pale-yellow split weeps the scent of sweet resin. That tree was far enough down the slope of a north-facing rise to be sheltered from the brunt of the gale, with only the crown of its crown shaken by the wind. What weakness caused it to break at the knees? The day before Eunice, we all knew that it was coming. I walked here in a place where nothing moved. It was a soundless prelude, the unreality of utter calm before the storm.
