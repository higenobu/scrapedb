5/5/2022,"Kidd Creole, a member of foundational hip-hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for manslaughter, after stabbing a homeless man in New York City. The rapper, real name Nathaniel Glover, 62, was convicted of the crime last month. Prosecutors said that Glover killed John Jolly, 55, with a steak knife after the two engaged in conversation; Glover’s defence was that he felt intimidated by Jolly, who, it is alleged, asked Glover “what’s up?” in a threatening manner. Glover’s lawyer had said that Jolly’s homelessness was a factor in Glover feeling threatened, but judge Michele S Rodney said the killing was not “somehow justified because the person is homeless … A life is a life is a life.” Glover told Rodney he had expected to be exonerated of the crime, and complained that he had been portrayed as someone “who has no remorse or humanity”. The one-time rapper had been on the way to his job at a copy shop when he attacked Jolly. Glover’s music career had long been dormant by the time of the killing, but he made a significant contribution to early hip-hop history as a member of the Furious Five. As Kidd Creole – not to be confused with the funk-pop star Kid Creole – he formed the group the Three MCs with his brother Melvin Glover, AKA Melle Mel, and Keef Cowboy, with Grandmaster Flash on production. Two more MCs, Scorpio and Rahiem, joined and the group was renamed Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. They were among the first hip-hop groups to cross over from the Bronx-born scene into the US charts, and while Kidd Creole doesn’t feature on the classic Melle Mel-delivered The Message, he contributed to numerous other tracks, and also appears on albums credited solely to Grandmaster Flash after a 1984 schism in the group. The original lineup reformed for a final album in 1987, but permanently disbanded soon afterwards.",Arts/Music,"Kidd Creole, Furious Five rapper, sentenced to 16 years for manslaughter",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/05/kidd-creole-furious-five-rapper-sentenced-to-16-years-for-manslaughter
5/5/2022,"Lost & Found, as befits a book about contrasts, is something of a hybrid. On the one hand, it is a memoir of two shattering events that took place almost simultaneously in Kathryn Schulz’s life: the death of her much-loved 74-year-old father, and her falling in love, in middle age, with a woman she calls C. It also veers between two distinct modes: the personal, where Schulz relates these events in affecting prose; and the more detached, essayistic style that will be familiar to readers of her Pulitzer-winning work in the New Yorker. After establishing the fact of her father’s death in the book’s opening, Schulz takes the reader on a series of long, impersonal digressions on the subject of loss in general: “Phone chargers, umbrellas, earrings, scarves, passports, headphones, musical instruments, Christmas ornaments, the permission slip for your daughter’s field trip … the range and quantity of things we lose is staggering.” She is such a good writer of nonfiction that she is never less than shrewd and entertaining company, dispensing maxims such as “In the microdrama of loss, we are nearly always both villain and victim,” and providing thoughtful readings of Elizabeth Bishop’s poem One Art, in which the narrator contemplates “the art of losing”. But the narrative truly comes alive when she contemplates her father’s story. She sees his incurable habit of losing things as “the comic-opera version of the series of losses that shaped his childhood … one that was defined by an extraordinary degree by loss”. Her father’s mother was the youngest of 11 children living in a shtetl outside Łódź in the late 1930s, and, since her family was too large and too poor to survive the war together, “by a private calculus unimaginable to me”, writes Schulz, she was designated as the only one to be sent away to safety, to Tel Aviv. Her son was born there, and at a certain point she received news that almost everybody back home had died. By 1954, visas for the two of them had been secured for the US. The book’s second section describes Schulz’s surprise at finding a life partner after years of cherishing a bookish kind of solitude. Here, her tendency to digress might be seen as a defence against cloying sentimentality. If so, she needn’t have worried. When she comes to describe meeting C (after 30 pages of philosophising and psychologising on the subject of “finding”) she writes beautifully about falling in love: “Everything that wasn’t her – the house around us, the rest of the world, the passage of time, the past and the future – retreated from awareness.” But Schulz’s unusual method – part‑essay, part-memoir – comes into its own in the book’s final third. This begins with a description of a meteor hitting Earth during the Eocene period and ends, 35m years later, on a “beautiful May afternoon” with Kathryn’s marriage to C. There follows a fascinating disquisition on how the ampersand symbol began to fall out of fashion as the final letter of the English alphabet early in the 19th century, which provides Schulz with an opportunity to expound on the paradoxical nature of life: “In short, we know that, as Philip Roth once put it, ‘Life is and.’ He meant that we do not live, for the most part, in a world of either/or. We live with both at once, with many things at once – everything connected to its opposite, everything connected to everything.” In these passages, Schulz’s prose almost rises to the level of Nietzsche at his most wise and humane, or William James. When, in the final pages Schulz reveals she and C are expecting a baby, her reflections on time, loss and mortality take on an even greater resonance. “We are here to keep watch,” she concludes, “not to keep.”  Lost & Found is published by Picador (£14.95).

5/5/2022,"At 5am, it’s as dark as it ever gets in Times Square, where massive digital billboards never stop blasting light into the sky, illuminating city blocks across midtown. The square is among the most-visited tourist attractions in New York City, but at this time it’s deserted, save for five people standing outside the Winter Garden Theatre. This is where the Guardian finds Robert Samuel, a 46-year-old former mobile phone salesman, whose job is now to sit in lines for other, mostly wealthy, people. It’s a strange career, but one which has given Samuel a front row seat at some of the biggest cultural events of the last decade – and a job which perhaps sums up the state of capitalism, and inequality, in 2022. The job entails Samuel sitting, or standing, or sometimes sleeping, in lines: waiting for theater tickets, iPhone releases, and once for someone to die as part of a macabre French art exhibit. Depending on the gig, Samuel then relinquishes his place to his customer or buys them tickets for in-demand shows. On this cold Thursday in April, despite the time, Samuel is chirpy and energetic. Wearing a hoodie and a baseball cap, he unpacks a tiny tent and a camp chair, and settles in for what will be an hours-long wait to buy two tickets for The Music Man. The show is the hottest ticket in town, largely because Hugh Jackman is playing the lead role of Professor Harold Hill, and to get a seat fans have to get down here early. Or they pay Samuel, who has been doing this full-time for nine years. The weather is 46F (8C) but it’s nothing compared to what Samuel refers to, with a mix of dread and reverence, as “the Hamilton line”. “It was zero degrees one day,” Samuel says. “And the inside of my tent was frozen with frost. I was able to scratch and write lines. That was, I think, the coldest I’ve ever waited.” It was worth it though, because Hamilton, the wildly popular Lin-Manuel Miranda musical that has broken records since it opened in February 2015, is really what made Samuel’s line-sitting career. “I feel like I need to cut him a commission check,” he says. He remembers those days with fondness. Hamilton swiftly became a golden goose for Samuel, but when Miranda announced his departure from the show, it reached another level entirely. Samuel had to hire people, initially friends and acquaintances, to sit in line with him, as theatergoers scrambled to catch Manuel’s final performances. “You have those theater purists who have to see the original cast, no matter the cost,” Samuel says. Resale tickets were available online, but for $15,000 or more. Samuel’s method meant his clients were receiving rush tickets, often in prime seats, released on the morning of the show. The tickets came at a knockdown price, but Samuel’s labor did not. “The wait was four, maybe five, days. We were charging $5,000 to get you two tickets. But compared to buying one resale ticket, we were the best deal in town.” At the beginning of Hamilton’s run, Samuel would buy two tickets, the maximum allowed, and hand them over to clients. The theater soon changed its policy, however, requiring the buyer of the tickets to see the show themselves. “I’d politely tell them: ‘Hi, you’re going to have a date,’” Samuel says. It didn’t seem to bother Samuel’s customers, who would commission him or his team to buy two tickets and invite them along to see the show. “One of the benefits of line-sitting, for me, has been rediscovering my love of theater,” Samuel says. He grew up in Brooklyn, across the East River, and a trip to Broadway, in Manhattan, was a rare treat when he was a child; his first show was Evita, which he saw with his mother – but he has seen Hamilton 10 times and seldom misses the most talked about plays and musicals. Hamilton raked in tens of thousands of dollars for Samuel, who eventually formed his own company called Same Ole Line Dudes. That wouldn’t be the only pop culture wave in which he played a role. Through his job Samuel has been present at some of the defining retail and cultural moments of the millennium. As the iPhone became the hottest consumer item on the planet, Samuel was there, waiting in line outside the company’s flagship New York store. As the street fashion brand Supreme built a cult following through its limited-edition drops, Samuel was at its SoHo store buying newly released T-shirts and hoodies. (His Supreme gigs prompted Samuel’s one attempt to buy sought-after products and resell them online. “I lost money,” he says, shaking his head. “And I’m like: ‘This isn’t for me, let me just stick to my lane.’”) The cronut? Samuel was a regular presence outside the Dominique Ansel bakery that created the portmanteau delicacy before that day’s batch sold out. Saturday Night Live? Samuel’s worked that too. When Omega, the luxury watch brand, soared in popularity and began to dabble in the world of limited edition releases, Samuel was there to scoop them up for clients with thousands of dollars to spend, but without the time, or inclination, to do the dirty work. But the jobs aren’t always about making people happy. And the work, especially in recent times, has posed some moral dilemmas. Samuel was paid by two different news organizations to hold a spot in line for the weeks-long Ghislaine Maxwell trial, which culminated in Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime associate being convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. And when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Samuel waited in line for vaccines, enabling New York-based clients – who frequently did not live in the area where the shots were being administered – to swoop in and get their vaccinations. Pre-pandemic, the job was enough for Samuel to earn up to $80,000 a year. But the job has exposed some of the uglier sides of society. Samuel says the worst part of the job is the racism that he and his team, many of whom are Black and Latino, have experienced. Samuel recalled how one of his colleagues had fallen into conversation with a woman and her young daughter as they all waited for Hamilton tickets. The daughter asked Samuel’s line-sitter about the last show he had seen. “Oh, don’t be silly, they don’t go to see shows,” the mother interjected. Another time, a colleague was waiting for tickets for Macbeth. He got talking with a white man in line and told him about line-sitting. “‘He was like: ‘Great idea, that’s awesome. But are there any white people who do this?’” Samuel recalls. That was before Donald Trump was elected. After that, Samuel said, “it just exacerbated it to a whole other level”. “A lot of tourists come from red states. And they bring those attitudes with them. And it’s like: ‘OK. This is a blue state. This is a blue city. You need to just shut up.’” Still, Samuel is happy with his job and – pre-pandemic – made a good living. But in a country where wealth inequality has exceeded the extremes of the 1920s and the gig economy has created precarious working conditions for many, Samuel’s role is another example of the wealthy exerting their financial power. To Sarah Damaske, a professor of sociology and labor and employment relations at Penn State University, the dynamic is reminiscent of “very old forms of labor”. “When we see really extreme income inequality, this ability to outsource personal tasks becomes more possible. It becomes more possible for someone who’s at one end of the extreme to purchase the labor power of someone who is at the other end of the extreme when the minimum wage is stagnant for as long as it has been,” Damaske said. “Which is why it makes me think of those days gone by when people were afforded opportunities via birthright, in kind of a manor-born type of way.” Most of Samuel’s work is based in New York City, but his role has enabled him to travel. In July 2018 he was hired by the artists David Brognon and Stéphanie Rollin for their show Until Then. An exploration of attitudes to euthanasia, the exhibition involved Samuel, whom the artists found online, sitting, alone, in an 11th-century church in France. Samuel sat in the church, waiting, for 26 days, the period of time between an unnamed patient in Belgium having informed their doctors that they wanted to die, and actually dying. At the moment the patient died, Samuel stood up and walked out of the church. “My eyes swelled up, and when I walked out of that church, even though I didn’t know that person, to know that I was waiting for them to end their life, it just touched me in such a way that I had never expected,” he says. The experience still moves Samuel – “I still get a little emotional thinking about it now,” he says, his eyes watering slightly. As for his regular work, waiting for tickets, gadgets and clothes, Samuel simply sees it as part of a “convenience that has taken over society”. “You can get people to literally do everything for you,” he says. “They can watch your kids, they can watch your pets. They can clean your home, you know, they can pick you up from A to B, bring you your food. So this is just an extension of that. “You can get people to do just about anything, within reason, as long as it’s legal and you want to pay.”",News/US news,"‘A five-day wait for $5,000’: the man who queues for the uber-rich",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/a-five-day-wait-for-5000-the-man-who-queues-for-the-uber-rich
5/5/2022,"“I’m very pro-choice.” So said Donald Trump in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press in 1999, attributing his views on abortion to “a little bit of a New York background”. Two decades later, the businessman and reality TV star is the unlikeliest of heroes for social conservatives and Christian evangelicals because he delivered the ultimate prize: the end of America’s constitutional right to abortion. The leak this week of a draft supreme court opinion showing that the court’s conservative majority is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalising abortion, represented a vivid aftershock of the Trump presidency. He had reversed his position on the issue by the time he reached the White House and, with uncharacteristic discipline, spent his four years in office bending the federal judiciary to the right, including with three supreme court appointments. “The supreme court will be his most important and long-lasting political legacy,” said Amanda Hollis-Brusky, an associate professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California. “If the number of supreme court justices stays at nine, Trump will have appointed a third of the supreme court having been a one-term president who lost the popular vote by 3 million. And yet those justices will have a greater and a longer-lasting impact than anything else he did as president.” The threat he posed to reproductive rights was always hiding in plain sight. As a Republican candidate running for president in 2016, Trump released a list of 11 potential supreme court nominees after heeding advice from conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. The unusual move was seen as a way of reassuring conservatives troubled by his boorish behaviour and past views on issues such as abortion. Then, during the last presidential debate with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, Trump was asked if he wanted to see the supreme court overturn Roe v Wade. He replied: “Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be – that will happen. And that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: it will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.” Once in office, Trump followed through by appointing Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the highest court, handing conservatives a 6-3 majority. In all he appointed 234 judges, including 54 appellate judges, outpacing Barack Obama’s first-term total of 172 and George W Bush’s 204. The process was guided by two men: Mitch McConnell, then Republican majority leader in the Senate, and Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, which counts among its members four supreme court justices, dozens of federal judges and every Republican attorney general since it was created in 1982. Hollis-Brusky, author of Ideas with Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution, said: “One of the interesting things about Trump, McConnell, Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society is that Trump made appointments based on friendships, brought his buddies into the administration, had loyalty tests for his appointees and fired people who displeased him but, when it came to the operation of finding, selecting and confirming judges, it was a completely professionalised shop. “If anyone worked in lockstep, it was McConnell and Leo, and Trump just largely got out of the way.” Trump gained further kudos in the eyes of conservatives when he resisted calls to withdraw his nomination of Kavanaugh, who was accused of having committed sexual assault as a teenager. The president also moved swiftly to replace the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg despite pressure to wait for the 2020 election. Curt Levey, president of the conservative advocacy group the Committee for Justice, said: “He showed some backbone that I’m not sure other Republican presidents would have shown. He stuck by Kavanaugh when frankly there were Republicans on the Hill who did not want him to. “When people said, ‘Oh, you can’t nominate anyone to fill Ginsburg’s seat, it’s too close to the election,’ he said, ‘I disagree’. He showed courage. Whether you like the guy or hate the guy, he was known for the courage of his convictions.” When the draft opinion leaked to the Politico website on Monday, Democrats expressed outrage while most Republicans focused on the breach of court secrecy, perhaps aware that premature triumphalism could result in political backlash. But Madison Cawthorn, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, wrote on Twitter that the ex-president deserved the credit. Others may eventually follow suit in praising Trump for delivering on his campaign promises and succeeding where other Republican presidents failed. Michael D’Antonio, a political commentator and Trump biographer, said: “They will regard him as heroic. He’ll be the fallen man who redeemed himself by this advocacy and forevermore he’ll be worshipped in certain corners of the Christian right. Their fanaticism knows no bounds and they’ve been looking for this kind of person to come along forever. What’s ironic is that he’s proving that a profane man can accomplish what devout ones could not.” If Roe v Wade falls, about half of the states in the US are certain or likely to ban abortion. The political impact on November’s midterm elections remains uncertain. But such an outcome could give Trump a ready-made applause line at campaign rallies for a White House bid in 2024. Edward Fallone, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said: “It increases the likelihood Trump will run again because he’ll see this as a monumental issue for generating enthusiasm and turnout. If he was hesitating at all to run a second time, I would think now he’s going to feel a bit emboldened. “I cannot imagine a scenario where Donald Trump does not take credit for this and repeat endlessly that he alone made it happen.” Fallone added: “Seismic events like Roe versus Wade on the way to being overturned have all kinds of ancillary repercussions. I’m worrying about the legal landscape and the future of constitutional law but the entire political landscape and the leadership of the Republican party could also be impacted. “This is an earthquake and it’s going to have repercussions.”",News/US news,Trump the hero for anti-abortion movement after bending supreme court his way,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/trump-abortion-supreme-court
5/5/2022,"“Hey, Mama!” This is how I was greeted by a friendly member of staff every morning during my week-long stay in hospital after my baby’s birth. Theoretically, I had had my whole pregnancy to get used to the idea of being a mother in the eyes of the world, because almost immediately you become, to the professionals you interact with, “Mum”. As in: “could Mum pop herself up on the bed, please?” (Mums seem to do a lot of “popping”). But nonetheless, it was still surreal to feel my identity shift. Meanwhile, the baby’s father wore a name tag that proclaimed: “I am [name]. I am husband.” It made me laugh, recalling as it did “I am woman, hear me roar”, or at least a labour ward version of that: “I am husband, hear me … ask politely once again for pethidine.” So these were our roles: mother and father, husband and wife. On all the discharge documents, too. Yet if certain media reports are to be believed, one of those terms was under threat: the word “mother”, as a result, apparently, of the push for trans-inclusive language. When, last year, Brighton and Sussex maternity services announced they would be adopting gender inclusive language, including terms such as “birthing parent” and “chestfeeding”, they were accused of misogyny and of “erasing” womanhood. Though the announcement made clear that the language of women and motherhood would be retained, some reports failed, cynically, to mention this fact, and there was still a social media uproar. (The widespread use of the inclusive term “birth partner”, however, doesn’t seem to ever cause such an outcry.) Fear over the erasure of the language of female biology, especially in maternity services, has become central to the gender-critical discussion of trans versus women’s sex-based rights, and yet, as someone who has been pregnant recently, it doesn’t seem to bear out. The language of maternity remains heavily gendered: I was almost always mama, Mum, mother, a pregnant woman, a lady, a female patient, a breastfeeding mother. It is true that at times I was a “pregnant person”, though I was never referred to this way by health professionals – it was usually applied by other resources and services, including charities. And in any case, it really didn’t bother me. Some aspects of pregnancy can feel dehumanising: I quite liked the fact that I was being given personhood when so often womanhood seems to preclude that. Yet the notion that trans people want to wipe out the language of maternity persists to the point that it has become, in my view, something of a moral panic. In her nine years as a midwife, the author Leah Hazard has, to her knowledge, only treated patients that identify as women. However, she feels that inclusive language is an important part of her practice. “Inclusive language and behaviour aren’t about erasing one group. It’s about including all groups,” she says. “It allows all people to feel included and seen and cared for and honoured. And that really is the essence of midwifery.” Instead of seeing inclusive language as a dangerous affront to women, Hazard sees it as part of her duty towards patients. Medical professionals, of course, adapt their language around different patients all the time: they might be working with a mother who has had a double mastectomy after cancer, rendering the language of breastfeeding inappropriate, or whose emergency caesarean means the language of vaginal birth makes her feel terrible. “If you’re in bed one and you want to talk about breastfeeding, I will talk to you about breastfeeding,” says Hazard. “And if Charlie is in bed two and is a trans man and wants to talk about chestfeeding or body feeding, what skin off my nose, really, is it to talk to Charlie about chestfeeding? None whatsoever … But it just means that I continue to provide that individualised person-centred care that I’m actually duty bound by the regulator to provide.” The importance of personalised care is even more apparent when I talk to a former colleague and fellow writer Freddy McConnell, a trans man who has just given birth to his second child. “Throughout both my pregnancies I felt respected and understood by every midwife and doctor I encountered,” he says. “After my second arrived by emergency C-section, it was incredibly touching and affirming to hear multiple people in the operating theatre spontaneously say, “congratulations, Dad” and “well done, Dad”. I didn’t have to ask or explain myself. I didn’t want special treatment – I just wanted us to be safe and to have a positive birthing experience.” (McConnell notes that the paperwork he was given could have been more inclusive – a point other LGBTQ+ couples have also highlighted.) I fail to see how anyone could reasonably take umbrage with his words. It seems to be that some of the uproar from the shift towards more inclusive language comes, not as a result of demands from trans people that the word “mother” be erased, but from organisations and services overcorrecting themselves while seeking to be inclusive. “I really don’t feel comfortable being called a birthing person. I am a mother, I have a baby,” said one NHS source, who complained during a meeting in which replacing “mother” with “birthing person” was touted by a colleague. She described the reaction to dealing with this issue as an “organisational phobia”, saying that the focus on this question was overshadowing the more important issue of improving services for everyone. “I’m not transphobic and I want people to feel comfortable … there needs to be some middle ground.” In the end, her workplace decided on “women and pregnant people”. Away from the fury and clamour of social media, professionals are making these decisions every day. They are not always getting it right, but at the heart of their efforts is the desire to create a more inclusive environment for everyone having a baby. On the day I unexpectedly went into labour, I was rewatching Seahorse, a documentary about McConnell’s journey towards pregnancy and parenthood. All I saw when I watched was another parent, embarking on a new life while negotiating their own specific challenges, as we all do. In this, I felt only solidarity, something we could all do with more of, no matter how we identify. What’s working: I want to sing the praises of the inventors of the Elvie breast pump, who have enabled me to feed my preterm baby – one of the biggest challenges that I have faced as a mother so far. It sits silently inside your bra, and unlike other pumps it allows you to move around while wearing it, so you feel less like a cow being milked. It’s expensive but worth it, especially in a situation such as ours. A truly liberating invention. What isn’t: My father reports that hand-knitted baby clothes have disappeared from Welsh charity shops, due to a visit from trading standards demanding that they need a fire safety label. Though he has discovered a way to, shall we say, circumnavigate this, it’s still a shame.
