1/13/2022,"Nato discussions with Russia have concluded with no sign of progress towards narrowing substantial differences or defusing the crisis over Ukraine, and with the alliance’s secretary general warning “there is a real risk for a new armed conflict in Europe”. After four hours of talks, the US delegation leader, the deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, said she had heard nothing in Brussels that differed from the Kremlin position laid out at bilateral talks in Geneva, demanding a guaranteed end to Nato expansion and a withdrawal of alliance troops in formerly Soviet bloc countries that joined the alliance after 1997.  Those proposals remained unacceptable to the US and all Nato allies, Sherman said. “We were basically saying to the Russians: some of the things you put on the table are non-starters for us. We are not going to agree that Nato cannot expand any further. We are not going to agree to go back to 1997,” she told reporters. “Together, the United States and our Nato allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on Nato’s open-door policy, a policy that has always been central to the Nato alliance.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called the day’s meeting a “defining moment for European security”, but said that “significant differences” remained. “We had a very serious and direct exchange on the situation in and around Ukraine and the implications for European security,” Stoltenberg said. “Our differences will not be easy to bridge but it is a positive sign that all Nato allies and Russia sat down around the same table and engaged on substantive topics.” But he conceded: “There is a real risk for a new armed conflict in Europe,” and warned that Russia would face “severe consequences” if it used military force. The Nato-Russia Council meeting will be followed on Thursday in Vienna by a third round of talks with Moscow, in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), currently chaired by Poland. After that all sides would have to go back to their capitals for leadership decisions on whether to continue diplomacy. Sherman said there was space for dialogue to address Russian security concerns and “identify solutions that enhance the security of all”. In Geneva the US raised the possibility of reciprocal agreements on missile deployments and military exercises. Sherman said: “Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext and they may not even know yet.” In an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said a Russian operation against Ukraine now appeared inevitable, once diplomatic talks with the US, Nato and the OSCE concluded this week. “They [the Russians] have created momentum. They want to use that momentum. They need to do something,” Zagorodnyuk – who served as defence minister in 2019 and 2020 – said. He added: “Moscow’s statements are extremely aggressive to the point of being rude.” But he said it was “very unlikely” the Kremlin would carry out a “large-scale invasion” of Ukraine. Although it would be relatively easy for the Russian army to seize territory, occupying soldiers would soon find themselves fighting an unwinnable guerrilla war, he said. “Ninety per cent of the Ukrainians do not want Russia. There would be huge resistance here,” he said. The Ukrainian army would immediately move to “small group tactics”, with regular soldiers working effectively as partisan units. He added: “It will be similar to what the Russians did to Napoleon in 1812. The war would be brutal and long.” Zagorodnyuk predicted the Kremlin was more likely to launch a hybrid war. That might include cyber-raids, attacks on critical infrastructure including power facilities and a massive information campaign. The strategy would be to “coerce Ukraine” into submission, he said. Ukrainian government sources suggest Russia is considering a “staged provocation” inside Ukraine which could then be used to justify a bigger attack. This might include a “violent” incident at the Russian embassy or consulate, which Moscow could then blame on far-right Ukrainian extremists. Meanwhile, Kyiv officials confirmed news reports that the Biden administration quietly authorised an additional $200m (£146m) security assistance to Ukraine in late December. The delivery – first reported by CNN – would include radar systems and marine equipment. No additional weapons have arrived yet, with the decision conveyed only recently to congressional staffers during a classified briefing, according to Politico. The Pentagon last month delivered small arms and ammunition under the terms of a previous $60m aid tranche. Ukraine has asked the US and EU countries to supply it with equipment that could be used by mobile units. These include Javelin anti-tank missiles and portable air defence systems such as Stinger missiles, as well as sniper rifles, drones and counter-battery radars. The Nato-Russia Council meeting, the first since July 2019, was called in response to rising tensions over Ukraine, after the Kremlin stationed more than 100,000 Russian troops and heavy weaponry at the border of its western neighbour. Stoltenberg stressed Nato wanted to continue talks with Russia and had proposed further meetings to discuss greater transparency over military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on missiles. The latest gathering followed inconclusive talks between US and Russian officials in Geneva on Monday, where both sides set out their opposing points of view on Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed western concerns that it is planning an attack, arguing it needs guarantees about security. “The situation has simply reached such a critical point in terms of pan-European security and the national interests of our country ... that we cannot delay further and the concerns we have voiced need concrete answers,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Against that backdrop, expectations of a breakthrough from the latest talks were low. Tomáš Valášek, a Slovak MP, who served as his country’s ambassador to Nato between 2013 and 2017, said the Nato-Russia Councils he attended “tended to be mere formalities, but not for lack of trying on the Nato side”. He said: “The Russian side wasn’t prepared to go beyond agreed notes, agreed talking points so in the end these meetings ended up being very formalistic without breaking any new ground.”",News/World news,Nato chief warns of ‘real risk of conflict’ as talks with Russia over Ukraine end,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/nato-chief-warns-of-real-risk-of-conflict-as-talks-with-russia-over-ukraine-end
1/13/2022,"Farce engulfed the Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday as the Group F clash between Tunisia and Mali was ended prematurely by the referee – twice. The Zambian official Janny Sikazwe caused bewilderment, and furious protests from Tunisian players and staff, by appearing to whistle for full-time in the 86th minute.  He then ordered play to resume, only to trigger further anger by bringing proceedings to a conclusion in the 89th minute, with Mali leading 1-0. As staff from Tunisia rushed towards the referee and pointed angrily at their watches, Sikazwe and his assistants were escorted off the pitch by stewards. Frantic negotiations followed in the stadium in Limbé, with efforts made to restart the match from the 89th minute, 40 minutes after the controversy began. As Tunisia refused to return to the pitch, Mali – who had come out again – were declared the winners thanks to the penalty scored by Ibrahima Koné on 48 minutes and Sikazwe ended the game for a third time. Wahbi Khazri had missed a chance to equalise from the spot when Ibrahim Mounoko saved his penalty. The fact that there were two penalties in the second half – as well as two incidents reviewed on the pitchside monitor, one red card (rather harshly for Mali’s El Bilal Touré), five substitutions and a drinks break – made the referee’s decision to blow early all the more bizarre. According to media reports in Tunisia, the country’s FA has filed an official complaint about the refereeing performance along with a request for the match to be replayed. “The players were taking ice baths for 35 minutes before they were called back out again,” Tunisia’s coach Mondher Kebaier said. “I*ve been coaching for a long time never seen anything like it. Even the fourth official was preparing to lift the board [to show how many minutes of injury time] and then the whistle was blown.”",Sport/Football,Time-keeping controversy overshadows Mali’s opening victory against Tunisia,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/africa-cup-nations-mali-tunisia-referee-controversy-timekeeping
1/13/2022,"Watching a faux contrite Boris Johnson take a pummelling from Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions over the illegal lockdown garden party he attended by mistake because he thought the 40 other people getting leathered in his back garden were all hard at work, The Fiver was reminded of last week’s Caffeine Cup semi-final first leg between Chelsea and Tottenham. In a match where they landed one blow after another and quite clearly had their opponents on the ropes, Chelsea came up a little short when it came to finishing them off, leaving Antonio Conte’s side with a faint glimmer of hope they might yet wriggle out of the very real mess in which they currently find themselves.  While the prime minister is relying on the inquiry he hopes will get him off on some sort of nonsensical technicality, Tottenham have Wednesday’s second leg at Stamford Bridge in which to try to turn things around. It is a game they go into needing to overturn a two-goal deficit if they are to make the final of a competition they last won in 2008. To do so they will have to up their game considerably from last week’s dismal showing in which they were outclassed to such an extent their players could have been forgiven for not realising they were at an actual work event. “For sure, when you play against this type of team, it’s hard,” blabbed Antonio Conte. “At the same time, despite our problems with injuries, we have to try to give everything.” He will be hoping the players he selects give a better account of themselves than those who were pretty feeble in victory over Morecambe in the FA Cup on Sunday, a game in which the dismal showing of several fringe players sent him scuttling off to his boss to gesticulate furiously in the traditional Conte style as he demanded several new January recruits. Missing several key players through knack and illness, the leader of Tottenham’s opposition Thomas Tuchel, who held “clear the air talks” with his disaffected striker Romelu Lukaku before last week’s first leg, insisted he will not be trying to alter the style of play of Chelsea’s £89m summer acquisition, who has been conspicuously out of sorts since his return to Stamford Bridge from Inter. “Once he adapts to the physical style of the league there is no doubt he will have a huge impact,” said Tuchel. “We will not reinvent his style or reinvent the player. He can simply be Romelu and then we are all fine and then he will score because this is what he always does.” And in the unlikely event that he doesn’t? Well, Chelsea could always stage an internal inquiry to find that despite all available evidence to the contrary he is in fact still banging them in.

1/13/2022,"In San Francisco, the night before the annual Pride parade is reserved for the Dyke March, a celebration of lesbian life throughout the city. It was like our Christmas – the biggest night of the year – and half of us would be so hungover we wouldn’t make it to Pride the next day. I remember getting a call from an editor at On Our Backs, a lesbian magazine run by women that billed itself as offering “entertainment for the adventurous lesbian”. It was a bedrock of the lesbian community – one of the few ways to communicate with one another, and to celebrate sex and educate each other about it at a time when Aids had brought so much devastation to queer communities. The editor wanted me to shoot a kiss-in, but the tone of her voice sounded almost guilty – like she couldn’t quite bring herself to ask me to work on the biggest party night of the year. But to me, it was the most fun I could imagine.  Lesbians from all over the country, many of whom I knew, had gathered in the park, mingling and chatting to whoever came along – gay, straight, whatever gender. But when the Dyke March began, the crowds cleared and the Dykes on Bikes took the lead, with the rest of us forming a column behind. I’ve always found something beautiful about that moment: people stepping aside to give lesbians their space, to celebrate and applaud them. Many of the women would march shirtless as a gesture of their freedom. It was a time for lesbians to assert themselves in the public sphere, a moment of safety and joy. The rules of the Dyke March were pretty much “anything goes as long as it’s fun”. Women were celebrating being half naked, feeling safe and supported by everyone. There were no protesters because there were simply too many queer people in San Francisco. It was a moment of wild abandon, marching through the streets, climbing bus stops, on top of cars, hanging out of windows. This shot was taken on 18th Street in the Castro, one of the centres of queer life in San Francisco. Anyone who had an apartment on the march route would take full advantage of their windows. Every year, the inhabitants of houses would lean out of the windows, often with signs, screaming for the crowd and the crowd would scream back. More than 20 years later, this image still hits me in my gut: I feel the power in it. It encapsulates a kind of joy that, at the time, was absolutely necessary. It was a way of celebrating sex in the face of the death wrought by Aids, and in opposition to voices on the right who blamed us for the epidemic. We couldn’t marry and job security was still uneven across the US for queer people. We still felt like outlaws. In the 1980s, there was a lot of discussion among feminists about the importance of sex. Some took a strident line – that photographing sex was offensive, even violent. While we owe everything to lesbian feminists of that era – they paved the way in so many respects – our generation wanted something different. We were pro kink, pro sex, and pro pornography. Sex meant a lot to us; we weren’t just going to let it go. It was a kind of political hedonism. There have been few times in history where women run the camera, the press and the ecosystem of publishing. But the world we created in San Francisco felt like a beautiful laboratory. It wasn’t separatist by any means – we didn’t seclude ourselves from men and non-lesbians – but we were making work for each other. I think that’s evident in these images. Publishing my work from that time in book form has been a dream of mine. I photographed that period so intensively: it told such a story of that community, and I didn’t want it to get lost. Photographs can get destroyed, ruined or lost, and the relative scarcity of lesbian publications means that, often, this work is absent from our collective archives. I’m so glad this survived. I have immense respect for the women who let me photograph them. It was a real political statement. But there was a feeling that it was also essential to let other gay women know that they were not alone. There’s always this stereotype of the lesbian as angry. Often, we had reason to be. But sometimes, we were too busy having a great time.

1/13/2022,"The Downing Street media briefing immediately following prime minister’s questions was dominated by queries about a social event in the No 10 garden in May 2020, and what Boris Johnson knew about it. There were, however, remarkably few answers. Below is a list of questions not answered on Wednesday by Johnson’s official spokesperson and his press secretary.  Beyond saying Johnson did not see and was not sent an email organising the event sent by the senior official Martin Reynolds, no answer: “He did not see the email, and as he said, he believed the events in question were within the rules.” “All I will say is to repeat what he [Johnson] said: ‘It was my view implicitly that this was a work event.’” “As I said, he did not see the email. Beyond that, he set out a clear account of this in his statement.” “On those specific allegations and speculation, those matters will rightly remain for the independent review to look at and determine.” “I don’t plan to add anything on this. This is a matter for the independent review to determine.” “Again, I’m afraid this is going to be fairly repetitive, but matters around the guidance, the nature of the gatherings, attendance, settings and purpose rightly remain a matter for the independent review.” “Again, matters around guidance, the nature of the gatherings, attendance, are a matter for the independent review.” “Again, I’m afraid the details around the nature of the event are a matter for the independent review. You would not expect me to pre-empt any of the findings.” “I wouldn’t comment on that one.” “Same answer. That gets into matters around the nature of the gathering, and guidance.” “Again, on all of the matters around those specific details, that will be for the independent review to determine.” “I’m going to have to just refer you to what he said.” “Again, he’s obviously not pre-empting the findings. He said in his statement that while he cannot anticipate the conclusions of the inquiry, he has learned enough to know that there were things we simply did not get right.” “Again, he’s not pre-empting the findings of the report. All of these matters remain a matter for the independent review to determine.” “I don’t know exactly what format Sue Gray will set out in the review. But it has our backing.” “I’m afraid not. As we’ve said numerous times, it’s an independent process.” “We wouldn’t get into the details of an independent inquiry. But as we’ve said before, the inquiry, and Sue Gray, has access to all individuals that are required to be spoken to.” “I would refer to the terms of reference. But the inquiry has access to all information and relevant individuals.” “He is not, but beyond that it is a hypothetical question.” “He [Johnson] has set out his understanding going into the event.

1/13/2022,"Succession, The Power of the Dog, Ted Lasso and House of Gucci were out in front with the announcement of this year’s Screen Actors Guild nominations.  The awards, voted on by members of the guild, honour both film and TV and are often seen as an indicator of who will go on to win Oscars. Jane Campion’s acclaimed Netflix drama The Power of the Dog picked up three nominations for Benedict Cumberbatch as lead actor and Kirsten Dunst and Kodi-Smit McPhee in supporting roles. Cumberbatch, whose role as a closeted rancher has won him the finest reviews of his career, will face off against Will Smith for King Richard, Denzel Washington for The Tragedy of Macbeth, Andrew Garfield for Tick, Tick … Boom! and Javier Bardem for Being the Ricardos. For lead actress, Lady Gaga’s performance in the fact-based drama House of Gucci is up against Olivia Colman for The Lost Daughter, Nicole Kidman in Being the Ricardos, Jennifer Hudson in Respect and Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. Spencer’s Kristen Stewart, who many had expected would be a major player, was a notable omission. Dunst’s beleaguered mother sits alongside Cate Blanchett’s Nightmare Alley femme fatale, Ruth Negga in Passing, Ariana DeBose in West Side Story and Catriona Balfe in Kenneth Branagh’s autobiographical Belfast. In the supporting actor category, Smit-McPhee is challenged by Bradley Cooper in Licorice Pizza, Ben Affleck in The Tender Bar, Troy Kotsur in Coda and Jared Leto’s divisive performance in House of Gucci. Ridley Scott’s drama about the assassination of a Gucci family member was also nominated for best ensemble alongside the casts of King Richard, Coda, Don’t Look Up and Belfast. On the television side, the third season of HBO’s drama Succession picked up nominations for Brian Cox, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong in the category of best actor in a drama series, Sarah Snook for best actress and the cast as a whole for best drama ensemble. The ensemble category also features the casts of The Handmaid’s Tale, Yellowstone, The Morning Show and Squid Game, making history as the first ever foreign language TV nominee. The actor in a drama series category also features The Morning Show’s Billy Crudup and Squid Game’s Lee Jung-jae while the actress category also features The Morning Show’s Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, Elisabeth Moss for The Handmaid’s Tale and Squid Game’s Jung Ho-yeon. Comedy nominees were led by Ted Lasso picking up nods for Brett Goldstein and Jason Sudeikis as actor and Juno Temple and Hannah Waddington as actress. The hit Apple show was also nominated for best comedy ensemble alongside freshman shows Hacks and Only Murders in the Building, The Great and The Kominsky Method. Jean Smart was nominated for best comedy actress for her role in Hacks, facing off against Elle Fanning in The Great, Sandra Oh in The Chair and the aforementioned Ted Lasso nominees. Smart was also nominated for best actress in a limited series for Mare of Easttown where she will be challenged by co-star Kate Winslet, The White Lotus’s Jennifer Coolidge, Maid’s Margaret Qualley and Cynthia Erivo for Genius: Aretha. Goldstein and Sudeikis are up against Steve Martin and Martin Short for Only Murders in the Building and Michael Douglas for The Kominsky Method. The category for best actor in a limited series features Ewan McGregor for Halston, Oscar Isaac for Scenes from a Marriage, Evan Peters for Mare of Easttown and Murray Bartlett for The White Lotus. The nominations arrive after last weekend’s Golden Globes which saw lead actor wins for Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Garfield and Rachel Zegler.

1/13/2022,"The prime minister’s authority was teetering on the brink of an abyss after he admitted attending a “bring your own booze” gathering in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown – but insisted it “technically” broke no rules. Amid speculation that this scandal could finally be the one to undo him, Boris Johnson apologised on Wednesday afternoon to the nation at prime minister’s questions. But was it enough to persuade rebellious Tory MPs? Here are some of their responses.  Christopher Chope, MP for Christchurch, appeared to reverse his earlier position on the debacle, which he had described as “dirty linen”, by praising Johnson’s “most abject and fulsome apology”. Chope told Sky News: I think it was a full apology rather than a partial one. And he took responsibility for what had happened, and I think most right-minded people will say we must accept that apology. Obviously it’s not the end of the matter because, as he pointed out, there is this inquiry going on and there will be a further opportunity for him to be subject to scrutiny when we know the results of that inquiry.” In what appeared to be an attempted defence of the PM, Simon Hoare, MP for North Dorset, said he did not know if Johnson would survive. He told Sky: As I understand it, and this is a third-hand understanding, this was a party organised to say, in the first instance, welcome back the prime minister. He had been in hospital, I think I’ve got the timeline right, and recuperating at Chequers. It was also a way of saying thank you to Dominic Raab for holding the fort. So whether the prime minister knew it was taking place or whether everybody just jumped out of the shrubbery and said ‘Surprise’, I don’t know. Sir Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, who is regarded as a senior backbencher, said it was clear Johnson misled parliament; politically, he was a “dead man walking”. Gale told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: Unfortunately, what the prime minister has said today leaves people like me in an impossible situation. We now know that the prime minister spent 25 minutes at what was quite clearly a party. That means that he misled the house. I fear that it is now going to have to be the work of the 1922 [Committee] to determine precisely how we proceed. If you look at the Twittersphere after prime minister’s question time today, it sounds to me I am afraid very much as though politically the prime minister is a dead man walking. Also condemnatory was Ruth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives. On Twitter, she referred to a previous comment criticising the government’s circumlocutions around the lockdown parties scandal, and added: And I’m not convinced today drew a line under anything either.” Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former most-senior aide, who has become a staunch critic of his old boss, also used Twitter to give his insider’s perspective. The party took place two days before the Guardian and Daily Mirror Barnard Castle exposé that precipitated Cummings’ own downfall. He wrote: Whole point of why I & other official told MR – WTF YOU DOING HOLDING A PARTY – was cos the invite = obv totally SOCIAL NOT WORK (UNlike all the mtngs in garden). No way ‘technically within rules’. [Shopping trolley] bullshit cos altern is admit he broke rules + resign. Not all Conservative MPs were so loquacious in their responses.

1/13/2022,"And Just Like That did not have the smoothest of landings. The Sex and the City sequel found itself draped in controversy from the moment its return was announced. There would be no Samantha Jones, with the core group reduced to a trio, after Kim Cattrall did not return to the franchise. (Was she invited? Did she decline? I look forward to an inevitable Ryan Murphy dramatisation of events – Feud: Cosmos and Cupcakes.) The films had been middling, then terrible, then a third thankfully ditched before it got too far. Could a series that was built on being so brassy and brash survive in the tetchy 2020s? Then it finally arrived, and the drama rolled on. The big twist, or the Big twist, at the end of episode one was briefly a moment, controversial largely for the fact that instead of weeping and hugging her still-conscious husband as he had a heart attack, Carrie might have considered calling an ambulance instead. To think that the reputation of Peloton was the main topic of conversation. Shortly after it aired, allegations of sexual assault were made against Chris Noth by multiple women. He issued a denial, but his co-stars published a message of support for his accusers, and a rumoured cameo at the end of the season was reportedly scrapped.  Critics of the show itself were not kind, and the first two episodes were certainly unsteady. It seemed clunky, grasping at what it felt was the zeitgeist with all the grace of a drunken goat. A couple of its storylines proved fuel for the dreaded culture wars, which some viewers managed to interpret as the writers’ hatred for its three leading women. It introduced a non-binary queer character, Che (Sara Ramirez), and Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte, now in their 50s, struggled to navigate this terribly modern world, as I struggled to navigate the idea that a podcast could represent the height of baffling modernity. Subtlety was not its strong point. Carrie seemed never to have heard of Diwali. The less said about kitchen sex, the better. Don’t make me relive “Rambo”. But the truth is that I am hedging my bets, acknowledging that I see its flaws and can understand many, though not all, of the criticisms. I note that these criticisms are rarely aimed at the first two episodes, however, and are about scenes that happen in episodes three, four and five (Miranda’s cheating, Carrie’s dodgy hip). So, I got to thinking, are the people who claim to hate this, watching it anyway? I suspect the answer is yes. Obviously, its return has been bumpy. (Miranda’s an alcoholic! Oh no she isn’t! Oh yes she is!) Yet every week, I wait for the day a new episode appears, then I stop what I’m doing to watch it, as soon as time and decency allow. I have heard others quietly admitting to the same. It is ironic that And Just Like That has struggled with technology – from Carrie’s coy and then freewheeling contributions to the podcast, to her inability to switch off a beeping device in her new apartment – because this show both fits into and resists the digital era. It fits into it because, on the accounts I follow, at least, which I admit are of a certain, camp bias, it is a talking point every week. It seems to have become that much-coveted thing, water-cooler television. And it resists it, because there is something free and old-fashioned about the way in which it feels so thrown together and blase. Some viewers have interpreted its tone as tiptoeing around the “issues”, whatever they may be, but the characters’ occasional blundering about identity, for example, seems pretty loose and open to me. To enjoy the series – and I realised, three or four episodes in, that I really am enjoying it – requires holding two contradictory notions in mind. One is that it can be incredibly clumsy and has many moments that seem ill-judged. The other is that it is pleasurable and very entertaining, and still has many of its charms, if not quite the same ones that it had in its heyday. One recent episode saw Carrie contemplating having a few cosmetic tweaks to her face, which turned into a thoughtful exploration of the value of lived experience.

1/13/2022,"Channel 5 has said it expects its profits for last year to be the biggest since the broadcaster launched almost a quarter of a century ago, fuelled by a TV advertising boom off the back of lockdown hits such as All Creatures Great and Small and Our Yorkshire Farm. The public service broadcaster, which is controlled by MTV-owner ViacomCBS, said when its 2021 results were officially reported it was likely to deliver a record operating profit.  This means Channel 5 is banking on having made in excess of £60m last year, given the broadcaster’s previous most lucrative year was 2016 when it reported £58.3m in operating profits, according to filings at Companies House. The broadcaster, whose previous owners have included the German media group RTL and Richard Desmond’s Northern & Shell, has managed to report annual profits in only nine of the 24 years since it was founded in 1997. Channel 5 revealed the 2021 forecast in financial filings that showed a £7m operating loss for 2020, as revenues fell 16% to £294m compared with 2019. The company said the challenging conditions at the height of the pandemic in 2020 gave way to a record year for the total UK TV ad market last year, with revenues up 23% to £4.6bn, ahead of 2019 levels. The strong performance of a string of shows in 2020 such as Our Yorkshire Farm, Channel 5’s highest rated factual programme, and the revival of All Creatures Great and Small, its best-performing programme since 2016, as well as dramas such as The Deceived pushed its share of all UK TV audiences to the highest level since 2014. The strong viewing performance in 2020, which included a 17% increase in primetime viewing and its biggest ABC1 audience since 2008, paved the way for record deals with advertisers as the UK TV market bounced back strongly last year.",News/Media,Channel 5 on track to report record profits for 2021 after ads boom,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/12/channel-5-record-profits-ads-boom
1/13/2022,"British skiers could soon be able to return to French slopes after an announcement that France is due to lift its blanket ban on non-essential travel from the UK. The French government’s official spokesman, Gabriel Attal, said after a weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday that Paris would ease travel restrictions from the UK to France in the next few days.  “I confirm that a further easing of the restrictions with the UK will be announced in the coming days,” Gabriel Attal told reporters. “Work is continuing. I hope that the announcement can be made by the end of the week.” France dramatically tightened restrictions on travel from and to Britain on 18 December in an attempt to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, effectively banning all non-essential journeys by requiring vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers to show a “compelling reason” for travel. The rule, which effectively limited entry from the UK to France and EU nationals and British citizens resident in France, was later eased to allow people in “for the pursuit of an economic activity requiring an on-site presence that cannot be postponed.” The rules also require all arrivals from the UK to present a negative PCR or antigen test taken within the previous 24 hours, rather than 48 hours, and to quarantine in France for seven days – reduced to 48 hours if they can produce a new negative test. On December 30, the French government suspended one of the new rules to allow British nationals who were legally resident in other EU countries to transit through France to reach their homes by road and rail. Border officials would “show tolerance” in order to allow people to return home after the Christmas and New Year period, the interior ministry said, without specifying when the rule would be reimposed. On Wednesday, Attal said he had said at the time that the new rules were introduced that “if we continued to see the same situation, that is the Omicron variant becoming dominant in France, of course we would continue to ease the restrictions.” New daily coronavirus infections in France have since set successive records, with the country on Tuesday reporting a new high of nearly 370,000 infections and a seven-day average high of more than 283,000, with Omicron accounting for 87% of all cases nationwide. The tight travel restrictions were also imposed during what analysts see as a breakdown of trust between the British and French governments in the wake of Brexit over a host of issues from migrants to fishing. They were a blow to the French tourism industry over the Christmas period, in particular to Alpine ski resorts, which are very popular with UK tourists. Charles Owen, managing director of Seasonal Businesses in Travel, an industry organisation representing UK travel businesses that mainly operate ski holidays, said the news could lead to a surge in bookings. “This is very welcome news, not only for the thousands of UK holidaymakers and people visiting friends and family in France, but also for the thousands of UK ski-tour operators that have been in an effective shutdown for 22 months,” he said. “Snow conditions in the Alps are near perfect and we expect demand for holidays to be very high over the next few weeks,” he added.",News/World news,France poised to lift blanket ban on UK travellers ‘by end of the week’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/france-poised-to-lift-blanket-ban-on-uk-travellers-by-end-of-the-week

1/13/2022,"He is a superstar artist in the US, revered for powerful civil war scenes and dramatic coastal storms, but Winslow Homer is barely known in the UK. Even less well known is the importance of an English seaside village in making him the truly great painter he became. The National Gallery will this year aim to correct that with the first in-depth exhibition of Homer’s art staged in the UK.  It has announced details of a major show telling the story of someone who is a household name in the US. “Every American is brought up knowing their Winslow Homer imagery,” said Christopher Riopelle, the National Gallery’s curator of post-1800 paintings. The exhibition will tell the story of his two years in Cullercoats, a fishing village on the coast between Whitley Bay and Tynemouth. Homer made his name as an embedded artist-reporter with the union army during the American civil war, providing imagery for the monthly press. He used these images in powerful paintings that, said Riopelle, “established him as someone who was really talking about America in the modern world. He was somehow telling Americans the truth about America.” Precisely why Homer decided in 1881, in his mid-40s, to move to Cullercoats will never be fully known. One story is that he met someone on the boat from the US to Liverpool who told him there was this place on the North Sea that had become something of an artists’ colony and he should take a look. “I’m not sure that’s entirely believable,” said Riopelle. “He was looking for imagery of heroism in modern life and I think someone told him there were these life-saving crews up there on the North Sea.” He followed his nose and found the heroism he was seeking. If there was an emergency at sea during the night Homer was out watching emergency crews go out, observing women on the beach beaten by the wind and the rain. Homer made many small sketches of what he saw, mostly in watercolour. “The fascinating thing about Cullercoats,” said Riopelle, “is that it doesn’t die when he leaves. Once back in America it is imagery he keeps going back to.” Critics quickly noticed that Homer’s style had changed. Riopelle said you could see Cullercoats in a great picture, The Life Line from 1884. “Cullercoats showed him how he could find allegory in modern life,” said Riopelle. The exhibition will include important pictures Homer made in Cullercoats, or those emerging directly from his time there. They include The Gale (1883), showing a single woman on the shore wrapped in shawls as the wind blows around her. When it was originally shown at the Royal Academy it contained much more detail, including a ship. Later “he took out all those anecdotal details and just reduced it to the woman on the shore in the gale who was, you know … coping. He wanted to get to the essence of things.” Another Cullercoats work is Inside the Bar, an 1883 watercolour being lent by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, a co-organiser of the exhibition. Highlights of the London show will include Sharpshooter (1863), coming from the Portland Museum in Maine and painted during the civil war, and the probable star of the show, The Gulf Stream, being loaned by the Met. Today, no Homer work exists in any British collection. The National Gallery tried to acquire a Cullercoats sketch some years ago but was outbid. “We were soundly beaten because of course Homer is a giant in America,” said Riopelle. Homer, who liked being seen as a taciturn Yankee, has had acres written about him, a lot of it speculation. “When you’re writing about him it’s absolutely impossible because he never said a damn thing,” said Riopelle. “There’s no paper trail, no letters, nothing.”  Winslow Homer: Force of Nature is at the National Gallery from 10 September-8 January.",Arts/Art and design,National Gallery to reconnect Britain with giant of US art Winslow Homer,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/12/national-gallery-to-reconnect-britain-with-giant-of-us-art-winslow-homer
1/13/2022,"If, like me, you spent the first week of the year excitedly hoovering up every last “Best upcoming shows of 2022” list online, I’m afraid I have some bad news. Not one list mentioned GenZeroes, and GenZeroes has the potential to be the most important television series ever made. Or, you know, it might be a steaming bag of turds that is watched by literally zero people on Earth. But, hey, it’s always nice to be positive.  Because, just as the television industry is starting to adjust to the popularity of non-linear, streaming viewing habits, GenZeroes represents the next incredible frontier of home entertainment. That’s right, GenZeroes is an NFT (non-fungible token) show. Now, true, the success of GenZeroes seems to be slightly hamstrung by the fact that nobody really seems to know what an NFT is. According to a report in Deadline this week, to watch an episode of GenZeroes, viewers will have to purchase an NFT through a specific website and, depending on the level of NFT purchased, receive access to a range of benefits or even ownership of the show itself. Which, as barriers to entry go, is just a little bit higher than “turn on the television”. Still, direct payment for television programmes is nothing new. Louis CK tried something vaguely similar when he offered new episodes of Horace and Pete to his email subscribers for $5 a pop. The system didn’t take off for a number of reasons, among them that the show was weird and meandering, that CK repeatedly griped about how much money he lost making it, and that he was quickly banished from the mainstream due to a flood of sexual impropriety allegations. Either way, with Horace and Pete you only needed to know your credit card number. For GenZeroes, you basically have to learn an entirely new financial system. That might be worth it if GenZeroes has an unmissable premise and acres of buzz. But no. It’s a show called GenZeroes. It’s a sci-fi set 200 years after an alien invasion of Earth. It’s written by the people who made that Van Helsing show you never saw, and stars Aleks Paunovic, whose top hit on IMDb is his role as Karate Dad in the 2012 film This Means War. In all fairness, GenZeroes might be incredible. But when Netflix started to make original programming, it hired one of the world’s best directors and an Oscar-winning actor to remake the BBC’s beloved political drama House of Cards. It felt unmissable. This, meanwhile, feels eminently missable. It sounds like a B-grade Quibi show. But who knows. There’s always a danger, when you write about emergent technology, of getting stuck on the wrong side of history. People wrote television off at first, and talking movies, and the internet. Even if GenZeroes is more an experiment than anything else, even if it’s just a weather balloon to test a new distribution model, there’s a chance that 20 years from now we’ll all be consuming television that we’ve bought with NFTs. There is certainly momentum building behind the idea. Last year Ashton Kutcher launched Stoner Cats, an animated NFT comedy about some pot-smoking felines that featured the voice talents of Jane Fonda, Chris Rock and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Was Stoner Cats any good? Sadly, the only way to watch it was to purchase an NFT token that cost 0.35 ethereum coins which – since that equates in real world terms to $1,130 – does seem a little steep for a five-minute cartoon about some cats. Which is a polite way of saying that I will die a violent fiery death before I ever find out. GenZeroes is a little more affordable than Stoner Cats – if I’m getting this right, you can buy an access NFT for about $100, but that’s still roughly the equivalent of a year’s Netflix subscription, which is a hell of a punt for a show where every character looks like a Björk album cover. Very few people are willing or able to drop that sort of money on a television series, which makes me doubt the model’s viability. But maybe that’s not the point. People don’t buy NFTs so that they can enjoy well-crafted content. They buy it so they can eventually get incredibly rich. Perhaps that’s the true fate of GenZeroes: nobody will watch it, but somewhere down the line it’ll make three crypto bros even wealthier. Count me out.",Arts/Television & radio,A fad or the future: are we ready for the rise of NFT TV shows?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/12/nvt-tv-shows-genzeroes
1/13/2022,"Germany has reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases as the Omicron variant increases its spread. The Robert Koch Institute, the country’s national disease control agency, said on Wednesday it had registered 80,430 new cases, where the previous record had been just over 65,000 in mid-November. It said 384 people had died in the previous 24 hours, bringing the death toll from coronavirus in Europe’s most populous country to about 115,000.  As health officials and policy makers seek ways to keep this latest wave under control, given the infectiousness of the Omicron variant which is dominating in parts of the country, they remain cautiously optimistic that the relatively low hospitalisation rate and tightening of protection measures will contribute to managing the virus over the coming weeks. Concern is focused on ensuring the most vulnerable are vaccinated, and that all adults have access to a third booster shot, as well as on keeping up vital facilities such as hospitals and rubbish collection amid a rise in sickness levels across the workforce. A vaccine mandate – so-called Impfpflicht – is being hotly discussed across the political parties. A Bundestag debate on the subject is scheduled for two weeks’ time, and a law could be in place by March, leading MPs have said. Among suggested variations are a regulation that would be limited to a year, or one that would target only those over the age of 50. The country’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said due to differing opinions on the issue, and the fact that many who had previously rejected the idea of an obligatory vaccine were now in favour of it, a “thorough debate” was necessary. He told a group of citizens at a discussion event that people who claimed Germany was controlled by a “coronavirus dictatorship” were “showing contempt for democracy and its constitutional institutions”. He added: “This is simply vicious nonsense.” While leading government figures such as the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, have made public their support for a mandate, the government has said a vote on the issue would not be government-led, in order to ensure as wide a consensus as possible. With a growth in the number and regularity of protests across the country against coronavirus protection measures in recent weeks, as well as death threats faced by politicians, there is an acute awareness of the need to keep the majority of the public onboard. Most Germans have said in polls that they are in favour of a vaccine mandate. As of Tuesday, 72.2% of all Germans had been double-jabbed, and 51.4% of adults had received the recommended booster jab. The government’s goal is for 80% of the population to have been vaccinated by the end of this month. Scholz has said he would later aim for 90%. Lauterbach announced on Wednesday that the country had enough stocks to give every German three more jabs, having procured an extra 5m doses from fellow EU partner Romania, which has been unable to administer them. Some vaccine sceptics have said they might be persuaded to be vaccinated once Novavax, a vaccine referred to as a “dead” vaccine because it contains the spike proteins that cover the virus’s surface, becomes available, possibly later this month. The hope is that this will help to boost vaccine take-up. Stricter measures were introduced on Tuesday across Germany, particularly in restaurants and hotels. Referred to as 2G+, they require people to show proof they have been double-vaccinated, or have recovered within the last six months, and have either received a booster shot or have an official negative test result. These rules have been extended to the Bundestag, requiring MPs who are not vaccinated and have no medical exemption, to sit in the public gallery above the plenary hall, as long as they have an official negative test result. In addition they must now wear medical FFP2 masks. Thinner, typically blue medical masks widely used until now are no longer allowed. The rules will be in place until 28 February. Both the far-right populist AfD and members of the far-left Die Linke have threatened to take legal steps against the move. Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD parliamentary group, who was unvaccinated but has recovered from coronavirus, accused the government of “shrinking MPs’ mandates”. She received unlikely support from Sahra Wagenknecht of Die Linke, who told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland in an interview: “To lock unvaccinated MPs out of the plenary hall rather than requiring everyone to take a tests, is epidemiologically nonsensical and quite clearly unconstitutional, owing to the lack of protection vaccines give against infection and transmission.” The video platform YouTube has meanwhile confirmed reports that it had blocked the anti-coronavirus measures lobby group #allesaufdentisch (lay it on the table), key supporters of which include leading figures from the German cultural world, from uploading videos for several days after it was accused of spreading falsehoods about the virus. One of the videos posted by the group falsely claimed that the coronavirus vaccine had led to 13,000 deaths, and compared the virus to a light cold. A YouTube spokesman confirmed to Spiegel that the video had “contravened our medical misinformation policy”. With increasing numbers of Germans working from home once again, the labour minister, Hubertus Heil, announced on Wednesday that in future employers would be obliged by law to allow employees to work from home as long as this was compatible with their jobs.",News/World news,Germany reports record number of daily Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/germany-reports-record-number-of-daily-covid-cases
1/13/2022,"Donald Trump hung up on a national US radio station halfway through a scheduled interview on Tuesday, after the former president was confronted about his election lies.  Trump, who has continued to falsely claim he won the 2020 presidential election instead of Joe Biden, was heard becoming increasingly irritated through the interview with National Public Radio before abruptly signing off. The ending meant NPR, which had been promised a 15-minute interview, had to make do with just nine minutes, much of it consisting of a vexed Trump talking over host Steve Inskeep. The segment, which aired on Wednesday, ended with Inskeep asking Trump if Republicans must repeat Trump’s increasingly unhinged allegations of election fraud in order to win his endorsement. “They are going to do whatever they want to do – whatever they have to do, they’re going to do,” Trump said. Never one to remain on topic, Trump added: “But the ones that are smart – the ones that know, you take a look at. Again, you take a look at how Kari Lake is doing, running for [Arizona] governor. She’s very big on this issue. She’s leading by a lot. “People have no idea how big this issue is, and they don’t want it to happen again. It shouldn’t be allowed to happen, and they don’t want it to happen again.” Inskeep attempted to move the conversation on, but Trump further added: “And the only way it’s not going to happen again is you have to solve the problem of the presidential rigged election of 2020.” Inskeep again tried to interject, only for Trump to sign himself off. “So Steve, thank you very much. I appreciate it.” It left Inskeep, who said he had been attempting to interview Trump for six years, and who had begun asking a further question, hanging on the line, before the NPR host accepted: “He’s gone. OK.” As is his wont, Trump had used the interview to repeat a slew of lies and conspiracy theories about the last presidential election. But with Trump used to friendly conversations with rightwing organizations such as Fox News, it appears he was upset at receiving pushback from NPR, which receives some of its funding from the federal government and is one of the most trusted news organizations in the US. Interviewers, at least those from conservative outlets, have previously struggled to get Trump off the phone rather than keep him on it. In April 2018, Trump called in to Fox News for an interview, and spent 30 minutes railing against Robert Mueller’s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump 2016 election campaign and Russia and subsequent obstruction, and other topics, until Brian Kilmeade had to gently edge Trump off the phone. “We could talk to you all day, but it looks like you have a million things to do,” Kilmeade said. “He got the president off the phone like an annoying relative,” Stephen Colbert quipped.",News/US news,‘He’s gone.

1/13/2022,"The New York court ruling that the civil sex assault case against the Duke of York will proceed is a devastating blow for Prince Andrew and the royal family after more than a decade of allegation and innuendo. Aside from any appeal Prince Andrew may be able to mount against Wednesday’s ruling, he faces the ignominious prospect of having to give evidence in a sex assault lawsuit and face cross-examination on aspects of his private life to clear his name. Win or lose, it is an unprecedented chapter in the royal family’s modern history.  One option to avoid this uncomfortable scenario would be to reach a settlement, though such is the momentum of this case worldwide it seems unlikely this could satisfactorily rehabilitate his reputation. Since Andrew was photographed in 2010 in New York’s Central Park with the sex offender and wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein, the duke’s public image has been tarnished by association. When, in 2011, the photograph of Andrew with his arm around the waist of the then 17-year-old Virginia Roberts appeared, it further damned him in the court of public opinion. But it was in 2015, that Roberts, now Giuffre, first alleged in legal papers she was forced to have sex with the prince – in Epstein’s New York mansion, on his private island in the US Virgin Islands, and at Maxwell’s London home. Since then, all Andrew’s attempts to fight the allegations – which he vehemently denies – while trying to avoid a courtroom showdown, have failed. His 2019 Newsnight interview, a high-stakes ploy, was widely derided as a car crash, and served to worsen his public standing. It resulted in the Queen making the firm and speedy decision that her second son must step away from royal duties, and from his Pitch@Palace entrepreneurial initiative. Aside from any appeal on Judge Lewis Kaplan’s ruling, Andrew now faces the “discovery” phase, which involves the taking of depositions. “That will involve witnesses on both sides being interviewed by the opposing legal team in the presence of their own legal team and either in the presence of a court reporter to take a verbatim transcript or with the interview being videotaped ‘for the court record’”, said Nick Goldstone, the head of dispute resolution at Ince. “It would be possible to have Prince Andrew deposed [interviewed] in the UK, so he would not need to travel to New York for his deposition.” “If the case progresses all the way through to a trial, I think the prince would be under enormous pressure to appear in person if he is going to give evidence in his defence. He may, of course, decline to appear, and I am certain that he cannot be compelled to appear. I think it is unlikely that he would be allowed to appear at a trial via a remote video link, and in any event, from a presentational perspective, that would not look good.” Another option, unattractive as it may be to Andrew, would be to stop the whole process by reaching a settlement with Giuffre. “If he can’t get it struck out, he has a choice of fronting it up at trial and facing the consequences of a verdict, which may go in his favour or may not. Or settle the case on the best terms available and getting certainty by resolving the case without having to appear, ending this process, unsatisfactorily maybe, but bringing the court process to an end,” Goldstone said. “I do think this story has now got so much momentum that it is a difficult case to settle with him having any future public life,” he added. Since the Newsnight interview, which backfired so spectacularly, Buckingham Palace has sought to put space between the institution of the monarchy and Andrew’s legal travails. Questions about the case are routinely referred to Andrew’s legal representatives, with the Queen’s aides refusing to comment on them. Andrew may have no current role in public life, and possibly never again will have, though he is said to harbour hopes his reputation can be rehabilitated. But he is still a member of the royal family, and as such his presence at family events continues. When the Duke of Edinburgh died, and members of the family paid tribute in television interviews, Andrew, with the Queen’s permission, was given a prominent role in addressing the media. He visited her at Balmoral in the summer, and several times has been photographed driving from his Windsor home to Windsor Castle to see his mother. But the Queen is 96 in April. Prince Charles and Prince William, the two next in line to the throne, will be very much taking the temperature of the nation’s mood reflected in Andrew’s plummeting standing in the polls, and both are understood to have concerns that he can ever play a public role again – even if he does succeed in clearing his name. “The Duke of York’s reputation is so badly tarnished that if the case went to trial and he won, his rehabilitation would be minimal,” said Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine. “The only official evidence of the Queen’s support for her second son is her agreeing to him stepping back from his royal role in late 2019 as the crisis intensified. However, as Andrew’s mother she continues to see him on a regular basis at Windsor Castle, so the personal bond is clearly still in place,” he added. “The Queen, Charles and William, mindful of the damage being done to the institution of monarchy, may have to take decisive action before the situation goes from bad to worse. “Official retirement as a working royal, perhaps, and the relinquishing of military appointments and patronages.”",News/UK news,Lawsuit is devastating blow for Prince Andrew – and the royal family ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/lawsuit-is-devastating-blow-for-prince-andrew-and-the-royal-family
