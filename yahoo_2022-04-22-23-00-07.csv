4/22/2022,"Sergey Protosenya was found dead in Spain alongside his wife and daughter on Tuesday, police said. Novatek, his former company, cast doubt on a working police theory that Protosenya killed his family and then himself. Novatek said he was a ""wonderful family man"" and slammed ""speculations"" on his death. The former company of a Russian oligarch found dead in Spain along with his wife and child has cast doubt on a prevailing police theory that the deaths were a murder-suicide. Sergey Protosenya was found hanging in an apartment in Lloret de Mar, a seaside town in Catalonia, Spain, Spanish TV channel Telecinco reported. His wife and daughter were also found dead with stab wounds in the same apartment, the outlet reported. Murder-suicide is the primary working theory of the Mossos D'Esquadra, the Catalan police body investigating the deaths, a spokesperson from Lloret De Mar's town hall told Insider. The Mossos did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In a Thursday statement, Novatek, a major Russian natural gas producer, appeared to suggest that the idea that its former employee could be responsible for the deaths bears ""no relation to reality."" ""Sergey Protosenya ... established himself as an outstanding person and a wonderful family man, a strong professional who made a considerable contribution to the formation and development of the Company,"" it said. ""Unfortunately, speculations have emerged in the media about this topic, but we are convinced that these speculations bear no relation to reality."" Novatek referred Insider to this statement without further comment when asked whether it was referring to the idea that Protosenya could be responsible for the deaths. When approached by Insider with the town hall's confirmation that the police were considering the murder-suicide theory, which would put the matter outside of media speculation, the Novatek spokesperson said this was a question for the Mossos. The Mossos said in a Tuesday statement that it was alerted to the deaths of three people in Lloret De Mar on Tuesday, without naming the victims. A Mossos spokesperson referred to this statement when Insider asked for comment on Protosenya. Though Protosenya's body was found with a bloodied knife and an ax nearby, there were no bloodstains on his person and no suicide note, Spanish outlet El Punta Vui reported, without citing sources. El Punta Vui also reported on Thursday that murder-suicide was the police's primary theory for the deaths. On this basis, the town hall organized a minute's silence on Wednesday in memory of the woman and girl who died, its spokesperson said. Two local equalities ministers, Tània Verge and Irene Montero, also called for unity against gender-based violence, Spanish newspaper La Vangurdia reported. Protosenya served on Novatek's management board between 1997 and 2015, the company said. He was retired at the time of his death, and had amassed a fortune of around $440 million, La Vanguardia reported, citing sources close to the family. Catalan police are currently combing the Protosenya family's phone records and security footage from the home, El Punta Vui reported. The discovery of the Protosenya family's deaths came a day after another Russian oligarch with connections to the energy industry, Vladislav Avayev, was found dead along with his wife and child in his Moscow apartment. Avayev was the former vice president of Gazprombank and was found dead from gunshot wounds, as were his wife and daughter, on Monday, the Russian state-run news agency Tass reported. There is no evidence of a connection between the cases, whose similarities have nonetheless sparked intense international interest.

4/22/2022,"Count us among those excited for Jetson’s One eVTOL. The Swedish start-up, which shares a name with the ’60s-era cartoon character, has just shared a video of its Star Wars landspeeder-like personal aircraft flying over the hills in Tuscany. All along, Jetson has stressed that it was building an accessible vehicle that would fun for just about anyone to pilot. Based on the new clip it looks like they’ve accomplished just that. More from Robb Report Byredo's Heady New 'Vanilla Antique' Fragrance Was Created Especially for the Night This Painstakingly Restored 1960 Porsche Outlaw Is Now Up for Sale Lexus's First EV for the American Market Is--Surprise--an SUV The video, which runs just shy of two minutes, was uploaded to the company’s YouTube account earlier this week. In it, you can see the One taking off from the lawn of a Tuscan villa and methodically circling around the nearby tree-covered hillside. We never get to see the pilot push the craft to its limits but they do show just how maneuverable the aircraft can be. The zero-emission vehicle is able to cut through the air with ease and looks like a breeze to control. Jetson/YouTube The video offers multiple cuts of the pilot’s perspective. Although they’re brief, the sequences give a glimpse at what you’ll see when you’re at the eVTOL’s controls. They also highlight the gorgeous views offered by its open-air cockpit as it navigates a stretch of a Tuscan hillside. The video was released to mark six months since Jetson first unveiled the production-ready One. The single-seater features a stripped-down design and doesn’t require a pilot’s license, meaning practically anyone can fly it. It’s powered by four rotors—two in the front, two in the back—that get their juice from a lithium-ion battery. It’s far from the most powerful eVTOL we’ve seen, but it can still reach speeds of 63 mph, which should be more than enough for recreational fliers. Jetson “We’re happy to let the big guys solve the big problems,” Jetson’s president and founder Peter Ternström told us at the time. “We can teach you to fly our aircraft in five minutes. It’s like a jet ski or a scooter that flies.” Although the company has been generous with the images and video of its eVTOL, it’s yet to be shown off for the public. That’ll change on June 8, when the aircraft is officially unveiled by Prince Albert II of Monaco. The One costs $92,000, but be warned that all of this year’s build slots are already filled. Luckily, there are three future spots currently available to reserve through the company’s website. Your next trip to your friend’s house just got a little more exciting.
