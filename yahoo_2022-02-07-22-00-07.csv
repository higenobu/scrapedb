2/7/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — Britain on Monday firmly rejected a statement from China that affirmed Beijing's support for Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands, as relations between London and Asia's leading power remain strained. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a tweet that the United Kingdom “completely"" rejected ""any questions over sovereignty of the Falklands.” “The Falklands are part of the British family and we will defend their right to self determination. China must respect the Falklands’ sovereignty,” she wrote. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Argentine counterpart Alberto Fernandez issued a joint statement on Sunday that said China “reaffirms its support for Argentina’s demand for the full exercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands,” using the Argentine name for the territory. The two leaders met as Fernandez was in Beijing for the Winter Olympics. Argentina believes the Falklands were illegally taken from it in 1833 and invaded the British colony in 1982. The United Kingdom sent troops and Argentina lost the two-month war for the South Atlantic archipelago in a conflict that claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 British soldiers. Argentina still claims the islands. London says the Falklands are a self-governing entity under its protection. Relations with China have already been strained on multiple fronts, including Britain's joining a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics to protest China's human rights record. The joint statement also said Argentina “reaffirms its adherence to the one-China principle,"" a reference to China's claim to the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. “China and Argentina agree to carry on with close communication and coordination in international affairs, and safeguard the overall interests of the two countries and other developing countries,"" the statement said. Xi and Fernandez also pledged closer economic cooperation and signed a memorandum of understanding on Argentina joining the “Belt and Road Initiative,” Xi’s signature project to build Chinese infrastructure worldwide. China has overtaken Brazil as Argentina’s main commercial partner, and if talks with Beijing remain on track, Argentina would become the first of the four major Latin American economies to join the initiative. “Belt and Road Initiative integration won’t be a paradigm shift but rather a continuation of broader trends of growing Argentina-China engagement,” said Pepe Zhang, director and fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. During his visit, Fernandez also laid a wreath at the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, where the embalmed body of Mao Zedong, the communist revolutionary who founded the People's Republic, is displayed inside a crystal sarcophagus. ___ Associated Press writer Débora Rey in Buenos Aires, Argentina contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,UK rebukes China for supporting Argentina's Falklands claim,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-rebukes-china-supporting-argentinas-115952404.html
2/7/2022,"The defeated former president, Donald J. Trump, is facing four investigations for wrongdoing. Two, by the Manhattan district attorney in New York and the Fulton County district attorney in Georgia, aim to determine whether Trump and his associates committed serious crimes. Another, by the attorney general of New York, seeks to determine whether Trump or his business, the Trump Organization, committed civil wrongs in its handling of finances before he became president. A fourth, by a congressional House Select Committee, will tell the story of the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and how to avoid anything like it happening again. Four such investigations, each with potentially serious consequences, up to and including convictions for felonies, would weigh heavily on anyone. Trump appears to be rattled. This is evident from three points he made in a disturbing speech at a “Save America” rally in Texas. First, Trump conceded that he lost the 2020 election after more than a year insisting that he had won. “Mike Pence” he said, “did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power; he could have overturned the election!” Here, Trump supposes that the election outcome needed “changing” and needed “overturning.” Why? Because he lost. He admits he attempted to overthrow the election. Second, he defended the Jan. 6 insurrectionists and rioters: “If I run and I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly, and if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly.” Dangling pardons before them could impair ongoing prosecutions as the criminal defendants bet on pardons and clam up. More: Donald Trump's empire is in serious trouble. This time, he might not get away with it. More: GOP censures Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, calls Jan. 6 riot 'legitimate political discourse' Third, the problem with dangling pardons is greater for the future Trump envisions. After calling, without reason, the Manhattan and Atlanta prosecutors “radical, vicious racist prosecutors” who are “mentally sick,” he replayed his plan for Jan. 6, 2021, but on a greater scale: “If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta, and elsewhere, because our country and our elections are corrupt,” Of course, his view of the prosecutors he described is that they could not possibly be fair to him. So, he is threatening mass demonstrations to intimidate the criminal justice processes in those cities, to his advantage. Will the crowds be big? Will they be unruly? Will we see a violent effort to trash the prosecutor’s offices? And more? This sort of rhetoric is not worthy of America. Laurence Tribe, this nation’s foremost constitutional lawyer, said that, in this speech, Trump admitted to his guilt for seditious conspiracy and other felonies. Jamie Raskin, also a highly respected constitutional lawyer, called it a “smoking gun.” And John Dean, President Richard Nixon’s White House counsel, tweeted, “this is the stuff of dictators.” Steven J Burton taught law at the University of Iowa for 42 years before retiring in 2019.
