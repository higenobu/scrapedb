2/21/2022,"Advertisements authorised by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have appeared on WeChat despite Coalition politicians calling for a boycott of the social media platform. The ads, which attack Anthony Albanese and celebrate Chinese New Year, were posted on WeChat by the Chinese-Australian website Australian Financial News (AFN), along with articles in which the treasurer delivers a personalised Chinese New Year message and a feature about his ambition to be prime minister.  Guardian Australia understands the ads are funded by the Liberal party and were intended to be posted to WeChat in addition to AFN, although Frydenberg does not have an account on the platform. In January it was revealed Scott Morrison had lost control of his WeChat account, prompting accusations of foreign interference, despite WeChat’s owner, Chinese tech giant Tencent, insisting there was no evidence of any hacking or third-party intrusion. The Liberal MP James Paterson, who is chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, and independent researcher Alex Joske had urged politicians to ditch the platform in response. “I am calling on all Australian politicians to voluntarily boycott WeChat,” Paterson told the Daily Telegraph, in an editorial complaining that Albanese is still sharing updates with his WeChat followers. “We cannot allow a foreign authoritarian government to interfere in our democracy and set the terms of public debate in Australia.” Chinese-Australian Liberal MP Gladys Liu said she would be supporting the boycott because of “serious concerns of political interference”. On 1 February AFN, a Chinese-language business daily published in Sydney, posted a Chinese New Year greeting from Frydenberg, which concluded with a banner ad authorised by the treasurer. On 16 February, AFN posted a feature drawing information about Frydenberg from multiple sources, including the treasurer’s frank admission on ABC Radio that he had “made no secret” he would put his hand up for the leadership at the right time. The article ended with a Chinese-language version of an attack ad against Albanese, claiming he has supported taxes on carbon emissions, mining, congestion, superannuation, income, housing, retirees, family businesses and inheritance. A spokesperson for Frydenberg said: “The treasurer does not have an active WeChat account.” “These are banner advertisements with the Australian Financial News which demonstrate Anthony Albanese’s record of supporting higher taxes on Australians,” he told Guardian Australia. “There is no payment for articles.” Guardian Australia contacted AFN for comment. On 11 February, the defence minister, Peter Dutton, cited “writing within some of the Chinese newspapers in Australia” as an example of Chinese influence on the Labor party – part of the Morrison government’s campaign to claim Labor is soft on national security. At Senate estimates on 14 February, the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said the takeover of Morrison’s WeChat account “appeared to be a terms and conditions matter”. “I couldn’t rule out [foreign interference] completely,” he said. “Sometimes things can be manipulated in a way that is opaque and nefarious. It would be ill advised to rule it out.” Pezzullo said the department doesn’t give advice to MPs and senators about whether they should use particular platforms, explaining it’s a matter of “free political communication” for them to decide.",News/Australia news,Josh Frydenberg ads appear on WeChat despite Liberal MPs calling for boycott ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/josh-frydenberg-ads-appear-on-wechat-despite-liberal-mps-calling-for-boycott
2/21/2022,"Labour has urged the government to “come clean” on bus funding as operators prepare to slash services, with a critical moment for decisions over routes approaching on Wednesday. Almost one in three services are at risk, the industry and local authorities have warned, with the Treasury refusing to confirm if it will continue grant funding to support operators whose bus revenues have yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  The financial lifeline will otherwise expire on 5 April, meaning many operators – who normally must give six weeks’ notice to close a route – will decide this week which services remain viable. Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said the situation could prove “devastating for the millions who depend on buses”, and called on the government to avert a looming crisis. In a letter to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, Haigh said routes could be axed just as passenger numbers begin to recover, “locking in declining services for years to come”. She said Shapps should “come clean on wider long-term funding cuts” for the Bus Back Better strategy announced last year by Boris Johnson, which included £3bn to transform buses. The improvement fund has been reduced to just over £1.2bn, with the government counting emergency support grants to the industry as part of the total figure. Authorities around the country have warned of cuts. Greater Manchester councillors said on Friday evening, after talks with local operators, that they expected to see a widescale reduction in bus frequencies and about 30 routes withdrawn. They warned communities would be cut off, with a “very significant impact on our economic recovery”. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents operators, said the situation was urgent: “There’s no still clarity on funding from the Treasury, and up to 30% of services face being cut.” The Campaign for Better Transport said hundreds of routes were in danger of disappearing for good. Its chief executive, Paul Tuohy, said: “The government can’t ignore the situation any longer, it must extend its recovery funding or face the economic, social and environmental impacts.” Buses are at particular risk in city regions with fixed public transport costs, such as Manchester’s Metrolink, and in Tyne and Wear where funding for the Metro rail service is required. Tyne and Wear’s transport authority has estimated 10% to 17% of its bus network will be taken out. The West Midlands has also warned that services are at risk, and the Conservative mayor of the region, Andy Street, joined with other metro mayors to appeal for continued funding. Regions were encouraged by the government last year to draw up detailed plans for transformational improvement schemes, under the strategy set out by Johnson, but reduced funding means many are set to lose out. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We have provided over £1.7bn to keep bus services running across the country throughout the pandemic, and are working closely with operators and local transport authorities to protect services after April.” The spokesperson said the government had committed to investing £3bn into bus services by 2025, “including £1.2bn to improve fares, services and infrastructure, and a further £525m for zero-emission buses”. Bus services in London are under pressure after Transport for London and the government failed to agree a new funding settlement, with a short-term Covid deal expiring last Friday night. The DfT said talks were ongoing and services would not be affected immediately. The spokesperson said: “We have repeatedly shown our commitment to supporting London’s transport network throughout the pandemic, providing over £4.5bn in emergency funding.”",News/Business,UK government pushed to ‘come clean’ as decision on bus funding looms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/uk-government-pushed-to-come-clean-as-decision-on-bus-funding-looms
2/21/2022,"Millions of patients in England face dangerously long waits for mental health care unless ministers urgently draw up a recovery plan to tackle a “second pandemic” of depression, anxiety, psychosis and eating disorders, NHS leaders and doctors have warned. The Covid crisis has sparked a dramatic rise in the numbers of people experiencing mental health problems, with 1.6 million waiting for specialised treatment and another 8 million who cannot get on the waiting list but would benefit from support, the heads of the NHS Confederation and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have told the Guardian.  In some parts of the country, specialist mental health services are so overwhelmed they are “bouncing back” even the most serious cases of patients at risk of suicide, self-harm and starvation to the GPs that referred them, prompting warnings from doctors that some patients will likely die as a result. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, who has acknowledged that national levels of depression have almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, is facing pressure to rapidly develop a “comprehensive plan” to respond to the soaring demand for mental health care in England. The call follows the publication of the long-awaited NHS elective recovery plan this month, which finally set out how the backlog of people needing planned surgical procedures is to be addressed. “We are moving towards a new phase of needing to ‘live with’ coronavirus but for a worrying number of people, the virus is leaving a growing legacy of poor mental health that services are not equipped to deal with adequately at present,” said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole of the healthcare system in England. “With projections showing that 10 million people in England, including 1.5 million children and teenagers, will need new or additional support for their mental health over the next three to five years it is no wonder that health leaders have dubbed this the second pandemic. A national crisis of this scale deserves targeted and sustained attention from the government in the same way we have seen with the elective care backlog.” The NHS Confederation is calling for an expansion of NHS estates for specialist mental health care, and a major recruitment drive, as part of a recovery plan. One in 10 consultant psychiatrist posts are unfilled. Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “We urgently need a fully funded mental health recovery plan, backed by a long-term workforce plan, to ensure everyone with a mental illness can get the help they need when they need it. “Millions of children, young people and adults are seeking help from mental health services that are overstretched and under-resourced. The situation is critical. The government cannot afford to neglect mental health recovery any longer.” Health leaders also believe a key element of a recovery plan should include a focus on providing early support for children and young people with mental health problems. There has been a 72% increase in children and teenagers referred for urgent support for eating disorders in one year, and a 52% rise in emergency referrals for under-18s to crisis care since the start of the pandemic. “The impact of the pandemic on young people’s mental health cannot be overstated,” said Olly Parker, the head of external affairs at the charity YoungMinds. One family doctor in Hertfordshire, Dr David Turner, said he was so concerned about the situation that he had chosen to speak out publicly for the first time in his 25-year career. “I and many other GPs feel the issue has become critical and it is only a matter of time before a child dies,” he told the Guardian. Turner said access to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) was “never great pre-Covid” but was now “appalling”. The double whammy of a spike in demand and underinvestment in CAMHS was putting patients at risk, he added. One particularly “dangerous” new trend, Turner said, was CAMHS “bouncing back” patients with serious mental health disorders to GPs who had referred them for specialist treatment. It means GPs are being relied upon to carry out weekly weight checks and blood tests, and monitor vital organs of patients with anorexia nervosa, some of whom are at risk of self-harm, suicide or starvation. “We have no specific training in this specialised area,” he said. Dr Phil Moore, a GP and chair of the NHS Confederation’s mental health, learning disability and autism system group, said he was concerned that the mounting backlog of care could see patients “deteriorating to the point of crisis”. “No clinician wants to see this happen,” he added. “This was a problem before Covid but things are a lot worse now.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.

2/21/2022,"America’s immigration courts are struggling to function at the most basic level, with judges who are already woefully understaffed and often undertrained now overwhelmed by a growing backlog of more than 1.6m cases, industry leaders have warned. The system is so damaged that judges, scholars and attorneys all share concerns about whether immigrants due in court will even receive notice before their hearings so they know to show up and aren’t ordered deported in absentia – an urgent concern made worse by volatile immigration policies at the US-Mexico border.  “It’s very worrisome. The fundamental requirement for a full and fair hearing is notice of your hearing and the ability to attend your hearing,” Mimi Tsankov, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), said. “I see incredible efforts being made by the staff – the bare-bones staff in some courts – to try to support these very, very heavy dockets,” she told the Guardian in an exclusive interview in her union leadership capacity. “But it’s extremely challenging for all of us to meet the demands.” The US immigration court system has been imperiled by dysfunction for decades. Now it’s in crisis after serious setbacks under Donald Trump, and Joe Biden is struggling to right the ship. On the line are millions of futures. Undocumented immigrants who fear being split from their American children and spouses, people facing persecution and death in their countries of origin, or those being sent to countries they haven’t seen in decades are all fighting for fair play and often literally their lives in courts ill-equipped to do them justice. “Let’s make it absolutely clear: due process is suffering,” said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. “There’s just no way around that.” Chishti said he sees all the hallmarks of a strong administrative law system suffering in the nation’s immigration courts, which are housed under the Department of Justice in the executive branch of the federal government, not within the judicial branch. “It is a system in crisis,” he said. After Trump made hardline anti-immigration policies pivotal to his 2016 presidential campaign, he flooded courts with judges more inclined to order deportations, Reuters reported. His administration hired so many new immigration judges so hastily that the American Bar Association warned of “under-qualified or potentially biased judges”, many of whom had no immigration experience. And as officials such as then-attorney general Jeff Sessions made sweeping proclamations that “the vast majority of asylum claims are not valid”, judges simultaneously confronted performance metrics demanding they each race through at least 700 cases a year. Yet in the roughly 70 US immigration courts across the country, judges are deciding complex cases with potentially lethal consequences. People ranging from asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico to unaccompanied children crossing the border on foot, to longtime undocumented residents with families stateside end up appearing in court, often without attorneys to help them parse the country’s byzantine laws. In a process smacking of a zip code lottery, one judge in New York may grant nearly 95% of asylum petitions while colleagues in Atlanta almost universally deny similar requests, creating a patchwork of standards. Such inconsistency drives a high appeal rate and clogs the system, experts say. In addition, judges under the Trump administration lost much of their power to press pause on low-priority proceedings so that they could focus on more urgent cases. Amid these bureaucratic logjams, the case backlog has ballooned out of control nationwide in a matter of years, from just over 516,000 cases in fiscal year 2016 to more than 1.6m today, according to data collected by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (Trac). “Quarterly growth in the number of pending immigration court cases between October and December 2021 is the largest on record,” according to Trac. Under Trump, “no progress was made”, said Jeremy McKinney, president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “As a matter of fact, there was significant and historic backtracking,” McKinney said, adding: “All the efforts of the prior administration did was create more litigation.” Now, Tsankov urgently wants to confront the government with the problems, including the courts’ chronic, severe staffing shortages that can create serious obstacles to fair adjudications. But amid a bitter, years-long campaign to decertify the NAIJ, the current administration under Biden is not meeting or even communicating with Tsankov’s union, she said. “If the judges don’t have the staff to send out the hearing notices and to ensure that the cases are ready for proceeding, the mission of the agency isn’t really going to be successfully fulfilled,” Tsankov said. Neither the courts’ crisis nor widespread frustration over the immigration system writ large are news to the Biden administration. Kamala Harris last year acknowledged in an ABC interview that the US immigration system overall is “deeply broken”. But while the administration has ended many Trump immigration policies, some of the most inequitable remain, such as forcing migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed in the US legal system and summarily expelling many with no access to court. Advocates were also befuddled by the Biden administration’s early appointments to the immigration courts, who were overwhelmingly former prosecutors, immigration enforcement officials and military personnel, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. And while Biden ran on a platform to double the courts’ staffing and otherwise ease judges’ burden, critics say case numbers aren’t dropping as quickly as they should. In fact, the backlog grew by roughly 180,000 cases between fiscal years 2021 and 2022. “When you’re running a court and you know that due process requires that parties have access to their hearings and that they’re aware of when their hearings are going to occur, just hiring more judges will not fix the problem,” Tsankov said. Judges require legal assistants, judicial law clerks, interpreters and front-window staff – support roles that are critically under-filled in cities as geographically diverse as Philadelphia, Salt Lake City and Memphis, Tsankov said. At one New York immigration court, for example, Tsankov said they were staffed at only about 30%. Raw migration numbers – US Customs and Border Protection logged an all time record of 1.73m encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border in fiscal year 2021, for example – don’t tell the whole story. Apart from policy changes, demographics of those encountered at the border have evolved from men searching for work, who had little access to court, to those seeking asylum who often go in front of a judge. And immigration enforcement became more closely linked with the criminal justice system in recent decades so that, for example, immigrants stopped for a traffic offense wound up fighting deportation. These factors helped spin the immigration court case backlog out of control. The result is bare-bones court teams scrambling to keep the system running, risking judges losing track of a case’s legal landscape over time and staff failing to update contact details for hearing notices. This despite the fact that people can be ordered deported if they don’t show up for court. It all adds up to courts “suffering from a lack of acceptability, affecting the integrity of the whole system”, Chishti said, adding: “People don’t have faith in it.”",News/US news,US immigration courts struggle amid understaffing and backlog of cases,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/us-immigration-courts-cases-backlog-understaffing
2/21/2022,"Dr David Turner is a GP in Hertfordshire“A particularly serious problem has arisen with the provision of mental healthcare for children and adolescents over the last 18 months. This is the first time in my 25-year career as a doctor I have felt the need to speak out publicly. I and many other GPs feel the issue has become critical and it is only a matter of time before a child dies. “Provision of mental healthcare by child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) was never great pre-Covid. Since the pandemic it has become appalling. There are two main reasons for this: underinvestment in mental health services for decades and a spike in demand.  “There was always a long wait for CAMHS services, but over the last year or so a more worrying trend has occurred: the specific problem is CAMHS ‘bouncing back’ patients referred to them for primary care to manage. Patients with serious mental health disorders such as anorexia nervosa are being referred to CAMHS, but they say because they are too busy they would like the GP to continue to monitor the patient. This is both unacceptable and dangerous. “In my practice we are now monitoring several seriously mentally ill teenagers, including some with anorexia nervosa, who CAMHS say they are simply unable to see due to workload pressures. They are at increased risk of self-harm and suicide, and the very nature of self-starvation leads to a multitude of physical health problems, the most serious of which can lead to death. “This condition needs careful monitoring with weekly blood-pressure and weight checks and blood tests to monitor the function of vital organs, such as the liver and kidneys. In addition, patients will need regular heart recordings (ECG) to monitor for signs of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms. Anorexia is not a trivial illness. “CAMHS are now routinely expecting GPs to monitor teenagers with anorexia nervosa weekly and undertake all these checks. We have no specific training in this specialised area of child psychiatry. We are also suffering from an enormous increase in our workload since the easing of Covid restrictions and are struggling to do this complex work in addition to our usual duties. “However, most GPs feel that if we do not do our best to help these children, they will get no treatment at all for many months while they wait to see a practitioner in CAMHS. We also have adolescent patients who have not attended school for many months while awaiting treatment for severe anxiety and depression. This has knock-on effects on their families. In some cases, it has meant a parent giving up work to stay at home to look after them. “There is no doubt many hundreds of teenagers around the country are suffering due to a deficiency in mental health services tailored to their needs and, sadly, some will die. This situation could be turned around quickly with a rapid investment of cash and resources. As we have seen during the Covid pandemic, when there is a political will and money we are capable of providing top-class healthcare in this country. We now need to do this for our young people.” As told to Andrew Gregory",News/Society,GP: ‘Teenagers at risk due to lack of tailored mental health services’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/gp-teenagers-at-risk-lack-tailored-mental-health-services

2/21/2022,"When Facebook removed dozens of groups dedicated to Canada’s anti-government “Freedom Convoy” protests earlier this month, it didn’t do so because of extremism or conspiracies rife within the protests. It was because the groups were being run by scam artists. Networks of spammers and profiteers, some based as far afield as Vietnam or Romania, had set up the groups using fake or hacked Facebook accounts in an attempt to make money off of the political turmoil.  That foreign networks of social media scammers had seized on a divisive political issue may feel like somewhat of a throwback. Before investigations into Russian troll factories’ operations during the US presidential election and culture war conflicts over content moderation, one of the biggest challenges facing social media platforms was profiteers pushing fake news articles and spam for easy money. Hundreds of websites mimicking US news outlets pushed their content on social media, reaping ad revenue from the traffic they generated. Platforms like Facebook have cracked down on such “inauthentic activity” since 2016, but the global misinformation industry remains. In recent years, these for-profit disinformation networks have seized on the popularity of conspiracy movements and far-right groups online, creating content aimed at anti-vaccine protesters and QAnon followers. “It can be an extremely lucrative industry for people in other parts of the world to very closely monitor US and Canadian political climates, then capitalize on moment-to-moment trends,” Emerson Brooking, a senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, told the Guardian. “If you’re out for money, and measure success not by sowing discord in a country but by maximizing ad revenue, there’s still a lot of benefit to these operations.” It is hard to know the exact scale of the for-profit misinformation industry, researchers say, since it functions as part of an underground economy and comes in various forms. In addition to content mills and ad revenue schemes, there are also private firms across the globe that are hired to create fake engagement or push political propaganda. In 2021 alone, Facebook said it removed 52 coordinated influence networks across 32 countries that attempted to direct or corrupt the public debate for strategic goals, according to a company report on inauthentic behavior. In addition, small networks can have an outsized impact if they effectively use online groups to mass organize and fundraise. In the case of the Freedom Convoy accounts, many of the largest Facebook groups involved appeared to be run by fake accounts or content mills hailing from numerous countries. Facebook took down the groups this month, but not before supporters of the convoy raised over $7m in crowdfunding and generated mass mainstream attention. (GoFundMe later disabled the campaign). A Bangladeshi digital marketing firm ran two of Facebook’s largest anti-vaccine trucker groups, according to Grid News, which had over 170,000 members combined before the platform removed them. The hacked Facebook account of a Missouri woman set up a network of several other pro-demonstration groups, collectively gaining more than 340,000 members in weeks. Other groups promoting American spinoffs of the Canadian protests were from Facebook accounts and networks based in Vietnam, Romania and other nations, Facebook officials told NBC News. But recent research has shed light on how some of these for-profit misinformation operations work. A series of case studies from the Institute For Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank, detailed what it takes to run a money-making online news scam. One example was a cobbled-together website called The U.S. Military News. The headlines on The U.S. Military News look much like those you might find on any number of far-right media outlets, with titles like “Trump Wrecks Pence In Awesome Statement” and articles praising the Canadian trucker protests. A shop on the site markets Trump-related merchandise including free American flags and Trump 2024 “Revenge Tour” commemorative coins. There are repeated pleas for donations all over the front page and attached to every article. But despite the name and wall-to-wall American branding, the site has no connection to the US military, or the United States for that matter. Its domain is registered in Vietnam, and it’s unclear if it employs any writers or if the products it advertises even exist. The articles themselves consist solely of stock footage videos, with an automated voice reading plagiarized content. A number of the articles and headlines posted on sites linked to the network veer into outright QAnon conspiracy content, featuring falsehoods about military tribunals and Biden officials being sentenced to death. One site’s front page prominently features a range of anti-vaccine and pro-Trump conspiracy content, while also promoting an Amazon affiliate link to Trump’s Art Of The Deal book. The Guardian contacted the email address that The U.S. Military News is registered under, but did not receive a reply. The U.S. Military News is just one of a number of sites that appear linked to the same Vietnam-based network, according to ISD. In another of ISD’s reports, researcher Elise Thomas found a network of dozens of Facebook groups and pages – which also appear to be linked to a small group of people in Vietnam – that shared plagiarized pro-Trump content aimed at conservative social media users. Taking articles from far-right conspiracy sites like The Gateway Pundit, the network created Facebook groups with names like “Conservative Voices” and built up large numbers of followers – sometimes in the tens of thousands of users. Although for-profit misinformation networks often monetize their audiences through running ads on their websites, the network ISD found appeared to be building up their Facebook group members in order to potentially resell the groups themselves. “This was the original threat that platforms were worried about,” Brooking said. “It wasn’t disinformation, you would characterize it as sort of ad fraud or ad farming.” In many cases, including ISD’s case studies, there isn’t vast amounts of money being made from inauthentic Facebook groups and conspiracy sites. But to many of the operators based in countries with low per capita income relative to the US, making a few hundred dollars a month from pushing conspiratorial content means significant gain. One of the more lucrative sites linked to Vietnam that ISD analyzed brought in around $1800 each month through advertising alone – around 10 times the monthly per capita income in the country. These scams have strong echoes of the surge in online commercial misinformation in 2016. Many of the people behind posts with false claims such as “Pope Francis Endorses Donald Trump” also came from outside the US, often from a single small town in North Macedonia called Veles which was responsible for over 140 imitation news websites. These original “fake news” websites capitalized on salacious headlines and social media algorithms that promoted posts with high engagement regardless of their content, leading creators to choose contentious political issues involving race, religion and culture war flashpoints to drive the most attention to their sites and social media accounts. Although the strategies to evade content moderators have evolved, that playbook of monetizing conspiracies and misinformation appears to have stayed largely the same. “This is what the misinformation threat looked like before we were even talking about state actions,” Brooking said. “It’s interesting that this sort of older threat is now back in center stage.” ",News/Media,Disinformation for profit: scammers cash in on conspiracy theories,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/20/facebook-disinformation-ottawa-social-media

Communities and NGOS would have the ability to take local authorities to court if they failed to provide healthy green space, under plans set out by more than 60 nature, planning, health and equality organisations. They argue that despite the fact there is strong evidence that accessible, nature-rich spaces boost our physical and mental wellbeing, and reduce mortality, one in three people in England cannot access nature near their home.  Visits to urban parks and other green spaces nearly doubled in the decade before the pandemic, from 1.2bn in 2009-10 to 2.1bn in 2018-19.

The coalition, which includes Greenpeace, Wildlife and Countryside Link, Institute for Public Policy Research, and The Wildlife Trusts, adds that access to nature should be included in any plans to “level up”. Research by Wildlife and Countryside Link, which on Monday launches a petition to urge the government to put this into law, found that 80% of the British public support a legal right to local nature and 85% say it should be a priority for all new housing developments to include accessible natural spaces. Dr Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, told the Guardian that Michael Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, as good as ignored nature in his white paper. He said: “There were some references to nature, you had to turn to page 212 or something like that, but people’s environmental rights were not included in the headline announcements. “It was notable that the six ‘capitals’ included in the paper didn’t include natural capital, which it clearly should have done.” Campaigners added that many natural spaces are under threat of development, with 11% of urban green space lost in the past 15 years. Local authorities could improve access to nature by having better transport links to green spaces, improving substandard and neglected patches of natural land, and creating new parks. Campaigners add that improving the quality of local natural spaces is also vital to help meet government targets to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030 and halt the decline in species by 2030. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “Having access to wild places and wildlife shouldn’t be a privilege, but a part of everyday life. We know how much people treasure time spent in nature near where they live, but for many communities this simply isn’t possible. The most deprived areas have nine times less green space than the wealthiest – and poorer areas are where people’s health is the worst. “Our towns and cities have a huge role to play in nature’s recovery. We need to create and join up habitats, enabling species to recover and benefiting people too. It is critical that nature is at the heart of all planning and development, for wildlife, communities, and climate.” TV stars including Deborah Meaden from Dragons’ Den and the Springwatch presenter Gillian Burke have backed the bid. Meaden said: “It’s increasingly clear that there are huge inequalities in the amount of green spaces and access to nature that people can enjoy close to home. I’ve always felt passionately that having nature close to the places where people live, work and visit is critical for our mental and physical health. “Despite 80% of Brits wanting a ‘legal right to local nature’, it is not yet set out in law, which means that building developments do not have to take this into account. This needs to change.”",News/Environment,UK wildlife campaigners call for legal right to access nature for all,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/uk-wildlife-campaigners-call-for-legal-right-to-access-nature-for-all
2/21/2022,"The unruly chorus of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) fills the fields to the east of Otley, sending the sounds of chattering, chirping, tweeting and trilling across a radius of at least half a mile. I immediately feel my spirits perk up at the sound of this jostling collective conversation, a ball of bright white noise in an otherwise muted February landscape. I get closer and see hundreds of dark silhouettes festooning the bare branches of a tall ash tree. Starlings are sometimes the subject of a certain petty prejudice; perhaps there is something uncomfortably insectoid in the way they teem and swarm, in their collective intelligence. Even their oily, iridescent plumage – which looks black at a distance but up-close shimmers green and purple like a puddle of petrol – has a hint of beetle armour about it.  This group intellect is what enables starlings to produce their famous strobing, morphing murmurations, and while I don’t see this happen today, I do get a hint of the hive mind in action. I walk towards the tree, but clearly get a bit too close, and the entire flock instantly muzzles itself, like the saloon falling silent in a western. A few moments of silence, the swarm sizes me up, and the cacophony gradually starts up again. I’m not very threatening, it seems, but the speed of their massed decision-making seems to border on the telepathic. Starling numbers plummeted a staggering 87% between 1967 and 2015, and are still in freefall. The rise of industrial agriculture is thought to be one of the possible causes, but the lightly managed fields around here probably still provide the birds with a rich larder of invertebrate food. This is just one example of the biodiversity value of this swathe of open country, and Leeds city council is to be commended for listening to local voices and deciding to rethink its initial plans for a massive, poorly considered housing development in these fields. This is good news, at least for now. Any new plans must accommodate all the animal occupants of this landscape, not just the human ones.
