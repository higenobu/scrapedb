5/6/2022,"US stock markets suffered their worst day of the year on Thursday as investors worried about the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates to tackle soaring inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1,000 points (3.1%). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5% and 4.9% respectively. Tech stocks were particularly hard-hit, with Amazon dropping 7.6% and Tesla falling 8.3%. The steep fall came one day after the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, announced the sharpest rise in interest rates in over 20 years. With inflation now running at an annual rate of 8.5%, a 40-year high in the US, Powell said the Fed needed to do “everything we can to restore stable prices”. The half-percentage-point increase in rates had been widely signaled, and Powell’s comments that the Fed was not considering raising interest rates by 0.75 percentage points at a future meeting were initially welcomed by Wall Street, with stock markets recording their biggest one-day gain since 2020. But those gains evaporated on Thursday as traders worried about the impact of the Fed’s moves on demand, and on the wider economy. “The Fed is between a rock and a hard place, and because of instant information, investors are experiencing both fear and greed at the exact same moment,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “Investors realized that by the Fed continuing to take a very measured approach, it could actually allow inflation to remain out of control.” The Fed’s aggressive shift to raise interest rates has investors worrying about whether it can pull off the delicate dance to slow the economy enough to halt high inflation but not so much as to cause a downturn. The pace and size of interest rate increases is being scrutinized closely on Wall Street. Diminishing the odds of a 0.75-point hike doesn’t mean the Fed is done raising rates steadily and sharply as it fights to tame inflation. Economists at BNP Paribas still expect the Fed to keep hiking the federal funds rate until it reaches a range of 3% to 3.25%, up from zero to 0.25% earlier this year. “We do not think this was Chair Powell’s intention,” economists at BNP Paribas wrote in a report, citing the market’s jubilance on Wednesday, “and we reckon we could see coming ‘Fedspeak’ seek to re-tighten financial conditions.” The selloff came as the Bank of England on Thursday raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 13 years and forecast inflation would rise above 10% this year, the highest level since 1982. Energy markets remain volatile as the conflict in Ukraine continues and demand remains high amid tight supplies of oil. European governments are trying to replace energy supplies from Russia and are considering an embargo. Opec and allied oil-producing countries decided Thursday to gradually increase the flows of crude they send to the world. Higher oil and gas prices have been contributing to the uncertainties weighing on investors as they try to assess how inflation will ultimately impact businesses, consumer activity and overall economic growth. Rising rates are already affecting the US house market, where home prices soared through the pandemic. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 5.27% this week, its highest level since 2009, according to the mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year ago, it averaged 2.96%. Mortgage rates tend to follow moves in the 10-year treasury yield. The sharp increase in mortgage rates has strained affordability for homebuyers after years of sharply rising prices.

5/6/2022,"Three people have been killed and at least four more injured in the central Israeli town of Elad, in the latest in a spate of street attacks that have sent tensions soaring in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent weeks. One or two as yet unidentified attackers, carrying a firearm and an axe, attacked passersby in a park in the ultra-Orthodox town near Tel Aviv on Thursday night, Israel’s Independence Day, local news reported. At least one person fled the scene in a vehicle. United Hatzalah first responders were still treating people at the park and roadblocks were set up in the area on Thursday evening. There was no immediate comment from Israel’s police other than that the incident appeared to be a terror attack, and Elad’s mayor has called on residents to stay indoors while security forces hunt for the perpetrators. The worst wave of terrorist attacks in Israel in years began in late March, when an Islamic State supporter killed four people in a stabbing and vehicle-ramming incident in the southern city of Beersheba. Tensions then rose throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which coincided with the Jewish festival of Passover. Several separate attacks in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank carried out by Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel claiming to be from different factions have killed 16 Israelis, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainian nationals. Three Arab-Israelis and 27 Palestinians have died during the same period, among them the perpetrators of attacks and others killed by Israeli security forces in stepped-up army operations in the occupied West Bank. The deadly violence has been accompanied by clashes throughout Ramadan at the Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police, in which hundreds of Palestinians have been injured. The site, known as the Temple Mount in Israel, is holy to both Jews and Muslims, and lies at the geographical and religious heart of the decades-old conflict. The compound’s reopening to Jewish visitors on Thursday morning, after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, was again marked by violent scuffles; after Israeli police moved to arrest one of the Palestinians protesting against the Jewish presence, scuffles broke out in which police fired rubber-coated bullets and Palestinians responded by throwing stones. Two Palestinians were taken to hospital and one police officer was lightly wounded, medics said. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, praised Thursday’s attack in Elad, but did not claim responsibility for it. “The storming of al-Aqsa mosque can’t go unpunished,” Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said. “The heroic operation in Tel Aviv is a practical translation of what the resistance had warned against.” The escalation of violence in the past six weeks has raised fears of another armed conflict similar to the 11-day war a year ago between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was in part triggered by unrest at Aqsa. Informally, Jews are allowed to visit, but not pray at the site. In recent years, however, growing numbers of Jewish visitors, sometimes praying or with police escorts, have inflamed longstanding Palestinian fears that Israel plans to annex the area. Israel says it is committed to maintaining the status quo, and accuses Hamas of inciting the recent violence.",News/World news,Three people killed and at least four injured in attack in Israeli town of Elad,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/three-people-killed-and-at-least-four-injured-in-attack-at-israeli-town-of-elad

5/6/2022,"The plight of asylum seekers is in sharp focus with heart-wrenching images of exhausted and terrified Ukrainian families forced into displacement. And while arriving at borders and seeking refuge is not new, the treatment of those forced to cross borders for asylum has rarely been so compassionate. Even in a nation that prides itself on compassionate governance, an independent report into the detention of asylum seekers in New Zealand has found the worst of systemic abuse. It turns out Aotearoa New Zealand has been detaining asylum seekers arbitrarily in criminal prisons, without charge or trial, for years now. What the independent report by Victoria Casey QC describes was no surprise to the community of people fighting to reveal this harrowing truth and asking successive governments to make it stop. The Casey report documents a damning Kafkaesque nightmare, where those escaping persecution, torture and war are detained in New Zealand’s highest-security prisons unable to challenge their detention. I still remember regularly seeing asylum seekers in the cells at Auckland’s district court, desperately trying to pass papers documenting their plight to duty lawyers through the slots of the busy meeting rooms. The duty lawyers are criminal lawyers, there to attend to those without representation in basic appearances before a criminal court. They generally lack the expertise or resources to put a case in refugee law. Where they might, the judges of courts focused on drugs, violence and property crimes are rarely equipped to challenge the detention of a new arrival on refugee rights grounds. That’s part of what the Casey report found. Refugee lawyers are not resourced to act for their clients in a challenge to detention, and the criminal courts just never really listen. For me, as a lawyer and now lawmaker, the work of bringing to light asylum seeker detention has been personal. I imagined my anxious parents gripping my hand at Auckland airport when we first walked on “New Zealand soil” and told a man in what must have been a Customs uniform that we were refugees. They took us aside for a short interview, but first they asked if we were hungry. Then, as comes the most important national security threat to our island nation, they asked if we were carrying any fresh fruit or plant products. They gave us access to a lawyer and told us the process and sent us off to be assisted by the Salvation Army. We were welcomed, with access to our basic human rights. The 100 or so asylum seekers whose detention is analysed in the Casey report similarly posed no national security threat or public safety risk that would necessitate their imprisonment. No lesser forms of detention, for example at the Mangere refugee resettlement centre (used to house quota refugees), or reporting requirements to police were prioritised. So what would have happened to my parents, Iranian political activists, fleeing the risk of torture, having lived through a war, here with a nine-year-old daughter they refused to raise under Islamic law? How would my dad fare at Mt Eden’s high-security remand prison? Detained asylum seekers experience all the physical and psychological violence prevalent in our overcrowded prisons. They arrive with existing trauma and the wound is ripped open in a system that dehumanises them. Those I’ve spoken to report years of mental health struggles. They withdraw, become anxious and depressed, at just that moment when refugees normally experience relief and joy at being in our new homeland. They cling to one another, not necessarily from the same country of origin, religion or pre-asylum world, but with the same scars from New Zealand’s prisons. What other group of people do we allow to be routinely imprisoned without charge or trial? Why do we presume asylum seekers to be a risk so high as to be locked up with our most dangerous criminals until proven innocent? We already have a royal commission report into the events of the Christchurch terrorist attacks. The report told us our national security apparatus is prejudiced against just the kind of groups who are most likely to seek asylum, to escape war, to be targeted by white nationalism and repressive regimes back home. Now the Casey report tells us again what systemic prejudice looks like. Importantly, the report calls not only for an end to arbitrary detention, but for proper resettlement resources to treat asylum seekers as equal to quota refugees. It repeats these are not “queue-jumpers”. The recommendations of the Casey report are what the Green party and the human rights and asylum seeker community have been demanding for years, and they are long overdue. The New Zealand government has accepted the report’s recommendations; now they must be implemented. New Zealand said after the Christchurch mosque attacks: “This is not us.” It turns out that was more of a call to action than a reality at the time. Treating refugees and asylum seekers with dignity, and implementing the recommendations of the Casey report, is the promise of that call. Golriz Ghahraman is an Iranian-born Green party MP.

5/6/2022,"A wild fox in Washington DC, has chewed through a fence at the National zoo and killed 25 flamingos in the worst animal attack there in two decades. On Tuesday, zoo officials announced that in addition to the 25 American flamingos that were killed early on Monday in their outdoor habitat, three more were injured. A northern pintail duck was also killed by the fox. Zoo officials had spotted a fox in the flamingos’ yard but said it escaped. The remaining flamingos out of the original 74 birds in the group were moved indoors into their barn and the ducks were transferred to a covered, secure outdoor space, the zoo said. The birds’ wings are clipped and they are unable to fly away. “This is a heartbreaking loss for us and everyone who cares about our animals,” said the zoo director, Brandie Smith. “The barrier we used passed inspection and is used by other accredited zoos across the country. Our focus now is on the wellbeing of the remaining flock and fortifying our habitats.” Officials found a softball-sized hole in the heavy-duty metal mesh surrounding the flamingos’ outdoor yard, which was last replaced in 2017 and passed an accreditation inspection, but has been reinforced since the attack. Live traps have been set around the yard to catch predators. The zoo has also set up digital camera traps with an infrared sensor that tracks overnight activity. The zoo’s flamingo exhibit was established in the 1970s and primarily consists of a 9,750-square-foot yard with a heated pool and barn. Last month a fox with rabies bit at least nine people on Capitol Hill, including a congressman, and was caught and euthanized.",News/Environment,Wild fox infiltrates flamingos’ pen at Washington’s National zoo and kills 25 ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/wild-fox-kills-flamingos-washington-national-zoo
5/6/2022,"A psychiatrist has expressed regret for discharging the Dorset teenager Gaia Pope from hospital just weeks before her death without community mental health support, an inquest heard. Dr Peter Jeffery completed a Mental Health Act assessment on 19-year-old Pope on 22 October 2017 after police took her to Poole hospital with what appeared to be psychotic symptoms. He decided she did not require admission to a psychiatric unit and instead she was sent home, Dorset coroner’s court heard on Thursday. On 7 November, Pope vanished from Swanage. Her body was found 11 days later on cliff tops in undergrowth. She had died from hypothermia. The college student, who suffered from severe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder, had been experiencing “ongoing manic episodes” and was deeply worried about the imminent release from prison of the man she had accused of raping her. Pope was taken to Poole hospital after making threats, suffering hallucinations and seeing blue spots in front of her eyes. In hospital she was aggressive to staff and “hyper-manic”. Jeffery told the hearing in Bournemouth that before discharging her, he did not discuss with Pope community-based support, such as therapy services, that she could access, or speak properly with her uncle, with whom she was staying. He said: “There are two regrets I have from this particular case. One is that I didn’t discuss with the uncle the insight we gained throughout the day – I think that would have been incredibly helpful. “I think there was the opportunity to refer her back to [the community mental health service] Steps2Wellbeing and I have to acknowledge that didn’t happen, and that was an omission.” Jeffery told the inquest he concluded that the teenager’s presentation that day was linked to her epilepsy and the result of a seizure and he prescribed her the anti-anxiety drug diazepam for seven days to help with the condition. Sarah Clarke QC, counsel to the inquest, said this was the fourth time in two years that Pope had been seen by psychiatric services, including being sectioned under the Mental Health Act earlier in 2017. “She is 18 years old and she is now in hospital again with what appears to be psychotic symptoms and although she has not been sectioned, she has gone through another Mental Health Act assessment,” Clarke said. Jeffery also said that despite knowing she was under the care of neurologists in London and Dorset, he did not speak to them. “I think there was a working assumption Gaia was being considered for surgery and was actively engaged in that process,” he said. “We could have communicated with neurologists our assessment and added value to their understanding.” He added: “I think the missed opportunities here were that we could have reassessed the link between Gaia and the Steps2Wellbeing service for consideration of trauma-based work. “There was a real opportunity to liaise with the neurologists, and I think I could have added real value by speaking directly with the neurologists.” The inquest continues.",News/UK news,Psychiatrist tells inquest he regrets not giving Gaia Pope mental health referral,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/psychiatrist-tells-inquest-he-regrets-not-giving-gaia-pope-mental-health-referral
5/6/2022,"Managers usually dislike revenge talk, at least in public, and Jürgen Klopp was no exception the last time Liverpool prepared to meet Real Madrid in the Champions League. “We are not on a revenge tour here,” he said before last season’s quarter-final. “Sometimes it [a reunion] is close enough, like a week or two later, and then you can have these kind of emotions in you.” Or four years later, as is the case with Mohamed Salah. Salah has been surprisingly open this week on his feelings towards Liverpool’s third Champions League final appearance in five seasons. “I want to play Madrid,” he told BT Sport following Liverpool’s semi-final defeat of Villarreal on Tuesday. “We lost in the final against them, so I want to play against them and hopefully win it from them as well.” Shortly after Madrid granted his wish with their astonishing comeback against Manchester City on Wednesday, the Egypt international posted on social media: “We have a score to settle.” There was no need to elaborate further. Klopp will prioritise other factors for the final on 28 May, such as the benefits or otherwise of Liverpool competing on every front before arrival in Paris, while Carlo Ancelotti’s team work towards that one game having won the Spanish title last weekend. But, courtesy of Salah’s message, he will be unable to deny that revenge is a motivating force inside the Liverpool dressing room. No player suffered as Salah did in the 2018 Champions League final of course – and the “we” in his message could have been of the royal variety – but he is one of eight players who started the 3-1 defeat in Kyiv who will, fitness permitting, be involved for Liverpool against a Ramos-less Madrid this time. Technically it is nine as Loris Karius remains a Liverpool player until the end of this season but, well, you know ... Incidentally, Alisson for Karius is not the only upgrade Klopp has made since Kyiv. His seven-man bench that night featured Simon Mignolet, Nathaniel Clyne, Ragnar Klavan, Alberto Moreno, Emre Can, Dominic Solanke and Adam Lallana who, struggling with injury, replaced Salah after his 22nd-minute shoulder injury. Liverpool will have game-changers on their 12-man bench in Paris, where they beat Real in a European Cup final almost exactly 41 years earlier. The revenge subplot did not materialise when the European heavyweights met in last season’s quarter-final for the first time since Kyiv. The occasion was entirely unsuitable. Both legs were behind closed doors – the first at Real’s Valdebebas training ground, the second everything Anfield should not be on a European night as a goalless draw unfolded at an empty, silent stadium – and a Liverpool team with Ozan Kabak and Nat Phillips at the heart of defence fell to Zinedine Zidane’s side again. Sergio Ramos had also been injured days before the first leg, depriving Salah of direct confrontation with his tormentor from 2018. Perhaps Ramos, now of Paris Saint-Germain, will be attendance to support his old club at the Stade de France this month. Given his stated intent to bury the ghosts of four years ago, Salah might well supply the ticket.",Sport/Football,Hungry Salah and upgraded Liverpool can use run-in to tune up for Paris,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/mohamed-salah-liverpool-can-use-run-in-tune-up-for-champions-league-final-real-madrid
