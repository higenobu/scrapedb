3/20/2022,"From the logging roads of the Pacific Northwest to the farm country of the Great Plains and beyond, it's not uncommon for people in rural parts of the U.S. to learn to drive when they're young, sometimes even before they reach their teens. But the news that a 13-year-old was behind the wheel of a pickup truck that blew a tire and struck a van on a dark, two-lane road in West Texas on Tuesday night, killing nine people — including six members of a New Mexico college's golf teams and their coach — put a renewed focus on the practice. At a news conference in Odessa, Texas, on Thursday, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said the dangers of underage driving put it on the agency’s “most-wanted list.” Along with drunk and distracted driving, Landsberg said “youthful driving” and excessive speed on rural roads are among the problems that make highway driving the most dangerous form of transit in the United States. “Every two days we are killing the equivalent of a Boeing 737 crashing,” he said, referring to highway fatalities from multiple causes. “It’s long overdue that we start to do something about it.” LEGAL DRIVING AGE VARIES BY STATE Cash Hogen, a 60-year-old who runs a kitchen and hardware store in Pierre, South Dakota, recalled learning to drive a Ford Bronco “as soon as my feet hit the pedals” – probably around age 10. He’d drive the two-track roads across his family’s ranch in western South Dakota to repair barbed-wire fences or for other tasks. But his father always stressed safety around vehicles and told stories of horrific tragedies to drive home the danger. “Under no circumstances would I be out on a public road without my learner’s permit,” he said. While it's legal for people of any age to drive on private property, such as farms or ranches, public roads where others are at risk is another matter, said William Van Tassel, the manager of driver training programs for AAA's national office. Every U.S. state has some type of graduated driver's licensing program, by which teens as young as 14 can begin taking driver's education classes or begin driving with an instructor or guardian, he said. Eventually they gain more independence, being allowed to drive on their own or at night, until they have full privileges. “Certainly in rural areas there's a general trend of lower minimum driving ages,” Van Tassel said. “We see a lot of teen drivers have driving experience by the time they come to a formal driver's education course because they've been driving trucks or tractors or other vehicles on the farm. But when it comes to public roads, the laws are pretty clear: You can't be out there until you're legally eligible.” According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, there were 47 fatal crashes and 1,057 injury crashes in 2020 involving drivers 13 or younger. In 2019, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled was 1.9 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas. PERMIAN BASIN SEES HEAVY TRAFFIC ON RURAL ROADS The cause of Tuesday's crash in Andrews County, Texas, near the New Mexico border, wasn't clear, but federal authorities said Thursday that the 13-year-old was driving a Dodge pickup on a road with a 75 mph speed limit when its front left tire, a spare, blew out. The truck veered across the center line into an oncoming transit van carrying the golf team from the University of the Southwest, in Hobbs, New Mexico. The boy and a man in the truck with him were killed, along with members of the golf teams and their coach. While the area is rural, the surrounding oil fields of the Permian Basin that crosses from West Texas into New Mexico mean the traffic can be anything but, local residents said. Gib Stevens, 57, of Hobbs, leads trucking operations for an oilfield servicing company. He said he himself started driving trucks at age 12 on dairy farms and quiet farm roads, but he said the road where the accident happened was clearly unsafe. “For a 13-year-old to be driving that road, that was dumb,” Stevens said. “These roads are all oil traffic.” ‘WORST CASE SCENARIO’ IN TEXAS CRASH In Texas, one must be 14 to begin classroom instruction for a learner’s license and 15 to receive that provisional license to drive with an instructor or licensed adult in the vehicle. Department of Public Safety Sgt. Victor Taylor said it would be illegal for a 13-year-old to drive on public roads. Van Tassel noted that the crash involved several risk factors besides the youth of the driver: It happened at night and on a road with a high speed limit when the spare blew. Further, teenage boys are one of “the most dangerous segments” of the driving population across the country, said Cathy Chase, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. “This is a worst case scenario, on top of a worst case scenario, on top of a worst case scenario,” Chase said. ___ Johnson reported from Seattle.

3/20/2022,"CHICAGO (AP) — Jussie Smollett walked out of a Chicago jail after serving six days and walked into months, if not years, of uncertainty — from what's next for his career as an actor and performer to whether he'll eventually be back behind bars. The former star of the TV show “Empire"" was sentenced last week to 150 days in jail plus probation and a fine after a jury found him guilty of lying to police about being the victim of a racist, anti-gay attack in downtown Chicago in 2019. His release late Wednesday came hours after an appellate court ordered he could go free during the appeal process, which wouldn't be completed before Smollett had served his full sentence. Smollett, who is Black and gay, has maintained his innocence. He didn't speak to reporters as he was escorted out of the Cook County Jail surrounded by security, and his attorneys wouldn't say where the 39-year-old may be heading or what he plans to do next. Under the conditions of the sentence imposed by Cook County Judge James Linn, Smollett must now serve the 30-month probation, though he may leave the state and travel without restrictions. That means he could travel to places like Los Angeles and New York to try to resurrect his career. But that will be difficult to do, publicists say, and the latest developments may not have done him any favors. “I think he's actually doing more harm than good” by fighting the conviction and sentence, said publicist Eric Rose. People can be very forgiving of celebrities who admit wrongdoing and apologize, he said, but instead Smollett is keeping his name and face in the headlines, reminding people of the circumstances of his conviction. “That's what we call ‘death by 1,000 cuts,’” Rose said. “From a reputation perspective, that is horrible.” During his trial, Smollett testified that “I've lost my livelihood” because of the charges against him, including losing his role on “Empire.” He has since worked behind the scenes, writing, directing and producing a film, “B-Boy Blues,” that recently won the “fan favorite narrative feature” award in the American Black Film Festival. While work in front of the camera may be difficult to find, Smollett could get opportunities working behind the scenes, particularly because he has a sister and other family members with successful careers in the industry, said another publicist, Danny Deraney. “Anything is possible,” he said. Smollett, who was convicted on five low-level felony counts of disorderly conduct and acquitted on a sixth count, also remains in legal limbo, with the prospect of being ordered back to jail to serve the rest of his sentence a very real possibility. Smollett told Chicago police in January 2019 that he had been attacked by two men as he walked near his home around 2 a.m. He said the attackers also yelled that he was in “MAGA country,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan that some Trump critics call racist and discriminatory. The claims quickly garnered national attention, with Trump weighing in, and Chicago police said they worked around the clock investigating before determining that the attack was a hoax, staged by Smollett to get publicity. At trial, prosecutors presented a check they said Smollett had written to two brothers who worked on the “Empire” set with him as payment to fake the assault. Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct, but Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx later dropped the case. A special prosecutor was then appointed, and Smollett was charged again. Outside the jail on Wednesday night, Smollett's defense attorneys said having to face charges a second time went against his constitutional rights. They also said Smollett was the target of a racist justice system and people playing politics. The appeal process will almost certainly take months, if not years, with multiple deadlines, extensions of deadlines, new deadlines and more extensions. For example, now that Smollett’s attorneys have filed their notice that they intend to appeal, they must send to the court the documents, transcripts and other paperwork the case has generated. “They have 49 days...” said Stephen Komie, a Chicago attorney with extensive experience filing appeals, adding that postponing that deadline for two or three 49-day chunks of time is routine. Komie explained that once that’s done, Smollett’s attorneys have 35 days to file their brief, but they can get that deadline extended up to four times. Then when it is the prosecutors’ turn to respond, the court will give them as many as four 35-day extensions too. “If the case goes quickly, they could have oral arguments this time next year,” he said. “But if the case goes at the normal pace you will be calling me in the summer of 2023 to tell me about the oral arguments.” They might then have to wait a couple months or more for a decision, and, depending on how that goes, there could be appeals to the state Supreme Court and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court. Smollett also still owes $120,000 in restitution and a $25,000 fine, though the Chicago Tribune reports that the money isn’t due for 30 months. And in the meantime, he is still being sued by the city of Chicago for the $130,000 the city says it paid out in police overtime to investigate Smollett’s report that he was attacked. ___ Check out the AP’s complete coverage of the Jussie Smollett case.",U.S./Associated Press,"Jussie Smollett is out of jail, but faces uncertain future",https://news.yahoo.com/jussie-smollett-jail-faces-uncertain-210751358.html
3/20/2022,"Janice Chen, Ph.D., one of Olympic gold medalist Nathan Chen’s siblings, is on a mission to build a $100 billion biotech company.

In 2018, she co-founded Mammoth Biosciences with Trevor Martin, Lucas Harrington and Jennifer Doudna, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry two years later for her pioneering work in CRISPR gene editing. Doudna also served as Chen’s mentor while she pursued her doctorate degree in molecular and cell biology at the University of California at Berkeley.

Mammoth is built on Chen’s work as a graduate student researcher in Doudna’s lab. Since the dawn of COVID-19 in 2020, the startup has seen accelerated growth as it snagged $100 million in multiple contracts and government grants.

The company’s valuation also hit $1 billion after a deal with Amazon, Apple’s Tim Cook and venture capital firm Mayfield, among others. But Chen and her colleagues are gunning for more.

 “Our intention is not to build and sell it [Mammoth] but to become a $100 billion company in next-generation CRISPR technology,” Chen told CNBC’s Rebecca Fanin. “There are so many creative building opportunities, and new technology that can come out of discovery in gene editing.”

CRISPR, or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, is essentially a tool for editing genes. It has wide-reaching applications, from correcting genetic anomalies to preventing diseases to improving agricultural yield.

Chen paved the way for a particular gene-editing enzyme to be used as a diagnostic test. Her method allowed to locate a specific sequence of viral DNA, cut it, and yield a fluorescent signal to indicate the result.

She has since received multiple accolades. She was named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Healthcare list in 2019, Business Insider's 30 Under 40 in Healthcare list in 2020, Endpoints Top 20 Women in Biopharma in 2020, and MIT Technology Review’s 35 Innovators Under 35 in 2021.

 

Headquartered in Brisbane, California, Mammoth describes its work as “reading and writing the code of life.” The company is on a track to discover and develop new CRISPR systems to solve specific biological problems.

“The best analog is, before you had Intel and Microsoft, if somebody wanted to build a new application, they would have to build a whole new computer function with an operating system,” Ursheet Parikh, co-leader of Mayfield’s engineering biology investment practice, told TechCrunch after a funding round in September. “You don’t have to build a CRISPR solution from the ground up. You can work with Mammoth to find the right proteins for specific problems.”

Mammoth was among seven companies granted $249 million by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create rapid tests for COVID-19. Through the funding, Mammoth scaled up its DETECTR BOOST SARS-CoV-2 Reagent Kit, which has so far been authorized by the FDA for emergency use.

Chen, 30, is now leading a team of around 130 employees as Mammoth’s chief technology officer. The startup is still hiring.

In an interview with Invesbrain’s Helen Albert, she stressed the importance of adapting quickly to changes, as a graduate student who suddenly became a CTO.

“You just have to accept that there’s so much that you don’t know and you have to constantly learn very quickly. I think part of what was absolutely critical is being able to adapt quickly, be flexible, but also bring in really, really good people. The best way to scale a company is to bring in people who are smarter than you, have done this before, and have much greater expertise in particular areas to help you take these new ideas, and bring them into the company.”

She also offered a piece of advice for others:

“I would say don’t be afraid to take risks. That was such an important mindset for me. It’s OK to think big, you’ve got to be outside your comfort zone, that's the kind of message that I think young entrepreneurs should take home.”

3/20/2022,"A Navy flight officer was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday after federal officials discovered he lied on his security clearance paperwork to hide his connections to China and the head of a Chinese defense contracting firm, as well as violations of gun laws. The case of Lt. Fan Yang, revealed in court documents and a Justice Department press release, started before Yang became an officer in 2013 and eventually grew to include his family business and wife as money flowed in from employment contracts he signed with Chinese partners. Yang lived in Jacksonville, Florida and was a crew member on one of the Navy's P-8 Poseidon aircraft. A naturalized citizen since 2006, Yang joined the Navy briefly from 2005 to 2007 but was discharged, according to court records. He re-joined the service as an Officer Candidate School applicant after getting a degree in electrical engineering. Read Next: What the Reported Deaths of 4 Russian Generals Mean About the Fighting in Ukraine Sometime in between all these events, Yang met a Chinese citizen named Songtao Ge, according to the Justice Department. Ge is described in court documents as ""Chairman of Shanghai Breeze Technology Co. Ltd"" who, during his many trips to the U.S. between 2013 and 2018, ""invested time and money in obtaining tactical weapons training by hiring U.S.-based firearms and tactical instructors with prior military experience."" The relationship between Yang and Ge grew during those years and by 2016 Yang got the Chinese businessman to hire his wife, Yang Yang, to ""handle business operations, conduct business negotiations, collaborate with other factories, declare products at customs, and conduct other similar business"" for the company in exchange for an initial salary of $3,000 per month. ""The money was used to pay Yang Yang's salary, Shanghai Breeze's expenses in the United States, and for goods that [Ge] ordered the Yangs to purchase,"" the press release explained. The funds were ""frequently routed through the Yangs' family business,"" it added. The Navy officer started to run into trouble in 2017 and again in 2018 when he purchased two 9mm handguns and filled out paperwork declaring they were for his use. Yet Ge ""reimbursed the Yangs for both purchases and had [one] pistol engraved with his initials -- 'G.S.T.' -- and the phrase 'Never Out of the Fight.'"" This led to two of the charges against Yang: lying on firearms forms and conspiring to violate firearms laws that prohibit ownership by foreigners. Yang ran afoul of the law again on his security clearance paperwork. According to court documents, he had had a top secret security clearance since 2012. However, in renewing that clearance in 2019, he omitted his relationship with Ge, various financial entanglements with China, and his wife's job with Ge's company. The couple's relationship with Ge was deep enough that the man had been to their home and paid for the two to visit him in Nebraska. Court documents show that Yang's shipmates told investigators that he asked his Navy chain of command for time off in July 2018, telling them the family was going to ""Disney."" In reality, the pair secretly traveled to Nebraska and met with Ge. ""Lt. Yang brought discredit to the Navy and threatened military operational readiness when he decided to make straw purchases of firearms for a foreign national and lie about that relationship during his security clearance background investigation,"" Special Agent in Charge Michelle Kramer of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service said in the press release.  ""Lt. Fan Yang swore an oath to protect this country, but instead he posed a significant risk to U.S. national security,"" Special Agent in Charge Sherri E. Onks of the FBI's Jacksonville Field Office said in the press release. Although Yang's case is reminiscent of Jonathan Toebbe, a Navy nuclear engineer who recently plead guilty to sneaking classified documents to federal agents posing as foreign spies, federal officials did not allege that Yang used his clearance to transfer information or intelligence to Ge or any other Chinese nationals. The Navy, when asked about this case, was not able to immediately offer a comment on Yang's current status with the service. For his part, Yang was sentenced to four years in prison followed by three years of supervised release. His wife pleaded guilty in December 2020 and ended up serving 14 months of prison time for her role in the charges. Ge pled guilty in November 2020 to lying on export documents and trying to fraudulently ""export special forces maritime raiding craft and engines to China,"" according to the press release. He was sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison in July 2021. -- Konstantin Toropin can be reached at konstantin.toropin@military.com. Follow him on Twitter @ktoropin.

3/20/2022,"When you're shopping for a bargain, sometimes the dollar store is a great place to snag deals. In fact, you might be tempted to spring for items that aren't on your shopping list simply because they cost only a dollar or so. Also See: Best and Worst Things To Buy Generic
More Advice: 30 Things You Should Never Buy Without a Coupon But maybe you will want to think twice before buying some items. Dollar stores have been under scrutiny since the mid-2010s, with studies questioning the quality of items sold. Environmental groups have been looking into potential health hazards, and their studies have shown that while some house-label products have improved quality over the past handful of years, others still contain ""chemicals of concern,"" according to a 2021 report from Campaign for Healthier Solutions. The fact is, some dollar store deals can be a terrible buy if you don't know what you're getting into. You may be compromising on quality or safety, and even $1 might not be the best deal for what you get. Read on to see which dollar store items you're better off without. At a dollar store, it's best to skip the electronics aisle, according to consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. ""Most electronics that plug in are junk and don't last long, especially HDMI cords and power strips,"" she said. ""When dealing with electronics, it's best to purchase from a legit electronic retailer or an online store like Amazon.com for cheaper prices."" Extension cords and USB cables from dollar stores previously were flagged for high chlorine levels in a dollar store safety report released by nonprofit organization the Ecology Center and Campaign for Healthier Solutions. That indicated the cords were made of polyvinyl chloride plastic, or PVC. And the research suggested this is a cancer-causing chemical. Some dollar store hand sanitizers have been found to contain methanol (alternatively called wood alcohol), which can have dangerous side effects, including cancer, the Food and Drug Administration said. Substantial exposure to methanol can cause conditions that include headaches, blurred vision, seizures and even permanent blindness, comas and death. The dollar store is a go-to destination when planning a summer block party or a barbecue. But pause before you immediately head to the aisle with the plastic cooking utensils. Plastic cooking utensils from a dollar store -- such as plastic slotted spoons, spatulas and the like -- might contain bromine, a component in brominated flame retardants, also known as BFRs, which have been linked to cancer, obesity and diabetes, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Consider saving your dollars and buying higher-quality stainless steel cooking utensils. It might be tempting to buy a couple of dollar toys to keep your kids happy. Although a doll or action figure only costs a buck at a dollar store, the toys' short lifespan might have you recalling the adage, ""you get what you pay for."" Many dollar store toys are made in China and are rarely tested by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Woroch said. ""Especially for children under 3, pieces can easily break and get swallowed. A trip to the ER isn't worth a couple of saved bucks."" A $1 hammer might sound like a great deal, but it probably won't be something you'll have in your toolbox for long. The website of home-repair guru Bob Vila recommends against tools from the dollar store because of the possibility of poor manufacturing and the chance they could break, causing injury. Instead, the website recommends buying a higher-quality kit that offers a warranty. When you're prepping in the kitchen, you'll want a knife that can get the job done. However, a knife from the dollar store might not live up to its duty, Woroch said. ""Some items in the kitchen section, like food storage containers, are a good buy. However, when it comes to knives, it's a big no-no, since these won't be sharp -- and dull knives can be very dangerous,"" she said. Any way you slice it, a knife from the dollar store might not be a wise investment. Batteries are one of those things we need but hate to buy because they can be expensive. But you're better off forking over the dough for batteries from another retailer than at a dollar store, as they are usually duds, according to Woroch. ""Cheap batteries may leak and damage your gadgets,"" she said. ""Save by purchasing these from the warehouse store for the best deal or use a coupon."" Parents rejoice when it's time for kids to return to school. What they might not be so thrilled about are those laundry lists of school supply requirements. Although a dollar store might sound like a logical choice, you could beat the $1 price if you wait for back-to-school sales at big-box stores or shop the specials at office supply stores like Staples and Office Max. You'll likely get a better bulk value, as well as quality, for comparable items. When it comes to your four-legged family members, you might want to avoid buying pet food from a dollar store. ""Many folks have found that giving cheap food or chewables to the dog means having a violently ill pet,"" Woroch said. For dollar store pet food, pay special attention to expiration dates and the ingredients list, as you would for any food product. Often, sticking to name-brand pet food is your best bet, especially if there are dietary restrictions for your dog or cat. Additionally, you might discover you'll get more bang for your buck at big-box stores. Sometimes it's better to be safe than sorry. Although there might be nothing wrong with some products in these categories, you might want to err on the side of caution. ""I would avoid these products,"" said shopping expert Trae Bodge. ""You will probably not recognize the brands, and if you do, they may have been sitting on the shelf for a long time."" Even makeup can become less effective if it's past its expiration date. In November 2019, the FDA sent a warning letter to a dollar store chain that outlined ""multiple violations of current food manufacturing practices"" at the places where house brands of drugs and certain cosmetics items were made.

3/20/2022,"Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) and Senator Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) tangled in an angry exchange on the floor of the upper chamber of Congress on Thursday. It began with a speech by Sasse in which he noted a tweet from Murphy taking aim at the Nebraska senator, among other Republicans, for voting against the $1.5 trillion omnibus package that included $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine. Of the Republican Senators who attended this weeks “Biden isn’t doing enough for Ukraine” press conference… 2/3 of them: Risch
Sasse
Kennedy
Cruz
Marshall
Fischer
Lankford
Hoeven
Sullivan voted AGAINST the bipartisan $12B Ukraine aid package. https://t.co/LLArQKh74m — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) March 17, 2022 Sasse expressed frustration with the fact that a bill providing emergency aid to Ukraine was not passed sooner on its own instead of being tacked on to the enormous omnibus package last week, and he justified his vote on that basis. “We spent 13 billion dollars on Ukrainian aid out of a total appropriations package of $1.5 trillion. So for those of you doing math at home, that’s less than 1 percent of what we passed in the middle of the night last week that was actually Ukrainian aid,” explained Sasse. “Ukrainian aid was a little bit of sugar on the larger medicine of a $1.5 trillion bill,” he added. Murphy’s implication that Republicans were registering their opposition to the aid within the large bill represented, according to Sasse, an attempt to “bully the other side.” Sasse continued on with a denunciation of politicians who provide fan-service to a narrow slice of the populace to the detriment of the American people and their governing institutions, using Murphy’s tweet as a prime example. He explained the purpose of the speech by observing that “if you allow liars to constantly lie, and they can get away with it, then they just keep doing it.” Murphy began his response by wondering aloud if Sasse had broken Senate rules by accusing him of “tribal hackery” in a chart that stood beside Sasse as he delivered his speech and complaining that Republicans often fail to “cast their vote in a way that is aligned with their voice.” He called it “concerning” that Republicans voted against the omnibus while critiquing the Biden administration for not doing enough for Ukraine because it reflected the more general “lack of interest in compromise” that he characterized as “a fealty to the perfect and an antagonism to the good” in the Senate’s culture. Sasse jumped in to ask Murphy a direct question: “Do you believe that the people who voted against it [the omnibus bill], voted against it because they were against Ukrainian aid?” “Every one of us approaches a big-” replied Murphy before being cut off. “I’m asking a really simple question,” said Sasse. “Do you think that a single person that your Twitter self-pleasuring was for, do you think a single person that voted against it, voted against it because they were against Ukrainian aid?” “Absolutely not,” said Murphy. “Then what’s the point of the tweet?” asked Sasse. Murphy reiterated his point about there not being enough compromise in the institution. At that point, Sasse separated the debate into being about three issues: Ukrainian aid, the budget process, and grandstanding. He noted that the real conflict between Murphy and himself was the third, and argued that “the Republic got dumber” as a consequence of the Connecticut senator’s misleading tweet. “I think it’s convenient for Republicans to consistently eviscerate the president for his conduct, but then not be willing to cast the difficult votes necessary to help the president effectuate a policy there,” said Murphy, who argued that the omnibus was the “only” way the Senate could have provided funds to Ukraine. Sasse called passing the omnibus or sending no aid to Ukraine a “false choice,” and Murphy defended it by saying there while there were infinite other options, Sasse’s choice was “convenient” given the fact that that was the option on the table, though he agreed that the budget process was dysfunctional. While he never apologized for his tweet, Murphy did say that he would “take the senator’s words seriously and try to raise it in a way that is constructive” in the future. Sasse closed out the exchange by agreeing that there’s rampant grandstanding on both sides of the partisan aisle, agreeing that the Biden administration is willing to spend money on Ukrainian aid, and restating his frustration with the budget process. The testy argument between the two senators functioned as a direct back-and-forth for much of its duration, in defiance of Senate rules.

3/20/2022,"The account for Ukrainian cat influencer Stepan has shared an update following the bombing of Kharkiv during Russia’s invasion. On Wednesday, Mar. 16, Stepan’s Instagram account — which boasts more than 1 million followers — shared photos of the cat, along with a harrowing caption about the current conflict. “On February 24, early in the morning, we were sleeping at home,” the post began. “At 5 am, some explosion was heard, and I didn't even understand what it was. After a while, after half an hour later, there were more explosions, the windows trembled. I jumped up and understood that something terrible was happening! The attack and shelling of Kharkiv (especially on the North Saltovka where we live). We realized that the war had come to our house.” The post, from Stepan’s owner who is thought to be named Anna, explained how shells hit their neighbors's homes and that while they witnessed many houses burn down, their home stayed safe for a week before it was damaged after a shell hit another home's balcony. The account described hiding in the basement for two days and spending a week without electricity before they were able to leave the city. “Kharkiv volunteers helped by taking us to the railway station. We got on the train Kharkiv - Lviv (in 20 hours, we got to Lviv). Then we followed to the border with Poland. At the border, we stood in a line in a pedestrian crossing. There were a lot of people (4-5 thousand). After 9 hours, we crossed the border,” the post continued. “When we reached Poland, we were offered help from the World Influencers and Bloggers Association from Monaco. They helped us get to France to wait for the very day when we could return home.” The caption concluded, “We're all right now. We worry very much about our relatives in Ukraine and will do the very best we can to help our country.” According to The Washington Post, The World Influencers and Bloggers Association is a global organization which unites influencers around the world. It named Stepan one of its top pet influencers. Maria Grazhina Chaplin, the association’s CEO and founder, learned of Stepan and Anna's struggles in Ukraine and organized a way to help them out of the country. Now, the organization is taking care of them in France. Stepan's post is a huge relief for fans of the cat, who had not seen an update from the animal influencer since March 3, a week after Russia first invaded Ukraine. Stepan, who Anna rescued as a one month old kitten and is now 13, per The Kyiv Independent, first skyrocketed to internet fame in 2019, when a TikTok set to Stevie Wonder's ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" featuring him with a glass of wine received more than 27 million views. Now, he continues to boast a large following on TikTok, where Stepan participates in many viral trends. He even caught the attention of Britney Spears, who posted a pic of Stepan to her since-deleted Instagram account with the caption, “If I go quiet from time to time, you can catch me with this cat somewhere.” Last December, Stepan officially went mainstream after he appeared in a Valentino ad with a $2,800 purse from the Italian designer.

3/20/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's urban water users and farmers who rely on supplies from state reservoirs will get less than planned this year as fears of a third consecutive dry year become reality, state officials announced Friday. Water agencies that serve 27 million people and 750,000 acres (303,514 hectares) of farmland, will get just 5% of what they've requested this year from state supplies beyond what's needed for critical activities such as drinking and bathing. That's down from the 15% allocation state officials had announced in January, after a wet December fueled hopes of a lessening drought. But a wet winter didn't materialize and unless several more inches of rain falls this month, the January-March period will be the driest start to a California year at least a century. That's when most of the state's rain and snow typically falls. Mandatory restrictions on using water for outdoor activities like landscaping and other purposes may come from local water agencies as they continue to grapple with limited supplies, said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources. Local water agencies that know their communities’ unique needs are better poised than state officials to set water use restrictions, Nemeth said. “I think with this reduced allocation we are going to see more urban areas in California move into some kind of mandatory water conservation,” she said in an interview. State officials will continue urging people to voluntarily cut water use by 15%, an amount designed to get Californians' collective water use back to what it was during the last drought, which lasted from 2012 to 2016, Nemeth said. Statewide water use in January actually went up 2.6% compared to the same month in 2020, due to dry conditions and warm temperatures. About a third of Southern California's water comes from state supplies, mostly routed through the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 19 million people. Abel Hagekhalil, the district's general manager, said in a statement Friday that the public needs to do more to save water. “We all need to take this drought more seriously and significantly step up our water-saving efforts to help preserve our dropping storage levels and ensure we have the water we need into the summer and fall,"" he said. California is in its second acute drought in less than a decade, and scientists say the U.S. West is broadly experiencing the worst megadrought in 1,200 years, made more intense by climate change. People adapted their water use during the state's last drought, in part by ripping up sprinkler-hungry lawns and replacing them with drought-resistant landscaping. Many of those water-saving habits stuck. But the dry conditions that began anew in 2020 are demanding more conservation, as reservoirs such as Lake Oroville and Shasta Lake remain below historical levels and less water from melting snow is expected to trickle down the mountains this spring. Current predictions estimate the state will have about 57% of its historical median runoff this April through July, said Alan Haynes, hydrologist in charge for the California Nevada River Forecast Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Melted snow traditionally provides about a third of the state's water supply. A very wet December put water content in the snow at 160% of normal levels, but isn’t resulting in as much water runoff as expected because warmer temperatures are causing some of that water to evaporate rather than flow into rivers and streams as it melts, said Nemeth, the Department of Water Resources director. A persistent lack of water could produce a range of negative consequences for California, including farmers fallowing fields and endangered salmon and other fish dying. The water providers that rely on state supplies have a certain amount they of water they can request from the state, and state officials make determinations through the winter on how much the providers will get based on supply. In December, before the major snowfall, state officials told water providers that they wouldn't get anything beyond what was needed for immediate health and safety, such as drinking and bathing. The state upped that to 15% of requested supplies in January. Critics of California's water policy say the state promises more water each year than it has to give. That's led to a continued diminishment of supply in federally and state run reservoirs, said Doug Obegi, an attorney focused on water for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We basically have a system that is all but bankrupt because we promised so much more water than can actually be delivered,"" he said. Officials on Friday also announced a plan to seek a temporary exemption from water quality requirements in Northern California's Delta, the part of the state’s watershed where the freshwater rivers and salty ocean water mingle. That would allow the state and federal water projects to release less water into the Delta from the Shasta, Folsom and Oroville reservoirs — which are the state's major water supply sources. The water quality standards are designed, in part, to ensure the water doesn’t get so salty it can’t be used for farming, drinking and protecting the environment.",U.S./Associated Press,Drought-stricken California imposes new round of water cuts,https://news.yahoo.com/california-prepares-3rd-dry-few-042043059.html

3/20/2022,"Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, proposed cutting the IRS budget in half. IRS chief Chuck Rettig said ""you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely."" The IRS is grappling with underfunding and understaffing amid new pandemic responsibilities. The IRS is currently contending with a reduced budget, staff, and new pandemic-era responsibilities, with the agency trying to dig itself out of a hole of millions of unprocessed returns and late refunds. Both the Treasury Department and the IRS have said that the agency needs much more long-term funding to get running at an acceptable capacity. Then there's Republican Sen. Rick Scott's solution: Shrink the IRS's budget by 50%. That formed part of his ""Rescue America"" plan that he rolled out last month. He pitched it as a Republican agenda, though one that he introduced as a rank-and-file Republican instead of in his role as the head of the party's Senate campaign fundraising arm. Democrats are pummeling its proposed tax hikes for Americans ahead of the midterms. Two Business Insider journalists decided to do their taxes on their own for the first time; here's how it went. In a Thursday Ways & Means Committee hearing, Representative Lloyd Doggett asked IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig about the potential impact of halving the agency's budget. ""If the IRS budget was cut by 50%, you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely,"" Rettig said. ""We account for 96% of the gross revenue of the United States of America! How are you going to fund what we need to fund and what every American deserves?"" Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, said that ""perhaps shutting it down is exactly what those who'd make this outrageous proposal have in mind."" But the architect of the plan didn't see it that way. Scott defended his agenda and argued he didn't intend to shutter the IRS by proposing drastic budget cuts. ""We got to make this system where we don't need a big IRS,"" the Florida Republican told Insider in a brief interview. ""We got to make the system simple. I mean the IRS, it's so complex. If you can get lawyers and accountants you can figure out how to not pay taxes, it shouldn't be that way."" As Scott noted, tax evasion is a potentially trillion dollar problem. The Treasury Department has said that the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers dodge $163 billion in taxes annually. But the answer to cutting down on that tax evasion might be the opposite of Scott's proposal. The Treasury has said that allocating $80 billion in funding to the IRS for enforcement — the amount President Joe Biden proposed in the currently defunct Build Back Better Act — could bring in $700 billion in tax revenue in the next ten years. The IRS and Treasury Department have repeatedly sounded alarm bells over the agency's funding, or lack thereof. Heading into 2022, the IRS was still sitting on over 6 million unprocessed refunds, according to national taxpayer advocate Erin Collins. Rettig has been outspoken about the ""severe limitations"" that the IRS faces ""without long-term, predictable funding,"" and the burden that that places on taxpayers waiting for checks.

3/20/2022,"(Reuters) - The television channel of a sanctioned Russian businessman on Thursday said Alphabet Inc's Google had lost a court appeal against a 2021 ruling that the company pay a compounding fine for blocking access to the channel's YouTube account. The Moscow District Arbitration Court was unable to provide information by phone and did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Google, which Tsargrad said blocked the YouTube account in July 2020, did not respond to a request for comment. Google was disputing a daily 100,000 rouble ($1,050) fine it was ordered to pay in April 2021 after failing to unblock Tsargrad TV's YouTube account, a Christian Orthodox channel owned by businessman Konstantin Malofeev. The Moscow Arbitration Court said last year the daily fine would double each week that Google failed to comply. Tsargrad said Google already owes 1 billion roubles in fines, as of mid-March. ""Currently, writs of execution have been issued, enforcement orders have been initiated and funds sufficient to fulfil the court acts have been seized from Google's accounts,"" Tsargrad said in a statement. A simmering confrontation between Moscow and foreign tech firms has escalated in light of the crisis in Ukraine, and Russia has blocked access to Meta Platforms Inc's flagship social media, Facebook and Instagram. Tsargrad has said the fine would stop compounding when it hit 1 billion roubles. From September, that limit will be removed. The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Malofeev in 2014 over accusations that he funded pro-Moscow separatists fighting in Ukraine, which he denies. Russia considers such Western sanctions illegal. Malofeev said Tsargrad intends to file new lawsuits against Google, demanding the channel's YouTube accounts be unblocked in other countries. ""Some local courts will refuse to support us, for example, in the United States, because I am under sanctions. And elswehere they will help us,"" Malofeev told Reuters.

3/20/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. Navy veteran who was jailed in Iran for nearly two years sued the Iranian government on Thursday for $1 billion, alleging that he was kidnapped, held hostage and tortured. The federal lawsuit describes in unsparing detail the “prolonged and continuous"" abuse that Michael White says he suffered behind bars, including being beaten and punched, whipped on his feet, deprived of food and drink, and pressured to falsely confess that he was a spy for the U.S. government. “Mr. White endured this trauma for nearly two years, never knowing if or when he would be released and reunited with his family, repeatedly promised that his conditions would improve soon, only to be crushed psychologically when they did not,” the lawsuit states. The allegations in the complaint mirror the claims made by White in a 156-page manuscript that he wrote behind bars and that was later obtained by The Associated Press. The 31-page complaint traces White's travel to Iran, saying he was lured there in the summer of 2018 by a woman he considered his girlfriend so that he could be kidnapped by Iranian government agents and put in prison. He was charged with insulting Iran's Supreme Leader and cooperating with the U.S. government against Iran — charges the lawsuit says were fabricated — and sentenced without a trial to 10 years in prison. The suit also alleges that White's imprisonment was an effort by Iran to extract concessions from the Trump administration and to “manufacture additional leverage for diplomacy"" in the aftermath of Iran's withdrawal in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal with the U.S. Diplomats are currently trying to salvage a deal that would bring Iran back into compliance with limits on its nuclear program. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. Besides White, other plaintiffs include his mother and two brothers. It was not immediately clear if Iran planned to formally respond to the complaint, or if it had a lawyer who might enter an appearance in the case. If Iran does not respond to the allegations, a judge could enter a default judgment on White's behalf, enabling White to collect damages from a fund set up for victims of acts of state-sponsored terrorism. The State Department  arranged for his release in June 2020, flying him back to the U.S. as part of a deal that spared additional prison time for an American-Iranian doctor convicted in the U.S. of sanctions violations. White later made a videotaped appearance at that summer's Republican National Convention in a segment with former President Donald Trump and other hostages and detainees freed during the Trump administration. ____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",Politics/Associated Press,"US vet jailed in Iran sues for $1 billion, alleges torture",https://news.yahoo.com/us-vet-jailed-iran-sues-221441630.html
3/20/2022,"Crematoriums in Hong Kong are reportedly filling up as the region nears 1 million infections and faces the world’s highest COVID-19 death rate in its current outbreak.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that the new wave of COVID-19 cases and their resulting deaths is putting a strain on the region’s healthcare system.

“Our crematoriums are working day and night, and they are already close to their capacity,” she said. “Within such a short period of time, we have seen so many deaths, and that would affect the logistics of funeral matters.”

Hong Kong’s recent surge made headlines after the local government first announced its rapid-test results from Feb. 26 to March 5, which saw 962,581 new COVID-19 cases.

Researchers at the University of Hong Kong earlier estimated that 3.6 million Hong Kongers, or about half of the region’s population, have been infected through March 14.

Hong Kong’s recent surge has filled up public mortuaries, forcing the city to utilize mobile refrigerated units to store corpses.

Most of the deaths, which have reached a total of 4,847 since the start of the pandemic, were residents of nursing homes, as well as the unvaccinated and the elderly. This total figure has exceeded that of mainland China, which is at 4,636 as of this writing.

The Omicron variant, which is extremely infectious, became too much for Hong Kong’s “zero-COVID” strategy, which involves citywide lockdowns and aggressive tracing and testing, along with other strict measures.

The zero-tolerance approach, which Beijing also imposes in mainland China, has seemingly backfired in Hong Kong, especially after the Omicron variant spread to dozens of local senior care homes.

According to Lam, the strategies from earlier waves are now “simply unrealistic” to implement due to the rising number of cases.

“I can’t see the economy torn into pieces,” she said.

The government has since eased some of its strict policies. For example, instead of being sent to isolation facilities and hospitals, patients with mild cases can now stay at home until they test negative for COVID-19.

According to officials, however, these temporary concessions will remain until isolation and testing capacities have recovered with assistance from Beijing.

3/20/2022,"Strategic Resource Group Burt Flickinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how retail shoppers are resisting inflationary price pressures, trends in consumer goods, and production slowdowns from China impacting electronic sales. BRAD SMITH: We've got Burt Flickinger, who is the Strategic Resource Group managing director. Burt, great to have this conversation here with you today. And so under inflation and feeling this in a different way, where does it show, where does the data show that shoppers are spending more of their money right now? BURT FLICKINGER: Brad, there's an accelerating inflationary retail ice age. So all retail categories are inflated in the US Department of Commerce report this morning. So it was up 3/10 of a percent overall. To your point, there were a couple standouts, clothing, but that's primarily because during COVID, record weight gains of men, women, and children, so people need larger sizes. But what's really alarming, Brad, is that internet sales were down month over month and grocery and health care sales were down month over month, despite the UN reporting worldwide food inflation of 21% over the last year. So real cause for concern and very probably a pronounced retail recession as we get into the fourth quarter this year and the new year next year. BRAD SMITH: I was told that it was a good weight that I was putting on, so it feels like a personal attack with the new sizes there, Burt. But at the end of the day, when we think about where some of those products are that they might be thinking about holding off on, and consumers are picking and choosing between categories, is there one category that has more pricing power than another right now? BURT FLICKINGER: The categories that have the most pricing power, Brad, are food and consumables more than wearables. And to your point of postponing purchases, we saw electronics being down as a category today. People are postponing purchases until the new generation of excellent consumer products come out for BTS, or back to school, this year. We're also seeing consumers postponing purchases of appliances and being very cautious and buying both used cars and new cars. So caution across the board. And if the proverbial great Eddie Grant Electric Avenue, the great musician and philosopher of the people, working so hard like a soldier, can't afford a thing on TV, can't afford to feed the kids. That's the summary of inflation and the real cause for concern in terms of consumer spending and affordability of the key categories you're referencing. BRAD SMITH: Burt, I want to break down two of those things that you just mentioned, and a great quote there at the end as well, significantly applicable here on the discussion. But particularly, starting things off with consumer electronics, how does this change the cyclicality that investors have come to expect when we evaluate technology companies that always have their production numbers that they are perhaps not just reporting but that investors are forecasting and baking that in to determine what is a normal cycle or a super cycle? How does the consumption habits that we're tracking right now change the cycle? BURT FLICKINGER: Brad, very prescient insights on your part, as always. And the consumer electronics purchase cycle will really be led by innovation. Apple, as always, others, and then Nvidia and Broadcom and others, as you've reported well. But it's also you and EP, great EP Rachel Sherman have teamed up to report, it's also getting the chips out of the People's Republic of China, which [? Rochelle ?] has reported very well over the years too. And even with innovation, supply chain snafus and delays and stoppages really can impair consumer electronics as well as autos, as you guys have reported well. So it's really up to the supply chain. And the supply chain is as bad this year as it was last year, and probably will be till the end of this year. BRAD SMITH: Burt, while we have you, you mentioned automobiles as well. How has this altered what consumers are willing to pay for value? Because that is what consumers are looking for at the end of the day, a valuable, not just purchase experience, but a valuable product that's going to stand the test of time as well. BURT FLICKINGER: Brad, on your important point, the best way to invest in autos is really used cars, through O'Reilly Auto Parts, AutoZone, and Advanced Auto Parts, which are three of our real Flick's Picks for Yahoo Finance, as well as BJ's Wholesale Club, Lowe's, and Target, too, where consumers get great quality and value in terms of both new products and in the case of the auto parts aftermarket, pre-owned products where consumers get a better life cycle out of cars and trucks and transportation and a better value, to your key point. BRAD SMITH: Burt, always a pleasure to have the conversation with you. Appreciate the time and insights here today.

3/20/2022,"By Akriti Sharma (Reuters) -Moderna Inc on late Thursday sought emergency use authorization from U.S. health regulators for a second COVID-19 booster shot, as a surge in cases in some parts of the world fuels fears of another wave of the pandemic. The U.S. biotechnology company said its request covered all adults over the age of 18 so that the appropriate use of an additional booster dose of its vaccine, including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities, could be determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health care providers. Moderna's request is significantly broader than Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE's application that was filed earlier this week with U.S. regulators for a second booster shot for people aged 65 and older. Moderna, without specifically commenting on the effectiveness of a fourth shot, said its submission was partly based on data recently published in the United States and Israel following the emergence of the Omicron variant. FDA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. U.S. health officials, including top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have raised the prospect of a fourth shot, especially for older people and to prepare for the possibility of another surge in cases. CDC data has shown that vaccine efficacy wanes over time and a third shot helps restore it. It, however, has not released comprehensive data based on age or health status to back the case. Pfizer and Moderna are betting additional booster doses will be needed as new virus variants emerge. The news was first reported by the New York Times. While COVID cases are falling in the United States and much of the world, infections are rising in China. In the UK and Europe, there has been a reversal in the downward trend of COVID cases as economies have opened up and a second variant of Omicron circulates.

3/20/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin could be feeling trapped — and despite his public statements, he can't just pretend that everything is going OK in Ukraine, where his troops have so far failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, said Jack Barsky, a former KGB agent and the author of ""Deep Undercover: My Secret Life and Tangled Alliances as a KGB Spy in America."" Born Albrecht Dittrich in East Germany and recruited by the KGB to spy on the U.S. during the Cold War, Barsky stayed in the U.S. after the fall of the Soviet Union and worked with U.S. intelligence after he was exposed as a former sleeper agent. Barsky told CBS News' Lana Zak that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a formative moment for Putin, who was then a mid-level KGB officer. As protesters gathered outside the office where he was stationed in Dresden, in East Germany, Putin was told Moscow was silent. Putin ""went from being a member of the most powerful organization, living the good life in East Germany, to somebody who was completely helpless, defending that position. I think that left a deep impression on him and it motivated him to rebuild — not necessarily the Soviet Union, but greater Russia. This is what he is after,"" Barsky said. Barsky told CBS News that in other wars, Putin sought to escalate the conflict — and if the pattern holds, will go after more civilian targets. ""He doesn't really care as much for the suffering of the Russian people. He's lashing out against his own people,"" Barsky said. The Russian leader has ""a tight grip on power,"" Barksy said. ""As long as he satisfies his inner circle — the folks that are directly supporting him — he doesn't have much to fear."" While a military revolt could be a potential long-term scenario, Barsky said, right now ""he is very well protected."" ""Assuming that he can survive this, assuming there isn't a sort of coup against him — so long term, he'll be in trouble if this keeps going like this, if more soldiers keep dying. He'll have an Afghanistan on his hands,"" said Barsky. Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in late 1979, toppling the Afghan leader and kicking off a nearly decade-long conflict with the mujahideen.

3/20/2022,"Daylight Savings Time (DST) could become permanent in the U.S. after the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, which now awaits a House vote and a signature from President Biden before it would become law and go into effect in late 2023. The goal of DST is to enable people to make more use of daylight. Currently, DST begins when clocks move forward one hour on the second Sunday in March at 2:00 A.M. and ends when clocks move backward one hour on the first Sunday in November at 2:00 A.M. So twice a year, Americans adjust. Businesses, politicians, sleep experts, and regular Americans are now actively discussing who would benefit from sticking to one schedule all year. One apparent winner would be golfers and golf courses. ""Golfers, of course, really like the longer days so they can get in more holes before the sun goes down,"" Greg Nathan, chief business officer for the National Golf Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. ""And with the extra evening light, course operators can accommodate more golfers/greens fee revenue."" Farmers, another group often linked to the DST debate, would probably be fine either way. ""Farmers and ranchers will make use of the sunlight no matter the time,” the National Farmers Union told Yahoo Finance in a statement. “There are certain types of farming that are dependent on a daily schedule, like dairy farming, that, depending on the farm, require some routine changes twice a year.” And who would lose from making DST permanent? Everyone else, according to sleep experts. “We’re disappointed, especially given the overwhelming scientific and health feeling that this is a bad idea,” Dr. Karin Johnson, a member of the board of directors of Save Standard Time and an associate professor of neurology at UMass Chan Medical School-Baystate, told the New York Times. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, “current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety.” (DST shifts daylight hours later in the evening while and Standard Time shifts daylight hours earlier in the morning.) The unanimous passage of the Sunshine Protection Act suggested bipartisan momentum for making DST permanent. ""I know this is not the most important issue confronting America, but it's one of those issues where there's a lot of agreement,"" stated Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a co-sponsor of the Sunshine Protection Act. ""If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore."" But while Rubio is right that Americans mostly prefer to end the need to adjust their clocks twice annually, there is no widespread agreement about whether DST should be made permanent or eliminated entirely. A 2019 AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that ""4 in 10 Americans would like to see their clocks stay on standard time year-round, while about 3 in 10 prefer to stay on daylight saving time."" (A recent Yahoo Finance Twitter poll found that 72% of 989 respondents supported permanent DST.) Many Americans don't realize that making DST permanent has been tried before, in 1973. That national experiment indicated that while most Americans liked the idea of permanent DST, they did not like the reality. ""In 1973, anywhere from 57-73% of people supported staying on DST during the winter,"" sleep expert Olivia Walch wrote in November. ""So they did it, in January of 1974. By the time February and March rolled around, only 19-30% of people still thought it was a good idea, while 43% said it was actively bad. What changed? People experienced what happens to your body when you have to kick off your day in the dark of night. They drove to work and caught the bus to school, while the sun waited to rise until 8:00 am. They didn’t like it, and rolled the decision back before the next winter came around."" Given the stakes, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine urged the House to consider making Standard Time permanent instead. ""We call on the House to take more time to assess the potential ramifications of establishing permanent daylight saving time before making such an important decision that will affect all Americans.""
