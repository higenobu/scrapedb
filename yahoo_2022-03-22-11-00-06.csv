3/22/2022,"A total of 11 officials and personnel of a local family planning station in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were punished after an investigation found a couple who had given birth to 15 children.

During the investigation, authorities learned of a man named Liang Er, 76, and his “wife,” Lu Honglan, 46, who gave birth to four boys and 11 girls between 1995 and 2016.

Followingthe discovery, a total of 11 officials and personnel, including the head of Licun town in Rong County and the director of the local family planning station, were punished for neglecting their duties, local authorities said on Sunday.

 

The couple could have faced punishment had they been discovered prior to the end of China’s one-child policy, an effort established by the Chinese government in 1979 to control the growing population and limit the demands on resources.

The decades-long policy has since been phased out after it was eventually changed to a two-child policy in 2015. The government eventually decided toremove the limit and its associated punishments, which included hefty fines and the loss of one’s job, on July 21, 2021.

The couple, who reportedly met and fell in love while working in Guangdon in 1994, had an informal wedding ceremony but never legally registered their marriage. The family has reportedly survived on Liang’s income from collecting resin of pine trees and government-provided poverty subsidies between 2015 and 2019.

Liang and Lu’s lives made headlines in 2016 when the man earned the epithet “Macho Man” for marrying a woman 30 years younger than him and having many children. His wife reportedly also gave birth to most of her children in their home.

Media attention again turned to the couple from Rong County in Guangxi after the Ministry of Public Security launched a campaign against human traffickingat thebeginning of the month. The campaign was launched following the wide circulation earlier this year of another case, in which amother of eight was found chained in Huankou village in Feng County of the eastern Jiangsu Province.

So, if they're placing cameras in the bathroom, then they're probably not going to bother with night vision. So, these camera lenses are very small — as you can see here — so they can be hidden in anything, even a hole in the wall.""

3/22/2022,"STORY: This is Tetyana Chornovol. A former nationalist member of parliament, who is now fighting in frontline trenches. Working as an anti-tank guided missile operator, just north of Kyiv. Here, she describes her most recent hit. ""I switched it on and saw tanks on the screen. They just entered within the range of my missile. I took aim and destroyed the first tank. Interestingly, the rocket was flying for quite some time. Perhaps the tanks registered the rocket's launch and managed to turn back but I shot it right at the fuel tanks and the ammunition load has detonated. The tank literally flew off the road and now it is somewhere in the road ditch in the forest. After that we came under fire, not for long, all during this time Russian military vehicles were turning back and escaping. So one destroyed tank was enough to stop the attack, for the column to turn back and run away.” A high profile anti-corruption campaigner, Tetyana, who is also a former journalist, was one of the leaders in the Euromaidan protests. She turned to politics in 2014 and was elected a member of the nationalist and conservative People’s Front party. But now she’s part of a unit tasked with engaging and destroying Russian tanks and armoured vehicles to stop its approach on the Ukrainian capital. Tetyana is a war widow herself. Her husband, Mykola Berezovyi, served as a volunteer fighter in the right wing paramilitary Azov Battalion. He was killed during fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2014.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Meet Tetyana, Ukrainian missile operator",https://news.yahoo.com/meet-tetyana-ukrainian-missile-operator-160529590.html
3/22/2022,"Joe Rogan voiced his support for “the deep state” – a conspiracy theory peddled by Donald Trump and his followers that refers to a secret network of career politicians and federal agents – on a Saturday episode of his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience.” In an interview with former CIA officer Mike Baker, Rogan made his case. “One of the things that the tinfoil-hat brigade likes to talk about is the deep state,” he said. “They always like to talk about the deep state. What I was saying is, what if we didn’t have a deep state?” he continued. “Do you know how f–ed we would be if we didn’t have career politicians and career intelligence agencies? People who are there for a long period of time who do understand it.” Rogan argued that President Joe Biden exemplifies the need for a government staffed by several experienced civil servants. “Listen, I’ve disrespected Joe Biden enough, I don’t think I should do it anymore,” he stated. “I’ve said enough about him being mentally incompetent. He’s just compromised, he’s an old guy. We know, everyone knows, the guy is falling apart.” If Biden was the sole person in charge, Rogan said, his administration would become a dictatorship. “But imagine if he really was the only say in how things run, and how things go? If he really was a dictator,” he proposed. “We would be beyond f–ed!” This is not the first time that the controversial comic-turned-podcaster has promoted conspiracy theories regarding the deep state. In a podcast episode from November 2021, he defended former president Trump, saying, “Look, Trump’s not a perfect guy, but this thing he kept saying about the deep state is 100% real!” Later in the clip, he said, “They were not spending their time trying to make the government work more efficiently and make the country a better place for everyone and prop up the middle class. No. They were trying to regain power, and they got it, with a dead man [Joe Biden].” Earlier this year, Rogan came under fire for promoting ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 and making other unfounded claims about the vaccine on his podcast. That, along with his use of the N-word in several episodes, fueled a saga that saw many notable artists leave Spotify. Last year, he signed a licensing deal with the streaming giant that is estimated to be worth at least $100 million.",Politics/The Wrap,Joe Rogan Endorses the Deep State: ‘We Would Be Beyond F–ed’ Without It,https://news.yahoo.com/joe-rogan-endorses-deep-state-233558018.html
