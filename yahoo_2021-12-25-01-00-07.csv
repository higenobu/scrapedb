12/25/2021,"The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has surged worldwide in record time—it was only three weeks ago that the first case was identified in South Africa. Last week, it accounted for 73% of new COVID infections in the United States, according to the latest CDC data. It's highly contagious—scientists estimate it's twice as transmissible as the Delta variant, which itself was twice as transmissible as the original COIVD strain—which calls for an abundance of caution. How do you know if you've been infected with Omicron, how severe is it, and what should you do? Read on to find out more—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID.     1 These May Be The Primary Symptoms of Omicron
 Dr. Katherine Poehling, a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, told NBC News on Wednesday that the prominent symptoms of an Omicron infection are: Cough Fatigue or tiredness Congestion and runny nose  Unlike previous variants, loss of taste and smell seems to be uncommon, she said.     2 Omicron Symptoms In Country Where It Originated
 According to South Africa's biggest private health insurer, South Africans with an Omicron infection often develop  scratchy or sore throat  nasal congestion dry cough  muscle pain, especially low back pain How severe do the symptoms tend to be? Read on.     3 Symptoms May Vary Based on Vaccination Status
 Experts tentatively say that Omicron seems to be producing milder symptoms than previous variants. ""It is clear that if you're vaccinated, particularly if you've had a booster, Omicron tends to produce milder infections,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center,"" told NBC. ""What we haven't seen yet is a substantial body of information about what Omicron will do in unvaccinated people,"" he added. RELATED: Warning Signs You Have ""Too Much Fat,"" Say Experts     4 But Research Isn't Conclusive But experts warn that more data needs to be gathered before it can be conclusively said that Omicron causes different symptoms. ""It's still too early to say that there's any difference in symptoms between the Omicron variant and previous versions,"" Ashley Z. Ritter, an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania told the New York Times on Wednesday.     5 Another Potential Difference Early data indicates that Omicron's incubation period—the time it takes for an infected person to develop symptoms after exposure to the virus—may be significantly shorter than with previous variants: Previously, it was about a week, while Omicron may develop in three days or less. RELATED: Things to Never Do After Age 40, Say Health Experts     6 Other Common COVID Symptoms According to the CDC, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea     7 Is It Omicron? So how do you tell if your cough or sore throat is a cold or COVID? You really can't, experts say. Their advice: If you're having any symptoms that are out of the ordinary, get tested for COVID ASAP—even if you've been fully vaccinated or boosted—and self-isolate until you know the results. ""Even if you think it's just allergies, it would be best for you to go ahead and get a COVID test and make sure you don't have it before you go to work or school or church, because those symptoms can be very mild,"" said S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist hospital, this week. If you test positive for COVID, the CDC advises that you isolate for 10 days after the date any symptoms started (as long as your symptoms are improving and you've been fever-free for at least 24 hours without using any fever-reducing medications). If you test positive but don't have symptoms, you should isolate for 10 days from the date of your COVID test.  RELATED: This Makes You ""Most Likely"" to Die of COVID, Says Experts     8 How to Stay Safe Out There Follow the fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—get vaccinated ASAP; if you live in an area with low vaccination rates, wear an N95 face mask, don't travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.","Health/Eat This, Not That!",Omicron Symptoms Usually Appear Like This,https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-symptoms-usually-appear-121546819.html
12/25/2021,"A dinosaur embryo perfectly curled up in its fossilized egg was analyzed by a team of researchers in southeastern China.

The rundown: The fossil, estimated to be between 72 and 66 million years old, belonged to an oviraptorosaur — a beaked, toothless and omnivorous theropod that existed during the Cretaceous Period of what are now Asia and North America. Researchers published their findings in the journal iScience.


 The embryo was estimated to be 27 centimeters (11 inches) long from head to tail. Researchers said the dinosaur, which would have fed on plants, would be 2-3 meters (79-118 inches) long had it lived to adulthood. The embryo was close to hatching as evidenced by its “tucking” posture, a behavior seen in modern birds. Chicks preparing to hatch tuck their heads under their right wing for stability as they crack the shell with their beak. Modern birds are direct descendants of theropods, which are two-legged dinosaurs. Theropods include the Tyrannosaurus rex, spinosaurus and velociraptor, among others. 
What the researchers are saying: Due to its complete structure, the fossil turned out to be one of the best dinosaur embryos found in history, the researchers told AFP. They called the creature “Baby Yingliang” after Yingliang Stone Nature History Museum, its current location.

 “This skeleton is not only complete from the tip of the snout to the end of its tail; it is curled in a life pose within its egg as if the animal died just yesterday,” study co-author Darla Zelenitsky, an assistant professor of paleontology at the University of Calgary, told Live Science. Lead author Waisum Ma, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Birmingham, said dinosaur embryos happen to be some of the rarest fossils. Most non-avian embryos are also incomplete, with bones separated at the joints. “We are very excited about the discovery of ‘Baby Yingliang’ — it is preserved in a great condition and helps us answer a lot of questions about dinosaur growth and reproduction with it,” Ma said. “It is interesting to see this dinosaur embryo and a chicken embryo pose in a similar way inside the egg, which possibly indicates similar prehatching behaviours.” The researchers said the embryo was found in Jiangxi province and acquired by Liang Liu, director of a Chinese stone company called Yingliang Group, in 2000. It was stored and forgotten until museum staff found it some 10 years later, during the construction of Yingliang Stone Nature History Museum, according to CNN. Embryos that don’t adopt the tucking posture are more likely to die as a result of unsuccessful hatching. The team plans to study the fossil further using advanced scanning techniques, since part of its body remains covered by rock.
