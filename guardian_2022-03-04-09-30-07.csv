3/4/2022,"Manchester United have the attacking skill to pierce Manchester City’s defence, but whether they convert their chances will depend to a large extent on whether Cristiano Ronaldo has lost his finishing power for good. Is his recent wastefulness the sign of a new – or rather, an old – Ronaldo? The other thing United must improve is their attitude: Ralf Rangnick’s fickle crew will need to be compact and energetic for 90-plus minutes if they are to get the counter-attacking victory that would boost their top-four prospects and make them momentarily popular in Liverpool. Failure to do that and another humiliation looms. PD Manchester City v Manchester United (Sunday, 4.30pm, all times GMT) There are more than a few reasons why September 2019 feels like several decades ago. One is that, back then, Arsenal were around the apex of their infuriating form under Unai Emery. It could hardly have been encapsulated better than in a 2-2 draw at Watford, where they were cruising at half-time but were pegged back after some mind-numbing defensive idiocy and ended up fortunate to draw. On Sunday they return to Vicarage Road and the difference is stark: Mikel Arteta has fashioned a sleek, tough team that operates with control and resilience. Those qualities will be put to the test by Roy Hodgson, who knows Watford need wins now and will be buoyed by the way they pulled through for a point at Manchester United. Arsenal will not be able to relax while Emmanuel Dennis and Ismaïla Sarr are waiting to counter. NA Experience suggests David Moyes will send out his team at Anfield with instructions to defend deep and counter-attack fast. That tactic worked well in November, when West Ham won 3-2 at the London Stadium in a victory that took West Ham above Liverpool in the table and level on points with Manchester City. Back then it looked like Liverpool’s defensive problems would undermine their season while West Ham were on course for something special. Instead Liverpool have tightened up and West Ham’s momentum has sagged, partly because of the season-ending injury that Angelo Ogbonna suffered in that win and also because, unlike in that match, they cannot score freely when Michael Antonio is unavailable or knackered. By contrast, Liverpool are on a roll and have a wealth of attacking options. Doing the double over Liverpool looks highly unlikely, but would be a heck of a way for West Ham to climb back into the top four. PD Liverpool v West Ham (Saturday, 5.30pm) Chelsea might be on the verge of a new era but a trip to Burnley has the capacity to complicate their appeal to potential owners. Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss, if they are to be the men to replace Roman Abramovich, would presumably like to be taking over a Champions League club so major slip-ups now are unthinkable. Neither side had the ideal midweek, Thomas Tuchel’s team being given a stern FA Cup test by Luton Town and Burnley squandering one of their top-flight games in hand against Leicester. Sean Dyche’s side need to start racking up wins - adding to their 12 draws may not be enough - and will want to summon the kind of full-blooded display that saw off Spurs. For Chelsea, an uneventful end to the most dramatic of weeks would be the desirable outcome. NA Burnley v Chelsea (Saturday, 3pm) On paper Crystal Palace are the most difficult opponents Wolves will face this side of Easter, with their next six games against the sides currently 11th, 19th, 17th, 16th, 13th and 14th. Wolves’ 2-0 defeat at Selhurst Park in November was the last time they lost, or even fell behind, to a team currently in the bottom half of the table and despite losing at Arsenal and West Ham in their last two games, given their fixtures, there seems every reason for Bruno Lage’s side to be looking up from their current position of eighth. SB Wolves v Crystal Palace (Saturday, 3pm) The Jesse Marsch era begins at Leicester and it may take some time, for everyone who has enjoyed Leeds’ ride in recent years, to get used to the absence of Marcelo Bielsa and his predilection for a ground-level viewpoint on the touchline. The parting of ways was deeply emotional from all sides and the Leeds players will need to adapt quickly. One concern is that, over Bielsa’s tenure, they were coached to play in a very specific way that led previously unremarkable performers to dizzy heights. Marsch will need to find a way of preserving some of Bielsa’s magic while correcting the issues – some of which, including a vast injury list, were hardly the Argentinian’s fault – that have led them towards a relegation scrap. The American has been well schooled in fearsome pressing methods so Leeds can still be expected to adopt a high-octane approach. Against a patchy Leicester, Marsch has a chance to show he can marry that with a structure that makes Leeds tough to beat. NA Leicester City v Leicester (Saturday, 12.30pm) Southampton’s 1-0 victory at St Mary’s in November was the final straw for Aston Villa’s board. They ditched Dean Smith almost immediately afterwards. Ralph Hassenhüttl, meanwhile, could take satisfaction from the fact that the only goal was scored by Adam Armstrong, who was given the No 9 shirt vacated when Danny Ings departed for supposedly better things … at Villa. Ings missed that match through injury but should be available to face his former club on Saturday. Southampton are four places above Villa in the table and recorded their third straight win when they ousted West Ham from the FA Cup. They seem to have found the consistency that Steven Gerrard has not yet been able to inspire in Villa. Ings and Ollie Watkins have yet to prove conclusively they can thrive together up front but both played well in last weekend’s win over Brighton. Another such display would be well timed for Villa, especially if Ings were to score his first goal in over two months. PD Aston Villa v Southampton (Saturday, 3pm) Newcastle are flying and so, at least, is Joe Willock. The goalscorer supreme of his loan spell last season has taken time to resurface but a sublime finish at Brentford last week meant that, having failed to score all season, he has now notched vital goals in successive games. “I didn’t really lose confidence, it just wasn’t going my way,” Willock said last week. Most things are panning out in favour of Eddie Howe’s side, now unbeaten in seven, and they look increasingly unlikely to be mired in the relegation scrap. Attractive though they are, Brighton arrive at St James’ Park on the back of three straight defeats and have not scored in 277 minutes; an in-the-mood Willock has a chance to show them how it is done and drive Newcastle closer to mid-table. NA Newcastle v Brighton (Saturday, 3pm) In January Jonathan Rowe signed a new contract at Norwich and declared that he was “just getting started”. This might be the weekend when he does, indeed, get started. Rowe ended 2021 with a run of nine goals and five assists in a dozen under-23 fixtures, a run of form hot enough to propel him onto the first-team bench. There have been four Premier League substitute appearances since, totalling 47 minutes and 22 touches, and on Wednesday he caught the eye given half an hour against Liverpool in the FA Cup, which included a first first-team shot, excellently saved by Allison. “He’s a good kid. He’s got a great attitude to the game,” said Dean Smith. “Jonny Rowe has got a hell of a future ahead of him if he keeps on the same learning path.” Norwich have one draw and four defeats in their last five in all competitions, Brentford one draw and eight defeats in their last nine, and if either side is going to kick-start their season this would seem the obvious place to start. SB Norwich v Brentford (Saturday, 3pm) Mike Riley’s apology to Everton for the failure to award a penalty following Rodri’s handball at Goodison Park last week is of no practical use to anyone. All that episode means is that Frank Lampard will scrutinise even more closely the performance of the officials in charge of Monday’s clash with Tottenham. The referee will be Stuart Attwell and, perhaps more significantly, the VAR operative will be John Brooks, which will presumably come as good news for Everton. After all, Brooks proved his ability to spot infringements on replays in January, when, after initially waving play on, he consulted the pitchside monitor at Goodison and gave Everton a penalty against Brighton, although Dominic Calvert-Lewin proceeded to show that spot-kicks do not equate to goals, as he ballooned the ball over the bar. And speaking of misfiring England strikers, Harry Kane was one of Spurs’ worst performers in their lame midweek defeat to Middlesbrough. Kane’s tendency to alternate between bright and incompetent performances makes him the ideal symbol of Spurs. Everton are no more reliable, so there really is no telling how Monday’s match will unfold.

3/4/2022,"Employees should report any suspicious emails rather than delete them and firms must step up their vigilance against cyber-attacks in the face of a heightened threat from Russian hackers, the UK’s data watchdog has said. John Edwards, the information commissioner, said a new era of security had begun where instead of blacking out windows, people needed to maintain vigilance over their inboxes. Experts including the UK’s cybersecurity agency have said Russian hackers could target Britain, and the imposition of sanctions by London on Moscow has increased those fears. Asked about the potential for a Russia-Ukraine cyber conflict spreading to the UK, Edwards said: “We have picked up on that heightened threat environment and we think it’s really important to take the opportunity to remind businesses of the importance of security over the data that they hold. This is a different era from blacking out the windows and keeping the lights off. The threats are going to come in through your inbox.” Edwards said that outside the Ukraine conflict and the warnings it had brought of a heightened security threat, the Information Commissioner’s Office had seen a “steady and significant” increase in cyber-attacks against UK businesses over the past two years. Between July and December last year the ICO recorded 1,345 “cybersecurity incidents”, including ransomware attacks, where assailants demand payment in cryptocurrency to decrypt a target’s computers, and phishing attacks, where the victim is tricked, often via email, into downloading malware or handing over their login details. This represented an increase of nearly 20% on the same period in 2019, according to the ICO data. “They may be from state actors as part of an offensive or they may be organised crime or they may be some nuisance vandal hackers. It doesn’t matter. What we need to keep doing is with the NCSC [National Cyber Security Centre] and the National Crime Agency amplify the message that cybersecurity is not a question of do it once and forget it. It’s about all-the-time vigilance.” Edwards said the ICO had yet to see warnings of Russian cyber retaliation for UK support of Ukraine come to fruition, but companies should check their cybersecurity, including reminding employees to report suspicious emails rather than just deleting them. The NCSC said before the Russian invasion began that UK firms should “build resilience and stay ahead of potential threats”. “I haven’t seen those threats being realised,” Edwards said. “But it is a time for vigilance, for checking security settings and making sure those servers are patched and up to date, reminding staff of basic email hygiene and of scepticism to phishing attacks. And of the need of not just to curl your lip and hit delete but to notify your IT department and get these things blocked so one of your colleagues doesn’t inadvertently open the organisation to a vulnerability.” Edwards, who was New Zealand’s privacy commissioner before moving to the UK, said companies could be exposed to penalties, which can include multimillion-pound fines, if they did not take adequate measures against attacks. The ICO’s remit is to help ensure organisations protect people’s data while enforcing data protection regulation. “If it’s the equivalent of leaving the front door open with a whole lot of other people’s stuff inside, really for anyone to walk away with, then we’ll maybe look at the regulatory options that we have and the penalties that are available,” Edwards said.",News/Technology,UK data watchdog urges vigilance amid heightened cyber threat,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/04/uk-data-watchdog-urges-vigilance-amid-heightened-cyber-threat
3/4/2022,"A dinosaur that sported spine-like plates along its back is one of the earliest stegosaurs yet discovered, fossil hunters have revealed, and they say the find could shed light on the evolution of some of the most famous dinosaurs to roam Earth. The stegosaur, which has been named Bashanosaurus primitivus in a nod to the ancient name of the region in China in which it was found in 2016 and its position on the stegosaur family tree, is thought to have lived about 168m years ago. The discovery makes the animal an early cousin of stegosaurus, which lived about 150m years ago and had a stocky build, spiked tail and huge kite-shaped plates down its back. Dr Susannah Maidment, of the Natural History Museum in London and a co-author of the study, said Bashanosaurus would have looked rather different. “It has this bizarre mix of features that we commonly see in quite primitive armoured dinosaurs,” she said. “Bashanosaurus doesn’t have these great big flashy, massive giant plates – very, very thin plates – that stegosaurus has, it has much smaller plates, and they’re quite spine-like really. “Maybe Bashanosaurus’s armour was actually more useful as body armour – it could have used it to defend itself – whereas stegosaurus’s armour [was]… probably for display.” The new specimen was found to differ from other stegosaurs in a number of features, including having thicker plates that curve outwards at their base. It is thought Bashanosaurus measured about 2.8 metres in length – a relatively small size, although the team note it is not clear if the fossils are from an adult or juvenile. Maidment said that while it could often be difficult to work out when such creatures lived, as fossils cannot be dated directly, the team was able to pin down the age of the stegosaur as volcanic minerals were found above and below the fossilised remains. The upshot was that Bashanosaurus could be dated to the Middle Jurassic, and it appears to be the oldest stegosaur yet found in Asia. Maidment said the latest discovery, which is published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, shed new light on how species of stegosaurus evolved. “They must have lost a lot of armour on their back. They developed these big plates and spines, and lots of other niche features of their anatomy changed as well,” she said. “The more we find these very early stegosaurs, that fills in the gap in our understanding.” Maidment said the discovery of Bashanosaurus, and other early stegosaurs in Africa, Argentina and Asia, also provided insights into the origins of such creatures. “They’re already worldwide, and they’re already quite diverse, by this relatively early point in the Middle Jurassic,” she said. “That really indicates to us that they must have evolved right back into the early Jurassic.” While the study suggests Bashanosaurus supports the idea stegosaurs may first have emerged in Asia, Maidment said the jury was still out, noting it was necessary to further investigate rocks from around the world. Prof Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said Bashanosaurus gave a glimpse of the earliest evolution of the stegosaurs. “It tells us that the big stegosaurs evolved from older, smaller ancestors with a more generalised body plan, with less gaudy plates and spikes,” he said. “These stegosaurs go all the way back to the Middle Jurassic, around 170m years ago, and were part of a wave of worldwide dinosaur diversification at that time, as the supercontinent of Pangea was breaking apart.” Michael Benton, a professor of vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Bristol, described the find as a great new discovery, adding that the specimen was quite complete. “The new find pushes the age [of stegosaurs] back a little, and reflects a time of rapid evolution among dinosaurs following the end-Triassic mass extinction event 201m years ago,” he said, adding the first armoured dinosaurs emerged soon after that crisis, and included Scelidosaurus from the Lower Jurassic of Lyme Regis – a creature that came before the subsequent split of armoured dinosaurs into ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. “Tracking the steps in this process is important and the new fossil helps plug a gap,” he said.",News/Science,Early stegosaur fossils may shed light on stegosaurus evolution,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/04/early-stegosaur-fossils-may-shed-light-on-stegosaurus-evolution

3/4/2022,"Britain’s economic growth will halve this year as a result of soaring inflation, hefty tax rises and the destabilising shock from the war in Ukraine, a leading business lobby group has warned. In the first major forecast of the UK economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it expected an inflation rate of 8% to cut disposable incomes in 2022, putting the brakes on the recovery from the pandemic. In its previous forecast, the BCC expected GDP to expand by 4.2%, but after a wide ranging review it said growth would fall to 3.6% – less than half the 7.5% expansion in national income seen last year. The BCC said the size of the economy would surpass its pre-pandemic level over the next few months, but was likely to struggle as consumer confidence, which collapsed last month as the full weight of the cost of living crisis became clear, dropped further over the coming months. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said he now expected inflation to peak at 8% and interest rates to increase to 1.5%, adding to the burden on households and companies, already battered by two years of Covid. “Our latest forecast signals a significant deterioration in the UK’s economic outlook,” he said. He described the effects of rising inflation, supply chain disruption and higher taxes as having a suffocating effect on the UK economy that would see growth “run out of steam in the coming months”. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is likely to weigh on activity by exacerbating the current inflationary squeeze on consumers and businesses and increasing bottlenecks in global supply chains,” he said. The downgrade largely reflects a deteriorating outlook for consumer spending and a weaker than expected rebound in business investment, he added. Unlike in the US and most other European economies, Rishi Sunak’s attempts to boost investment using tax breaks and subsidies have failed. Last year business investment declined despite the offer of a 130% tax break on spending on new plant, machinery and technology. Business investment is forecast to grow at 3.5% in 2022, the BCC said. “This is down from the previous forecast of 5.1% and materially lower than the Bank of England’s latest projection of 13.75%.” The anaemic increases in business investment will mean it remains 6% lower than its pre-pandemic level by the end of 2024. UK exports are expected to remain 13.7% (or £25.5bn) lower than their pre-pandemic level by the end of 2024, reflecting “the impact of post-Brexit trade friction and a weakening global outlook on demand for UK goods and services”. Consumer confidence fell last month to lows not seen since the third lockdown in January 2021, according to the latest GfK survey. The BCC said consumer spending would grow in 2022, but at a much slower pace than it forecast last year. It estimated consumers would spend at 4.4% more than in 2021, down from its previous forecast of 6.9%. Analysts at Bank of America said last week that UK households could suffer the biggest annual decline in their living standards since the 1950s after the sharp rise in energy prices. With inflation already at the highest rate for 30 years, the analysts said a sustained rise for wholesale oil and gas markets due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine could trigger a drop in household real incomes of 3.1% in 2022 compared with a year earlier – the biggest annual drop since at least 1956, the year of the Suez crisis. The BCC said it expected inflation to outpace wage growth until the second quarter of 2024, making the squeeze on household finances even worse than the most pessimistic predictions. Some economists have argued that better off households, who have saved around £220bn during the pandemic, would use those savings to boost spending over the next year, but Thiru said the decline in consumer confidence would “limit households’ willingness to empty their deposit accounts",News/Business,UK’s economic growth to halve this year says British Chambers of Commerce,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/uks-economic-growth-to-halve-this-year-says-british-chambers-of-commerce
3/4/2022,"Seventy works by Picasso and more than 100 by 50 of his contemporaries will be heading to the National Gallery of Victoria, in an exclusive new exhibition that will open 10 June as part of the Winter Masterpieces program. Several years in the making, The Picasso Century will be curated by the deputy director of France’s National Museum of Modern Art, Didier Ottinger. The show will chart Picasso’s impact on the 20th century through his relationships with other artists, poets and intellectuals, as well as the impact of the century’s events on him. “He is the key man for the century,” Ottinger said. “This show is about how a genius like Picasso could become a genius – he was in touch with everyone. The purpose of this show is to see Picasso’s work develop, from when he arrived in Paris as an impoverished artist, to the end of his life when he was living in the south of France.” Despite both museums being in Paris, The Picasso Century is the first ever collaboration between France’s Museum of Modern Art, which is in the Pompidou Centre, and the Musée Picasso. Both are sending works to Melbourne. The exhibition will include significant Picasso works such as Reclining woman (1932), The violin (1914) and Portrait of a woman (1938). It will also feature works by artists including Georges Braque, Salvador Dalí, Henri Matisse and Dorothea Tanning, as well as artists rarely shown in Australia – if ever – such as Natalia Goncharova, Wifredo Lam and Maria Helena Vieira da Silva. The exhibition will also shed light on the Spanish artist’s interactions with intellectuals André Breton, Georges Bataille and Gertrude Stein. Spread over 15 themed areas, it will include a room on Picasso’s relationship with communism, another on the Spanish civil war (his anti-war stance most famously captured in his 1937 masterpiece Guernica), and one about the creation of cubism, a movement pioneered by Picasso and Braque. But uniting the show will be Picasso’s notorious ability to absorb influences and ideas from the world around him, Ottinger said. The NGV’s senior curator of international exhibition projects, Miranda Wallace, said Picasso is widely accepted as a genius. “But you cannot have genius in isolation,” she said. “It is nurtured and prompted by the places, people and the context of how the artist is working and living. Picasso was like a sponge, absorbing everything around him.” His contemporary, the Romanian artist Constantin Brâncuși, was less kind. “Picasso is a cannibal,” he once said, describing Picasso’s remarkable if irritating ability to recreate the works of others with his own flair. Picasso biographer John Richardson once wrote: “After a pleasurable day in Picasso’s company, those present were apt to end up suffering from collective nervous exhaustion. Picasso had made off with their energy and would go off to his studio and spend all night living off it.” Picasso’s sculptures will be shown alongside those of Julio Gonzalez and Alberto Giacometti, to demonstrate how he fed off the work of others. “Brâncuși thought that Picasso would be making Brâncuși sculptures the next day, but maybe better,” Wallace said. “That’s what everyone said – he steals but then he makes it better. He was a fascinating figure in that regard.” While Covid has seen exhibitions shut early and artworks on loan trapped in lockdowns around the world, the NGV didn’t struggle to put this show together, due to the sheer logistics that were involved in securing the Picasso works before the pandemic. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “We started getting the loans lined up five years ago, because so many of these works are in demand for exhibitions around the world,” said Wallace. “In Europe, they constantly have a Picasso show in many countries at one time. So to get them all reserved for one exhibition took lots of planning. “We know that we won’t get the international visitation probably that we would have had in normal times. But for our local audiences, who are unable to travel as much or less willing to travel to Europe, I think they will be very delighted to see some of these works that they would otherwise be hoping to see in Paris.” The NGV exhibition comes two years after Matisse & Picasso, a major show at the National Gallery of Art in Canberra, was forced to close early due to the pandemic. It has been 16 years since the NGV’s last Picasso show, which focused on his relationship with artist and muse Dora Maar. These days, a Picasso show is sure to be met with more fanfare in Australia than decades previous. In 1939, Keith Murdoch – Rupert Murdoch’s father – sponsored an exhibition of about 200 contemporary European artworks, including pieces by Picasso, Matisse and Vincent Van Gogh. It was shown in Melbourne town hall because the NGV couldn’t make space for it, then travelled to Sydney where the Art Gallery of NSW declined to host it. Picasso, along with the other artists, was displayed in the David Jones department store on George Street instead.
