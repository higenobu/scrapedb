4/26/2022,"More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine and millions more have been internally displaced since the start of the Russian invasion. But volunteers have also been coordinating daily rescue missions to save thousands of the country’s non-human population too – pets, farm animals and zoo animals. Dogs follow a volunteer at Korchuvate shelter, Kyiv Organisations such as the Polish Centaurus Foundation, the Ukrainian Equestrian Federation, or the Lviv animal shelter are trying to save animals from the war on a daily basis. A view of Borodianka, a town north-west of Kyiv, destroyed by Russian fire. They have a large and valuable army of volunteers, as well as funding through online crowdfunding and private donations. It is impossible to determine how many animals have been moved or made it out of the country since the start of the war. What is certain is that there are numerous daily departures to EU countries in public transport, vans, trucks, and private cars. Patrick, a driver with Centaurus Foundation, came to Ukraine as a volunteer to fight alongside the Ukrainian army but was rejected. He did not want to return home and has been helping animals and people between Ukraine and Poland for about a month. Left: a dog stretches its paw in an attempt to catch people’s attention; a volunteer carries a dog, both inside a makeshift shelterat Kyiv hippodrome. I joined a convoy run by Polish Centaurus Foundation of seven vehicles, made up of people of four different nationalities. It was delivering food and veterinary surgical supplies in Kyiv. The mission was the extraction of the surviving dogs from a shelter in Borodianka, a town north-east of Kyiv that came under severe bombardment. A young lion from Kharkiv Ecopark, saved from euthanasia, is transferred to its new home in a wildlife sanctuary. Nataliya Popova from UAnimals, and her partner, look pleased as they unload food and veterinary medicines for the wildlife centre. Another animal organisation that works tirelessly in the rescue, care and extraction of animals is UAnimals, a Ukrainian organisation that since the beginning of the war has coordinated volunteers. One volunteer, Nataliya Popova, after seeing how animals from zoos and reserves were abandoned to starve or were euthanised, turned her equine centre on the outskirts of Kyiv into a wildlife refuge. More than 100 animals from there have been evacuated to zoos and reserves in Romania or Poland since the beginning of the war. Among them were seven bears, four tigers and three lions from the bombed Ecopark in Kharkiv. A wild deer at the makeshift wildlife shelter near Kyiv; a monkey taken from a circus in Lviv. Numerous other animals have been found wandering around the various villages recaptured from invading forces; some were starving, eating anything they could find, others were wounded or frightened and confused by the sounds of the explosions. Many were hiding in their homes, where there was no one left. Zenia, a three-year-old cat whose owner had to flee the village of Andriivka, near Bucha. She survived burns and starvation. Ken Dillo, a former paramedic from the US Marines, provided first aid to Zenia, who was later reunited with her human family. To the west, the city of Lviv has become a centre of animal rescue and evacuation operations, mainly due to the fact it is the closest city to the border with Poland. A dog in a cage rests at Lviv animal sanctuary. Located far from the frontline, Lviv has become a safe place for people displaced by the conflict. And so too for animals, such as the bears from the White Rock sanctuary in Kyiv, where there was a reserve for them, many taken from circuses, which have now been transferred to a shelter near Lviv. Or the dogs, cats and wild animals that stop for a few days at the animal shelter in Lviv, where they are cared for by volunteers who look after them, feed them, walk them and give them affection, while in their offices the necessary bureaucratic steps are taken for their transfer out the country.",News/World news,The volunteers saving animals in Ukraine – photo essay,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/the-volunteers-saving-animals-in-ukraine-photo-essay
4/26/2022,"Three games from the summit: now for The Cartel. It is a key element of elite football’s febrile brand of double-think that the richest club in the world can still portray themselves as underdogs, outsiders, thieves in the temple. As Manchester City contemplate their Champions League semi-final first leg against the imperial meringues of Real Madrid on Tuesday night, there is still that lurking sense of novelty, of an entity that is, on some level, forcing its way in from the outside. “It is an honour to be here in the semi-final against Real Madrid,” Pep Guardiola said at his pre‑match press conference, doffing his cloth cap and presenting his chipped enamel mug for another helping of turnip soup. “In the last decade we start to be here and it is an honour. We try to do a good game.” And so here they come, the nowhere boys: beating down the mahogany-panelled doors of the shadowy elite, cartwheeling across the dining tables like sky blue Spice Girls – and doing all this mainly by spending €433m a year on salaries, hiring the greatest coach in the world, setting their lawyers against anyone in their path and trying to join a super league. It should be noted that Manchester City’s supporters have largely dropped the cartel stuff over the past year. It is a logical move given City have tried and failed to join an anti-sport cartel of their own. The European Super League may have stalled under the weight of its own tin-eared incompetence but it remains a handy guide to how the super-rich really feel about stitch-ups and closed shops. Deeply unhappy when they are left out of one. But absolutely delighted to be included. It is on the pitch that the Citizens versus Royals dynamic still has some way to travel. City may be favourites for this competition. They may have the most powerfully balanced group of players in European football. But the fact remains that not one member of the current squad has ever won the Champions League (Real have at least a dozen former winners). And even in its current ageing iteration there is something gloriously, stupidly compelling about the optics, the enrage, the cultural weight of Madrid on these occasions. City have fewer flaws. City are a better, more coherently constructed team. But Real Madrid are Real Madrid. Here is a club capable of winning these moments simply through presence, vibes, will to power. Being Real Madrid. It is not much of a tactic. But you try doing it. When it comes to match-ups, and indeed the area where these games will surely be settled, that sense of elite outsider-dom is dramatised best in central midfield. Kevin De Bruyne will be City’s joint longest-serving player if Fernandinho leaves at the end of the season. But De Bruyne remains an oddity too, the component in this City collective who comes closest to the role of superstar, individualist and one‑man magic bullet. It is a studied kind of freedom. De Bruyne has licence to make riskier passes, to shoot and surge and break his own team’s lines simply because he is so good at all of these things, because doing them at this level of efficiency makes his team more likely to win. Odd, then, to think of him as an underrated player outside these shores. Successive PFA player of the year awards are a mark of how cherished De Bruyne is in England, where it has become routine to refer to him as the best midfielder in Europe. He regularly makes those Uefa teams of the year. But there is still something missing here, the kind of ultimacy only this stage can deliver. Does the rest of Europe really get De Bruyne? His best years have brought him an eighth, a ninth and a pair of 14ths in the Ballon d’Or standings. Uefa’s obscure statistical rankings have him as the 56th best player in the Champions League this season, a figure that demonstrates little more than its own inanity, but which is significant for one reason. Even here De Bruyne is ranked below Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, direct opponents on Tuesday night, and the most gilded central midfield pairing of the age. De Bruyne is six years younger than Modric and 18 months younger than Kroos. He is unarguably a more rounded player than the latter. But Modric-Kroos remains the standard, the defining central midfielders of the past decade of the Champions League. This kind of comparison can often fall apart under any kind of scrutiny. Games at this level are decided on matters such as fitness and form, tactical tweaks, luck, destiny, the efforts of others. But the fact remains that sense of ultimacy has been hard-earned. Kroos and Modric have four Champions League medals apiece, and even now they just keep on coming. In the quarter-final second leg against Chelsea it was in central midfield that Madrid finally asserted just enough pull, albeit only once Kroos had left the pitch looking spent. Chelsea never did quite have the craft to dominate that area, despite their physical edge. Ten minutes before Modric delivered the decisive goalscoring pass to Rodrygo Madrid’s 36‑year‑old 5ft 6in dynamo could be seen splayed on the Bernabéu turf as Ruben Loftus-Cheek veered around him like a man absent‑mindedly dodging a stray traffic cone. At that moment one feared slightly for Modric. He winced, got up and chased back. He knows this is going to happen. His entire career has been spent as a welterweight in a land of giants. But he remains utterly plugged in, able to regulate every part of a game from tempo and passing rhythms, and to springing the kind of press City will attempt to apply with a shimmy of the hips. De Bruyne has had his moments in this company. He strolled around Kroos and Modric in the last-16 tie between these teams two years ago. He is if anything a more mature, versatile presence now, a midfielder so good he can decide to pack away for a couple of months a skill others would build a career around – those forensic deep crosses from the right – in order to fill a role as a false No 9 or a central conductor. The next week feels like a step closer to the summit; and a perfect moment for De Bruyne to show his own champions’ qualities against legacy-defining opponents.",Sport/Football,De Bruyne holds key to Manchester City’s hopes of toppling ‘The Cartel’ | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/26/de-bruyne-holds-key-to-manchester-citys-hopes-of-toppling-the-cartel
4/26/2022,"This is not a golden era for women writing love songs about men. With the exception of Lana Del Rey, the last decade of female-fronted pop has been defined by revenge anthems and breakup bangers, with “dump him” a common refrain. But Suki Waterhouse isn’t sold. “I find the whole ‘dump him’ thing very toxic,” she whispers into her oat milk latte in a quiet nook of Notting Hill’s Electric cinema in west London. “I get it, but it’s important not to underestimate how incredible it is to be with somebody. And also how yummy and wonderful masculinity can be when it’s the good kind, when it’s warm and protecting … ” She pauses, smiling knowingly. “Anyway, let’s not go on that tangent!” This week, Waterhouse is releasing her debut album, I Can’t Let Go, through Sub Pop. Produced by Brad Cook, the man Pitchfork called “indie’s secret weapon” (he has worked on albums by Bon Iver and the War on Drugs), it is 10 tracks of sweeping Americana, with heart-on-sleeve lyrics that land somewhere between Taylor Swift’s simplicity and Del Rey’s fatalism (“I believe in old-fashioned things / Imagining us,” she sings on the lead single, Melrose Meltdown). “So much of my life has been this weird blur,” says Waterhouse, running her hands through her hair – dishevelled but somehow still immaculate. I ask whether romance is the biggest force behind her songwriting. “It’s literally how I remember everything,” she says. “Who I was in love with at the time, how we broke up, and what happened after.” Waterhouse has been in the public eye since she was 16, starting her career as a model in the late 2000s. For more than a decade she has been a fixture on runways and magazine covers, a bona fide “it girl”, regularly papped with her friends and fellow models Adwoa Aboah and Cara Delevingne. Then there’s the acting career, which has seen her appear in a mishmash of blockbuster romcoms (Love, Rosie), cult black comedies (Assassination Nation) and documentary-style TV series (the upcoming Daisy Jones & the Six). Throw in a photography exhibition here, an accessories brand there – not to mention a slew of high-profile relationships with the likes of Bradley Cooper, Diego Luna and, currently, the Batman himself, Robert Pattinson. It is hard not to feel that this latest addition to her pop-cultural portfolio is a little … low stakes? “I’m really aware that it’s like: ‘Oh, you’ve done modelling, you’ve done acting, and now you’re gonna give me this album.’ I’m really wary of people just being like: ‘Fuck off!’” she admits. “I totally get it.” Waterhouse turned 30 in January. The celebrations were low key – dinner with a friend followed by a “girly evening” in a hotel room with margaritas – but the milestone helped to quash some of her anxieties around releasing music. “I think I was carrying a lot of shame around myself for a long time,” she says. As a model, Waterhouse is used to people looking at her, but not so used to being seen. For years she felt “muted” and “quiet”, struggling to know how to connect to herself and others. She tried to start bands at school in west London,, west London, after she got her first guitar around the age of 13, but no one would turn up for practice. Her father, a cosmetic surgeon, and mother, a cancer care nurse, didn’t gift her with the “knowledge of music”, either. Her love of music developed in tandem with modelling. It was an era when the two worlds were intertwined; when Kate Moss and Pete Doherty were constantly hanging out of windows. “Whatever was going on, I was prepared to take an hour-long bus ride and walk 30 minutes in a pair of seven-inch heels,” she says. Even then her role was more observant, being unable to see a way into music for herself. “A lot of the last few years has been me coming out of a time where I was trying to escape the need to fill these voids, and starting to look at myself and my own sabotage,” she says. To that end she has been testing the waters at the rate of approximately one song a year since 2016, unsure if there would even be any appetite for them, although the comments under her YouTube videos are full of fans gushing over her “retro vibes” and “gorgeous voice”. Rather than manifesting a sudden burst of confidence, I Can’t Let Go came together like a photo album: snapshots of different times, places and people. The breathy acoustic track Slip was written during a trip to Montreal, where she went to work with a chef-cum-musician on the recommendation of someone she met on a night out; the reverb-heavy ballad My Mind was written during the pandemic in her west London flat, where building work meant the windows were blacked out for months; Melrose Meltdown was inspired not by the trip she took with a friend to Bhutan (“We were drinking too much and feeling a bit shit”), but by a text she read on the plane home. “She was showing me some messages and I was moved by her alcoholic ex-boyfriend, who’s really quite a good poet in a way.” The album has a rose-tinted energy, with restrained backdrops that marry 60s girl-group sentiments with dreamy modern pop and lyrics that would be at home on early 2010s Tumblr – there’s plenty of “crying on your milk-white sheets” and getting “faded into oblivion”. It’s very two drinks into an evening, when emotions are generous and arise as if out of nowhere. “I definitely approached it thinking quite cinematically,” she says, citing Thelma & Louise and Fruits of My Labor by the country singer Lucinda Williams as inspirations for her goal of making something that “sounds good in the middle of the desert”. Fittingly for the subject matter, the space they were meant to record in fell through and they ended up in a wedding hall, with Cook and members of Bon Iver bringing Waterhouse’s demos to life in a bridesmaids’ room crowded with makeup lights and “Live, Laugh, Love” cushions. “I think that struggle to connect is what this has all come from,” she says, “and this is how I want to tell people about myself: through music. For me it’s just the best way.” I Can’t Let Go is out now on Sub Pop.",Arts/Music,Suki Waterhouse: ‘I was carrying a lot of shame around myself for a long time’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/26/suki-waterhouse-i-was-carrying-a-lot-of-shame-around-myself-for-a-long-time
4/26/2022,"I’m a 70-year-old man who enjoys sex and intimacy, but my wife, who is 65, feels she is too old for this. We sleep in the same bed but keep the pooch and pillows between us. Talking is useless and always becomes a blame thing. She has occasionally said “Well, go ahead,” as if that will work. At my age I require foreplay – which I enjoy giving as well as getting. It’s been years since we’ve been intimate. For a while we would couple up on birthdays or new years, but then that stopped, too. We have both lost a lot of weight and things are sagging and wrinkly. I think part of the problem was, during intimacy, she would notice me finding a bump or wrinkle that she felt self-conscious about. The insight you expressed in your last sentence may be the key, so you might do well to start there. Poor body image and self-loathing are often responsible for lowered sexual interest. And one of the most powerful predictors of our level of desire is who we feel ourselves to be in the context of our partner.

4/26/2022,"Elon Musk’s $44bn takeover of Twitter and his promises to revamp the social media platform have reignited debate about whether it’s time to leave the website permanently. But is that too hasty? How do you leave? And where would you go? It seems every few months there’s a wave of people announcing they are quitting Twitter. Some do it permanently, while others make the big announcement only to return weeks or months later. The latest push has come in response to Musk’s purchase of the platform, with some concerned it will allow misinformation, disinformation, abuse and hate speech to flourish on the website more than it already does. Musk has suggested he is a “free speech absolutist”. There has been speculation over who and what will be allowed back on Twitter, including whether former US president Donald Trump will return to the platform, although he has already hosed down that talk. Australian lobby group Digital Rights Watch has expressed concern that while Musk claims the takeover is about free speech, it’s actually about power. “While free speech is important, you have to account for asymmetries of power and other barriers that stop people from speaking freely,” chair Lizzie O’Shea said. “Musk’s style of free speech absolutism will tilt the scales in favour of the rich and powerful who can silence or bully critics. What Musk really seems to want is freedom from accountability. “Musk’s proposed approach to content moderation will likely make Twitter a less safe place for many people to speak freely while allowing powerful disinformation and propaganda campaigns to spread unchecked.” Electronic Frontiers Foundation said any move away from allowing anonymous accounts on the platform would have the effect of reducing free speech. “Pseudonymity and anonymity are essential to protecting users who may have opinions, identities, or interests that do not align with those in power,” EFF said. “Political dissidents may be in grave danger if those in power are able to discover their true identities.” Twitter is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Aside from Musk, who had a stake of just under 10% before this deal, the major shareholders were largely investment firms. The Twitter board includes the current chief executive, Parag Agrawal, the former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, and Salesforce’s co-CEO Bret Taylor as chair. It is a dramatic response when so much is unknown about what Musk intends to do with the service. If you’ve stuck with what many people call “the hell site” for this long, it’s questionable whether Musk taking it over will be some sort of final straw. Apart from some general tweets around defeating spam bots, having human authentication, an edit button, open-source algorithms and what he says will be free speech, we don’t know yet what Musk plans to do with Twitter. If you’re set on leaving Twitter, you can first deactivate your account for 30 days before it is permanently deleted. The easiest way to do that is through the “Settings and privacy” tab in the menu of the Twitter app. Go to “Your account” and then “Deactivate your account”. If you go via the Twitter website, you follow the same prompts from the “More” tab. If you don’t log back into your account within 30 days, your account is permanently deleted, and people can register an account with your username from that time. The Guardian asked Twitter what data was retained once a user permanently deletes their account. A spokesperson pointed to the company’s privacy page, which details what data is kept on active users, but does not outline what is retained once an account is deleted. If you want to keep a record of your tweets and other activity on Twitter, you can download your archive from Twitter before you deactivate your account. It really comes down to why you used Twitter in the first place. If it is just for breaking news, then you might want to sign up to push alerts from media companies or through the various news apps on your phone. There’s always Reddit, where you can find subreddits devoted to topics and communities you’re interested in. An open source version of Twitter, called Mastodon, is often touted as an alternative, but it is much more fragmented, with people signing up for specific topics or communities. The main problem Twitter replicas have had is reaching the scale of Twitter – more than 200 million users – so it’s hard to say whether anyone leaving will find something that is the ideal replacement. It’s partially why Musk might have been motivated to buy Twitter rather than starting his own social media site, like others, including Trump, have attempted.",News/Technology,"Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover: what will change, is free speech at risk and should you delete the app?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-bought-buys-what-will-change-is-free-speech-at-risk
4/26/2022,"Jeff Bezos has questioned whether China will lean on Elon Musk’s Tesla business to quell criticism of the country on Twitter. The world’s second richest man posted a tweet raising concerns over potential Beijing influence on Twitter several hours after the Tesla CEO, and current holder of the number one wealth spot, reached a $44bn deal with the Twitter board to buy the influential social media platform. Bezos quoted a post from a New York Times reporter that listed the importance of China to Tesla’s business, including the fact that it is the electric car maker’s second largest business. The tweet said China may now have a way of holding leverage over Twitter. Bezos responded with: “Interesting question. Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?” Musk called Twitter the “digital town square” after striking a deal on Monday and has made his belief in open debate a central purpose for the acquisition. The agreed takeover has triggered debate over the implications of a powerful and wealthy individual, with multiple business interests, owning a platform used by 217 million people that plays a key role in shaping the political and media agenda in the US and elsewhere. Interesting question. Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square? https://t.co/jTiEnabP6T Bezos, the founder and executive chair of Amazon, clarified his comments in subsequent tweets and said any Chinese pressure was unlikely to result in censorship. “My own answer to this question is probably not. The more likely outcome in this regard is complexity in China for Tesla, rather than censorship at Twitter.” He added: “But we’ll see. Musk is extremely good at navigating this kind of complexity.” The Musk takeover has been unexpected and controversial among Twitter employees. Speaking at an all-hands meeting on Monday following news of the deal, Parag Agrawal, the CEO of Twitter, told employees that the future direction of the social network was uncertain. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal said.

4/26/2022,"The proposal of a company owned by Clive Palmer to dig Australia’s largest thermal coalmine in central Queensland is “an attempt at financial gain” that comes with “an obscenely high cost” for future generations, a group challenging the mine’s approval in a landmark climate and human rights challenge has told court. The case, which began in the Queensland land court on Tuesday, has been brought by a group of young people, Youth Verdict, and is led by its First Nations members. The group argues that the Galilee Coal Project proposed by Palmer’s company, Waratah Coal, would cause environmental harm by contributing to global climate change, and in the process limit the cultural rights of First Nations Queenslanders to maintain their distinctive relationships with the land, the court heard. As part of the case, the court will later travel to the Torres Strait to consider the first-hand impacts of climate change. It is the first time the Queensland Human Rights Act, adopted in 2019, has been considered in relation to the impact of a resources project. The Galilee Coal project – formerly called China First – has not progressed since it gained federal environmental approval in late 2013. The proposed mine is about 100km from Adani’s Carmichael project and would require much of its own supporting infrastructure. Waratah Coal plans to build two open-cut pits, four underground mines – removing 40m tonnes a year – and a 453km railway linking the project to the Adani-owned Abbot Point coal terminal near Bowen. The barrister acting for Youth Verdict, Saul Holt QC, said in his opening statement that Waratah Coal was ultimately controlled by a single person and that the proponent had shown it was “prepared to stop and start based on economics”. “The attempt by the proponent at financial gain on the collapsing coal market is not cost free,” Holt said. “It comes at an obscenely high cost and most of that cost will be borne by future generations.” In a brief opening statement, Peter Ambrose QC, acting for Waratah Coal, said “climate change is real” but that the coal at the site was “high-energy producing” and would ultimately result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions. “If the … coal is not brought to market, coal from other sources will supply the market, however long the market exists,” Ambrose told the court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Holt told the court that in Waratah Coal’s own environmental impact statement from more than a decade ago, the company argued the need for the project was based on the “demand for the coal resource.” He said the argument that total global carbon emissions would not be increased by the mine was “false logic”. “The climate scientists have identified possible future scenarios in which humanity ceases burning coal … those scenarios can exist without this coalmine, but they cannot exist with it,” Holt said. “The climate change experts agree … that every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is material, given the state we are in. This mine will contribute more than 2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide [and would be] easily the biggest thermal coalmine operating in Australia, four times the size of Adani’s. “The only way to achieve less than 2C of warming is … if 95% of Australian coal reserves stay in the ground.” He also questioned Waratah’s “assumptions about coal quality, coal quantity, cost and price, which are unclear and inconsistent”.",News/Australia news,First Nations challenge over approval of Clive Palmer’s coalmine begins in Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/first-nations-challenge-over-approval-of-clive-palmers-coalmine-begins-in-queensland
