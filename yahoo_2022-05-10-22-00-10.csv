5/10/2022,"Mark Esper in his new book said Trump skipping Biden's inauguration ""tarnished our democracy."" The former defense secretary blasted Trump for not participating in the peaceful transfer of power. Esper said Trump's refusal to attend the ceremony undermined Biden's ""legitimacy"" among many Americans. On January 20, 2021, a who's who of the most prominent leaders in American government headed to the United States Capitol to attend the inaugural ceremony of Joe Biden, who would assume the presidency that day after a hard-fought election. Even when most modern presidents were unable to secure reelection to a second term, they attended the inauguration of their successors, taking part in a peaceful transfer of power that had long been the envy of many nations around the world. However, President Donald Trump — whose campaign team vigorously contested the results before Biden took office and who continues to make unfounded claims that the election was ""stolen"" from him — decided to skip the inaugural, departing the White House early that morning en route to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland before heading to his Mar-a-Lago residence in South Florida. Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper — who served under Trump as Navy secretary from 2017 to 2019 and in his aforementioned role from 2019 until his November 2020 termination by the former president – was not happy about the situation, as he detailed in his recently-released book, ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times."" Esper, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, said Trump's decision to forgo attending the ceremony undermined Biden's standing with a wide swath of the public. ""Donald Trump did not even bother to attend the Inauguration — the first sitting and able president to skip his successor's inauguration since 1869,"" he wrote in his book, which released on Tuesday. ""It was a final act of petulance that defied tradition, tarnished our democracy, and further damaged Biden's legitimacy with millions of Americans."" Esper also noted the military's role in the inaugural activities, which was heightened in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the same Capitol complex where the main ceremony was held. After the riot, fencing with barbed wire was installed around the historic building to provide an additional layer of security. ""The military played its traditional part in the peaceful transfer of power, however — providing honor cordons and military bands to welcome the new president and vice president — while also securing the city from those misguided Trump true believers who might want to interrupt the sanctity of a peaceful, orderly, democratic transfer of power,"" he wrote. During the ceremony, Esper said he felt relief that Trump — whom he was highly critical of his memoir — would be replaced with a new leader. ""I sat at home, watching carefully, eagerly, and finally, both pleased and relieved that we had made it — the nation made it,"" he wrote. ""We had a new commander in chief.""

5/10/2022,"NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France (Reuters) - The Russian military's failure to seize the Ukrainian capital was inevitable because in the preceding years they had never directly faced a powerful enemy, according to a former mercenary with the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group who fought alongside the Russian army. Marat Gabidullin took part in Wagner Group missions on the Kremlin's behalf in Syria and in a previous conflict in Ukraine, before deciding to go public about his experience inside the secretive private military company. He quit the Wagner group in 2019, but several months before Russia launched the invasion on Feb. 24 Gabidullin, 55, said he received a call from a recruiter who invited him to go back to fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. He refused, in part because, he said, he knew Russian forces were not up to the job, even though they trumpeted their arsenal of new weapons and their successes in Syria where they helped President Bashar al-Assad defeat an armed rebellion. ""They were caught completely by surprise that the Ukrainian army resisted so fiercely and that they faced the actual army,"" Gabidullin said about Russia's setbacks in Ukraine. He said people he spoke to on the Russian side had told him they expected to face rag-tag militias when they invaded Ukraine, not well-drilled regular troops. ""I told them: 'Guys, that's a mistake',"" said Gabidullin, who is now in France where he is publishing a book about his experiences fighting with the Wagner Group. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know who Gabidullin was and whether he has ever been a member of private military companies. ""We, the state, the government, the Kremlin can not have anything to do with it,"" he said. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Gabidullin is part of a small but growing cohort of people in Russia with security backgrounds who have supported President Vladimir Putin's foreign incursions but now say the way the war is being conducted is incompetent. Igor Girkin, who helped lead a pro-Kremlin armed revolt in eastern Ukraine in 2014, has been critical of the way this campaign is being conducted. Alexei Alexandrov, an architect of the 2014 rebellion, told Reuters in March the invasion was a mistake. Gabidullin took part in some of the bloodiest Syrian clashes in Deir al-Zor province, in Ghouta and near the ancient city of Palmyra. He was seriously injured in 2016 when a grenade exploded behind his back during a battle in the mountains near Latakia. Gabidullin spent a week in a coma and three months in a hospital where he had surgeries to remove one of his kidneys and some intestines. Reuters has independently verified he was in the Wagner Group and was in combat in Syria. Wagner Group fighters have been accused by rights groups and the Ukrainian government of committing war crimes in Syria and eastern Ukraine from 2014 onwards. Gabidullin said he had never been involved in such abuses. DIFFERENT PROPOSITION Moscow's involvement helped turn the tide of the Syrian war in favour of al-Assad, but Gabidullin said Russia's military restricted itself mainly to attacks from the air, while relying on Wagner mercenaries and other proxies to do the lion's share of the fighting on the ground. The Russian military's task was easier too. Its opponents -- Islamic State and other militias -- had no anti-aircraft systems or artillery. Fighting Ukraine, he said, was a different proposition. ""I've seen enough of them in Syria... (The Russian military) didn't take part in combat directly,"" he said in an interview in Paris to promote his book, which will be published by French publishing house Michel Lafon this month. ""The military forces .... when it was needed to learn how to fight, did not learn how to fight for real,"" he said. Wagner Group is an informal entity, with -- on paper at least -- no offices or staff. The U.S. Treasury Department and the European Union have said the Wagner Group is linked to Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin has denied any such links. Concord Management and Consulting, Prigozhin’s main business, did not respond to a request for comment. President Vladimir Putin has said private military contractors have the right to work and pursue their interests anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law. Putin has said the Wagner Group neither represented the Russian state nor was paid by it. Gabidullin said although he had known the Russian invasion of Ukraine was coming, he did not expect it to be on such a scale. ""I could not even think that Russia will wage a war on Ukraine. How could that be? It's impossible,"" he said.

5/10/2022,"Prince Charles stepped in for ailing Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday to open Britain’s Parliament, a deeply symbolic moment in British royal history that gave the clearest glimpse yet of the contours of the post-Elizabethan world. Her Majesty left her decision to Monday afternoon to finally pull the plug on her scheduled role of opening the new legislative session, inevitably sparking fresh concerns that she is considerably more unwell than the palace—which cited “episodic mobility problems”—is letting on. Queen Elizabeth Will Skip Her Own Garden Parties, Stoking Health Fears Notably, Prince Charles, who was decked out in his military uniform, sat on a throne to read the Queen’s Speech (which is actually written by the government but traditionally delivered by the monarch) although it had previously been rumored he would avail of more humble seating options. Her Majesty’s crown rested symbolically on a velvet cushion on a small table next to him. Prince William sat on Charles’ right, wearing a dark morning suit; Camilla, his wife, sat on Charles’ left. They both sat on relatively normal chairs. While the queen would traditionally refer to “my government,” Charles referred to “Her Majesty’s government” throughout the speech. The palace said William and Charles were jointly opening Parliament, in their roles as counselors of state, and that the queen was watching the ceremony on television at Windsor Castle. The decision of Elizabeth to pull out of the event at the last minute has served to deepen national anxiety about her health, which has become a source of much comment since the death of her husband, Prince Philip, last year. The official line is that the queen has “mobility problems”—the terminology was updated in a briefing Monday to become “episodic mobility problems”—but this explanation is increasingly thought to be a major understatement, especially in light of the legal mechanism that the queen used to step away from Tuesday’s commitment: the Regency Act. The only time Britain has had a formal regency is under George III, who was periodically declared insane. George IV, the heir, was made regent and took on all his father’s duties. It is not unprecedented for the monarch not to make the ceremony. The queen has actually missed the state opening of Parliament twice, while she was pregnant, in 1959 (with Anne) and 1963 (with Edward). Queen Victoria regularly skipped this particularly duty, sending the crown on a velvet cushion, just as the queen did today. But an important if slightly obscure point is that on those occasions the monarchs asked a senior parliamentary official to fill in for her, essentially, an ad hoc basis. The big difference concerning Monday’s move was that the queen a) put her heir, Charles, in her place rather than using a mere functionary for the task and b) according to royal historian Robert Hardman, author of the new biography Queen of Our Times, she did so by invoking the Regency Act of 1937 and, specifically, Section 6 (1) which states: “In the event of illness… the Sovereign may… delegate, for the period of that illness or absence… such of the royal functions as may be specified.” Hardman told The Daily Beast: “The last time that an heir to the throne opened Parliament, he was called the Prince Regent, so it is understandable that is how some people are seeing this. But the fact is that a regency is something that is done on behalf of the monarch, and in this case the monarch has laid down the rules and asked for it to be done, which is an important distinction.” Hardman added that the situation is “genuinely unprecedented” and that that “everyone is slightly scrabbling around trying to figure out what happens next.” He pointed out that the new arrangement is not open-ended, it only applies to today. Charles is not now authorized to open Parliament automatically every year—although in truth it’s hard to imagine the queen now ever reprising the role. Despite the constituional niceties, it is not entirely surprising that the invoking of the Regency Act on as important occasion as the opening of Parliament is being seen by many as the first step toward a regency, although this is something Buckingham Palace calmly but robustly denies, insisting the queen still remains very much in charge. In most senses, she is. There is little doubt that her word is the final one. But today’s appearance by the future King Charles III marks an important line in the sand, and a window into what the future of British pomp and circumstance looks like. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/10/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried to revise history on Monday, but was busted by his own past comments. As Fox News footage showed a peaceful protest in favor of abortion rights, Cruz slammed members of the crowd as “goons” and warned of “escalation.” Then, he defended the right-wing mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021: That’s very different from what Cruz has said in the past. Progressive PAC MeidasTouch contrasted Cruz’s words this week with his previous comments about Jan. 6 rioters, who he called “terrorists” who committed a “violent assault on the Capitol.” Earlier this year, Cruz was widely mocked for a “groveling” and “humiliating” appearance on Fox News in which he desperately tried to take back those words. It didn’t go well. “The way I phrased things yesterday it was sloppy and it was frankly dumb,” Cruz told Tucker Carlson during the awkward interview in January. Carlson was unconvinced. “I guess I just don’t believe you,” Carlson said. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

5/10/2022,"By Philip O'Connor and Ilze Filks VISBY, Sweden (Reuters) - The crack of gunshots splits the silence in a sleepy forest as Camilla Selander, a deli-counter worker, squeezes off shots from her Glock 9 millimetre pistol during target practice with Sweden's Home Guard on the island of Gotland. The 34-year-old is one of the volunteers practising at a military firing range on the island, likely to be on the front line of any future confrontation between Russia and Sweden. The island lies just 300 km (186 miles) from the home of Russia's Baltic Fleet in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland. ""People are a bit worried, but we're trying to keep everybody calm, so that we talk about what is happening but nevertheless tell each other that it's going to be fine,"" Selander told Reuters in a break during shooting in the forest of Visborgsslatt. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced Sweden and neighbouring Finland to rethink security policy and whether they can remain safe outside NATO, unprotected by its promise that an attack on any member will be seen as an attack on all. Both countries are expected to decide whether to apply for membership in the 30-nation alliance in May. Gotland, briefly occupied by Russian troops in 1808 during a war that saw Finland for a century fall under the sway of the Tsar, is seen as important to the defence of Sweden and NATO's vulnerable Baltic members Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. ""If the Russians were to occupy parts of Sweden that would create some kind of ... 'wall' that NATO would have to fight its way through before being able to help its Baltic members,"" said Karlis Neretnieks, a former major general and head of Sweden's National Defence College. ""With Sweden in NATO this 'wall' would more or less become a 'road' to help the Baltic states instead."" After withdrawing its forces from Gotland following the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago, Sweden is hastily rebuilding its military presence on the island, a 170 km (105 mile)-long rocky outcrop in the middle of the Baltic Sea that is a popular vacation spot for many Swedes. In 2018, it reactivated the army's Gotland Regiment and it has reinforced the island's defence with ground-to-air missiles and other measures. The build-up is part of a general rearmament sparked by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Sweden's military and government have said they do not believe Russia has plans to invade. But President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine mean few are willing to rely on that assumption for their security and both Sweden and Finland are widely expected to announce they plan to apply for NATO membership. ""In the short term, the military situation would be better for Sweden and for Gotland,"" Colonel Magnus Frykvall of the Gotland Regiment said. ""The threshold effect would be higher for Russia in terms of attacking a NATO country than a country that is not in NATO."" A decision to join would redraw the security map of Northern Europe, creating a largely unbroken band of NATO states across the continent from the Arctic to the Black Sea. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto is expected to give his support on May 12, pressuring Sweden to follow suit. An all-party review of Sweden's security policy will report on May 13 and the ruling Social Democrats - long opposed to joining the alliance - are expected to come out in favour of membership days later. For the people of Gotland, whose scenic coastline is dotted with disused machine gun nests from World War Two, recent months have brought a sense of a return to a bygone era, when its strategic importance on a Cold War frontier was never doubted. ""Gotland,"" said retired officer Rutger Banholtz, a former head of the Home Guard. ""It is an aircraft carrier."" ""He who sits in Gotland controls large parts of the Baltic Sea.""
