1/14/2022,"It has taken a year and a half but the UK economy has now regained the ground lost during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. A better than anticipated performance last November means national output is now 0.7% higher than it was in February 2020. Other countries reached this milestone sooner, with the US for example already operating well above its previous peak. Even so, Britain has experienced what economists call a V-shaped recession, with a precipitous drop in activity in March and April 2020 followed by a brisk – if occasionally interrupted – recovery.  That pattern is explained by the nature of the Covid shock. Governments imposed lockdowns in an attempt to prevent the virus spreading, and once the restrictions were eased businesses that had been closed reopened and economies bounced back. The UK economy contracted by less during the financial crisis of 2008-09 than it did in 2020 but took much longer to regain the lost ground. November’s 0.9% monthly increase in output was due to a combination of factors: the easing of supply chain bottlenecks that had been hitting manufacturing and construction firms; consumers shopping early for Christmas; and people feeling more confident about going out to enjoy themselves. The arrival of the Omicron variant has muddied the waters. It looks inevitable that output fell in December owing to widespread staff absences, the introduction of the government’s plan B restrictions and individuals becoming more cautious. January will be another tough month so the chances are that the economy will fall back below its February 2020 peak. If, as expected, the government decides to ease restrictions in England later this month, output will recover again in February and March. But as Paul Dales, of Capital Economics notes, April will see the economy hit by a double whammy of rocketing energy bills and higher taxes. As is often the case with the UK economy, it will be one step forward, one step back.",News/Business,Omicron likely to slow UK bounceback from economic Covid shock,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/omicron-likely-to-slow-uk-bounceback-from-economic-covid-shock
1/14/2022,"As panto season draws to an end, Britain’s theatres are counting the cost of another Christmas wrecked by Covid, with cancelled shows decimating income during a traditionally lucrative period. York Theatre Royal’s Cinderella – whose star and understudy both had to self-isolate – cancelled 12 performances with an estimated loss of up to £200,000. Theatr Clwyd’s Beauty and the Beast achieved ticket sales comparable to pre-Covid times but the Welsh government’s Covid restrictions, introduced on Boxing Day, led the venue to cancel all remaining performances, worth an estimated £500,000. At Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph theatre, almost half of Jack and the Beanstalk’s run was lost because of coronavirus cases in the company; now the theatre hopes to attract viewers to an online version this month.  Liverpool Everyman’s rock’n’roll pantomime Robin Hood, which ends this Saturday, had almost a third of performances cancelled, amounting to at least £100,000 in ticket income – never mind the lost ice-cream sales. Christmas was a critical period, said its CEO, Mark Da Vanzo. The financial success of the panto, postponed from 2020, “underpins the rest of the artistic programme throughout the year”. Robin Hood’s first week was cancelled because Covid cases prevented the set from being supplied in time. An additional 15 shows were lost owing to cast and crew illness. “If we get through to Saturday, we’ll have delivered 50 shows out of a planned 71,” said Da Vanzo. “That’s pretty good going considering everything we’ve had to face with Omicron and the isolation rules.” The cast included two “swing” performers, who fill in for other roles when required, and an understudy was available to cover. Without them, “we’d have lost even more shows”, said Da Vanzo. “Once Covid got into the company, it was very hard to stop it transmitting.” The Christmas season at the Everyman and its sister theatre Liverpool Playhouse was supported by a grant of £283,599 from Arts Council England’s Culture Recovery Fund and Da Vanzo noted that last year’s VAT reduction had also helped. It meant the theatre did not need to apply for a share of the government’s £60m emergency funding announced in December to tackle Omicron’s impact. Perth theatre was among the venues to cancel a festive show mid-run when new Covid restrictions came into effect in Scotland on 27 December. Its Cinderella opened in November to rave reviews. Written and directed by ugly sister Barrie Hunter, it became the theatre’s bestselling panto to date and drew an audience from surrounding areas including Dundee, Fife and Stirling, said chief executive Nick Williams. “It’s a huge influx of people and the amount of money they spend is vital not just for us but for the city centre.” But on 14 December, first minister Nicola Sturgeon asked the population to minimise contact with people in other households. A 50% drop in sales ensued, said Williams. The restrictions brought in on 27 December to minimise risk of transmission included one-metre physical distancing and a cap of 200 people in indoor theatres. Cinderella became unviable: “the whole thing just collapsed”. Perth theatre usually seats around 500; its audience would have been reduced to under 80. The theatre was on course to make 22% more income from its panto than in 2019, but ultimately 40% of the run was cancelled. The impact would be felt all year, said Williams, as audience confidence had been dented. The theatre is waiting to see how much assistance will come from the Scottish government’s mitigation fund. New restrictions in Wales – including the same 200 audience cap but a greater social distancing requirement of two metres – led Theatr Clwyd to cancel Beauty and the Beast from Boxing Day to 15 January. With the secondary income that comes from bar and merchandise sales, the theatre projects a loss exceeding £500,000. Even theatres that cancelled relatively few performances have felt the hit. Bristol Old Vic’s Robin Hood lost seven shows from a run of 52. The theatre took 70% of the income that would have been expected pre-Covid. Twelve performances of Cinderella at York Theatre Royal were cancelled, with two extra shows added. But chief executive Tom Bird said attendance had been encouraging and that 64% of this year’s audience were making their first ever trip to York Theatre Royal. Other venues warn of an unstable environment caused by Omicron and the government’s plan B. Manchester’s Royal Exchange cancelled just a handful of performances of its Christmas show but the theatre said audience attendance had become unpredictable, with up to 40% of tickets sold within 48 hours before a performance. Pre-Covid, the peak time for bookings would have been eight weeks before. When a show is cancelled, buyers can generally choose a refund, credit note or to donate the ticket price. Several theatres report a dropoff in donations. “In the first lockdown we had a significant proportion of people donating – that has decreased,” said Caroline Routh, executive director of Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph theatre. In 2019, Covid meant that its planned festive spectacular, The Snow Queen, became a spirited one-woman show instead. In 2020, “we were able to go with a five-hander show, which is our normal size”. Covid cases among the Jack and the Beanstalk cast meant 14 performances were cancelled, including during the busiest week in the run-up to Christmas, with the loss in ticket sales estimated at £35,000. However, a grant from the charitable Weston Culture Fund was used to underwrite risk and the view from this seaside resort is rather different. “A lot of theatres have pressure on their Christmas show,” said Routh. “But we make our money in the summer.”",Arts/Stage,Dames in distress: Britain’s theatres count cost of Christmas wrecked by Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/14/dames-in-distress-britains-theatres-count-cost-of-christmas-wrecked-by-covid
1/14/2022,"Like a lot of people, for many years I said yes to things I didn’t want to do. This was a combination of conditioning – it pays to be “nice” – vague fear of missing out and basic conflict avoidance. Without giving it much thought, it seemed to me there was no easy way to turn things down without causing offence or running against the grain of my own personality. Hostage negotiators and people in business presumably had workarounds for this inhibition, but whatever their tactics, they weren’t available to the rest of us. All we had, growing up, was the maxim “Just say no” – a slogan so useless it became a universally recognised and decades-long joke. A lot has changed since then. In the past 10 years, a language has developed, mainly from social justice and feminist movements, but also from academia, to describe latterly opaque states of discomfort and the right we have to resist them.  Chief among these are terms reaching to describe the more intangible end of labour inequality. If the term “sexism” was popularised in the late 1960s to frame basic double standards between men and women, modern iterations seek out more subtle disparities. Years before the phrase “mental load” took off, I recall a friend describing, via thousands of words, how her husband was “very good” at doing 50% of the childcare, while relying wholly on her as his line manager. (The example she used has stayed with me: he would, she said, “gladly” take the kids to a birthday party at the weekend, but it wouldn’t occur to him in a million years that they had to turn up with gifts, which needed buying and wrapping.) The phrases that evolved to address this imbalance are good, and they work. In fact, “mental load” and its adjacent term, “emotional labour”, work so well, they have been absorbed into common usage and promptly lost much of their original meaning. Emotional labour was, apparently, coined in the 1980s in academia to describe service industry jobs requiring the faking of a cheerful demeanour. It doesn’t mean that now. With trigger-happy application, you can bolt that phrase on to almost any situation, conversation or obligation you’d rather not be involved in, and back out feeling gloriously wronged. I say this without judgment. I do it all the time. My favourite, and by far the most useful, of these newish locutions is the phrase: “I’m not comfortable with that.” It’s just brilliant. It can get you out of almost anything. It hints at some unspeakable trigger event, and as such forestalls most pushback. It also has in its favour that particularly American brand of officiousness that evokes my other favourite word, “boundaries”. One can ditch disagreeable people left, right and centre these days via use of the word “boundaries” while escaping any feelings of guilt. I am not being mean: I am merely protecting myself from your inadequate boundaries. It’s clear that this get-out-of-jail-free card is not how the language was intended to be used, although I’m inclined to think – possibly delusionally – that even in diluted form, the net result is still good. Being able to politely back out of something without tying yourself in knots is useful, particularly for women socialised to comply. Feeling less responsible for other adults’ unruly emotions is a good thing, too. Common use of these terms is also an expression of individualistic self-advancement that has little or nothing to do with the power imbalance the language was created to address. Real-world application of academic language is notoriously sloppy, and can lead to bizarre inversions; this is no different. And yet, once you start, it is almost impossible to stop. You don’t even have to say the words, you just have to think them. A small example that I’m still trying to process. A while ago, I received a very long and angry email from a woman who accused me of slighting her. The offending interaction had occurred two years earlier, and while her email seemed unreasonable, she was clearly upset and I was, in the first instance, alarmed. I’m not obliged to engage with everyone who demands it; on the other hand, the distress was real, and perhaps I could assuage it if I spent enough time on the reply. Dithering, I forwarded the whole thing to a friend, who took one look at it and made a summary judgment. “She’s asking you to do emotional labour,” he said, and bingo: I was off the hook. Not only off the hook, but righteously indignant: I’m not replying; she’s a vampire; case closed.

1/14/2022,"Apparently inspired by the suicide of a friend and remixed by Cedric Gervais into that rarest of things – a party-starting Lana Del Rey banger – Summertime Sadness was a hook-laden highlight of her second album Born to Die, later becoming a key text in the #prettywhenyoucry “sad girl” aesthetic Del Rey inadvertently spawned.  High By the Beach sounds superb: shimmering organ, exhausted-sounding washes of synth, a trap rhythm that seems to have been sapped of all its swaggering machismo. It perfectly fits the song’s mood of weariness, an early sign of its author’s wariness about her celebrity: “I can’t survive if this is all that’s real.” There was a time when Lana Del Rey singing about riding a tractor in Oklahoma would have seemed no more likely than Lana Del Rey doing a cover of the Hokey Cokey, but here we are. Even by her more recent standards, the music here is minimal, which only adds to the song’s mood of creeping disquiet. It’s hard not to be cheered by the lyrics of Norman Fucking Rockwell: after umpteen songs in which she pledged undying fealty to some appalling-sounding character, it offers the sound of Lana Del Rey telling one of them where to get off in pleasingly direct terms. Also: fantastic chorus. It was probably only a matter of time until Lana Del Rey named a song after a David Lynch movie – Lynch’s 80s collaborations with singer Julee Cruise have clearly been a major influence from the start. Wild at Heart is a striking, hazy imagining of a world without Lana Del Rey in it: a fantasy of escape from celebrity. Lana Del Rey’s favourite song from Honeymoon, apparently because it was “jazzy”. It’s jazzy in the sense that a torch song is jazzy, but – beyond the parched, reverb-heavy guitars that recall Mazzy Star – the most obvious influence is John Barry’s Theme From Midnight Cowboy, echoed in the lovely descending vocal melody. Like Dory Previn’s Mary C Brown and the Hollywood Sign, Lust for Life is haunted by the 1932 suicide of failed actor Peg Entwhistle: like the relentless pulsing synthesiser in the background, the allusions to it add a dark undertow to what initially sound like bullish assertions of strength from Del Rey and Abel Tesfaye: “We’re masters of our own fate.” A cynic might suggest that, from its title to its lyrics (“24/7 Sylvia Plath”, “spilling my guts with the Bowery bums is the only love I’ve ever known”), this is a song that teeters on the verge of self-parody. But it’s hard to be cynical while it’s playing – just a piano and voice, it’s the model of elegant simplicity. The height of Lana Del Rey in Stepford-Wife-as-pop-star mode, National Anthem pitches her blank vocal delivering satirical sex-and-materialism lyrics – “Money is the reason we exist, everybody knows it” – against jarring musical euphoria: a skyscraping chorus, a string arrangement with a hint of Bitter Sweet Symphony about it. With its song titles borrowed from Neil Young and its lyrical nods to Joni Mitchell, Norman Fucking Rockwell! is an album immersed in Laurel Canyon’s late 60s singer-songwriter scene, an inspiration that finds its fullest expression on Mariners Apartment Complex, a beautifully sullen, icy update of said scene’s folk-based style. The first evidence of Ultraviolence’s sonic shift – aided by Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys – into more guitar-driven territory: the initial riff is equal parts Blondie’s Atomic and the Beatles’ And I Love Her, the lyrics a tribute to a mythologised California, the sudden slowing of tempo that announces the chorus is fabulous. Lana Del Rey’s lockdown song, which captures something of the lockdown experience by being impressively scattered. The lyrics leap without warning from posturing (“Let me show you how bad girls do”) to tearily confessional (“I’m not friends with my mother”), the music from exquisitely controlled – the tempo shifts in the chorus – to unravelled and chaotic. Tellingly, Lana Del Rey’s songs have gone from fetishising fame and success to yearning for a life without either. A distant spiritual cousin of Joni Mitchell’s For Free – which she covered – White Dress breathily suggests she was happier as a waitress or unknown singer: ironically it’s set to the kind of irresistible tune that sent her Chemtrails Over the Country Club album to No 1. An ambiguous ode to youth: the lyrical message is be-young-be-foolish-be-happy but the tone of the vocal coolly indifferent, there’s something noticeably ominous about the music. How you take it probably depends on how old you are, but there’s no arguing with the power of the tune, or the sweet reference to the Beach Boys’ troubled ballad Don’t Worry Baby. Released in the aftermath Born to Die’s success – and appended to the album’s deluxe Paradise Edition – Ride was produced by Rick Rubin and drenched in strings, but beneath them lurks a supremely classy country-soul song: for someone whose vocal abilities were mocked early on, Del Rey’s octave-leaping performance is nervily powerful. Shortly after the release of Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Lana Del Rey shared a cover of Rolling Stone with Elton John. You can hear his influence on The Greatest, a gorgeously elegiac song that could have made it on to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road: its everything-is-screwed mood – “I want everything to feel like it used to” – however, is pure Trump-era America. Self-baiting autobiography, or bitchy hipster character assassination? It isn’t clear, and perhaps it doesn’t matter: just luxuriate in Brooklyn Baby’s swooning melody, the lovely moments where the beat drops out, leaving just Del Rey, a trebly guitar and the buzzing of an amplifier. Lou Reed was meant to sing backing vocals, but died the day of the session. By some distance the best thing on the star-studded soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby, Young and Beautiful is Lana Del Rey at her most haunting. Co-opted by rather than commissioned for the film, its saga of fleeting youth and celebrity fits its story perfectly, the melody is exquisite. Nearly 10 minutes long, Venice Bitch hypnotises the listener for its entire duration. It shifts, subtly, from tender folk rock – replete with references to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 album Déjà Vu – to a heady swirl of synthesiser and guitar feedback, to a refrain based on Tommy James’s Crimson and Clover. It’s expansive, experimental and enveloping: a triumph. With Lana Del Rey a constant, influential presence in pop over the last decade, it’s easy to forget how striking her first appearance was. She’s written umpteen fantastic songs since, but Video Games is the kind of once-in-a-career song that stops you dead in your tracks: the slow building strings, the funereal beat, the lyric’s unsettling combination of romance and dread, the glassy-eyed vocal, the sense that it was utterly unlike anything else happening in pop at the time. As introductions to a new pop phenomenon go, it may well be the best of the past 20 years: the passing of time has done nothing to dim its potency.",Arts/Culture,Lana Del Rey’s greatest songs – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/14/lana-del-reys-greatest-songs-ranked

The result was patchy and a smidge too dark, so I added a little cornflour and arrowroot powder, as recommended in the online recipe, and that was pretty mattifying – like traditional loose powder. At a push, I could use this, but the cornflower does make me look a little grey and deathly. Even as a goth, I want to look semi-alive. The verdictIt works, but not very well.

1/14/2022,"On the day after Christmas in 2021, 56-year-old Daryn Worster, a long-haul truck driver, was seriously injured in a crash near Grants, New Mexico. He ultimately died from injuries sustained during the crash. Though Worster worked for a trucking firm, his wife, Joani Worster said she received no help from the company in bringing her husband home from New Mexico to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he would be laid to rest.  “I can’t get a hold of their insurance director. I’ve left four voicemails,” said Joani Worster. “Which hurts. I first asked if I could ride down and pick him up as they retrieved their truck, but they never got back to me.” She is one of many surviving loved ones of truck drivers in America who die on the job, and feel left to figure out the logistics of retrieving the body as many trucking companies refuse to offer any assistance. Joani Worster was able to contact Truckers Final Mile, a non-profit dedicated to helping bereaved families coordinate and pay for the costs of transporting a truck driver who lost their life on the road, or helping with travel costs in the case of an injury or illness. “They’ve given me and our four kids some breathing room. We’re paycheck to paycheck with no savings,” added Worster. “I would still be trying to find the money and means to bring him home.” Truck driving has long been one of the most dangerous jobs in the US, with truck drivers experiencing fatalities and serious injuries on the job at significantly higher rates than other occupations. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 843 truck drivers lost their lives on the job in 2019. Truck drivers killed on the job accounted for more than one in seven workplace fatalities in the US, with a fatality rate of 26.8 per 100,000 workers, compared with the rate for all US workers of 3.5 fatalities for every 100,000 workers. A 2014 survey conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh) found truck drivers having to work under tight delivery schedules, through fatigue, dangerous weather conditions and inadequate training as contributing factors to high fatalities and injuries among truck drivers. Covid-19 has increased risks to truck drivers and worsened working conditions as drivers have faced reduced access to services such as food and bathrooms. For unionized truck drivers, this issue is non-existent as language in master agreements covering over 100,000 truck drivers ensures companies are responsible for transporting workers and covering expenses in the case of a fatality, illness, or injury on the job, according to Lamont Byrd, director of the Teamsters’ safety and health department. “With deregulation, there’s been this race to the bottom, and these companies have really made driving being a truck driver, really tough, long hours, tough work, not paid for all of the work that’s done, and they’ve really trashed the industry. That’s one of the things as a union, we’re trying to fix,” Byrd said. Today, only a fraction of the more than 3.5 million truck drivers in the US are represented by unions, leaving many workers to rely on the whims of management to assist truck drivers and their families in the case of a fatality, injury or illness on the job. Robert Palm, an over-the-road (long-haul) truck driver since March 1981, started Truckers Final Mile after experiencing several instances through his career when a loved one or himself was abandoned by a trucking company after an accident. In 1993, he lost his stepbrother to a trucking accident, and his family was left to retrieve him and his belongings and bring him home. In 1997, his family had to collect him several hundred miles from home after a trucking collision put him in the hospital for a long period of time and the company he worked for provided no assistance for him or his family. Then in 2010, his appendix ruptured while on the road, and he had to drive himself to an emergency room and experienced the same issue, with the trucking firm he was working for providing no assistance. He was forced to arrange and pay for his own transportation from St Louis, Missouri, to his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Shortly after an incident in 2012 when he stopped to assist a truck driver who overturned their trailer into a ravine, he began looking into forming a non-profit to provide assistance to truck drivers and their families who experience accidents on the road and aren’t helped by their employers. “To our knowledge, with eight years of experience doing this charity, there’s no law, no statute, no regulation, no mandate to compel any employer or any company to bring any driver home for any reason,” said Palm. “It’s a thing a lot of drivers need to be educated about because they have the assumption they would be taken care of by their employer.” Palm asserted there were several trucking companies that do provide assistance for drivers and their families in the case of an accident. “There are those that can’t, won’t, or they simply don’t help bring a driver home. But they’ll go retrieve the truck, they’ll go get the load,” said Palm. “This happens every day.” Richard Ivey, 53, of Shelby, North Carolina, was at work truck driving near Ashland, Ohio, when he stopped to assist a mother and her infant child who had been in a traffic collision. While stopped on the side of the road, another vehicle hit them and Ivey was killed on 28 December 2021. “He was going down the interstate, when he noticed a wreck that had already occurred. He stopped and the lady was trying to get someone to help her get her infant son out of the vehicle,” said Ivey’s daughter, Kristen Ivey. “Another vehicle ended up hitting the car with the baby inside. The baby and mother sustained minor injuries. My dad’s were unfortunately fatal. He was killed on impact.” Her father’s employer referred them to Truckers Final Mile to assist in retrieving the body and the expenses required to transport him to North Carolina. The death was a shock to Ivey’s daughters, who had just reconnected with their father after five years and re-established a relationship. “My father was someone who’d give the shirt off his back,” added Kristen Ivey. “He told us he wanted to die doing what he loved and that he did. He was on the road like he wanted, helping someone else. Don’t take your loved ones for granted because we never know what tomorrow holds.”",News/US news,Final mile: non-profit helps families bring home truckers killed on the job,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/14/truckers-final-mile-non-profit-retrieve-killed-injured
1/14/2022,"Just over 30 years ago, Julia Cameron’s agent gave her the immortally bad advice that no one was going to be interested in a book about creativity. “What on earth are you doing?” the agent demanded. Instead of shelving her manuscript, Cameron photocopied it and started selling it by hand. She got a new agent, signed a deal with mind, body and spirit publisher Tarcher Books and in 1992 they released The Artist’s Way with an initial print run of 9,000 copies. Since then, more than 4m have been sold around the world.  It sounds like a fairy story, but this was a book born of struggle. Cameron’s was a life of precipitous highs and lows. Born in 1948, she embarked on a successful journalistic career in her 20s, writing for the Washington Post and Rolling Stone magazine. In 1975, she married the up-and-coming director Martin Scorsese and worked, as she says, as his “live-in-writer” on classic films such as Taxi Driver and New York, New York. But their union ended when Cameron discovered Liza Minnelli’s silk shirts in Scorsese’s wardrobe and found herself in a classic Hollywood downward spiral of addiction. She had begun to see cocaine “not as a problem, but as a solution”, she recalls in her memoir, Floor Sample. She was also an “out of control” alcoholic. “I was,” she writes, “not OK.” It was the subsequent time spent getting sober that helped Cameron develop the ideas that she would turn into The Artist’s Way. Inspired by the Alcoholics Anonymous model, the book offers a programme for “artistic recovery”. Split into 12 chapters designed to be worked through a week at a time, it aims to teach people to unlock their creativity. There are weekly challenges and exercises designed to foster inspiration and overcome the doubts that block creative work. Alongside these weekly tasks, Cameron suggests writing “morning pages” every day. The idea is that you just get words down to help you override your internal censor and develop new ideas and perspectives, by writing at least three pages of longhand, stream-of-consciousness prose before trying any other work. She also invites her readers to take themselves on weekly “artist’s dates”, time set aside to nurture “creative consciousness” by engaging with art, going to a gallery, going for a walk or watching a film – whatever your “inner artist” may appreciate. The book doesn’t offer an easy route to financial reward. Cameron promises her readers “many doors” will open, but these are artistic doors, not the doors of literary agencies. The big claims she makes are all about “creative recovery”. This, she says, is “a teachable, trackable spiritual process”. That’s right: spiritual. Like the AA, The Artist’s Way asks you to put trust in the “Great Creator” – or whatever non-denominational higher being you think will help you unleash your potential. This god talk comes alongside an emphasis on self-care that may strike some readers as solipsistic. “Be particularly alert to any suggestion that you have become selfish or different,” counsels Cameron, not because you may have a problem, but because such suggestions may block you. A chapter entitled Recovering a Sense of Compassion turns out to be about helping yourself rather than other people. Readers should also expect vague, unsubstantiated references to the kind of “brain research” that lets us know that “showering is an artist brain activity”. It’s harder to be sceptical about the practical success of The Artist’s Way. It isn’t just that the book has sold so many copies since Cameron ignored her agent’s advice, it’s that it has generated significant results. Musicians as varied as Alicia Keys, Pete Townshend and Kelly Lee Owens, and writers such as Patricia Cornwell have acknowledged the help that the book has given them. “It completely changed my life,” the actor and director Kerry Washington says on the back of my copy. There’s also a quote on from the multimillion-selling author Elizabeth Gilbert: “Without The Artist’s Way there would have been no Eat, Pray, Love.” Cameron is capitalising on the anniversary with a sequel of sorts, Seeking Wisdom, which promises “a spiritual path to deeper creativity”. But it has to be noted that not everyone is impressed by these kinds of guides. “They are a total con,” says Lucy Ellmann, the author of the multi-multi-award-winning Ducks, Newburyport. “The time spent reading these books should be spent reading Dickens. Or at least writing.” But it’s difficult to deny Cameron’s continuing influence. Her sunny American outlook even resonates here in the rainy UK. While researching this article, I’ve asked several classes of creative writing students if they’ve heard of the book and each time two or three talk enthusiastically about the morning pages. Just after her novel Olive was selected as a Waterstones paperback of the year, author Emma Gannon told me: “I took up The Artist’s Way one miserable Christmas when I’d tried and failed for the umpteenth time to write a novel. There was something about the book, not just the content but the feel of it, the tone of it, how supportive it is, that allowed me to follow my creativity and unblock myself. I absolutely feel indebted to Julia Cameron for helping me get out of my rut.” If the increased attention The Artist’s Way has been getting since the spring 2020 lockdown is anything to go by, Gannon isn’t the only one Cameron has boosted. It was reported that sales of the book doubled in the UK in the first half of the year, and Cameron even found herself being interviewed by Russell Brand on his Under the Skin podcast during that gloomy first April of the pandemic. “Many of us are trapped indoors, we’re restless, we’re feeling claustrophobic, …we’re feeling that events are beyond our control,” Cameron said, “but what we do have control over is taking the pen to the page.” She recommended the exercises in The Artist’s Way as a method of gaining “confidence, security, enthusiasm and hopefully a little bit of frivolity. Right now we desperately need frivolity.” On that score, at least, it’s hard to argue.

Fifa’s Global Transfer Report, which excludes domestic deals, also shows that clubs in England sold the most players and recouped the most transfer fees too, as the financial dominance of the country’s football in the world game was confirmed, despite an overall drop in transfer spending.  The report shows that $4.86bn (£3.5bn) was spent worldwide in 2021 in recruiting footballers, falling by as much as a third from the record totals set pre-pandemic in 2019. Nearly 88% of transfers did not involve a fee. English clubs’ spending fell too this year, from $1.627bn (£1.2bn) in 2020 to $1.386bn (£1bn) last year. At more than a quarter of all spending, however, it was more than $400m higher than the second-highest spenders, Italy. Romelu Lukaku’s £97.5m transfer to Chelsea from Internazionale was the biggest international deal of 2021, with Jadon Sancho’s £73m move from Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United the second-biggest. Raphaël Varane, Ibrahima Konaté and Martin Ødegaard also feature, but included in the top 10 global deals were some signings who have barely registered in the Premier League to date: Amad Diallo, who joined Manchester United from Udinese, and Bryan Gil, who signed for Spurs from Sevilla. As a transfer within a domestic league,Jack Grealish’s £100m move from Aston Villa to Manchester City does not feature. Tammy Abraham’s move from Chelsea to Roma was the fifth-biggest international move of the year, evidence of English football also being able to recoup money through sales. English clubs took more money in transfer fees than any other country, recouping $548m of the money they spent, and they sold or loaned more players than any other country too. English clubs sold or loaned 885 players, with Manchester City top of the global list with 41, and Wolves also appearing in the top 10, with 30. Fifa’s report shows the vast majority of transfer revenues stay at the top of the game. There were 2,230 transfers that commanded a fee in 2021 (and 15,838 that did not). The top 100 commanded more than 50% of all fees. The overall picture was quite different in the women’s game. In 2021 the international transfer spend grew by 72.8% on the year before, albeit to a total of $2.1m – a level very different to the men’s game. There was also a substantial growth in the number of players transferred, the 1,304 international deals up by a quarter on 2020. Although English clubs were lower down the list of spending in the women’s game, the WSL recorded the biggest international transfer in 2021, when Hanna Bennison joined Everton from Rosengård.",Sport/Football,English clubs dominate international transfer spend in 2021 with £1bn outlay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/english-clubs-dominate-international-transfer-spend-in-2021-with-1bn-outlay-fifa
1/14/2022,"Currys has trimmed its annual profit forecast after a shortage of goods ranging from PlayStation 5 consoles and Apple products to hairdryers resulted in a 5% fall in sales over the peak Christmas period. The UK’s biggest electrical retailer said that sales were hit by problems including the global chip shortage, which is affecting the supply of goods from TVs to appliances, the shipping of products and a drop in demand as households budgets become increasingly squeezed.  “The technology market was challenging this Christmas, with uneven customer demand and supply disruption,” said Alex Baldock, the chief executive of Currys, which formerly traded as PC World, Carphone Warehouse and Dixons. “We have certainly had our hands full this Christmas with supply, not just of products but also of people, containers, chip sets, the full range.” Currys, which has trimmed its full-year profit guidance from £160m to £155m, said that the overall UK market for sales of technology products was down 10% at Christmas. “We are seeing patchy consumer confidence when it comes to the bigger ticket purchases like electricals, like technology that we sell,” said Baldock, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It certainly hasn’t been helped by cost of living concerns, and hasn’t particularly been helped by Omicron either. Still, even with that patchy customer demand we have been able to keep growing and gain market share.” Currys, which operates 800 stores and sells its goods online, said that sales in the UK and Ireland fell by 6% year on year in the peak trading period of the 10 weeks to 8 January. While consumers turned to online sales to avoid going to the high street, with digital revenues up 29% compared with the Christmas of 2019, it was not enough to overcome the company’s overall sales drop during the 2021 festive season. Despite the trading problems, Baldock said the business traded profitability and outperformed the wider market. “Customer demand for some tech was strong,” he said. “This was a gamers’ Christmas, the year that virtual reality broke into the mainstream, and when consoles flew off the shelves. Oculus Quest 2 and the PS5 were stars. Appliances large and small also enjoyed strong sales, as consumers continued to kit out their homes. Even though not everyone may not have got their first choice of product this Christmas we had plenty of choice for everyone.” The company said that for the 36 weeks to 8 January sales were down 3% year on year but up 11% compared with 2020. Baldock said Currys, which commenced a £75m share buyback scheme on Friday, is focusing on “profitable sales, with good discipline on margin, cost and stock”. However, he added that there continues to be pressure on the supply chain and consumer demand. “I am not counting on it getting any better,” he said. “There is plenty of uncertainty, not just on the supply side but also the demand side looking ahead, whether you are looking at cost of living, real wages, discretionary income or consumer confidence, which is one of the reasons we are being quite cautious in our outlook.” Shares in Currys fell 4% on Friday morning.",News/Business,Currys sales slide amid shortages of key tech goods,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/currys-sales-slide-amid-shortages-of-key-tech-goods
1/14/2022,"Russia’s buildup of a potential invasion force on Ukraine’s borders has produced little reaction at home despite western threats of devastating economic consequences that would harm tycoons, top businesspeople and the general public alike. Since 2014, recurrent rounds of sanctions over the annexation of Crimea, the shooting down of the MH17 jetliner, the 2016 US elections interference, the Salisbury poisonings, the attempted assassination of Alexei Navalny and other international scandals have steeled Vladimir Putin’s elite supporters and prepared them for the worst.  Many tripped over themselves to publicly show their loyalty to the Kremlin during the 2014 crisis, despite facing crippling sanctions as a result. “You must pay for everything in life, including knowing [Putin],” quipped Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire friend of the Russian president who was sanctioned in March 2014, in an interview with state media. Behind closed doors, top businesspeople and officials browbeat each other into staying loyal in the face of personal sanctions. “Our country is under sanctions. And the president is alone on the parapet,” Vladimir Yakunin, the then head of Russian Railways, said during a leaked account of a heated committee meeting in 2014 on whether to integrate Crimea’s football teams into the Russian league (a decision some feared would earn them personal sanctions). After eight years of persistent conflict with the west, the elite and the public appear largely resigned to whatever course Vladimir Putin chooses in his quest to assert dominance over Ukraine. And despite signs pointing toward a greater conflict, polling and anecdotal evidence indicates that many Russians do not feel the threat of war as intensely. “This talk of war is more done on the western side,” said Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, in a television interview this week. “On the Russian side, there is none of that. There is no feeling of an impending war in Ukraine. But military pressure is certainly there, and military pressure is certainly to continue; the military pressure may increase.” Russia has positioned more than 50 battalion tactical groups, or nearly a third of its total, within striking distance of Ukraine. More main battle tanks and other armoured vehicles have been filmed departing Russia’s far east on flatbed railcars, indicating the buildup is continuing even as high-stakes negotiations were under way in Europe this week. Top Russian officials have indicated talks are at an impasse. “I do not see any grounds to sit down, convene another meeting and begin the same discussion all over again in the coming days,” said Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister who represented Russia at this week’s negotiations with the US in Geneva. He demanded that the US deliver concrete counter-proposals or Russia would be forced to ensure its security via other means. While the Kremlin has delivered bombastic rhetoric blaming the west for the conflict, there has not been a similar outburst of nationalism like the one after the annexation of Crimea. “We don’t notice much enthusiasm … the government’s ratings continue to fall, despite the possibility of a large-scale confrontation,” said Denis Volkov of the independent Levada Centre. The events of March 2014 also energised opponents of the clash with Ukraine, a portion of the Russian opposition that risked openly opposing the growing conflict in Ukraine. Liberals “are aghast of President Vladimir Putin’s warmongering, and they are very vocal in their condemnation of the Kremlin revanchism, but the situation in Ukraine itself is not the focus of their conversation,” wrote the journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan. Ultimately, there is little in terms of domestic politics to restrain Putin from going to war in Ukraine if he so chooses. The Kremlin has spent years preparing for a broader economic conflict with the west, including building up considerable cash reserves that would insulate it from the economic shock of new US sanctions. And as the experience of 2014 shows, its powerful oligarchs will also be expected to shoulder their burden in the coming conflict. “Personal inconveniences and costs to one’s business can and should be neglected when it comes to the interests of the state,” said Timchenko, the billionaire friend of Putin, in the interview. “There can be no compromise here.”",News/World news,Low key and loyal: the domestic response to Russian troop buildup,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/russians-buildup-troops-ukraine-border
