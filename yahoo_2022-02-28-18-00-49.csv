2/28/2022,"Russian banks have raised key rates to 20% in a bid to save the ruble as major countries cut off support to Moscow amid its invasion of Ukraine. The Russian central bank raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% on Monday in an emergency move.

Russia's state-owned Sberbank is ""failing or likely to fail,"" the European Central Bank said in a prepared statement. Russia has also ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues, the central bank and the finance ministry said. The key rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow when they fall short of their required reserves. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in tensions in the Eastern European region.

The interest rate will increase from 9.5% to 20%, the central bank said in a statement before ruble trading was due to open at 10 a.m. local time. It also temporarily banned brokers from selling securities held by foreigners starting Monday on the Moscow Exchange, without specifying which securities the ban applies to. Authorities also introduced mandatory hard-currency revenues sales for exporters. The emergency steps represent the most forceful measures taken by Russia after the latest round of sanctions, with the U.S. and the European Union agreeing to potentially block access to much of the $640 billion the country’s central bank has built up to protect the economy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spurred a flight from the nation’s markets, and the ruble was indicated 26% weaker in offshore trading on Monday as market makers from Sydney to Hong Kong pulled back. It dropped 8% at the open on the Moscow Exchange, immediately hitting the trading limit of 90 per dollar. Governor Elvira Nabiullina is due to speak at 4 p.m. in Moscow, the central bank said. “Russian authorities have to prevent fire-sales of Russian securities to prevent panic,” said Commerzbank AG strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann. It’s “something which is certainly harmful in the long run, but which Russian authorities seem to prefer given the risk of an even more significant ruble collapse.” READ: Russia Bonds, Now Junk, Set to Reel From Central Bank Sanctions S&P Global Ratings lowered Russia’s credit score below investment grade on Friday, while Moody’s Investors Service -- which rates Russia one notch above junk -- put the nation on review for a downgrade.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- ‘Too risky to deal in’ is the mantra from foreign-exchange to equities trading floors as investors step back from dealing with Russian assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says Spreads on the ruble have widened by eight times, with market makers from Sydney to Hong Kong pulling back, traders said. Nomura Holdings’ domestic securities arm said it will suspend taking purchase or sale orders for the time being on four investment trusts that contain Russia-related assets. Singapore said it would block certain Russian banks and financial transactions connected to Russia. Evaporating liquidity, due to biting sanctions ramped up over the weekend, is spurring authorities to act, with Russia’s central bank announcing it would temporarily ban foreigners from selling securities. Moscow Exchange said it will start currency and money-market trading only at 10 a.m. local time, about three hours later than normal. “Russia is simply unbankable at this stage and anyone holding Russian assets will find their book value marked at zero till we find a way out of this,” said Saed Abukarsh, chief portfolio manager at Ark Capital Management Dubai Ltd. “The overall market is unprepared for the speed of developments since the inception of the war.” Russian assets have plummeted in the wake of the nation’s invasion of Ukraine, with the ruble’s slump making it the worst-performing emerging-market currency in February. Foreign-exchange market participants from Sydney to Hong Kong are freezing ruble trading as they mull the effects of the harshest sanctions placed on a major economy in a generation. “When anything like this happens, we cut leverage and basically tell people to close positions. It’s just too high risk,” said Nick Twidale, chief executive Asia Pacific at forex broker FP Markets in Sydney. “No trades are coming through at all on the ruble.” Read More: Russians Rush for Dollars as Sanctions Threaten Ruble Collapse Equities futures slid on Monday, with European contracts falling more than 3%. Strategists are predicting fresh pressure on the region’s banks as the sanctions take effect. “European banks may be under some pressure on Monday given some Russian exposure and concerns around what that will mean if payments are restricted,” TD Securities strategists including Rich Kelly wrote in a note. “Austrian banks are most exposed, with Russian counterparties representing 1.6% of banking assets, followed by 0.6% for Italy and 0.2% for France.” Ruble Rout National Australia Bank Ltd.’s Ray Attrill in Sydney was glued to his desk all Sunday in preparation for Monday’s volatility. “We are hearing ruble being quoted in 114-119 area locally,” said Attrill, head of FX strategy and markets, who started his work day at 5 a.m. local time. Russia’s central bank may become “impotent” in defending the ruble if sanctions are successful, he said. The rout is extending to futures markets. CME ruble futures tumbled more than 30% after the open, though some trades are now starting to trickle through, according to Matthew Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index. “The ruble is in a freefall as the gravity of sanctions and restrictions on Russia’s central bank take effect,” he said. “CME futures fell over 30% after the open, which is not what Russians who are queuing up at cash points across the country want to hear right now.” (Updates to reflect trading across assets) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Wall Street’s Risky ‘Razor Blade’ Trade Is Making a Comeback A Pandemic Baby Bump Shines a Spotlight on the Nordic Welfare Model Cyberwar: How Nations Attack Without Bullets or Bombs Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",World/Bloomberg•3 hours ago,Liquidity Vanishes Across Russia Assets With Ruble Plunging,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ruble-indicated-29-lower-offshore-024516048.html
2/28/2022,"Rouble crashes to record low; Moscow Exchange opening delayed Oil surges above $103 a barrel; Gas prices leap 40pc FTSE 100 falls 1pc at the open BP severs ties with energy giant Rosneft Lucy Burton: It’s high time to crack down on London lawyers protecting Putin’s oligarchs Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter​ The rouble has collapsed to a fresh record low against the dollar after the West rolled out fresh sanctions against Russia and President Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert. The Russian currency dropped almost 30pc to 119 per dollar in early trading. The opening of the Moscow Exchange has been delayed and the Russian central bank raised interest rates to 20pc in a desperate bid to prop up the economy. It came after the US and Western allies agreed to banish Russia from the Swift international payments platform and took measures against its central bank, while the EU has banned Russian airlines from its airspace and is sending weapons to Ukraine. Global markets are now braced for a tumultuous day of trading. Oil benchmark Brent crude jumped above $102 a barrel and gas prices surged almost 40pc, while US and European stocks markets are set to plunge at the open. The decision to ban some Russian banks from the Swift system could result in missed payments and huge overdrafts in the international banking system, forcing authorities to step in. That's according to Credit Suisse, which warned central banks may need to reactivate daily operations to supply the market with dollars. Analyst Zoltan Pozsar drew comparisons with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the pandemic market crash in 2020. He said: ""Exclusions from Swift will lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts similar to the missed payments and overdrafts that we saw in March 2020, ""Banks' inability to make payments due to their exclusion from Swift is the same as Lehman's inability to make payments due to its clearing bank's unwillingness to send payments on its behalf. History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes."" Mr Pozsar argued that current excess reserves and reverse repurchase agreement facilities won't be enough, and monetary authorities will need to act. Germany could extend its use of coal as the country rethinks its energy plans in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Economy Minister Robert Habeck has said. The former co-leader of the Green party said coal plants could run for longer and even said he wasn’t “ideologically opposed” to extending the use of nuclear energy. Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Sunday plans to build two new liquefied natural gas terminals to expand Germany’s energy choices and reduce its reliance on Russia. Mr Habeck said the government wanted to reach a point where it can “pick and choose which countries we want to build energy partnerships with”. He told German television: “Being able to choose also means, in case of doubt, that you can become independent from Russian gas, coal or oil.” While Germany can manage without Russian gas for the coming months, the country would have to expand its purchasing strategy significantly for next winter, he said. German Greens now thinking the unthinkable - they might agree to let the country’s nuclear power stations run for longer. Anything but rely on Russian natural gas. https://t.co/s8eMYpZljN — Guy Chazan (@GuyChazan) February 27, 2022 The FTSE 100 has dropped 1.3pc as an escalation in tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked fresh jitters across global markets. Russia-exposed miners Polymetal International and Evraz are the biggest fallers, dropping 36pc and 17pc respectively. BP is down 5.8pc after announcing plans to sell its state in Russian energy firm Rosneft – a move that could cost it as much as $25bn (£18.7bn). Financial stocks including HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and Prudential are also dragging down the index. The FTSE is outperforming its European rivals, however. That's largely thanks to a 14pc surge for BAE Systems after Germany said it was ramping up its defence spending. Miners Rio Tinto and Anglo American are also helping to limit losses as they track commodity prices higher. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 has suffered a less severe drop of 0.7pc, with Petropavlovsk tumbling 12pc. While markets have opened in the red, defence stocks are making gains. It comes after Germany said it will increase defence spending in a radical policy shift following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. BAE Systems – Europe's largest defence contractor – jumped 13.5pc to the top of the FTSE 100. Babcock gained 6.6pc, while Qinetiq rose 8.6pc and Chemring pushed 3pc higher. In Germany, Hensoldt surged as much as 84pc and Rehinmetall rose more than 40pc. The rouble tumbled more than 15pc against the dollar and euro as markets opened in Moscow, but central bank intervention helped it recover from record lows. The currency was trading at 95.48 to the dollar – down more than 15pc from Friday's close – with the central bank's sale of foreign currency helping to limit losses. It had crashed 30pc to a record low of 120 against the dollar earlier in the day in electronic trading. Russia has raised its key interest rate to 20pc and introduced a raft of new measures in a bid to prop up the currency and prevent a run on banks. But the Government has said it will cut off Russia's central bank to prevent Moscow from undermining the impact of sanctions. The sell-off is spreading across Europe this morning as traders brace for turbulence. The FTSE 100 is down 1pc, but it's faring better than some of its peers across the continent. Germany's Dax and the French CAC index have both dropped more than 2pc. BP shares have slumped 7pc at the open after the oil giant was forced to ditch its stake in Kremlin-controlled energy firm Rosneft. The FTSE 100 company said it will sell its 20pc stake in Rosneft, warning it could take a hit of up to $25bn (£18.7bn) from the move. Read more: BP abandons stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft The FTSE 100 has dropped more than 1pc at the open as tougher sanctions and Putin's nuclear threat rattle markets. The blue-chip index tumbled just over 1pc to 7,417 points, extending last week's losses. Kwasi Kwarteng has waded into the debate over energy security as the escalating crisis roils markets. The Business Secretary said additional UK production wouldn't help to ease the surge in wholesale gas prices and dismissed fracking as a solution. Instead, he said it was crucial to shift towards renewable energy sources as the continent tries to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. The wholesale price of gas has *quadrupled* in UK and Europe.  Additional UK production won’t materially affect the wholesale market price. This includes fracking – UK producers won’t sell shale gas to UK consumers below the market price. They’re not charities. (4/9) — Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) February 28, 2022 The ECB has frozen Sberbank's main businesses in the bloc after regulators determined they were likely to fail. The Single Resolution Board, which handles European lenders that run into trouble, suspended payments, enforcement and termination rights to three Sberbank divisions until the end of March 1. That came after the ECB determined that Austria-based Sberbank Europe and its subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia probably won’t be able to pay their debts or other liabilities as they fall due. The central bank said Sberbank Europe and its subsidiaries “experienced significant deposit outflows as a result of the reputational impact of geopolitical tensions”. It added: “This led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position at group level and in each of its subsidiaries within the banking union.” Chinese markets have closed higher this morning, spurred on by gains for energy and commodity firms as the deepening crisis drives up prices. The Shanghai Composite index closed 0.3pc higher at 3,462.31, reversing an earlier drop of as much as 0.75pc. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.2pc after earlier slipping as much as 0.9pc. It's unlikely to be a similar story in Europe, however. The FTSE 100 is poised to drop 1.6pc at the open, while the Stoxx 50 index is pointing 3.4pc lower. Norway's biggest energy company Equinor has joined BP in withdrawing from Russia in response to the crisis. Both firms have told investors to brace for a hefty financial impact. Equinor, which is 67pc state-owned, said the decision to pull out from joint ventures in Russia will dent the book value of its assets in the country and spark impairments, but it didn't put a figure on the hit. BP has estimated that its exit from Rosneft could spark a writedown of as much as $25bn (£18.7bn). Bank of China's Singapore operation is said to have stopped financing deals involving Russian oil and Russian companies, in a sign Beijing may not step in to support its strategic partner. It follows reports from Reuters that major buyers of Russian oil were struggling to open letters of credit from Western banks to cover purchases or find ships willing to transport Russian oil. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that European banks Societe Generale and Credit Suisse have halted the financing of commodities. BP will be in the spotlight when markets open this morning after the oil giant was forced to cut-ties with Kremlin-controlled energy firm Rosneft. Here's more from James Titcomb: The FTSE 100 oil giant will offload its 20pc stake in Rosneft, previously valued at $14bn (£10bn), and abandon its two seats on the board following pressure from the Government. Bernard Looney, its chief executive, will step down from Rosneft’s board, as will Bob Dudley, the former BP boss, as it exits a three-decade venture in Russia. The company said it is likely to take a significant financial hit from the sale. It said it would also sell its investments in three joint ventures with Rosneft, while Mr Looney will separately resign from the board of the Russian Geographical Society. Separately, Norway said late on Sunday that its $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund would sell its Russian interests, around 0.2pc of its assets, which are worth around $2.8bn including stakes in Sberbank and Gazprom. BP’s chairman Helge Lund called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine an “act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region”. He said the company’s stake in Rosneft was “no longer aligned with BP’s business and strategy”. Read the full story here Stocks across Europe are set to tumble at the opening bell after the latest round of sanctions, while surging energy prices fuel yet more inflation fears. The FTSE 100 is poised to drop 1.6pc, while futures tracking the pan-European Stoxx 50 index plunged 3.4pc. Tough new sanctions, nuclear threats from Putin and a renewed rally in energy prices are all weighing on sentiment this morning. On the FTSE there'll be a particular focus on BP, after the biggest foreign investor in Russia said it was abandoning its stake in state oil company Rosneft at a cost of up to $25bn (£18.7bn). Oil and gas prices soared further this morning as a fresh wave of sanctions threw energy and commodity markets into disarray. Benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 7pc before easing back slightly to trade above $103 a barrel. It had hit almost $106 last week amid fears the conflict could disrupt supplies to Europe. Meanwhile, European gas prices surged 39pc to €125 per megawatt-hour. The UK equivalent leapt 25pc. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has rattled markets in everything from oil and gas to wheat and nickel, piling more inflationary pressure on the global economy. Traders now fear a new raft of sanctions – including banning some Russian banks from the Swift payments system – could further disrupt the market. The Bank of Russia has raised its key interest rate to 20pc in a desperate effort to shore up its economy. The interest rate will increase from 9.5pc, while the central bank also introduced mandatory hard-currency revenues sales for exporters and banned brokers from selling securities by foreigners. Earlier today the regulator announced a temporary sales freeze on the Moscow Exchange, without specifying which securities the ban applies to. It marks Moscow's efforts to mitigate the impact of sanctions and prevent a run on banks. There Kremlin is battling to stave off a run on Russian banks this morning after the weekend brought a tidal wave of new sanctions and the rouble collapsed to a record low. Here's more from my colleague James Titcomb: Russia's central bank was also reportedly bringing in new measures to prevent a sell-off of Russian securities. According to Reuters, central bank documents showed that it had ordered market players to reject foreign clients' bids to sell Russian securities from early Monday morning. The step came after the central bank on Sunday said it would provide unlimited funds to the country’s lenders and dramatically expand eligibility for loans as it was forced to reassure citizens that bank cards would continue to work normally. Russians were yesterday racing to cashpoints and there were reports of the machines running out of banknotes. Russian economist Vladislav Zhukovskiy said “panic has started”. He said: “All over the country there are queues at ATMs to withdraw money. Banks are selling the dollar at 100 to 120 roubles! Where are [central bank chief] Elvira Nabiullina and [prime minister] Mikhail Mishustin?” ​Read more on this story The Government has reiterated its plans to cut off Russia's central bank as it ramps up financial sanctions against Moscow. The measures are designed to prevent Russia from deploying its foreign reserves to undermine the impact of sanctions. They also stop the central bank from using foreign exchange transactions to support the rouble. Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said: These measures demonstrate our determination to apply severe economic sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We are announcing this action in rapid coordination with our US and European allies to move in lock step once more with our international partners, to demonstrate our steadfast resolve in imposing the highest costs on Russia and to cut her off from the international financial system so long as this conflict persists. The Moscow Exchange will open forex and money market trading at 10am Moscow time on Monday – that's three hours later than usual. The bourse also said it will suspend trading on the forex repo market. It's the latest sign of just how much disruption is expected when markets open this morning, as traders react to tougher Western sanctions and a escalation of Putin's rhetoric. Good morning.  Traders are holding their breath this morning ahead of what's expected to be a torrid day on the markets. An escalation of sanctions over the weekend – coupled with Vladimir Putin's chilling nuclear threat – has fuelled uncertainty over how the invasion of Ukraine will progress. The rouble has plunged to a fresh record low against the dollar, while the opening of the Moscow Exchange has been delayed. While there's been a mixed performance for Asian stocks overnight, the FTSE 100 and European stocks look set to plunge at the open. Wai Ho Leong, an analyst at Modular Asset Management, said ""A terrible weekend... hard to make any decisions when the conflict in Ukraine is re-intensifying."" 1) BP abandons stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft FTSE 100 company says Ukraine war caused it to 'fundamentally rethink' 19.75pc shareholding 2) Sanctions spark Russia bank run fears as country braces for ‘free fall’ in rouble Ban from Swift payments network set to send currency tumbling 3) The West has finally taken the gloves off against Putin, and redeemed our honour Ukraine's valiant resistance has provoked a moral scramble to be seen and counted in the melee 4) Delays at UK ports double as Brexit red tape slows customs Economists have warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to prolong the disruptions 5) Aeroflot cancels all flights to European destinations after EU bans Russian jets The European Commission announced a block across the entire 27-country bloc on Russian-owned aircraft from entering the bloc’s airspace or landing at their airports on Sunday What happened overnight  Shares were mixed in Asia but US and European futures were sharply lower as President Vladimir Putin escalated tensions by ordering that Russian nuclear forces be put on high alert. US futures fell, with the contract for the S&P 500 down 2.5pc and that for the Dow industrials 1.6pc lower. The future for Germany's DAX dropped 3.2pc and the future for the FTSE 100 lost 1.3pc. Japan's Nikkei 225 index recovered from earlier losses to edge 0.1pc higher.

2/28/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Intel has chosen the east German city of Magdeburg as the site for a new multibillion-euro European chip factory and will make the decision public on March 4, a person familiar with matter told Reuters. The company said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021, but no announcement has been made. Germany was top of the list of potential locations, with the local governments of Penzing in Bavaria and Magdeburg and Dresden in eastern Germany trying to tempt the U.S. company. Analysts had said Intel could be waiting for the introduction of new legislation before deciding on a European location. The European Chips Act aims to reduce the continent's dependence on Asian suppliers for advanced semiconductors by subsidising the local development of large chip factories. Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger travelled to Europe last year. The government subsidies, stability and availability of skilled workers were factors that encouraged the CEO to choose Germany for the new plant, the source said. Germany is also home to many of the world's biggest automakers which have been particularly badly hit by the global chip shortage. The small city of Magdeburg is the capital of Saxony-Anhalt state. It hosts the Otto von Guericke University and has space for a new plant in the Eulenberg industrial area in the southwest. It is not clear when production could start. Intel, which in January announced plans to build a $20 billion U.S. chipmaking complex in Ohio, is likely to consider France and Italy for new locations in Europe as it plans to build a design centre and packaging plant, the source added.

2/28/2022,"Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. Hello and happy Saturday! Today we're taking on two topics. The first fits neatly into our usual coverage area. The second not so much. Let's go! In the 2021 SPAC rush I missed the public debut of Alight Solutions. Based outside of Chicago, the company is a business process outsourcing shop that supports tens of millions of employees in the United States. It combined with Foley Trasimene, a blank-check company, last July after announcing its intentions to list via the SPAC earlier in 2021. It also reported earnings this week, and I chatted with its CEO Stephan Scholl after the fact. There are three things that matter from the Alight report that I want to noodle on with you. In order: Not all SPACs are a mess: Today Alight Solutions is worth about $4.7 billion, and is trading a fraction above its pre-combination $10 per share price. That means that the company's SPAC deal was valued pretty well, and that it is possible to take a company public using the method and not have it eat its own shorts in the following weeks, months and quarters. SoFi was, previously, our leading example of a SPAC combo that failed to flounder; we can add another name to the list. Some SPAC projections bear out: In its investor deck from its combination announcement from last January, Alight said that it expected to generate $363 million in BPaaS revenues in 2021. BPaaS stands for Business Process as a Service, and is the company's SaaS-y service that is its fastest-growing revenue segment. In 2021, however, the company actually saw $390 million in BPaaS revenues. It beat on a key metric! That's why the company is above water, I reckon. The idea of profitable growth: Why is it considered bad news in some circles if a tech company starts to pay a dividend? One line of thinking is that the choice to return cash to shareholders via regular disbursements is an indication that the company in question is out of places to deploy funds, which implies slower future growth. So we tend to see tech companies that aren't goliaths simply grow like hell even at the expense of profits. Alight appears to sit between the two extremes, focusing on what Scholl described as profitable growth to TechCrunch. This, he explained, ensures that his company doesn't ""over-rotate"" on any particular effort, and isn't burning its ships on its BPaaS strategy; if it doesn't work out long-term, the company will survive. Alight is rather profitable, so he's speaking from a position of black ink, for reference. Still, it was interesting to talk to a company that has much in line with tech companies going through a software transition, but with a very different approach to balancing growth and profits. Interesting. And now, something different. I am writing to you, as I do every week, on Friday afternoon. I type up this little missive, contribute to Daily Crunch, and then bounce into the weekend. This Friday, however, has been a grinder. Not only because of economic uncertainty, the pandemic, or the invasion of Ukraine, but also because Chris Gates is leaving TechCrunch for a new role elsewhere. You probably don't know Chris, which is evidence that I haven't done enough along the way to shout him out. Regardless, he was a founding member of the Equity podcast, and his last day was today. By the time you read this, he will be gone. We worked together for around a half decade, recording hundreds of shows, suffering from failures, celebrating wins and generally making the show work as a team. Through host changes, the sale of our parent company, and so very much more, he was there, steady, warm and ready to fucking go. It goes without saying that Equity is also Grace and Mary Ann and Natasha, and has also had the pleasure of having Danny and Kate and Matthew and Katie and Connie in the mix during its life. It is very much a group project. I'm going to miss working with Chris so much. But his exit is a good reminder of the very human force-multiplier called teamwork. The man, the myth, the smile. Chris posted this to Slack when he announced his exit, so it's only fair to troll him with it here. This is the energy he brought every single day. This newsletter, for example, gets written by myself. Then Annie or Richard give it a read. Henry often peeks at it, as well, as he helped dream it up with me a few years back and supported its birth. Finally, it's moved into our email software, into a slot that our sales team prepares to include the correct advertising elements. It then gets sent out to your inbox and posted on the site, which our tech crew makes possible. I just get my name at the top because I wrote the words. But this product is the result of material, longitudinal teamwork. I've had better luck than I have deserved when it comes to teams. The folks I have had the pleasure of working with in my career have, with very few exceptions, been people I have loved having in my life more generally. Chris and I worked on Equity together through weddings, the birth of kids, moves and more. We did life together, you know?

2/28/2022,"A version of this post was originally published on TKer.co. Warren Buffett published his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday. You can read it here. Arguably the greatest investor of all time, Buffett is known for timeless insights about investing using very approachable language. Lately, I’ve been thinking about something he said in his 2005 letter: Long ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius. But Sir Isaac’s talents didn’t extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.” If he had not been traumatized by this loss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases. Newton was a pretty smart guy. Much of what we’re taught in high school physics and calculus can be tracked back to him. And apparently, he had a pretty good track record as a diversified, buy-and-hold an investor. That was before he got crushed speculating on shorter term swings in the stock market. When markets make sharp moves up or down for whatever reason, it can be very tempting to stray from your long-term investment plan and ramp up your short-term trading activity in an attempt to maximize gains and minimize losses. While there may be some opportunities you are able to correctly exploit, there’s also the very high risk that you mistime the market and do significant irreversible damage to your long-term returns. (Read more here and here.) With every trade comes not one, but two decisions. If you decide to buy, then you also have to know under what conditions you would decide to sell. Similarly, if you’re thinking about trimming your exposure to stocks because you think the market will go lower in the short-term, then you also have to consider under what conditions you would buy to get back to your target long-term asset allocation. As I wrote in my Thursday newsletter this is “particularly important, because you have to consider scenarios under which prices only rise from“ the moment you sell. These are all good questions to ask upfront as you formulate your investment plan. Perhaps the most important element of prudent investing is having a good plan. By the way, Newton’s folly was not that he got involved in the South Sea Bubble. Rather, it’s the fact that he was trading in and out of it. From WSJ columnist Jason Zweig: Prof. Odlyzko estimates that if Newton had bought and held his South Sea shares continuously from early 1712 through 1723, when the stock stabilized after the bursting of the bubble, he would have earned a cumulative total return of approximately 116%. That’s about 6.5% annually, not counting dividends — a generous return at a time when long-term government bonds carried interest rates of 4% to 5%. However, Newton didn’t buy and hold continuously. If only Newton had given it time.

However, it bounced strongly at the 200-week moving average on Thursday, raising odds for an intermediate rally that could add 30 points before bears return in force. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) rallied to a 13-month high last week before stalling within 12-points of 2020’s all-time high.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Russia said it will start purchasing gold again, just under two years after it ended a long-running buying spree that helped prop up bullion prices last decade. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says The central bank will begin buying gold again on the domestic precious metals market, it said in a statement. The move comes after the monetary authority and several of the country’s commercial banks were sanctioned in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of Russia spent six years rapidly accumulating gold, doubling its holdings and becoming the biggest sovereign buyer. It stopped in March 2020 as prices spiked at the onset of the pandemic, and has largely kept its stockpile steady since. The Russian purchases provided a key pillar of support for the market at a time when demand from investors was muted. Gold swung wildly last week, surging as investors turned to haven assets after Russia invaded Ukraine and then tumbling back as Western nations imposed sanctions. Prices rose 1.1% to $1,910.11 an ounce as of 10:34 a.m. in Singapore on Monday, and are up more than 6% this month. Russia will continue to usurp its own production of gold to bolster its war chest and that’s likely to be viewed as initially bullish by the market, Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP SA, said in a note. But the purpose of buying gold in the domestic market is to monetize it when required, she said. “It matters less that gold will likely be siphoned off to other bad actors, off-market, therefore technically not hitting the global flows,” Shiels said. “It’s the impact to sentiment which is greater,” and the fear over potential central bank sales will hang over the market, she said, adding that a further collapse in the ruble will make Russia more likely to sell gold. Central bank buying has been a key source of demand for bullion in the past year, alongside a revival in appetite from Asian jewelry consumers. Central banks added 463 tons to reserves in 2021, an increase of more than 80% from a year earlier, according to the World Gold Council. Russia had more than 2,000 tons of gold at the end of January, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, accounting for just over 20% of its reserves. It’s the fifth-biggest sovereign gold owner globally.

2/28/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's central bank on Monday sharply raised its key policy rate to 20%, a day after announcing a slew of measures to support domestic markets, as it scrambled to manage the fallout of harsh Western sanctions in retaliation against Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The bank hiked the key rate from 9.5% to counter risks of rouble depreciation and higher inflation, and also ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues. ""External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,"" the central bank said in a statement, adding that the rate hike 'will ensure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risk."" Monday's steps bolster other measures announced on Sunday, which include the central bank's assurance that it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions. It also increased the range of securities that can be used as collateral to get loans and ordered market players to reject foreign clients' bids to sell Russian securities. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a briefing at 1300 GMT, the bank said in its statement on Monday. The steps came after Western allies ratcheted up sanctions on Saturday, taking action to banish big Russian banks from the main global payments system SWIFT and announced other measures to limit Moscow's use of a $630 billion war chest to undermine sanctions. The new set of sanctions were likely to deal a devastating blow to the Russian economy and make it hard for Russian banks and companies to access the international financial system. The rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the dollar on Monday. RUN ON BANKS? Russians waited in long queues outside ATMs on Sunday, worried that new Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine will trigger cash shortages and disrupt payments. ""A bank run has already started in Russia over the weekend ... and inflation will immediately spike massively, and the Russian banking system is likely to be in trouble,"" said Jeffrey Halley, Asia-based senior market analyst at OANDA. Nomura analysts said the fresh reprisal measures by the West against Russia is likely to have wider global implications. ""These sanctions from the West are likely to eventually hurt trade flows out of Russia (around 80% of FX transactions handled by Russian financial institutions are denominated in USD), which will also hurt the growth outlook of Russia's key trading partners including Europe and lead to greater inflationary pressures and risk of stagflation, we think,"" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. Energy major BP opened a new front in the West's campaign to isolate Russia's economy, with its decision to abandon its stake in state oil company Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion, the most aggressive move yet by a company in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian business operations of other Western corporations are also in the spotlight as governments tighten the financial screws on Moscow Several European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, majority owned by the Russian government, are failing or likely to fail due to the reputational cost of the war in Ukraine, the European Central Bank, the lenders' supervisor, said on Monday. FINANCIAL STABILITY The Russian central bank in several announcements on Sunday sought to ensure financial stability. It said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market from Feb. 28. It added that customers of sanctioned banks would be unable to use their bank cards outside Russia, and that cards issued by the sanctioned banks won't work on Google Pay or Apple Pay. It also ordered market players to reject attempts by foreign clients to sell Russian securities, according to a central bank document seen by Reuters. That could complicate plans by the sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Australia, which said they planned to wind down exposure to Russian-listed companies. In a bid to inject cash into the financial system, the central bank said there would be no limit at a ""fine-tuning"" repo auction it plans to hold on Monday and added that the banking system remained stable after the new sanctions targeting Russia's financial institutions. The central bank said bank cards were working as normal and that customers' funds could be accessed at any time. It said it would substantially increase the range of securities that can be used as collateral to get central bank loans. The central bank also said it is temporarily easing restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions after the sanctions. The measure, allowing banks suffering from ""external circumstances"" to keep positions above the official limits, will be in place until July 1, it said in a statement. The central bank said that it would continue to monitor changes in currency positions ""in order to guarantee the normal functioning of the currency and money markets and the financial stability of lending institutions"".

2/28/2022,"By David French and Megan Davies NEW YORK (Reuters) - Western sanctions on Moscow could throw the small but lucrative Russian investment banking business that several large U.S. banks have maintained into question, lawyers said, which could deal a hit to tens of millions of dollars in fees. Major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, have continued to underwrite and advise on Russian deals, often alongside the investment banking arm of state-owned VTB. VTB Capital is the largest investment bank by fees in Russia. But U.S. sanctions placed on Thursday on VTB and Sberbank in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine make the prospect of doing so in the future difficult, lawyers said. That's only been compounded by the moves to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system, announced Saturday. All the U.S. banks declined comment. Under the U.S. sanctions, any assets of VTB, including 20 subsidiaries, that touched the U.S financial system would be frozen and U.S. persons would be prohibited from dealing with them. The sanctions against VTB, which one lawyer said were as severe as those placed against terrorist organizations, would raise new reputation and compliance risks for banks doing business in Russia and make it impossible for U.S. banks to work with VTB on any deals, that lawyer said. ""These are very strong sanctions on the financial system,"" said Clay Lowery, executive vice president at the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based bank group. One of the lawyers who advises financial institutions said the sanctions were ""a brick wall,"" and for banks there was now a reputation risk of dealing with Russia, even when it is not one of the sanctioned entities. Ross Delston, a U.S. lawyer and former banking regulator, said that the moves on SWIFT would result in Russia being viewed as ""radioactive"" by banks in the U.S. and Europe. Still, some see a future for U.S. banks in Russia despite the measures. A source familiar with one U.S. bank in Moscow said that they were working out how to apply the sanctions and recognized there would be an impact on how to conduct investment banking business. But the source added that the bank was not considering pulling out of the country. A source close to another U.S. bank said that even if VTB could not be in deals such as IPOs or M&A, other banks could replace it - as long as those banks are not also subjected to sanctions. That source said the sanctions were not an insurmountable problem for the international banks, adding that there were other segments of the market and sources of revenue for international banks. VTB said in a statement on Thursday that sanctions had ""been a reality for us over the past few years"" and the bank has ""had time to learn the lessons and prepare for the most severe scenario."" The bank did not respond to follow up questions. Investment banking business in Russia has been dwindling since 2014, when the United States sanctioned Moscow for invading Crimea. But U.S. banks managed to retain a toehold in the market. Russia accounted for 0.27% of the global fee pot last year, including advisory and underwriting fees on mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets. In 2013, Russia accounted for nearly 1% of the fee pool. Even so, the number translates to sizeable fees. The investment banking arm of Russia's No.2 bank, VTB Capital, collected $142.9 million - or a third - of the fees earned in Russia in 2021, Refinitiv data showed. JPMorgan was second overall with $32.8 million, Morgan Stanley fourth, generating $27.3 million, and Citigroup fifth with $22.8 million, while Goldman Sachs was seventh, generating $19.5 million.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest bond market is signaling concern that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could lead to an economic outcome the Federal Reserve is eager to avoid: persistent inflation and weak economic growth. Most Read from Bloomberg EU Discusses Sanctions on Tycoons; Oil Soars: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ West Cuts Some Russian Banks From SWIFT, Sanctions Central Bank Bond-market gauges of short-term inflation expectations jumped to a record during the past week as oil and natural gas surged in the unfolding crisis. At the same time, the gap between short- and long-term yields narrowed, indicating expectations of an economic slowdown. Investors scooped up Treasuries that provide protection against inflation even as traders priced in that the Fed will cut rates in 2024 following the series of hikes expected to begin next month. Bank of America Corp. strategists advised clients to start positioning for stagflation, a mix of rising prices and stagnant growth that the U.S. hasn’t seen in a generation. “This Russia-Ukraine crisis has accelerated the stagflation trend,” said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “Higher commodity prices will cause growth to slow down and boost inflation. The Fed will be even further behind the curve.” The Treasury market briefly served as a refuge for investors after the Russian invasion set stock prices sliding worldwide. But equities rebounded, and yields followed suit as anticipation of rising interest rates moved back to the foreground. The benchmark 10-year yield ended the week just below 2%, near the highs hit earlier this month. Yet two-year yields jumped even more, narrowing the gap between the two to just under 40 basis points from 45.5 basis points a week earlier. The coming week will be pivotal for investors seeking to gauge the outcome of the Fed’s mid-March meeting, when it’s widely expected to start raising its policy rate from near zero, where it’s been since early in the pandemic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, providing insight before policy makers enter their pre-meeting communications blackout period. On Friday, the Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report, which is expected to show wage pressures accelerated even as payroll growth slowed amid a tight labor market. While the Ukraine crisis led traders to mark down the odds of a half-percentage-point hike in March, they continue to anticipate a steep but short tightening cycle. The implied yields on eurodollar futures maturing in 2024 are about 17 basis points lower than those for the 2023 contract, suggesting that traders are pricing in a high probability of a rate cut within three years. “The takeaway is that inflation will stay elevated, and the expected Fed tightening is going to be the catalyst for slower growth,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. “I won’t call it stagflation. Growth isn’t stagnant but is going to slow down, coupled with that inflation impulse is going to persist for a little longer.” The conflict in Ukraine, Europe’s largest land war since 1945, threatens to worsen two key points of vulnerability in the post-pandemic global economy: high inflation and jittery markets. The escalation of the conflict sparked a major reversal this week of fortunes for Treasury inflation-protected securities -- known as TIPS --- as fears over more price pressures mounted. These securities compensate investors for the hit of inflation and therefore yield less than their plain-vanilla Treasury counterparts. The demand for TIPS had faltered in January and early February as Fed officials began to adopt a more hawkish tone. Yet it rebounded after the invasion, with the inrush driving the the yield on five-year TIPS down by as much as 39 basis points on Thursday, touching negative 1.61%. The yield rebounded to finish the week at around negative 1.2%. Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America, said the war in Ukraine increases the risk of stagflation and missteps by the Fed. “Portfolios should position for stagflation and dollar debasement,” he wrote in a note with his colleagues.

Buffett, who has faced mounting pressure on environmental issues over the years, typically navigates the topic by referring back to Berkshire’s operating model, where each company has individual responsibility for how it addresses such risks. Abel’s letter marks one of the most comprehensive explanations of the firm’s environmental strategy in a Berkshire annual report yet, while also cementing his ascent to the top job as and when Buffett steps down. “It has a tremendous signaling effect,” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. “It’s perhaps the first sign of a true transition at the helm here. He has tasked his successor with specifically commenting on their efforts -- particularly as it relates to environmental issues and sustainability -- I think it’s a powerful statement.” Abel, who rose to prominence at Berkshire as a key manager of the energy operations and now oversees all of the non-insurance businesses which include more than 320,000 employees, outlined how a variety of businesses -- namely the BNSF railroad and energy operations -- are handling emissions goals and environmental efforts. BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy represent more than 90% of Berkshire’s direct emissions, he wrote. “Berkshire’s businesses are exceptionally well positioned to deliver on ever-changing customer expectations regarding sustainability, in both resources and attitude, while also driving value for Berkshire’s shareholders,” the Berkshire vice chairman said. “I am supportive of these outlined objectives and fully committed to Berkshire’s ongoing journey of delivering sustainable solutions.” Abel also signaled that Berkshire would continue Buffett’s decentralized approach to the environment under his own rein. Managers of its units will continue to own all business decisions including their approach to sustainability, he wrote. Among the sustainability goals Abel outlined: BHE will retire 16 coal units between 2022 and 2030, in addition to the 16 units it’s already retired -- a step that will help it cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. As the company deploys more non-carbon generation instead, BHE plans to retire all remaining coal units by 2049, with its fleet of natural gas units phased out by 2050. This will allow the business to achieve net zero greenhouse-gas emissions overall, Abel said. For BNSF, Abel said the company will continue its improvements in fuel efficiency and increase its use of renewable diesel fuel, as it targets a 30% reduction in its GHG emissions by 2030. “Other subsidiaries, of course, are important, but Berkshire will have failed if BHE and BNSF do not achieve their GHG emissions reduction goals,” Abel wrote. Abel also touted the energy business’s investment in renewable energy. It recently proposed a $3.9 billion wind and solar project in Iowa that could rank among the renewable energy industry’s biggest yet. Buffett similarly touched on sustainability in his annual letter. BNSF -- which he called the number one artery of American commerce -- is a cleaner alternative to truck haulage, he said. The billionaire investor also teed up Abel’s letter by noting that the energy business had no wind or solar generation in 2000, but now is a huge player in that space. “The profile you will find there is not in any way one of those currently-fashionable green-washing stories,” Buffett said of Abel’s letter. On Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s website, “you will see that the company has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up all of its earnings.” BNSF, as well as Berkshire’s utility operations, helped the conglomerate’s quarterly operating profit climb to $7.29 billion, the second highest level in data going back to 2010. The company’s cash pile ended the year at $146.7 billion, as decent deals remained scarce, prompting Buffett to lean on buybacks to deploy the hoard. Governance issues On some other key social and governance issues, Buffett remained quiet, including the changing make-up of Berkshire’s board which sped-up following the announcement that long-serving member Tom Murphy would step down. Buffett didn’t mention whether or not his spot would be filled. Despite giving Abel space to pen his own letter, Buffett made little mention of his role succeeding the billionaire investor as Berkshire’s chief executive officer. But nonetheless, it was a chance to get some insight into the executive, said James Armstrong, who manages assets including Berkshire shares as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. “It makes all the sense in the world to give shareholders the chance to hear from Greg,” he said.

The Norwegian fund owns 1.03% of Apple's shares, making it the company's eighth largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data. The maker of iPhones, computers and other devices is due to hold its annual meeting of shareholders on March 4.

2/28/2022,"It’s a particularly busy week ahead on the economic calendar, with 80 stats due out through the week ending 4th March. In the week prior, 57 stats had been in focus. ISM Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing PMI, ADP nonfarm employment change, and initial jobless claims will draw attention Monday through Thursday. Friday’s nonfarm payroll figures for February will be the key driver, however. Away from the economic calendar, geopolitical news will also provide direction. Hopes of the FED hitting pause on rate hikes weighed on the Dollar on Friday. With geopolitics in focus, U.S President Joe Biden’s State of the Union Speech will also draw interest after the U.S market close on Monday. Following Biden will be FED Chair Powell, who is due to give testimony on Wednesday and Thursday. In the week ending 25th February, the Dollar Spot Index rose by 0.55% to 96.615. Private sector PMIs for Italy and Spain and finalized PMIs for France, Germany, and the Eurozone will draw interest. Expect the Eurozone’s PMIs to have more influence. German retail sales, unemployment, and trade data will also draw plenty of interest. On the monetary policy front, the ECB meeting minutes are due out on Thursday. The impact may be less than normal, however. In response to the Russia invasion of Ukraine, the ECB stated that it is carrying out an impact analysis and will do what is needed to deliver on its mandate. For the week, the EUR fell by 0.72% to $1.1268. Finalized private sector PMIs for February will be in focus. The markets will be looking for any revisions to the services PMI. The Pound slid by 1.14% to end the week at $1.3409. 4th quarter GDP numbers are due out early in the week. The Bank of Canada monetary policy decision will be the main event.

Retail sales, 4th quarter GDP, and trade data will draw interest in the week. We expect the retail sales figures to have a more marked impact on the Aussie Dollar. Away from the numbers, Tuesday’s RBA monetary policy decision and forward guidance will be the main event of the week. The Aussie Dollar rallied by 1.25% to $0.7226. It’s a quiet week ahead, with stats limited to business confidence figures. While the number will draw interest, market risk sentiment and economic data from China will also provide direction. The Kiwi Dollar ended the week up by 1.38% to $0.6743. Industrial production, retail sales, and 4th quarter capital spending figures are due from Japan. Expect the industrial production numbers and retail sales figures to have more impact. The Japanese Yen fell by 0.11% to end the week at ¥115.550 against the U.S Dollar.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Seritage Growth Properties, a real estate investment trust that emerged from the Sears bankruptcy, is exploring strategic alternatives including a sale of the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says New York-based Seritage, which owns property from Alaska to Florida, is working with the investment bank Barclays Plc on the plans. Seritage is open to a full sale of the company or piecemeal disposal of assets, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The plans aren’t final and the company could still decide to change course. A representative for Seritage declined to comment while a representative for Barclays couldn’t be reached for comment. Prospective buyers could include private equity firms, real estate companies and former Sears Chief Executive Officer Eddie Lampert, who currently serves as chairman of Seritage, the people added. Lampert owns a 22.1% interest in the company and owns about 9.3% of the Class A shares, according to a filing last November. A representative for Lampert didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Since Andrea Olshan took over as CEO of Seritage a year ago, she has sought to refocus the company and divest non-core properties to raise capital for developing more profitable sites. Its strategy has been to try to attract new tenants and redevelop former Sears properties at malls across the country. The company has terminated its leases connected to Sears and said in a press release last year that, as of March 2021, it has no remaining exposure to Sears or Kmart. Sears Holdings Corp. filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Its portfolio has interests in 170 properties comprised of approximately 10 million square feet of gross leasable area, a filing showed. Seritage shares closed at $9.22 apiece on Friday, giving the company a market value of about $402 million. Its shares have fallen about 54% year over year. Seritage has a $1.44 billion loan from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The company and Warren Buffett’s investment firm renegotiated the loan, according to a filing from earlier this year, and extended its maturity to 2025.

2/28/2022,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shares in energy firms and payment service companies rose sharply on Chinese markets on Monday as investors bet on stocks they saw potentially benefiting from the conflict in Ukraine, while a major fund house repeated a warning against speculation. In a statement on Monday, GF Fund Management said that the price of its fund for qualified domestic institutional investors tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration and Production Index was ""significantly higher"" than net asset value. ""Investors who blindly invest in funds at a high premium to net asset value may suffer large losses,"" the statement said, adding that the fund was operating normally. It was GF's second such risk statement since Friday, after investors betting on a jump in oil prices jolted the fund's share price higher in secondary markets. Chinese payment-related stocks jumped as investors wagered that the United States and Europe kicking Russia out of the SWIFT global payment system would benefit China's own cross-border payment system and accelerate the development of the country's digital currency, the e-CNY. Ratcheting up sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States and Europe said on Saturday they would banish big Russian banks from SWIFT and announced other measures to limit Moscow's use of a $630 billion war chest. Investors speculating on the impact of the news pushed shares of leading Chinese companies involved in developing digital yuan payment infrastructure higher, including Newland Digital Technology Co, Lakala Payment Co and Client Service International Inc, despite weakness in the broader market. A sub-index tracking the internet finance sector jumped more than 2% early in the trading day before trimming gains. The SWIFT sanctions against Russia ""is a milestone event that will accelerate the process of de-dollarisation,"" wrote Dang Congyu, analyst at Founder Securities. ""Although it's hard to replace SWIFT in the short term, this incident is very beneficial to yuan's globalisation over the long run."" The view was echoed by Guosheng Securities, who recommended Chinese payment-related stocks, citing the potential of China's own payment system, CIPS, and digital yuan, to break the dollar's hegemony. Against the backdrop of global power competition, the digital yuan ""will pay a key role in promoting the yuan's global status, and its development will accelerate,"" analysts Liu Gaochang and Yang Ran wrote.

2/28/2022,"Biden administration officials and Democrat senators are considering a suspension of the federal fuel tax in order to combat record inflation levels ahead of the Federal Reserve’s planned rate hikes. The proposition has received bipartisan pushback from legislators who are skeptical about the efficacy of a gas tax holiday. According to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank which collects data and publishes research studies on U.S. tax policies at both the federal and state levels, suspending the fuel tax would actually do more harm than good for surging prices. “Cutting the gas tax makes gasoline relatively cheaper. Therefore, on the margin, people are going to be more likely to choose to drive instead of using some other mode of transportation (or not taking a trip at all),” Tax Foundation Federal Policy Analyst Alex Muresianu told Yahoo Finance. “That means higher demand for gasoline, which drives price increases.” Economists are mixed on whether gas tax holidays actually lower gas prices due to the resulting spike in demand. However, a temporary suspension would likely have a serious impact on funding for the Biden administration’s infrastructure promises. Muresianu also noted that although temporarily suspending the federal gas tax would be a smaller program than the March 2021 American Rescue Plan (ARP), it, like the ARP, would provide more fiscal stimulus than the gap between the economy’s current position and its potential. “In the context of the whole economy, reducing or eliminating the gas tax would exacerbate inflation,” Muresianu wrote in his article. “Currently, demand in the economy, boosted by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, far outstrips supply, plagued with its own problems driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects.” And while the proposed legislation states that consumers will “immediately receive the benefit of the reduction in taxes,” Muresianu is doubtful of the ability for Congress to enforce this piece of the bill. He pointed to studies suggesting that only around 70% of a gas tax suspension would be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, while oil companies would capture the remaining benefits. Muresianu believes the idea behind the gas tax holiday bill ignores the structural reasons behind rising gas prices, which he cited as being a mismatch between supply and demand. Demand for gas has recovered to pre-pandemic levels as Americans are hitting the road once again—travel on U.S. roads rose 11.2% in December 2021 compared with December 2020—but domestic production has not yet recovered to 2019 highs. In addition, overseas pressures such as the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War are adding on to the oil supply crunch. In any case, Muresianu said that the expansionary fiscal policy in a suspension of the federal gas tax is “the wrong way to deal with inflation.” Instead, he believes policymakers should pursue structural reforms to encourage productivity growth and physical capital investment, thereby raising the economy’s long-term productive capacity, making supply chains more resilient to future shocks, and putting downward pressure on inflation. “A particularly good policy in this case is full expensing for capital investment, which would make investment in say structures and machines fully deductible when they’re made, just like salaries and other day-to-day expenses,” he told Yahoo Finance. “This would make companies more likely to invest in things like additional warehouse capacity or transportation resources that make handling changes in demand easier. However, these kinds of effects would take a while to show up, so in the short term it’s mostly just letting the COVID-era stimulus wear off and not further raising the deficit this year.” Thomas Hum is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

2/28/2022,"Following Western sanctions on Russia’s financial institutions in response to the invasion of Ukraine, customers of several of the country’s largest banks can no longer use their debit and credit cards in conjunction with Apple Pay and Google Pay.

However, they won’t work overseas, and they can’t be used to make online purchases from retailers registered in countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia.

2/28/2022,"If you thought inflation was the worst thing that could happen economically as the world grapples with a post-pandemic recovery, get ready for stagflation. The term hasn’t been needed much since the 1970s. Stagflation describes an economy with higher-than-normal inflation and unemployment rates but little to no economic growth. The last time the U.S. economy entered such a state was in the 1970s, when former President Richard Nixon took the United States off the gold standard. The term has recently become a hot topic again among economists and analysts, and it’s not something to look forward to. With bitcoin seen by many digital-asset investors as a hedge against inflation, and by others as a risky asset whose price could fall during a lousy economic stretch, the ""S-word"" might soon start creeping into the lexicon of the crypto-markets narrative. Since 1960, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks has averaged +2.5% per quarter, but during periods of stagflation, it saw a 2.5% decline, Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy, told CoinDesk. With the consumer price index rising 7.5% over the past 12 months, the highest inflation since 1982, analysts are already worried, and recent tensions in Eastern Europe make things even more dicey. Oil prices went over $100 a barrel after Russian president Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, and the possibility of losing access to other Russian commodities has been driving prices for other raw materials as well. “Stagflation is a reality,” said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank. “Because of the positive correlation between crypto and the NASDAQ (it keeps getting tighter and tighter as time goes on) the stagflation playbook could certainly hurt the crypto markets,” he wrote in a note. He predicts high demand for Treasury bonds, U.S. dollars, gold, consumer staples and real estate, and he's bullish on small-cap stocks – companies with a market capitalization below $2 billion – and tech. “Bouts of stagflation have historically been associated with declining profit margins, as companies face higher prices and dwindling sales,” said Bauer. “In periods of stagflation, the demand for defensive assets increases,"" he said.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc moved to dump its shares in oil giant Rosneft PJSC, taking a financial hit of as much as $25 billion by joining the campaign to isolate Russia’s economy. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says The surprise move from the British company is the latest sign of how far Western powers are willing to go to punish President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine. BP has been in Russia for three decades and just weeks ago was staunchly defending its presence there. But it was coming under growing pressure from the U.K. government over the alliance with Rosneft. Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney was summoned by U.K. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to explain the company’s Russian links last week. Kwarteng welcomed BP’s move on Sunday. “This military action represents a fundamental change,” BP Chairman Helge Lund said in a statement. “It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue.” BP didn’t say whether it was planning to sell its roughly 20% stake in Rosneft, or simply walk away. Any potential buyer would have to navigate a tightening web of economic sanctions that would make any transaction extremely difficult. In a memo to employees, Looney said there would be “financial consequences” from the move that would show up in its next quarterly results. A spokesperson said there could be a writedown of as much as $25 billion. The London-based company did confirm that it would no longer account for its share of oil and gas reserves, production and profit from its stake in Rosneft. Looney will also resign with immediate effect from the Russian company’s board, as will his predecessor Bob Dudley. BP will also exit its other business in Russia, which include three joint ventures with a carrying value on its books of about $1.4 billion. Financial Shock The move -- and the associated financial costs -- will come as a surprise to investors on Monday. BP shares have risen 15% this year, bolstered by rising oil prices even as Russian forces were massing on Ukraine’s border. In early February, Looney was still arguing that BP could “avoid politics” in Russia, which was “a large member of the energy system.” The shock of Putin’s large military incursion into Ukraine made that position untenable. BP has a longer history in Russia than many of its peers. It was one of the first Western oil majors to establish a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. John Browne, the chief executive officer at the time, bought a stake in Sidanco in the 1990s, which eventually morphed into TNK-BP, a joint venture with a group of billionaires. That gave BP direct operational control of Russian oil fields, with large numbers of expat staff in the country. It was highly profitable, but also fraught with tension between the oligarchs and their Western partners. A bitter battle for control in 2012 ultimately resulted in BP exchanging its stake in TNK-BP for $17 billion in cash and a large chunk of Rosneft shares. BP’s stake in the Kremlin-controlled oil producer had a lot of symbolism, marking the continuation of three decades of operating in the country, but in many practical ways the alliance was shallower than it appears. While BP reported its share of Rosneft production, reserves and profit for accounting purposes, it didn’t have direct stakes in any of Rosneft’s fields nor physical access to the hydrocarbons they produced. The London-based company did receive regular dividends from Rosneft, which last year amounted to $640 million, compared with BP’s total operational cash flow of $23.6 billion. Rosneft said the move “destroys the successful 30-year cooperation” of the two companies. “The decision was made under unprecedented pressure from politically engaged forces,” it said in a statement on its website. BP had the largest interest in Russian oil and gas, but its Big Oil peers also hold important stakes in the country. TotalEnergies SE’s operations in Russia represent around $1.5 billion of its total cash flow, or around 5%. It has a stake in gas producer Novatek as well as a large interest in the Yamal LNG project. Shell Plc has a large holding in the Gazprom PJSC-led LNG project Sakhalin Energy, while Chevron Corp. and Exxon Corp. have a presence in lubricants.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Equities fell Monday, sovereign bonds rallied and commodities surged amid heightened uncertainty after Western nations escalated sanctions on Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says Banks led declines in Europe’s Stoxx 600 Index, with Raiffeisen Bank International AG down as much as 18%. U.S. futures also slid, while utilities and defense stocks gained. Oil, natural gas, wheat and palladium jumped, with Brent crude again soaring above $100 a barrel on fears of commodity-supply disruptions. Rallies in a dollar gauge, gold and Treasuries underlined the demand for havens. The euro fell on worries about risks for Europe’s economy, which relies on Russian energy. An Asia-Pacific equity index ticked up. The fresh Western penalties further isolate commodity-rich Russia from global finance by seeking to prevent its central bank from using foreign reserves to blunt sanctions. They also exclude some Russian lenders from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins trillions of dollars worth of transactions. Doubts are now growing about the Bank of Russia’s ability to backstop Russia’s financial system. The nation hiked interest rates to 20% from 9.5%, mandated sales of foreign-currency revenue by exporters and temporarily banned non-residents from selling securities. The ruble fell 8% at the open in Moscow. There’s speculation that monetary authorities may have to supply markets with dollars to fill holes in global banking created by the SWIFT step. The escalating Ukraine conflict and more severe Western sanctions are roiling markets. The hostilities threaten to stoke inflation by imperiling flows of key resources such as grains, energy and metals, exacerbating the pandemic-era price pressures that were already weighing on world growth. A key question is how all this may affect the Federal Reserve’s plan for a series of interest-rate hikes starting in March. Markets now see smaller chances of an aggressive Fed liftoff, and anticipate just under six hikes in 2022. “We’re just a few days into a kind of once-in-a-lifetime reorientation in the global order,” Homin Lee, Asia macro strategist as Lombard Odier, said on Bloomberg Television. “This transition is not going to be a smooth one” and uncertainties will remain very high in the next few weeks, he said. In Russia, citizens were lining up at cash machines around the country to withdraw foreign currency, fearful of a ruble collapse. Russian bonds were cut to below investment grade by S&P Global Ratings on Friday. BP Plc’s shares dropped the most in three months after its decision to offload its stake in Rosneft PJSC was given little chance of attracting a buyer. The London-based company already warned that it could take a financial hit of as much as $25 billion from exiting Russia. Norway plans to excise Russian assets from its $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund. Meanwhile, European defense stocks jumped after Germany said it will increase defense spending in a historic policy shift. Rheinmetall AG surged as much as 49%. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced skepticism about talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials at the Belarus border that could get underway within hours. Ukraine said a delegation led by its defense minister had arrived at the border. The Washington Post reported that Belarus is preparing to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to help its ally Moscow. The conflict is “likely to boost energy prices significantly, resulting in immediate inflationary effects and a large drag on global growth,” Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at Federated Hermes, wrote in a note. “It’s fair to say that the crisis increases the room for central banks’ policy mistakes.” What to watch this week: President Joe Biden State of the Union address, Tuesday Reserve Bank of Australia policy decision, Tuesday Fed Chair Jerome Powell testifies to Congress on monetary policy, Wednesday and Thursday OPEC+ meeting, Wednesday Eurozone CPI, Wednesday Bank of Canada rate decision, Wednesday ECB publishes the account of its February meeting, Thursday U.S. unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, Friday Some of the main moves in markets: Stocks The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.7% as of 9:01 a.m. London time Futures on the S&P 500 fell 1.8% Futures on the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.5% Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4% The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1% The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 1.5% Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.5% The euro fell 0.8% to $1.1175 The Japanese yen was little changed at 115.57 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 6.3097 per dollar The British pound fell 0.3% to $1.3366 Bonds The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined five basis points to 1.91% Germany’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 0.17% Britain’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 1.44% Commodities Brent crude rose 4.1% to $101.92 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.5% to $1,899.52 an ounce Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Wall Street’s Risky ‘Razor Blade’ Trade Is Making a Comeback A Pandemic Baby Bump Shines a Spotlight on the Nordic Welfare Model Cyberwar: How Nations Attack Without Bullets or Bombs Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•48 minutes ago,"Equity Markets, Ruble Fall as West Isolates Russia: Markets Wrap",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euro-slides-yen-jumps-west-195946638.html

2/28/2022,"Mortgage rates held relatively steady after a spike in early February. In the week ending 24th February, 30-year fixed rates slipped by three basis points to 3.89%. 30-year fixed rates had jumped by 23 basis points in the week prior. 30-year fixed rates held above the 3% mark for a 15th consecutive week. Compared to this time last year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 92 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 105 basis points, however, since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. U.S economic data was on the light side in the first half of the week. Private sector PMI and consumer confidence figures for February were in focus. The numbers were positive, with a sharp pickup in service sector activity positive for U.S Treasury yields. In February, the services PMI jumped from 51.2 to 56.7, driving the composite PMI from 51.1 to 56.0. While private-sector PMIs were positive, consumer confidence weakened. In February, the CB Consumer Confidence Index slipped from 111.1 to 110.5. While the stats were upbeat, geopolitics weighed on demand for riskier assets in the week. The weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 24th February were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates slipped by 3 basis points to 3.89% in the week. This time last year, rates stood at 2.87%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates fell by 1 basis point to 3.14% in the week. Rates were up by 80 basis points from 2.34% a year ago. The average fee fell from 0.8 points to 0.7 points. 5-year fixed rates held steady at 2.98%. Rates were down by 1 basis point from 2.99% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Despite the decline in mortgage rates, rates have increased by more than a full percent in six months. Economic growth remains strong while rising inflation impacts consumer sentiment, which has taken a hit at the turn of the year. Higher mortgage rates and low inventories will likely support a further upward trend in house prices before easing back later in the year. For the week ending 18th February, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.05% to 4.06%. Points increased from 0.45 to 0.48 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.01% to 4.09%. Points fell from 0.59 to 0.56 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 3.81% to 3.84%. Points rose from 0.39 to 0.45 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, tumbled by 13.1% in the week ending 18th February. The Index had fallen by 5.4% in the previous week. The Refinance Index slid by 16% and was 56% lower than the same week one year ago. In the week prior, the Index had fallen 9%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 52.8 to 50.1%. In the previous week, the share had declined from 56.2% to 52.8%. According to the MBA, Mortgage applications fell to their lowest level since December 2019, weighed by the upward trend in mortgage rates. Higher mortgage rates have hit refinances, with refinance activity down in six of the first seven weeks of the year. While the average loan size did not increase in the week, it hovered around last week’s survey record high of $453,000. From the U.S, ISM Manufacturing and ADP nonfarm employment change figures will be key early in the week. While the stats will draw attention, geopolitics will be the key driver. Last Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine, driving demand for the safe-havens. Progress towards an end to the invasion would support a further pickup in mortgage rates.

2/28/2022,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs expects a rise in the prices of commodities that Russia is a major producer of and lifted its short-term Brent crude forecast as the West stepped up political and economic sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. ""The range of near-term price outcomes for commodities has become extreme, given the concern of further military escalation, energy sanctions or potential for a cease-fire."" Goldman said in a note to clients on Sunday. Russia's political and economic isolation deepened on Monday as its forces met stiff resistance in Ukraine's capital and other cities in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Further, ""we expect the price of consumed commodities that Russia is a key producer of to rally from here - this includes oil, European gas (and hence aluminum), palladium, nickel, wheat and corn,"" Goldman said. The bank raised its one-month Brent crude oil price forecast to $115 a barrel from $95 per barrel previously, with ""significant upside risks on further escalation or longer disruption."" Brent crude futures on Monday rose to well above the key $100 a barrel level as the Ukraine crisis deepened, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were near $96 a barrel. ""The recent escalation with Russia create clear stagflationary risks to the broader economy, driven by higher energy prices, which reinforce our conviction in higher gold prices in coming months and our $2,150/toz (troy ounce) price target,"" Goldman said. Spot gold on Monday was trading at over $1,900 per ounce, and set for its best month since May. ""Gold’s unique role as the currency of last resort will likely be apparent if restrictions on Russia’s central bank accessing its offshore reserves leave it leveraging its large domestic gold stockpiles to continue foreign trade, most likely with China,"" the bank said.

2/28/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian central bank raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% on Monday in an emergency move, and authorities told export-focused companies to be ready to sell foreign currency as the rouble tumbled to record lows. The rouble hit a low of 120 to the dollar on electronic currency trading platform EBS after President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday, while the West imposed harsh sanctions against Russia. The central bank, which says it targets inflation at 4% and will do all necessary to ensure financial stability, said the rate increase will bring deposit rates to levels ""needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risks"". ""This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect citizens' savings from depreciation,"" it said. The rate hike to levels above the 17% seen in 2014 when Russian annexed Crimea from Ukraine comes after Western countries moved to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. ""External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,"" the central bank said in a statement. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a briefing at 1300 GMT, the bank said. In another attempt to support the rouble, the central bank and the finance ministry said they will jointly decide on ordering Russian exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues on the market. The recent moves add to a slew of measures announced since Thursday to support domestic markets, as the state scrambles to manage the broadening fallout from Western sanctions. Russian authorities have also ordered brokers to suspend short selling on the Russian market and stop executing orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian securities. ""These measures may help calm down increased market nervousness, but at the same time they undermine the foundation of the monetary policy, focused on inflationary targeting and flexible exchange rate,"" BCS Global markets said in a note. ""Unfavourable external environment made Russia's monetary policy unsustainable and we do not rule out a possible rate hike going forward or further unexpected and non-market decisions.""

2/28/2022,"Trading volumes between the Russian ruble and bitcoin increased to 9-month highs as the country's fiat currency plunged to record lows due to the fallout from Ukraine invasion. Data tracked by Kaiko, a Paris-based cryptocurrency research provider, shows that ruble (RUB)-denominated bitcoin volume surged to nearly 1.5 billion RUB on Thursday, hitting the highest since May. ""The activity was concentrated on Binance,"" Kaiko's research analyst Clara Medalie told CoinDesk in an email. ""Bitcoin-Ukrainian hryvnia volume has also spiked, but not as high as October levels. BTC-UAH only trades on 2 exchanges – Binance and LocalBitcoin."" Similar trends were observed in tether-ruble and tether-hryvnia trading volumes, Medalie added. Tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market value, offers the unique feature of price stability in the often volatile world of cryptocurrencies by maintaining a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Kaiko data show USDT/RUB trading volume also rose to an eight-month high of 1.3 billion RUB on Thursday. The spike in the ruble-based crypto trading volume came as investors scrambled to move out of the ruble, fearing stricter sanctions from the West. The Russian currency plunged over 8% to 90 per U.S. dollar last week and extended the slide by another 28% early today, reaching a record low of 118 per dollar, according to Bloomberg data. Gold, U.S. treasuries, the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc have been the beneficiaries of the flight to safety. Over the weekend, the U.S. and its allies stepped up punitive measures against Russia, intending to stop its banks from accessing the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the messaging network underpinning global financial transactions. The European Union banned all transactions with the Russian central bank in a bid to prevent it from selling overseas assets to support its banks. Early Monday, Russia's President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's nuclear deterrence force to be on high alert.

2/28/2022,"(Recasts and updates throughout with more listing venue detail) By Scott Murdoch and Anshuman Daga SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio Inc plans to carry out secondary listings by introduction in Hong Kong and Singapore as it seeks to grow its business in the region. Stock exchange filings on Monday showed the New York-listed firm had received preliminary approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to trade its shares in the city, while the Singapore Exchange was reviewing an application for a secondary listing on the main bourse of that board. Shanghai-based Nio said the Class A shares are due to start trading on March 10 in Hong Kong under the code 9866 once it receives final approval from the stock exchange. Its primary listing will remain in New York, the company said. Unlike a typical initial public offering (IPO) or secondary listing, companies listing stock by introduction raise no capital and issue no new shares. The mechanism was popular among companies in the past looking to build a brand in Hong Kong and the rest of Greater China. The decision to pursue an listing by introduction was ordered by the company to not dilute or put further pressure on its stock by issuing new shares in Hong Kong and Singapore, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Singapore was chosen as a listing venue because of the company's desire to grow its EV market share in that region, the source added. The source could not be named as the information was not yet public. Nio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Singapore Exchange spokesperson declined to comment on Nio's listing application. The spokesperson said SGX had nearly 30 secondary listings from companies from diverse sectors and geographies as firms look to broaden their access to a wider range of investors while using the city-state as a launchpad into Southeast Asia. Nio's New York shares have fallen nearly 34% so far this year. Nio had planned to list in Hong Kong last year but faced questions from regulators over its company structure, including a ""users trust"", Bloomberg reported in September.
