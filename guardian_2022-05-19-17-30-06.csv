5/19/2022,"The Australian office of the eSafety Commissioner has issued eight notices to websites hosting the Buffalo terrorist attack video or manifesto, but has not blocked any from being accessed in Australia. On Saturday, an 18-year-old white man allegedly opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle at the Tops Friendly Market in a predominantly Black neighbourhood of Buffalo, New York. According to US authorities, as he struck 13 people with gunfire, killing 10, he used a camera to livestream the rampage, and posted a 180-page manifesto online. In the aftermath of the Christchurch attack, which the alleged Buffalo shooter reportedly referenced in the manifesto, the Australian government swiftly passed new laws to empower the eSafety commissioner to order internet service providers in Australia to block sites hosting the related video or manifesto. It was later enshrined into Australia’s Online Safety Act in 2020. After the Buffalo terrorist attack, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, determined the video and manifesto was subject to removal under the Online Safety Act, and issued notices to eight overseas-hosted websites to remove the content, giving each site 24 hours notice. The letters warned the sites that individuals could be fined $2,664 and companies $13,320 for failing to comply with the notice, and additional fines of $111,000 for individuals or $555,000 for businesses may also be imposed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Four of the sites have since removed the content. “Some of the worst fringe sites in the world host this terrible material and I make no apology for taking action against them to ensure Australians are protected,” Inman Grant said. One site to receive a notice posted the letter in full on the site, and replied “the United States has laws protecting freedom of speech and the distribution of information”, with many of the comments in response mocking the attempt to have the material removed. The site in question was also briefly blocked in Australia for hosting material related to the Christchurch attack. The commissioner hasn’t taken the next step of ordering access to the sites to be blocked in Australia, Guardian Australia understands, because it hasn’t met the conditions of an “online crisis event” due to the relatively limited distribution of the material on gore websites and file hosts. The commissioner could take other action, including issuing fines to the sites or their web hosts, although it is unclear how that would be enforced on sites not hosted in Australia. The commissioner could also ask search engines to remove links to the content from search results. New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced on Wednesday her office was investigating Twitch, 4chan, 8chan and Discord along with other platforms the Buffalo shooter used to amplify the attack.",News/Australia news,Australian eSafety office tells websites to remove Buffalo attack video but does not block access,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/australian-esafety-office-tells-websites-to-remove-buffalo-attack-video-but-does-not-block-access
5/19/2022,"This film, from screenwriter Shane Crowley and co-directors Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer, is a tense cine-ballad of guilt and shame. It is set on a remote coastal village in Ireland where there is a precarious living to be made from fishing and oyster farming and the wind’s howling creates an unearthly and doom-laden atmosphere. This is a movie which has some dramatic redundancy and is sometimes submerged too deeply in its own sense of tragic destiny. But it is fiercely acted by its excellent cast, including Emily Watson as Eileen, the careworn mum who has been deeply affected by a prodigal-son drama in her life. The oedipal element here may have taken some inspiration from David Siegel and Scott McGehee’s 2001 drama-thriller The Deep End with Tilda Swinton as the protective mother taking desperate steps for her son. The presence of Watson in this film, along with its sombre, almost ritualistic singing scenes, brought back for me a tiny echo of Lars von Trier’s Breaking the Waves. Watson plays a supervisor at the local fish-preparation plant; her grownup daughter and baby still live with her and her husband, who is a hardworking fisher. The community is devastated by the loss of one of its young men, a fisher drowned at sea, and Watson is as distraught as any. But attending the wake, she is astonished and delighted when her son, played by Paul Mescal, walks into the pub out of the blue. This is a man who had left the village years before to seek his fortune in Australia; he had not kept in contact and has now returned with no great plans other than to live rent-free in the family home and resume the fishing work he had professed to hate, in a village he once said he was sick of. One of the reasons he left was that he may have had his heart broken by a local woman, played by Aisling Franciosi, who by that token may have broken Watson’s heart as well – depriving her of her cherished boy. Mescal cleverly creates this young man’s persona: cool, confident, charming in his way, but also rough-hewn, with an edge of resentment and violence. His reappearance triggers an intense irritation in his father, who now feels almost like a slighted lover, as Eileen dresses up to go out for drinks with their son. One night Eileen is called down to the police station to give a statement. A charge of rape is to be laid against her son by a complainant whose identity she can easily guess. Can Watson give an alibi for her son, and swear, on oath, that he was at home with her? Her answer to this question sets in train a terrible series of events. There is a deadpan irony in the title, as there is no great comfort for these people in thinking that they are God’s creatures and therefore eligible for divine love and care. Rather, it seems as if they have been created to fend for themselves by an uncaring cosmic force, left to live and die in this stark and unforgiving place. It is a tough story, told with conviction.

5/19/2022,"The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, has disputed the chief inspector of constabulary Andy Cooke’s suggestion that the cost of living crisis will trigger an increase in crime, branding it “old-fashioned” thinking. As inflation hit a 40-year-high of 9%, Cooke told the Guardian that officers should use their “discretion” when deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat. Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Malthouse, a longtime ally of Boris Johnson, said Cooke’s thinking was “old-fashioned”, adding: “Because people are challenged financially … that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to turn to crime.” The chief inspector of constabulary is the head of the independent assessor of police forces in England and Wales. Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, took over from Sir Tom Winsor in the role last month. Malthouse has told officers not to let shoplifters off if they are stealing food out of desperation during the cost of living crisis. He later told LBC ministers would ensure police do not turn a blind eye to shoplifters stealing food. “In fact I wrote to chief constables just a year or so ago saying they should not be ignoring those seemingly small crimes,” he said. Earlier, the minister told Times Radio: “The broad rule is that justice should be blind and I hope and believe that is the principle that sits behind not just the police but the operation of the courts as well. “I have to challenge this connection between poverty and crime. What we’ve found in the past, and where there is now growing evidence, is that actually crime is a contributor to poverty. That if you remove the violence and the crime from people’s lives they generally prosper more than they otherwise would.” Cooke told the Guardian: “The impact of poverty, and the impact of lack of opportunity for people, does lead to an increase in crime. There’s no two ways about that.” When asked how policing could avoid being seen as the arm of an uncaring state, he said forces across England and Wales were skilled in dealing with the tensions and dynamics of their communities. “What they’ve got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community, and that individual, in the way they deal with those issues. And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion – and they need to use discretion more often.”",News/UK news,"Don’t let people off if they steal food in desperation, minister tells police",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/dont-let-people-off-if-they-steal-food-in-desperation-minister-tells-police-kit-malthouse
5/19/2022,"Ihad an easy pregnancy, a textbook C-section and the gift of a two-week recovery period alone at home after my twins were sent to the newborn intensive care unit – or, having given birth in the US, “the world’s most expensive babysitting service”, as a nurse described it at the time. One consequence of this was that I was fully healed by the time they came home. Another was that in the first two weeks of my babies’ lives, breastfeeding had to be supplemented with formula. By the time they left hospital, my supply was getting sketchy, which as it turned out was the least of our problems. Trying to get two preemies, not much bigger than guinea pigs, to latch was like asking them to eat peas off a beachball. I’d forgotten about all this. As with everything to do with childrearing, there’s a scorched-earth psychology that means each stage renders its antecedents uninteresting. When something comes along to trigger the memory of those first weeks and months – a friend having a baby or, as in the US at the moment, a shortage of baby formula that this week saw two babies in Memphis hospitalised – I’m struck simultaneously by just how absurd the experience was and how out of whack the conversation around it continues to be. The formula shortage in the US is a result of supply-chain problems, exacerbated by one of the biggest suppliers, Abbott Nutrition, recalling its formula after four babies who had consumed its product were hospitalised with bacterial infections. As a result, tins of formula have been listing on eBay for $120 a pop and babies with specific nutritional needs, such as the two in Memphis, are in danger of various dire health failures. These are the worst-case scenarios. The more bearable but still aggravating casualty is the equilibrium of breastfeeding mothers. It is so very weird that an activity undertaken by millions of women over thousands of years is still subject to such wilful misunderstanding. With an air of “let them eat cake”, up popped the commentators on social media asking mothers why they didn’t just switch on their boobs. It was mostly, although not exclusively, men. Women police each other, too, and along came Bette Midler, of all people, jumping on Twitter to say: “Try breastfeeding! It’s free and available on demand.” When people shouted at her for being insensitive, she clarified: “No shame if you can’t breastfeed, but if you can & are somehow convinced that your own milk isn’t as good as a ‘scientifically researched product’, that’s something else again.” I don’t know anyone still labouring under the delusion that breast milk isn’t “good enough” for their babies. In fact, the opposite tends to be true, particularly in communities that over-invest in the word “natural”. But anyway, as all new mothers know, you can’t win. Whatever you do, someone, somewhere will surface to ask why you aren’t doing it the other way. And, obviously, “available on demand” is not the case for lots of women. Back it all came, in a nightmarish rush; the series of breastfeeding consultants; all the mad things I ate (brewer’s yeast; endless oatmeal) to increase my supply; having too little milk, then too much. The formula itself, gross-smelling and thin – standing in the kitchen, warming the bottles in a cup of hot water, wondering how they could stand to eat the stuff. The middle-of-the-night delirium in which I wondered whether Vietnam was worse than this, surely not. The body that wasn’t mine any more. The endless bloody how-to-breastfeed-your-twins classes. The sense of failure, and failure, and failure again. And my god, the anxiety: the knowledge that with babies that small there is no margin for error. The old adage about children and food – “they won’t let themselves starve” – doesn’t work with six-week-old babies who weigh less than a pack of butter. They don’t eat quickly at that age. Eyes on the clock, watching the two-hour rotational feed take an hour and a half, knowing that, this cycle, you’ll only have 30 minutes off, so it’s cheat-with-formula or go actively mad. I’d forgotten all this, as most women do. But in weeks such as these, the fact that this experience falls squarely within the normal range only makes the conversation around breastfeeding – as around everything to do with babies, from “too posh to push” to “cry it out” – inclined to trigger a rage that has been dormant for years.

5/19/2022,"Notifications arrive every day at Loveone, an Ipswich gift shop, heralding price increases of 5% to 10% on products it sells, usually adding a couple of pounds to the sticker price. “If I don’t get my orders in by a certain date then I will have to pay more,” says Cathy Frost, who has run the shop for 15 years. “I can kind of hold my prices for the moment as I ordered stock six months ago, but if the things I’m ordering now are going to be more expensive, I’m asking: ‘Will people pay more?’” Frost is already worrying about Christmas. Retailers can have six-month lead times to ensure they have the right products for their most important season. “I’m wondering, if this cost of living crisis is really going to be felt in October, will people be spending at Christmas?” she says. “I don’t know if people will spend £30 for a candle when last Christmas they did.” Footfall in Ipswich is down, which Frost blames on people having less money to spend and also the number of people working from home. Small businesses are not protected by an energy price cap, and so can be left exposed. Frost turned off the heating weeks ago to cut bills. Meanwhile part-time staff costs have also increased, taking away further from the bottom line. “I’ve been here 15 years and went through Covid but that felt like a bit of a walk in the park compared to this,” Frost says. “We knew we were in lockdown and that we would come out.” Ben Hancock is the managing director of Oscar Acoustics in Kent, which makes and installs acoustic sound-proofing for interiors. Inflation is delivering a series of challenges just as the £4.5m-turnover company is planning an expansion, adding another building. It will carry on with the investment, although Hancock says some companies in worse financial positions might not. But inflation is hitting the raw materials the company uses, such as aluminium for fittings that can change price overnight. The weakening pound has not helped either, making imports from the US more expensive and forcing the company to choose between raising prices or lowering margins. “You have to protect your customers as much as possible,” he says. “You take the hit to your margins as long as you can, and then you make the increase.” The company is also seeing increased wage demands as it looks for new hires. It is looking at ways of making the job attractive without offering pay increases that Hancock fears could be unsustainable if the economy worsens further. “We have to be a little bit careful if we’re heading into a recession,” he says. David Exwood has about 600 cows and farms about 2,000 acres in Horsham, West Sussex, growing crops including wheat, oats, oilseed rape, maize and beans. He is also vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union. “Nobody is insulated from what is going on, that’s for sure,” he says. “My fuel bill has doubled, my fertiliser bill has trebled, and these are big numbers, that equates to £250,000 extra for me, just to keep farming in the same way.” The price of everything from spare parts to fencing and fence posts has increased. “There is not a lot you can do about it,” he says. “Yes you can make efficiencies but you can’t find them on that scale. It puts a lot of strain on businesses. You can only keep it up for so long, in the end something has to give. You either have to do less or have less ambition or grow less crops because you can’t work miracles for ever.” Exwood says while the price of his wheat has gone up, the crops he feeds to his cattle have gone up “a lot more than that”. Customers in his farm shop are counting their pennies.“People are very nervous. They might buy less or might buy chicken thighs instead of breast; they might buy braising steak instead of sirloin steak.” He adds: “The risk of farming has gone through the roof. The volatility is beyond anything we’ve experienced. I can’t budget, I have no idea of predicting what the market is going to do. Farming is a long-term game. I have just bought a bull, I am going to put that bull in [to mate] and those calves won’t be ready for sale until three years from now, 2025. Who knows what the price of beef is going to be in 2025? It’s anybody’s guess.” When filling up a 400-litre fuel tank in a 44-tonne lorry, it pays to keep a keen eye on the cost of diesel. Kevin Plews, a director of Plews Brothers, a haulier based in North Shropshire, says there isn’t much they can do about price rises. “It has just kept going up and up since Christmas,” he says. “I have to be quite savvy about how we purchase it.” Fuel cards can sometimes be more cost-effective, while if prices drop then buying in bulk can be better. Drivers’ wages have also increased, in part because of a shortage (which many analysts suggest is down to post-Brexit immigration limits) and the fact that they are seeing inflation at home themselves. Other costs that have risen include tyres and the urea-based AdBlue, which is added to diesel combustion to reduce harmful pollutants. At least, for now, interest rates are historically low. “I can remember in the 70s and the 80s when inflation was very high but we had the added aggravation of high interest rates,” Plews says. “Should interest rates rise that’s a worrying thing.”",News/Business,Inflation hits small firms: ‘Covid was a walk in the park compared to this’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/inflation-hits-small-firms-covid-was-a-walk-in-the-park-compared-to-this
5/19/2022,"As a young woman, Virginia Woolf’s Clarissa Dalloway established a theory about the problem of knowing other people. In each interaction we have, she believed, some trace of who we are is left behind; and so to know someone, “one must seek out the people who completed them; even the places”. Perhaps we should consider their encounters with culture, too: which aspects of themselves they find (and therefore we find) within works of art, music, literature. Pen, the teenage protagonist of Emilie Pine’s debut novel, Ruth & Pen, describes Mrs Dalloway this way: “When she’d read that book by Virginia Woolf last summer, about the man with shell shock, Pen had understood why he had jumped from the window, and she had also understood how hard it was for his wife, who could not help him.” What Pen takes from Woolf’s fourth novel is equally instructive about her own character: the fact that she alights on Septimus Warren Smith, the traumatised first world war veteran, as the text’s fulcral figure. In Septimus’s sensitivity and vulnerability, Pen sees something of herself. School can be challenging for a young person with autism: she has few friends, and requires regular timeouts from class to cope with the sensory shock that each day presents. Pen’s summation of Mrs Dalloway also offers a key to her compassionate worldview: she can feel Septimus’s pain and that of his wife at once; she can admit her own unhappiness and simultaneously recognise the ways that sadness hurts her mother, too. Throughout Ruth & Pen, opposing statements are bonded together: “It’s too late. It’s not too late”; “Run! Stay!” “The truth is: No. The truth is: Yes.” The title itself, with its prominent ampersand, is indicative of this balancing act of positions that the novel strives towards. As in Mrs Dalloway, there are two figures around which the action orbits, and the story takes place over the course of a day – 7 October 2019 in Dublin. For the first few chapters the narrative reliably alternates between Pen and Ruth by means of a close third-person. They cross paths twice, both times briefly, at an Extinction Rebellion protest in Merrion Square, where much of Pen’s storyline takes place. She is there to meet the girl she is in love with, Alice; she plans to disclose her true feelings, finally, after the protest. The chapters focusing on Pen are beautifully managed, taking seriously the experiences of a young person with autism. Ruth is a therapist in her 30s. On 7 October she wakes up alone. Her husband, Aidan, is away on a work trip, and she feels apprehensive about his return in the evening. For a long time, they have been locked into the same fight. For Ruth, three cycles of IVF – all those churning hormones, spikes of hope and deep valleys of disappointment – have put considerable strain on their relationship. With each failed cycle, Ruth feels she and Aidan are “losing more of ourselves”. In her view, they have reached a blind alley: she cannot go on like this and he can only see her refusal as a giving up on any potential future between them.Ruth’s storyline is an extension and reworking of an excellent essay in Pine’s acclaimed 2018 collection, Notes to Self. From the Baby Years draws on her and her partner’s attempts to conceive, ending with their decision to forgo IVF and stop “trying” (a phrase Pine comes to hate). The voice in Notes to Self has a brilliant force to it, like the intrusive beam of a searchlight, revealing in stark detail all aspects of Pine’s various, deeply personal subjects. In Ruth & Pen the intensity of feeling is diluted, not just by the third-person perspective, but by the introduction of further voices as the story progresses. Aidan, Alice and Pen’s mother, Claire, all get their own chapters. And they, like Ruth and Pen, are decent, well-intentioned people. While this ensures that Ruth & Pen develops into a gentle, empathetic novel, the sharpness of thought that is so propulsive in Notes to Self is missing. In a 1923 diary entry, Woolf wrote of her intentions for Mrs Dalloway: “I want to give life & death, sanity & insanity; I want to criticise the social system, & to show it at work, at its most intense.” Woolf’s novel is charged because of these conflicting elements, which are held in tension by means of two primary characters that exist as dark doubles for each other. There is not enough friction, not enough pressure between the protagonists of Ruth & Pen; its coordinative, paratactic style of “both/and” is the final limitation to its success.

5/19/2022,"Mike Trout has done so many wondrous things in nearly 11 full big-league seasons – 319 home runs, nine All-Star appearances, three American League Most Valuable Player awards among them – that it is hard to believe that he has but one career postseason hit. One. That lonely hit, a bases-empty home run, came in the top of the first inning of a game on 5 October 2014 that the then-Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim would lose to the Kansas City Royals, 8-3, to get swept out of the American League Division Series in three games. That 1-for-12 performance at the plate was in Trout’s only postseason, so he has zero playoff victories. Since 2015 – a period when the other Los Angeles team, the Dodgers, have been to three World Series, winning one – the Angels have not had a winning season. It is hard to feel too sorry for a big-league ballplayer who has a 12-year, $426.5m contract. But it must hurt Trout, widely considered the best baseball player on the planet and possibly one of the greatest of all time, that his teammates have been unable to complement his talent for so long. That is, perhaps, until now. He is playing for a Los Angeles Angels team (they dropped the of Anaheim part six years back) who have established themselves as a contender in the first six weeks of the season, winning 10 of their first 15 games in May to become a contender in the AL West, where their main challengers are the Houston Astros. “I’m just really happy for the guys,” Joe Maddon, their third-year manager, said in a news conference after an 11-3 victory over Tampa Bay earlier this month. “They come ready to play every day. They’re very tightly knit. We’re a lot of fun.” Wait. Joe Maddon. Remember him? Just six years ago, Maddon led the Chicago Cubs to their first World Series title in 108 years. Before that, he’d taken the once-forlorn Tampa Bay Rays to their first World Series, which they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008. Maddon, who grew up over his father’s plumbing shop in West Hazleton, Pennsylvania, spent virtually his entire minor-league career as a catcher in the Angels’ organization. He was later a scout, interim manager and coach. He was Mike Scioscia’s bench coach for the Angels team that won the World Series in 2002. But his triumphant return to the team got off to a slow start. Maddon’s first year back with the Angels, 2020, was trimmed to 60 games because of the Covid pandemic. Trout’s 2021 season ended on May after he tore a calf muscle. He appears more than just OK this year, and the Angels appear to have an even better pitching staff than last season. They will probably need to outlast the Astros to win their first AL West title since 2014, but the Angels appear to have put together a roster, and a good start, that could lead them to a spot in the MLB playoff field, which has been expanded this year to 12 teams. Trout remains the linchpin. He grew up in Millville, New Jersey, where he was known as “Mikey,” the kid who took batting practice in his backyard by tossing up rocks and hitting them with an aluminum bat, the ping-ping-ping carrying through his neighborhood. Although he grew up far from traditional baseball hotbeds, he became a prodigy, muscular, smart, stoic, pleasant – if not a quote machine. His main interest, famously, is not flashy cars or NFT schemes but the weather forecast. His career WAR, a metric that measures a player’s overall contribution to his team, is 78.8. For context, that is only 0.4 behind Joe DiMaggio – and Trout still has plenty of years to come. If he stays injury free he should retire in the top 10 of all time in career WAR. After he was named as the AL Rookie of the Year in 2012, he said of a possible sophomore slump, “I don’t believe in that stuff. I just go out and play. You go into a slump, you just got to get out of it. That’s the way I look at it.” So, not that surprisingly, Trout, who turns 31 in August, has bounced back from last season strongly, logging an on-base-plus-slugging (OPS) average that is similar to the one he compiled in his three MVP seasons. The difference, this time around, is that Trout has two other formidable everyday teammates: the amazing Shohei Ohtani, who is not just a designated hitter but a pitcher as well, and the leadoff man Taylor Ward, a career .254 hitter who is somehow topping the American League batting average table this season. Last week was especially good for the Angels, for many reasons. Trout belted three home runs in a 12-0 victory over Tampa Bay but was practically an afterthought, because 22-year-old rookie lefthander Reid Detmers no-hit the Rays. Chase Silseth, a 23-year-old righthander, was called up from the Rocket City Trash Pandas (really) in Double A and threw six shutout innings and earned the win over Oakland in his big-league debut. In the off-season, the Angels signed free-agent Noah Syndergaard, the 6ft 6in righthander named “Thor,” to a one-year, $21m contract. Thor appeared as if he’d pitch forever for the New York Mets but was often injured, undergoing Tommy John surgery, so there was some risk on the Angels’ part. But he won three of his first four decisions. Yes, the Angels could tumble. Trout was hit in his left hand with a pitch in a 17 April game against Texas. X-rays were negative, but it was a scare: Trout missed six weeks with an injury to his left thumb in 2017, after he’d walloped 16 homers in the first two months. Trout also missed 18 games in 2018 because of inflammation in his right wrist and 19 games in 2019 after foot surgery. He injury his calf at this point of the season last year. He was originally expected to miss six to eight weeks but never did come back. But he is back now, and he and his teammates quickly set a goal to play in the postseason. He gracefully handles being called the best player in baseball, but he acknowledges the best players in any sport still crave the trophies earned by their teams. “I always try to think positive,” he said in a March interview with CBS Los Angeles. “I have a great organization behind me, a lot of support from my teammates, coaches, front office. It was probably the most frustrating and difficult year of my career so far, not being able to be with my guys.” But he would add, “It’s still a baseball game. I’m still going out there and playing a game I love. A lot of stuff comes along with that. But for me, once the lights come on and I’m running out there, I just play baseball. That’s the mindset I’ve had since I was a little kid.” ",Sport/Sport,Mike Trout: does the world’s best baseball player finally have a supporting cast?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/mike-trout-los-angeles-angels-playoff-drought-mlb-baseball
