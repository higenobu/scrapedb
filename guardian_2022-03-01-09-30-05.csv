3/1/2022,"Pressure is mounting on more British businesses to sever ties with Russia after oil giant Shell became the latest company to quit the country, ditching gas projects with the country’s state energy firm Gazprom. Shell on Monday said it would exit its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas facility, its 50% stake in Salym Petroleum Development and the Gydan energy venture. A day before, BP announced plans to offload its 19.75% investment in the state oil behemoth Rosneft following international outrage. Shell has been one of the Russian oil industry’s most important partners thanks to a “global cooperation” pact with Gazprom through which Shell offered expertise and equipment for offshore fossil fuel exploration. It also held a 10% stake worth $1bn in Gazprom’s planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was due to double the flow of Russian gas to Germany, until Berlin called a halt to it earlier this month. It will also exit that project. “Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction,” Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said. “We cannot – and we will not – stand by.” Shell said its Russian projects are worth about $3bn, while BP said it will incur a $25bn writedown on its decision to offload its Rosneft stake. “We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression, which threatens European security,” said van Beurden. After decades of integration that led to dozens of Russian firms listing on London’s Stock Exchange and City firms spending billions of pounds on Russian shares, British firms are scrambling to decouple from their Moscow counterparts. Countries around the world are introducing an unprecedented package of sanctions against Russia that have so far hit the country’s central bank, airlines, energy firms, and major commercial lenders including VTB and Bank Rossiya. BP and Shell’s costly decisions to quit a country they have spent years cultivating and ploughed billions of pounds into reflect an unprecedented severing of economic ties – one that will have huge ramifications for the global energy industry. Similarly vexed decisions are having to be taken at businesses from City banks and law firms to consumer goods giants. One banking executive told the Guardian that he had been working around the clock for more than a week to ensure the sanctions measures, including the blocking of some Russian banks from accessing the Swift payments system, were being enforced. The City had expected “incursion” on Ukrainian territory, he said. “No one expected a full-blown invasion.” It means firms across the City are having to review millions of client transactions, investments and fundraising deals. Dedicated sanctions teams at lenders including Goldman Sachs worked overtime this weekend to help implement the blacklist, while JP Morgan Chase bulked up its sanctions enforcement team in London and the US to ensure the money taps were being turned off. Goldman Sachs revealed on Friday that its exposure to Russia was worth more than $1bn (£793m), over half of which was related to credit and loans to Russian-linked businesses. It is unclear whether the Wall Street bank intends to exit those positions. “The banks have extensive trading relationships with companies that transact with Russia, not just from the UK but from across Europe,” said Benjamin Ensor, director of research and strategy at fintech consultancy 11:FS. “How decoupling works, and how quick it is, depends on the extent of sanctions and how much the conflict escalates.” Even implementing blocks on Swift – the main messaging system used to make cross-border payments – has been “a maze”, the executive said. “It’s not as simple as turning the system on or off,” he added. “A process can be in place, but more capillaries will reveal themselves as time goes on.” Meanwhile, the Investment Association trade body has been contacting fund managers as they try to assess their exposure to Russia and offload stakes in sanctioned firms. But some of its members are already struggling. Abrdn, which manages £465.3bn in assets for its clients, has so far failed to sell its £5m stake in Rosneft due to new Russian rules that restrict foreigners from trading on its Micex stock exchange. Widening sanctions could cause problems for a broad array of British companies. Russia’s large population of 144 million people has made it an attractive market for some of the UK’s best-known consumer brands, including Marks & Spencer, which has 32 shops in Moscow alone. Unilever, the London-headquartered consumer goods company, which sells products ranging from Dove soap to Marmite, has a subsidiary in Russia with registered offices in Moscow and Omsk, but has declined to give any details of its employee numbers or its operations in the country. While its Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream brand earlier this month tweeted criticism of the US government’s approach to talks with Russia, Unilever chief executive Alan Jope criticised the intervention. The FTSE 100 firm only said it was “watching with concern and focusing on the safety of our people”. London-listed mining companies are also in the spotlight after politicians in the UK and the US said they would target resource-heavy industries with fresh sanctions. While FTSE 100 member Polymetal International, which operates goldmines in Russia and Kazakhstan, has not been named as a potential target for sanctions, its shares plummeted by 56% on Monday. Shares in steel producer Evraz, which is listed on the FTSE 100 but has major mining and processing operations in Russia, also fell by 29%. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, lawyers for Evraz’s largest shareholder, Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, disputed that he or Evraz fitted the criteria for potential designation for sanctions. Other companies that have quietly built up investments in the Russian market in recent years are expected to start disclosing their positions – and any related financial risks – to investors over the coming weeks.",News/Business,The great decoupling: how UK-based firms are unwinding exposure to Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/the-great-decoupling-how-uk-based-firms-are-unwinding-exposure-to-russia
3/1/2022,"If you place a bet on the Tote, who do you think you are betting against? For most of its customers, the answer today would probably be much the same as it was when Winston Churchill helped to set up the UK’s pool-betting operation nearly a century ago. The Tote is there for recreational, relatively small-scale punters, and racegoers in particular, who want a fiver each-way for an interest, or a few quid in the Placepot in the hope of a decent return at the end of the afternoon. And while hardly anyone on a day out at the races is bothered about the mechanics of Tote betting, one key point is generally understood: there’s no bookie. Instead, all the cash goes into the pool, the Tote takes a cut off the top and then divides what is left by the number of winning units to get the dividend. Since May 2020, however, there has been a new player in the pools: the Tote itself. Faced with the problem of maintaining liquidity in a post-lockdown world with no racegoers, the Tote came up with a Pool Guarantee Service (PGS) which, according to its website, “seeds wagers into the pools … in order to provide robust pools into which all customers of the UK Tote can bet. By increasing the size of the overall pools, PGS helps to stabilise pricing within the pools so that the published ‘will-pay’ figures [the on-screen estimated dividends] reflect as closely as possible the final UK Tote dividend that is declared after the result.” The Tote accepted at the outset that situations might arise in which it would effectively “win” money from its customers, while also saying that its ideal scenario would be “to come out neutral in the long term”. Imagine, for instance, that a once-a-year punter finds an outrageous Tricast because three rank outsiders remind them of their husband, their daughter and the next-door neighbour’s dog. A potentially life-changing payout awaits … unless the PGS managed to find it too and reduce the dividend accordingly. An important point here is that the successful punter will only see the dividend and the number of winning tickets. Whether one or more actually belonged to the Tote itself is not disclosed, and so that potentially humungous win which turns out to be a little underwhelming might be because someone else was blessed with the same divine inspiration. Or it might be because Nanny’s automated betting system had covered all the bases.

There are big professional operators using automated programs of their own to squeeze cash from every major pool betting system on the planet. In many cases, the operators actually pay them to play, via rebates, because of the precious liquidity they bring to the pools. But it is unusual, to say the least, for the pool operator itself to get involved in the same way. And although its precise mechanics are not verifiable, being in a position to see exactly how the big players operate could presumably give give the Tote’s programmers a decent head start on them. Now few tears will be shed over that, but it still leaves no one the wiser about exactly how much the Tote is making from PGS, what proportion of the money in its pools is “proprietary”, or why PGS is continuing now that crowds are back on track. If the Placepot pool at Cheltenham, for instance, really requires “seeding”, then the game is surely up. For the sake of fairness and transparency, these are all questions that deserve an answer. One claim – in a document seen by the Guardian - suggests the Tote could have made at least £3m from proprietary trading since PGS made its debut, and that as much as 40% of many day-to-day Placepot pools is actually comprised of the Tote’s own money. The claim is hard to verify and, when contacted on Monday, the Tote declined to comment on these figures on the record. It insists, however, as it did when PGS launched, that its aim is to make pools more stable, transparent, fair and better for all customers.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: punters right to ask why the Tote is still playing its own game,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/talking-horses-horse-racing-the-tote-betting
3/1/2022,"A culture of “obstruction and delay” has scuppered investigations into police misconduct, MPs have warned, in a damning assessment of the way complaints against the police are handled. A report by the home affairs select committee into the role of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found that poor communications and “opaque processes” are having a detrimental impact on complainants and officers. There is little public confidence that complaints are likely to succeed or result in proper sanctions if officers were found to have committed misconduct, the report concluded. Diana Johnson, the chair of the committee, said the IOPC had a duty to deliver a complaints system that can restore public confidence after a succession of scandals had left trust in policing at a “perilous point”. The IOPC took over complaints about police misconduct in England and Wales from the Independent Police Complaints Commission four years ago. The report acknowledged that “substantial work” had been undertaken by the IOPC to rectify the failings of its predecessor, including a reduction in the time taken to complete investigations. The majority are completed within a year. But MPs said it was “clear that much more needs to be done”. The committee’s inquiry heard how investigations were still being bogged down by different policing organisations and the IOPC blaming each other for ongoing delays. “There needs to be a change of culture in police forces,” the report said. “It should not be necessary to compel officers to cooperate with investigations. This culture change must be from top to bottom to ensure that complaints are handled quickly and openly, delivering punishment for misconduct where necessary and clearing officers who have not committed an offence.” The committee cited the “acute failures” of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard’s £2.5m inquiry into bogus allegations of a VIP paedophile inquiry, as how the police complaints system can go “so badly wrong”. It said experiences suffered by those falsely accused and their relatives, such as Lord Brittan, the former home secretary who died before he was cleared, and his wife, Lady Brittan, were examples of why the system must deliver more timely inquiries. Many other cases that did not benefit from attracting the same amount of publicity as Operation Midland had left complainants “feeling let down by a system failing to treat their complaints with the severity they merited”.",News/UK news,"Culture of obstruction has sunk investigations into police misconduct, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/police-culture-change-needed-in-handling-complaints-say-mps
3/1/2022,"More than 51,000 people joined the ranks of the “ultra-wealthy” last year as the fortunes of the already very rich benefited from rising global stock markets and increased property prices during the pandemic. The number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) – those with assets of more than $30m (£22.4m) – rose by a record 9.3% last year to 610,569, according to a report by the property consultants Knight Frank. “By any of the measures that we track, whether luxury property prices, UHNWI populations or even private jet traffic, 2021 was a good year for those lucky enough to be the owners of property or other tangible assets,” said Rory Penn, the head of Knight Frank’s private office, through which he advises ultra-rich clients across the world. “Notwithstanding uncertain times, we have still seen substantial wealth creation globally with the number of people with net wealth of US$30m or more increasing by almost 10% last year.” The number of ultra rich people in the UK increased by 11% to 25,771 – more people than could fit in the football stadiums of Watford, Burnley or Brentford. The number of Britons with assets of more than $30m has doubled since 2016, and Knight Frank predicts the total will rise to more than 32,000 by 2026. There are more than 3 million people in the UK classed as dollar ¡millionaires (£750,000), a 54% increase on five years ago. The UK had the second-fastest rate of growth of ultra-rich people behind the US, where the number increased by 13% to 210,353. The ranks of the wealthy grew on every continent except Africa, where 17 people fell off the list, taking the total to 2,240. Monaco stood out as the country with the most super-rich people per capita, with 199 people holding assets of $30m or more out of a population of just 39,000 – which works out as five people in every thousand. Just under seven in 10 people living in Monaco are dollar millionaires. Monaco is home to several rich Britons, including the former Topshop boss Sir Philip Green and his wife, Tina; billionaire Brexit backer and petrochemicals tycoon Sir James Ratcliffe, property billionaires Simon and David Reuben; John Hargreaves, the founder and chairman of Matalan; John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones4u; and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. Knight Frank’s report shows that on average the ultra-wealthy hold just under two-thirds of their wealth in property. Unsurprisingly, the most expensive property is found in Monaco, where homebuyers would need to spend at least $34m to join the top 1% of most expensive properties. A million dollars buys just 14.6sq m of residential space in the Mediterranean principality, compared with 30.6sq m in London, or 256 sq m in São Paulo. Conscious of the lack of space available to attract more billionaires to Monaco, Prince Albert II, the reigning monarch, is overseeing a $2bn (£1.5bn) scheme to reclaim six hectares (15 acres) of land from the sea. The sovereign city-state – which is only slightly bigger than Regent’s Park in London – said it was embarking on the “offshore urban extension project” because it had run out of space for those seeking the “fiscal advantages” the tax haven offers. The reclaimed land will allow the creation of 120 luxury homes selling for more than $100,000 per sq metre – more expensive than One Hyde Park in London and 15 Central Park West in Manhattan. On average ultra-rich people own 2.9 homes, according to Knight Frank’s survey of private bankers and wealth advisers.",Lifestyle/Money,Pandemic spurred record numbers of ‘ultra wealthy’ in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/01/pandemic-spurred-record-numbers-of-ultra-wealthy-in-2021
3/1/2022,"Rishi Sunak is facing renewed pressure from business leaders to delay a planned £12bn rise in national insurance, amid warnings over soaring costs for companies and households as the Russian invasion of Ukraine drives up inflation. The manufacturing trade body Make UK, which represents 20,000 firms of all sizes across the country, said the tax hike planned for April should be pushed back until the UK economy is in a stronger position. It warned the government that pressing ahead would risk firms slamming the brakes on recruitment and putting the economic recovery from Covid at risk. With concerns mounting over the fallout from Vladimir Putin ordering his troops into Ukraine last week, the business lobby group said now was not the time to add further self-imposed costs on companies. “The proposed increase remains illogical and will be even more ill-timed given how circumstances have rapidly changed since it was announced,” said Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK. “The cost burden on business is continuing to escalate and, while some of these increases are due to global events, government must avoid adding shooting business in the foot by an entirely self-imposed decision.” According to a survey of almost 300 manufacturing firms by Make UK, as many as three in five said the tax rise would have a moderate or significant impact on their hiring intentions. Almost three-quarters said they would pass on, or would be very likely to pass on, the rise in their costs to customers in the form of higher prices for their products and services. It comes as the fighting in Ukraine drives up global energy prices, and as the conflict and western economic sanctions unleashed in response lead to tensions over the supply of Russian gas to Europe. Following a sharp rise in wholesale gas markets last week, economists said UK inflation could rise from the current rate of 5.5% to peak above 8% within months – the highest level for three decades. Boris Johnson had attempted to draw a line under demands to delay or scrap the planned tax rise, arguing in a joint letter with Sunak that the policy was the right way to deal with NHS Covid backlogs and reforms to social care. With the prime minister criticised over the “partygate” affair, senior Conservatives had urged him to tear up the plan for a 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions for both workers and employers announced last September. However, the tax-raising plan has led to broader unrest in company boardrooms, when taken together with other steps to raise the UK’s tax burden to the highest sustained levels in 70 years. In an intervention ahead of Sunak’s spring economic forecast later this month, the Confederation of British Industry urged the chancellor to set out a range of tax cuts and spending commitments to offset the impact on firms. The CBI said a permanent investment deduction was necessary to help companies boost the amount they spend on productivity-enhancing technologies, machinery and buildings by £40bn a year by 2026. It said firms should be offered a 100% tax deduction against such investments from April 2023, offsetting an increase in the headline rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25% in the same month. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, said: “You’ve come out of the blocks with a pretty damaging measure, which is that increase in corporation tax. So I think it is incumbent upon government now to compensate for that.” The CBI said firms needed measures to encourage them to spend, after a period of weak business investment since the Brexit vote and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The lobby group estimates that £100bn could be added to the Treasury’s coffers by 2030 if the UK bucks current predictions and achieves a more ambitious 2.5% average growth rate for GDP over the remainder of the decade. “Faced with a record tax burden, a cost-of-living crisis, wage pressures and the end of the super-deduction, firms will be looking to the spring statement for a clear signal that the government’s ambition will be matched by action,” Danker added.",News/Business,Businesses urge Sunak to delay ‘ill-timed and illogical’ NI rise ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/national-insurance-businesses-urge-sunak-delay-rise
3/1/2022,"She has long been a symbol for mid-20th century moral panic, a censorious crusader quixotically tilting at the windmills of sexual liberation and social liberalism, but a senior BBC broadcaster has suggested the legacy of Mary Whitehouse may be due for reappraisal. Samira Ahmed, who grew up in 1970s and 80s watching the much-mocked campaigner against perceived immorality in the British media “demonised and mocked as a puritanical harridan”, has produced an hour-long Radio 4 programme on Whitehouse’s diaries, which were donated to the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Library and cover 30 years of her life. As a schoolteacher from the Midlands, Whitehouse came to prominence in 1964 after launching a campaign to clean up the BBC’s output. From then she became a regular feature in the media and on the BBC itself, giving speeches all over the country in defence of traditional marriage, heterosexuality and polite language. Ahmed said she wondered whether, as an older woman, she might now be able to understand what drove the campaigner. She told Radio Times she found herself impressed by Whitehouse and often smiled at the diary entries, which reflected “a witty woman who loved fashion, enjoyed a lively argument and liked the company of young people”. “Her account of a phone call in which she harangued David Attenborough – then controller of BBC2 – over showing a sexually explicit film convinced me the experience may well have made him return to wildlife presenting, feeling safer in the jungle. Perhaps we owe her a debt of gratitude,” Ahmed said. The presenter suggested Whitehouse’s concerns echoed contemporary debates about the government’s forthcoming legislation which could result in online age checks for adult material. “Her lobbying created laws banning the making of child pornography, indecent displays of porn magazines in newsagents and forced the vetting of home videos – all protections we now take for granted,” she said. “The current online harms bill is trying to address dangers she warned of 40 years ago.” Ahmed said she could not make excuses for Whitehouse’s strong religious belief that homosexuality was sinful. But she praised her for facing down media executives “who sneered at this grey-haired Midlands schoolteacher” and for running a “relentless lifelong campaign to tighten obscenity laws and regulate digital technology in order to protect children”. Towards the end of Whitehouse’s life she had become a figure of mockery, even being namechecked in the title of a BBC comedy show. But Ahmed said there was a case for nuance in judging Whitehouse’s legacy. She said: “At the time people joked about her objections to violence in children’s TV shows such as Doctor Who, but producers are far more sensitive as a result to what we see on screen, including the exploitation of young actors in sexually explicit scenes.”",News/Media,Ahead of her time?
