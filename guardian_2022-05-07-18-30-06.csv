5/7/2022,"Nearly 60% of children’s textiles labeled “waterproof”, “stain-resistant”, or “environmentally friendly” that were tested as part of a new study contained toxic PFAS substances known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment. Among products checked were clothing, pillow protectors, bedding and furniture. “It’s definitely a concern because these toxic chemicals can make their way into children’s bodies,” said Laurel Schaider, one of the study’s authors. PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of more than 9,000 compounds typically used across dozens of industries to make products water-, stain- or heat-resistant. They’re in thousands of everyday consumer products such as stain guards, cookware, food packaging and waterproof clothing. The chemicals are linked to cancer, birth defects, liver disease, thyroid disease, decreased immunity, hormone disruption and a range of other serious health problems. They’re dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they accumulate in humans. The peer-reviewed study was conducted by the public health advocacy group Silent Spring Institute and published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal. It aimed to provide a sense of the chemicals’ use in products that come with labeling suggesting it’s environmentally friendly or protective from stains and water. The study is not intended to provide a representative sample of children’s textiles. It detected PFAS in 54 of 93 products, including 21 with labels such as “eco”, “green” or “non-toxic”. The chemicals were most widely used in products labeled “water-” or “stain-” resistant. PFAS in clothing can get in the body via several routes. The chemicals are volatile, meaning they can break off from the products to which they’re applied, then move through the air and be breathed in. They can also attach to dust that’s breathed in or ingested, or they can be absorbed through the skin. Silent Spring most frequently detected the chemicals in upholstered furniture, clothing, and pillow protectors, and the latter two generally contained the highest PFAS levels. Nearly 20 products contained multiple kinds of PFAS, including PFOA, a highly toxic compound that regulators and industry claim has been phased out because of its danger, but which is still regularly detected in the US. Products that contained PFOA were made in China. It’s difficult for consumers to avoid the chemicals because they aren’t listed on tags, but the study provides some helpful hints, Schaider noted. Products labeled “stain resistant” most commonly contained the chemicals as PFAS are often the main ingredient in stain guards like Scotchgard. “That might mean making a lifestyle decision to live with stains,” Schaider said. Products labeled “waterproof” also frequently contained the chemicals. Navigating “eco” and “green” labels is also difficult because there’s no legal definition for the terms, and they can be “meaningless” marketing, Schaider said. Third party companies will certify products as environmentally safe, but there’s no uniform standard and some companies don’t consider PFAS in their certification. That’s partly because PFAS are a newer chemical than toxins like lead, but Schaider said certifiers “could do a better job”. The best solution, she added, is a ban on PFAS outside of essential uses such as medical devices where there isn’t a substitute chemical. “Where it is just a nice-to-have feature but we don’t really need it – all of these textile products fall into that category – it’s not worth it to introduce these forever chemicals into the home,” Schaider said.",News/Environment,‘Forever chemicals’ found in nearly 60% of children’s ‘waterproof’ or ‘stain-resistant’ textiles,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/07/pfas-forever-chemicals-children-textiles

But what began as a favour for a friend turned into something of a second job, and now the Nottingham-based photographer follows the same route, under the Trent Bridge, several times a week with various local dogs. “I’d noticed before that on rainy days, water from the road above would seep through and create a bit of a puddle in the same place. Schnauzers recognise and greet each other as if they’ve known them their whole life. On this day, I realised Flapjack was looking at his own reflection. “I love his expression and bushy eyebrows,” she continues. “They remind me of Denis Healey. Someone else told me the shot reminded them of Caravaggio’s Narcissus.” Wright is half-Norwegian and recalls spending summers there with family as a child. “We were right by the sea, so I think that’s where my affinity with water began. Whether it’s a little puddle or a fjord, I’m constantly looking at it in different ways, being inspired by it, trying to capture it. I’m especially drawn to reflections. Sometimes I like to flip them, or when it’s blurry rather than pure. Then, using black and white draws your eye to the details and the action.” Wright hasn’t used her digital camera for years, opting for her iPhone 11 Pro Max for this shot. “Strangers give me some peculiar looks when they see me crouching down near water,” she says. “Recently, one old lady tried to help me up!”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘His bushy eyebrows remind me of Denis Healey’: Emma F Wright’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/07/expression-bushy-eyebrows-emma-f-wright-best-phone-picture
5/7/2022,"Many column inches have been filled this week with what was worn at the Met Gala on Monday. But what about what wasn’t worn? Cara Delevingne went topless bar some gold paint and a couple of nipple protectors, while Gwen Stefani wore a strapless acid-green bra and matching ball skirt. Adwoa Aboah’s see-through crystal bra was more see-through than crystal. Could it be that clothes have fallen out of fashion? According to a new trend report from Clearpay, a payments platform and sponsor of London fashion week, “the sexy silhouette trend that bubbled up at the start of the pandemic is evolving into ‘barely there’ clothing, with lingerie styles creeping into everyday wear.” This season has seen “naked” cut-out dresses from Nensi Dojaka, Cult Gaia and the size-inclusive label Ester Manas, bikini ball gowns at Valentino and Vera Wang, and Miu Miu’s ultra-cropped tops and micro minis. Fashion historian Dr Kate Strasdin of Falmouth University draws a parallel between today’s financial adversities and those of the Great Depression. It’s not unusual to see a “spike of glamour” during hard times, she says, which may explain the current trend for flesh. “In the 1930s, there was a devil-may-care attitude,” she says, with similarly “revealing, form-fitting dresses that would be worn without underwear. Being on show was a big thing during the Depression. It was a celebration of the visibility of the human body, and a rejection of all those privations.” The modern-day equivalent, says Laura Yiannakou of the trend-forecasting agency WGSN, is “sweatpant fatigue and a rejection of stay-home style, which goes hand-in-hand with a new era of hedonism”. Yiannakou adds that these barely-there looks are a clear reference to the 1990s, when underwear was worn as outerwear and dresses were inspired by lingerie, Tom Ford sent a naked bottom down the catwalk (save for a Gucci G-string) and Alexander McQueen created bottom cleavages with bumster trousers. Flashing the flesh is also about “using the female body as a shock tactic”, says Strasdin. “For example, bumsters were about outraging the establishment.” This time round, it’s about rattling the patriarchy. “Post #MeToo, women are saying, ‘I can celebrate my body by wearing whatever I want,’” she adds, “and that doesn’t mean it invites unwanted access.” The no-clothes trend “taps into a new era of power dressing”, says Yiannakou. “It’s modern feminism, celebrating the female form in all its shapes and sizes, and unapologetically so.” Some are, predictably, more cynical. “This is not about feminism,” says Dr Kirsty Fairclough of Manchester Metropolitan University, but a “desperate attempt by celebrities to revive their brands”. Referencing a New York Times article that maintained celebrity culture was redundant, Fairclough said, “The world’s burning, and you’ve got Kim Kardashian flying her friends to a private island in the middle of a pandemic. The celebrities are trying to regain their relevance by baring flesh, and it’s deeply problematic.” To Fairclough, such exposure is about gaining, well, exposure – it’s simply a business strategy. “Social media is such a noisy place now,” says Yiannakou. “This whole flash-flashing thing is done to garner attention.” Clearpay’s data suggests that this trend is already trickling down to shoppers, with ultra miniskirts, cut-outs and super sheer skirts all topping its clothing searches. Clearpay’s fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell concedes that it’s easier for celebrities to “get away with barely-there fashion, because they’re less bound by social norms; they don’t have to do a 9-5”. Celebs may be experimenting with exposure but “let’s be honest,” says Yiannakou. “We’re not all going to be wearing tiny bras and micro minis. The willingness to give up comfort altogether is not quite there yet.” In fact, she adds, WGSN has recently identified a new trend which they’re calling “comfy party”, where skimpy, “going out-out” clothes are paired with slouchy cardies and drawstring waistbands. “It’s still rooted in a comfy night out.” Phew.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Flashing the flesh: what’s behind the new barely-there trend?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/07/flashing-the-flesh-whats-behind-the-new-barely-there-trend
5/7/2022,"Through the end of 2020 and the early part of 2021, as Donald Trump’s political world fell apart in the wake of his election loss, the former US president was receiving advice and aid from a range of sources. As Trump raged against non-existent election fraud, he took counsel from his actual staff. He also had help from acquaintances and associates like Rudy Giuliani. But, less conventionally, Trump’s White House was also getting guidance from some of Fox News’ best-known personalities, in a level of coordination rarely, if ever, seen in top-level politics. The direct interactions between Trump’s administration and the Fox hosts Sean Hannity and Maria Bartiromo were revealed in leaked text messages from the phone of Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff during the November election and the January 6 insurrection. The texts, revealed by CNN, show how the lines between Fox News and the Trump White House had become jarringly blurred in Trump’s final months. On election day 2021 Hannity, the second-most watched host on Fox News, was texting Meadows asking which states he particularly needed to “push” – to encourage people to vote. On 29 November, an hour before Trump was to sit down for a first interview since losing the election, the president received a bit of help with his preparation; from Bartiromo, who sent her list of questions to Meadows, along with a suggestion. “Pls make sure he doesn’t go off on tangents,” Bartiromo wrote, a request that ultimately would go unheeded. In total, Meadows exchanged more than 80 text messages with Hannity between 3 November and 20 January, when Joe Biden was inaugurated. CNN obtained 2,319 of Meadows’s texts, which the former chief of staff had provided to the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. They show Hannity variously giving and asking for advice from the White House. After seeking direction on where he should help get out the vote, Hannity would later give Meadows suggestions on how Trump could fight the election results. The implications of a Fox News-Trump White House alignment are “scary”, said Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, a media watchdog. “Because you cannot have any kind of functional authoritarian or anti-democratic environment unless you have some really powerful propaganda tools. And once you have this kind of synchronization, then basically what you have is a pretty important ingredient in order to drive a whole range of policies,” Carusone said. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Brian Kilmeade were also in contact, to varying degrees, with Meadows over the three-month period, meaning a slew of Fox News personalities had their own lines into the White House. The select committee had previously released texts which showed Ingraham and Kilmeade pleading with Trump to intervene as his supporters swarmed the Capitol. “Hey Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,” Ingraham wrote. In the wake of the texts being published Hannity, who was lightly reprimanded by Fox News in 2018 after he appeared on stage at a Trump rally, obliquely addressed the texts on his nightly show. “Yes, I’m a member of the press,” Hannity said. “I’m on the Fox News Channel – which is a news channel – but I don’t claim to be a journalist. I claim to be a talkshow host.” (“I’m a journalist,” Hannity said in an interview with the New York Times in 2017. “But I’m an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist.”) Coordination between rightwing media and Republican administrations is not necessarily new. Scott McClellan, press secretary under George W Bush, admitted working with Fox News on “talking points” during the 2004 presidential campaign, while Rolling Stone reported that John Moody, a top Fox News executive during the Roger Ailes era, wrote a memo to staff that Bush’s “political courage and tactical cunning are worth noting in our reporting throughout the day”. What’s different this time, Carusone said, is that even though the network and Bush’s team “were in close alignment” in 2004, “they still felt independent”. As chairman and CEO of Fox News, Ailes had close control over the network’s editorial policy, and he alone would make decisions on direction. As Trump flailed in the dying days of his presidency, there was no Ailes-like figure to steer the coverage. “There was no gatekeeper. It’s not like the White House was coordinating with all the hosts back in the day,” Carusone said. “They were coordinating with Roger Ailes, who was doing the editorial meetings. He was functioning as the conduit for coordination. In this case, it was like a free-for-all.” The interaction between Fox News and Trump’s White House appears to have flowed both ways. Under Bush’s administration, it seemed to be the politicians leading the line, with Fox News supporting the president’s policies. Under Trump, it wasn’t so clear who was in charge of policy. According to Media Matters, Trump “tweeted in response to Fox News or Fox Business programs he was watching” 1,146 times from September 2018 through August 2020. To journalists, Bartiromo’s handing of questions to Trump’s team might seem to be the most egregious action. “1Q You’ve said MANY TIMES THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED… And the facts are on your side. Let’s start there. What are the facts? Characterize what took place here. Then I will drill down on the fraud including the statistical impossibilities of Biden magic (federalist). Pls make sure he doesn’t go off on tangents. We want to know he is strong he is a fighter & he will win. This is no longer about him. This is about ????. I will ask him about big tech & media influencing ejection as well Toward end I’ll get to GA runoffs & then vaccines,” Bartiromo texted to Meadows an hour before the November interview. The interview, as CNN reported, mirrored the questions in Bartiromo’s message. Heather Hendershot, a professor of film and media at MIT who studies TV news and conservative media, said the advent of cable TV news, which began in the 1980s and accelerated through the 1990s – the Fox News channel was launched in 1996 – had prompted a change in acceptable, or permitted, journalistic standards. “In the pre-cable, network era, an anchorperson or reporter would obviously be fired – with no room for discussion – if it was found that he or she had provided questions in advance of an interview with a politician,” said Hendershot, who is writing a book about how coverage of protests at the 1968 Democratic convention contributed to a shattering of faith in US media. “This would be seen not simply as a political gaffe but perhaps even more strongly as a professional gaffe. The norms of journalistic practice dictated against this sort of behavior. “In 1963, Walter Cronkite of CBS interviewed JFK. Immediately following the interview, the president said he was unhappy with the interview and wanted a ‘do-over’. Cronkite did not hesitate: that was out of the question. They would run the interview as it had happened.” Today, Hendershot said, one can easily imagine the same scenario, where a president or politician was unhappy with an interview question, and requests another go at answering. “Would a network correspondent allow this?” Hendershot said. “Probably not. Would Fox News allow it? Definitely yes, but only for a Republican politician.”",News/Media,Meadows texts reveal just how tight the Fox News-Trump embrace is,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/07/fox-news-donald-trump-meadows-hannity-texts
5/7/2022,"In May 1993, as the IRA edged towards the end of its armed campaign, Michelle O’Neill was beginning her own struggle. She was a 16-year-old working-class schoolgirl from Clonoe, a small village in County Tyrone, with a newborn baby. The road ahead looked rocky. She had not finished school and perhaps never would, because that was the fate of many unmarried teenage mothers in Northern Ireland. Some teachers at her Catholic grammar school were not supportive. Yet almost three decades later, O’Neill, now 45, is on the verge of making history as the first nationalist leader of Northern Ireland. Personable and cheerful, she has led Sinn Féin to victory in an election for the Stormont assembly. As the biggest party it can nominate her for first minister. The symbolism is momentous. A state designed to have a permanent unionist majority may soon be led by a politician who wants to dissolve it into a united Ireland. “I knew Michelle could do it. She has grit. She got herself educated, worked hard, never stopped,” said Paula Sweeney, 57, a friend and neighbour. There is no short-term prospect of a border poll for a united Ireland, let alone victory in such a referendum. Most people in Northern Ireland wish to remain in the UK. Nor would O’Neill becoming first minister signify radical change. Before Stormont collapsed in January she was deputy first minister, a post with equal power in the power-sharing executive, where Sinn Féin has governed with other parties for 15 years. But winning the more prestigious title is a psychological breakthrough for Irish nationalism and a gut-punch to unionism. If unionist parties balk at serving in a new executive there could be months of wrangling. Even so, O’Neill would remain centre stage. Her journey there intertwines with the IRA ending its armed struggle. She was born Michelle Doris into a prominent republican family at the height of the Troubles. Her father, Brendan Doris, was an IRA prisoner. An uncle, Paul Doris, headed the Irish Northern Aid Committee (Noraid) that raised funds for the IRA in the US. Two of her cousins, IRA members, were shot by security forces, one fatally. O’Neill’s family rallied around her when she became pregnant and helped care for her baby daughter, Saoirse, while O’Neill completed her A-levels. IRA ceasefires paved the way for the 1998 Good Friday agreement and boosted Sinn Féin at the polls. O’Neill’s father was elected to Dungannon borough council, a path she followed, winning his seat in 2005 after he stepped down. O’Neill went on to become mayor and a protege of Francie Molloy, a Sinn Féin assembly member, and Martin McGuinness, the party’s dominant figure along with Gerry Adams. They selected her to run for the assembly in 2007. She won. “It was shrewd of Martin to pick a working-class woman with republican credentials. That is incredibly important when it comes to Sinn Féin in the north,” said Aoife Moore, a journalist with the Irish Examiner who is writing a book about the party. O’Neill, by then with a second child and a husband, served on the education committee but initially appeared to have a crisis of confidence at Stormont, said Moore. “She has a serious amount of tenacity. She has come on leaps and bounds from when she first started.” Sinn Féin appointed O’Neill agriculture minister in 2011 during the “Chuckle Brothers” heyday when McGuinness, as deputy first minister, established a rapport with Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist party leader and first minister. Paisley referred to him as “my deputy” even though they had equal power. O’Neill served as health minister before Stormont collapsed in 2017 over a renewable energy scandal. When McGuinness died soon after, Sinn Féin vaulted O’Neill over more senior colleagues to lead the party in the north and serve as deputy first minister, part of a strategy to promote younger faces with no direct ties to IRA violence. Mary Lou McDonald, a member of the Irish parliament in Dublin, succeeded Gerry Adams as the party’s overall leader. The two women run an effective double act. McDonald is the senior partner and appears more comfortable speaking off the cuff and cracking jokes. She could be Ireland’s next taoiseach. O’Neill sounds more scripted and guarded, fuelling allegations that a backroom cabal with IRA ties wields influence. “She’s not the person who sets Sinn Féin policy on a wide range of issues. She’s the front person who can appear plausibly on television and communicate effectively,” said one DUP insider. Deirdre Heenan, a social policy professor at the University of Ulster, said suspicions would endure. “Sinn Féin will always suffer a question of who is really in charge but they’re trying to shake off the image of the past.” O’Neill was part of a tightly disciplined campaign that targeted centrist voters and focused on the cost of living and healthcare as opposed to a united Ireland. She avoided the gaffes or controversy that might have enabled the DUP to close the gap, said Jonathan Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor. “She has looked first ministerial. She has been personable rather than confrontational.” When the Guardian asked O’Neill about making history as the region’s first nationalist leader, she stayed on message and spoke of a need to to “stand up for everybody” and fix the health service. She made no mention of a referendum on a united Ireland. She did not have to. She now embodies momentum towards that day.",News/Politics,Michelle O’Neill: centre stage for Sinn Féin’s prospective first minister,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/michelle-oneill-centre-stage-for-sinn-fein-prospective-first-minister
5/7/2022,"Just as many of us grasped for connections during lockdown, the pandemic has inspired Eunic London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, to dwell on the meaning of relationships for this year’s showcase for European short films, put together by curator Shira Macleod. Not all are – as the strand’s subtitle would have it – loving encounters: break-ups, bureaucratic frustration and unsettling alien fauna crop up, too. And the one explicitly Covid-related work, Romanian director Alina Manolache’s mesmerising I Am Here, features relationships by their absence: the social vacuum on display in CCTV footage from the Trevi Fountain, Chinese pharmacies, a British golf course and other depopulated locations around the world. Relationships take a politicised shade in Alexandra Matheou’s A Summer Place, a lush dalliance between a Cypriot food artist and the Arab refugee she rescues from the sea. But its Paolo Sorrentino-esque scenes of excess draw the lines between European haves and outsider have-nots somewhat heavy-handedly. More subtle on the immigration beat is the forlorn black-and-white drama Beyond Is the Day, from Poland’s Damian Kocur, which turns an out-of-the-way river barge into an intercontinental metaphor. Eunic’s selection broadly tries to buoy us up as societies emerge from the pandemic with an upbeat view of relationships, as in the delightful Forest Coal Pit, by Siôn Marshall-Waters, about a pair of elderly Welsh brothers who, despite the rigours of running their farm, are never short on wonder about the world. “Well, they’re in perpetual motion, shrews, aren’t they?” one marvels. But there’s an anxious pulse to Cuckoo!, in which Dutch director Jörgen Scholtens puts his cuckoo clock-dwelling protagonist on a tight schedule, ensuring an elderly lady takes her medication; it plays like an absurdist Werther’s Original advert. An even angstier mother frets about sexual predators on behalf of her gay son in Are You Hungry?, creating a honeytrap profile for him as “Tomi of Finland”. But Teemu Niukkanen’s droll and sharply characterised feature asserts that the kids are alright. “I like rainbows as natural phenomena,” deadpans Tomi about his LGBT-flagging T-shirt. Most striking are two shorts from Croatia and Scotland. The resplendent Into the Blue is a teenage love triangle unfolding in a relaxed riviera setting, only with intense undercurrents. Gracija Filipovic is darkly seductive as the interloper crashing her childhood friend’s budding romance, while director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović makes the sapphire depths undulate with loneliness and liberation. Josephine Lohoar Self’s animation The Fabric of You sounds cosier, but there’s an unsettling texture to its tryst between a Bronx mouse tailor and his well-spoken client. This rodent Remains of the Day discourses smoothly on the link between fashion and dissimulation, while its frayed, writhing stop-motion hints at agony beneath the breast. The standard of work is perhaps more consistent than that of last year’s group, but it’s also notable that, with plenty in the 15- to 25-minute range, the selection pushes the definition of short. One final mention then to Maria Fredriksson’s documentary entry Svonni vs the Swedish Tax Agency, which manages to pack in a tale of one women and her dog, her struggle to get it recognised as tax-deductible, and the broader context of Sami reindeer herding, in a succinct and springy five minutes. Brief encounters can be the most intense.
