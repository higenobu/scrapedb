1/28/2022,"Canadian authorities believe the deaths of four Indian nationals found steps away from the Canada-US border are connected to a human smuggling scheme. Jagdish Patel, 39, Vaishailben Patel, 37, and their children Vihangi, 11, and Dharkmik, 3, died from exposure due to the frigid cold near Manitoba, Canada. Temperatures dropped to -35C (-31F) on the night the Patel family attempted to cross into the US on foot. The family was found in a field north of the border on 19 January. Their identities were announced by the Canada's High Commission of India and later confirmed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, RCMP superintendent Rob Hill said the Patel family first arrived to Canada on 12 January, arriving on a flight from Toronto. From there, they made their way west to Manitoba, before travelling to Emerson - a border town - on or around 18 January. Their bodies were found the next night. No vehicle was found near the Canada-US border in Emerson, suggesting that someone drove the Patel family to a drop-off point before they began their journey on foot. ""This is an extended period of time for a family who is unfamiliar with Canada to be traveling across the country"", he said. It is believed that someone may have facilitated their travel. The RCMP would not comment on whether the Patel's case was connected to a group of seven other Indian nationals also found by border agents on the evening of 19 January. Steve Shand, a 47-year-old Florida resident, has been charged with human smuggling after authorities found him driving a 15-person van along the border, on the same night the Patels were found. Mr Shand had two Indian nationals as passengers in his car, and cases of food and water in his boot. The deaths of the Patel family has rocked the Indian community in Manitoba. ""There's a common sense of feeling guilty, like something has gone wrong,"" Ramandeep Grewal, president of the India Association of Manitoba, told the BBC. Questions remain as to why the Patel family set out on foot in the dark, in Canada's punishing winter weather. Mr Grewal said he heard rumours the family walked for 11 hours. ""You don't expose yourself to that degree of cold for minutes, let alone hours,"" he said. Such questions have consumed Indian communities in Winnipeg, said Hemant Shah an Indian ex-pat, who organised a virtual prayer for the Patel family this week. ""There are lots of Patel families here, lots of Indo-Canadians,"" he said. ""Everybody's talking, making their own theories."" While perilous border crossings have become typical to the United States' southern border, this type of journey is less common from the north. ""I've never seen this in Canada,"" Mr Shah said. ""This is unheard of."" The RCMP has launched an ""extensive"" investigation into how the Patel's made their way to Canada, coordinating with the US and India. It is so far unknown if the Patels had family in Canada or the US. A special team led by a senior Indian consular officer was dispatched to Manitoba to assist Canadian authorities with the investigation. The Consulate General of India in Toronto has been in touch with relatives to provide support. Last week, a US Homeland Security official said they were also investigating the Patel case, alongside a ""larger human smuggling operation of which [Steve] Shand is suspected of playing a part"". There had been three other recent incidents of human smuggling in December and January in the same location where Mr Shand was apprehended, according to court documents. The India Association's Mr Grewal said he hopes other families contemplating a similar journey may now reconsider. ""If there's anybody else who's in the same boat, who's trying to cross... Don't go, don't listen to people who are telling you they can help.""",World/BBC,Family who died in freezing cold by US-Canada border identified,https://news.yahoo.com/family-died-freezing-cold-us-200418848.html
1/28/2022,"Editor’s note: This story describes graphic instances of domestic violence. Proceed with caution. “Daddy was hitting mommy with a blue stick,” the 11-year-old daughter of a woman allegedly beaten to death in Long Beach said in a forensic interview with authorities. “Daddy was jumping on mommy,” the child later added. The stick was actually a blue concrete pipe, and the events that the couple’s eldest daughter shared with forensic interviewers, along with other evidence, backed up what Long Beach police suspected all along: Robert Oshinski, 37, had allegedly killed his common-law wife, Ashley A. “Angie” Barbara. That and other gripping testimony about the alleged attack came out in Oshinski’s preliminary hearing Wednesday in Harrison County Justice Court. After hearing the evidence, it didn’t take long for Justice Court Judge Dianne Ladner to find there was enough evidence to bound the case over to a Harrison County grand jury for indictments. The killing occurred on Jan. 9, a day after Oshinski got out of jail in Hancock County on a $10,000 bond on an aggravated assault charge accusing him of assaulting Barbara’s sister’s boyfriend six years earlier. Hancock County sheriff’s investigators have not said why it took six years to arrest Oshinski in the 2015 assault, but according to the affidavits filed in the case, Oshinski had allegedly run over the victim with a 4-wheeler and then repeatedly punched him in the back of his head. An ambulance took the man from the scene on Longvue Street to an area hospital for treatment. And that wasn’t the first time Oshinki had been accused of an assault. He had previous arrests in St. Tammany Parish in Louisiana in misdemeanor domestic violence assault cases involving Barbara, Long Beach police Det. Brad Gross said Wednesday. Despite his history of alleged assaults and domestic violence in other jurisdictions, a Hancock County Justice Court Judge set Oshinski’s bond at $10,000 in the Hancock County assault case. After two days behind bars, Oshinski was a free man. When Oshinski returned to the couple’s 24-foot camper in a parking bay on U.S. 90 after his release from the Hancock County jail, the events leading up to Barbara’s death started to unfold. Oshinski was angry after being locked up for the assault and then started accusing Barbara of cheating on him, the investigator said. In the hours that followed, the oldest child told authorities, Oshinski repeatedly hit Barbara with the concrete pipe and once she fell to the ground, he started jumping on her and punching her. At one point when Barbara was on the floor of the couple’s camper, the children told authorities that Barbara screamed out for Oshinski to stop, saying, “‘I can’t feel my legs. You are going to paralyze me,” Gross said. Once Barbara lost consciousness, the oldest child said, her father grabbed some oxygen he happened to keep in the camper and tried unsuccessfully to revive Barbara. He reminded the children at the time, the investigator said, that their mother had done this before, meaning passing out during an alleged assault. At first, the couple’s children provided little information about what had happened, apparently following the lead of their father to say he found Barbara on a seawall near Cleveland Avenue and tried to revive her before telling the children he needed to take mommy to the hospital for treatment. On the way there, the 11-year-old girl started trying to perform CPR on her mother, but Oshinski told her to stop, the investigator said. The child told authorities Oshinski rode around for a bit still trying to figure out what to do about Barbara. He had placed Barbara in the back seat of her Chevrolet Tahoe, where investigators later found blood on a seat and elsewhere. Oshinski then instructed the 11-year-old girl to wipe the blood from around her mother’s wounds before they arrived at Memorial Hospital at Gulfport. Once they got there, Gross said, video footage from the hospital showed Oshinski placing Barbara’s limp body into a wheelchair and trying to adjust her head because it kept falling. When Oshinski spoke to hospital officials, he said “her name is Ashley and I’ve got kids in the car,” and then he left, Gross said. In addition to the bloodied wounds on her body, Barbara had bald spots in her hair that Oshinski allegedly ripped out during the alleged attack, and her eyes were blackened and swollen shut. Both of her hands had been broken, the investigators said, and one of her fingers had been stretched out and slashed to the bone. In addition, Gross said, Barbara had a large cut across the length of her forehead with what investigators said appeared to be brain matter hanging out of it. Barbara, with already a weakened pulse upon arrival at the hospital, was pronounced dead a short time later. Gross said there was also evidence of old wounds on Barbara’s body consistent with injuries she likely suffered in previous assaults. Shortly after the investigation began, Long Beach police obtained a search warrant for the couple’s camper in Long Beach. Inside, Gross said, investigators said there were clothes, food, bicycles, tools, a cat and dog and various other belongings that were strewn about. The first thing investigators noticed, he said, was blood all over the walls and floors and what appeared to be skin hanging from a mirror in a bathroom inside. Authorities also recovered the bloodied concrete pipe and other evidence. Oshinski, he said, was taken into custody when he returned to the hospital after dropping the three children off at the home of his bosses. Oshinski worked in construction. When police tried to question Oshinski about the alleged attack, he declined and asked for an attorney instead. Oshinski remains jailed in Harrison County on a $1 million bond. In addition, he has been off-bonded on the aggravated assault charge in Hancock County, meaning he is not eligible for release in that case. After Barbara’s death, the three siblings were placed in child protective services. All the children are together in the same place, Harrison County prosecuting attorney Herman Cox said. If convicted of murder, Oshinski could go to prison for life.

1/28/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — China is demanding the U.S. end “interference” in the Beijing Winter Olympics, which begin next week, in an apparent reference to a diplomatic boycott imposed by Washington and some of its allies. Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the demand in a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday Beijing time, according to the Foreign Ministry. The U.S. has said it will not send dignitaries to the Games, which open Feb. 4, in a protest over China’s detention of more than 1 million Uyghur Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, along with crackdowns on human rights elsewhere in the country. The boycott does not prevent U.S. athletes from taking part in the Games, which are being held under strict anti-pandemic rules. China has also protested what it says are calls within the State Department to withdraw staff and their dependents from the embassy and consulates around China over the tightening restrictions. According to a news release posted on the ministry’s website Thursday, Wang also called for an end to U.S. support for self-governing Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. China’s growing assertiveness directed at the U.S. has extended as far as relations with Central American nations and as close as Beijing’s maritime claims in the South and East China Seas. At a monthly briefing Thursday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian responded to a question about U.S. military movements in the Asia-Pacific region by saying China's armed forces were “fully prepared to deal with any foreign provocations or emergency situations"" that arise during the Olympics. The U.S. says it doesn't recognize most of China's claims in the strategically crucial South China Sea and routinely sails warships and flies planes near Chinese-held islands. Foreign Minister Wang also complained that the administration of President Joe Biden has maintained tough political and economic policies enacted earlier despite its expressed wishes for a less confrontational relationship. “The U.S. continuously puts forward wrong words and actions toward China, causing new conflicts in relations between the two countries,"" Wang was quoted as saying. A brief statement from the State Department said that Blinken and Wang exchanged views on how to manage strategic risk, health security and climate change. It did not mention the Olympics or Taiwan. Blinken underscored the economic and security risks posed by Russian aggression against Ukraine, the statement said. The phone call follows the appointment of veteran diplomat Nicholas Burns as the new U.S. ambassador to China, a position that has remained empty for more than a year.",World/Associated Press,China demands US halt Olympics 'interference',https://news.yahoo.com/china-demands-us-halt-olympics-065048625.html
1/28/2022,"U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg has boxed herself into a dilemma. She has kept a report on a theoretical voting machine flaw—authored by a respected computer researcher—secret since last summer, citing concerns that releasing the report would fuel conspiracy theories about voting machines and the 2020 U.S. presidential election. But her attempts at preventing conspiracy theories has fueled those theories anyway. And now, she has Georgia's top elections official, Brad Raffensberger, urging her to make the report public. For now, Totenberg decided Thursday that she would keep the document private. But she said she would review the report herself and potentially make a new judgment soon—possibly as soon as Monday. “I’m unhappy about the course of political treatment of the report… it’s out of hand,” a clearly frustrated Totenberg said in court Thursday. “But I’m not going to release it without seeing what is being proposed with redactions.” The judge’s decision to keep the report private last year has generated plenty of scrutiny—and interest from the Department of Homeland Security, Louisiana’s secretary of state, and Fox News. Judge Seals Report on Voting Machine Vulnerability Many want to see what, exactly, Michigan computer science professor J. Alex Halderman found that led him to conclude that a non-technical person could spend a few minutes in a voting booth and change how a particular machine tallies votes. “Georgia voters face an extreme risk that [ballot marking device]-based attacks could manipulate their individual votes and alter election outcomes,” Halderman said of the secret report in a signed declaration last year, as The Daily Beast previously reported. And facing mounting pressure—including from fellow Republican allies like Gov. Brian Kemp—Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger issued a statement Thursday urging transparency. Although Halderman has already asked for a safer, redacted version of his report to be made public, Raffensperger issued a statement Thursday “calling on J. Alex Halderman” to ask the judge to publicly release his findings. “The public deserves to know the context of J. Alex Halderman’s claims,” Raffensberger said. In court, the state agency’s lawyer, Vincent Robert Russo Jr., said not making the report public would do more harm than good. “It’s unfortunate that we’re in this position,” Russo said. Raffensberger’s pivot may represent less of a genuine interest in exploring the revelations in Halderman’s report, and more of an attempt to call out Halderman’s bluff. Raffensberger noted Thursday he thought the report was not an “objective, academic study.” Pro-Trump Group Invented Voter Fraud Claims Months Before Election Although some will welcome Raffensperger’s sudden call for transparency, it does come with some political risk. The Republican secretary of state came under attack from former President Donald Trump for asserting that the 2020 election was fair and accurate—and has drawn several GOP challengers for his reelection campaign this year. If the report is made public and the flaws are proven to be real, his office will have only a few months to fix them before the primary elections in May—or face even more fear mongering about hacked voting machines from conspiracy theorists. Totenberg has for months insisted that the 25,000-word report remain “attorney’s eyes only” and had resisted Halderman’s own request to make public a redacted version of the report to allow the voting machine manufacturer to fix any flaws. Halderman has wanted to release a redacted version of the report that would not serve as a blueprint for would-be hackers, but Thursday was the first time Raffensperger supported that move. The document’s release wouldn’t just be relevant for the ongoing court case and Raffensberger; the machines in question that may have the theoretical vulnerability are also in use in various jurisdictions in multiple states around the country, some of which have expressed interest in receiving more information about the alleged flaws. Some of the states are holding elections this year. Fox News is also watching the case with keen interest. They’ve been working to fend off a defamation suit from the machine maker in question, Dominion Voting Systems, that the news station had been spreading conspiracy theories about how the vendor’s technology may have contributed to election meddling. Election-Fraud Stars Vow to Stab Each Other—‘With the Truth’ Although its attorneys had access, Dominion itself had been blocked from viewing the report for months, but two sources familiar with the court case told The Daily Beast that the company obtained Halderman’s findings in December. The company did not immediately confirm that on Thursday afternoon. In a statement issued alongside the Georgia secretary of state, Dominion CEO John Poulus attacked Halderman’s review. “Dominion supports all efforts to bring real facts and evidence forward to defend the integrity of our machines and the credibility of Georgia’s elections,” he said. In court on Thursday, David Cross, an attorney for the voting rights activists who commissioned the report and are seeking to replace the state’s voting machines, said that there’s now another reason to make this report public. “As long as this report stays sealed… it’s hurting Dr. Halderman’s professional integrity,” he said. For some, the entire conversation about potential vulnerabilities in voting machines, including in this case, has always led them back to one conclusion: That using paper ballots, while leaving some machines available for those with disabilities, would be the most secure way to run elections. Election security experts have long argued that paper ballots would eliminate any concerns about hackers interfering in elections’ operations. Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/28/2022,"Amazon will shut down third-party seller program ""Sold by Amazon"" over allegations of price-fixing. Washington's AG says Amazon ""unreasonably restrained competition in order to maximize its own profits"" with the program. The company will also pay $2.25 million to settle the allegations. Amazon is shutting down its third-party seller program ""Sold by Amazon"" after the company was accused of price-fixing. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced Wednesday that Amazon will end the program nationwide and pay $2.25 million to settle the allegations under a legally binding resolution. Ferguson's lawsuit alleged that Amazon violated antitrust laws and ""unreasonably restrained competition in order to maximize its own profits off third-party sales"" by agreeing on prices with these sellers instead of competing with them. ""Consumers lose when corporate giants like Amazon fix prices to increase their profits,"" Ferguson said in the release. ""Today's action promotes product innovation and consumer choice, and makes the market more competitive for sellers in Washington state and across the country."" The program ran from 2018 to 2020 and guaranteed third-party sellers a minimum payment for product sales ""in exchange for their agreement to stop competing with Amazon for the pricing of their products,"" the release says. Whenever sales exceeded the minimum, Amazon split the extra proceeds with the sellers. Amazon had its pricing algorithm match prices offered by some external retailers, according to the lawsuit. This meant higher prices and lower sales for the sellers as customers sometimes turned to Amazon's own branded products instead. ""This resulted in Amazon maximizing its own profits regardless of whether consumers paid a higher price for sales of products enrolled in the 'Sold by Amazon' program or settled for buying the same or similar product offered through Amazon,"" the release says. Amazon's pricing algorithm set artificially high prices for many of the sellers' products because it was programmed ""to maintain the seller's pre-enrollment price as the price floor,"" the release says. Sellers had few options to offer discounts without dropping out of the program, hurting their sales and customers' wallets, Ferguson alleges. Amazon told Insider the program was started to give small businesses another channel to get their products to market and to lower prices for consumers. The company said Sold by Amazon was shut down for business reasons unrelated to the investigation. ""This was a small program to provide another tool to help sellers offer lower prices, much like similar programs common among other retailers, that has since been discontinued,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""While we strongly believe the program was legal, we're glad to have this matter resolved."" Amazon faced a similar lawsuit last May, when Washington DC Attorney General Karl Racine accused the company of creating ""an artificially high price floor across the online retail marketplace"" by demanding third-party sellers not sell their products at lower prices on other websites. Besides Sold by Amazon, the company has recently ended or suspended a handful of other programs, according to news reports. The Financial Times reported earlier this week that the company ended its Ambassador Program at the end of last year, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The program had paid warehouse workers to tweet positively about Amazon. Also this week, The Information reported that Amazon suspended its pay-to-quit program, which offers workers up to $5,000 to quit after busy seasons and agree never to return.

1/28/2022,"CHICAGO (AP) — A man and teen were ordered held without bond Thursday in the shooting death of an 8-year-old Chicago girl, who was walking and holding her mother's hand when she was shot in the head by a gunman authorities say was targeting someone else. Melissa Ortega died Saturday following the midday shooting along a busy city street, which Cook County Circuit Court Judge Susana Ortiz said showed ""an absolute disregard for human life.” Prosecutors say Xavier Guzman, 27, was driving a vehicle that stopped in the Little Village neighborhood on the city's Southwest Side on Saturday afternoon after a rival gang member leaving a store flashed gang signs. Emilio Corripio, 16, then got out of the car and fired toward the 29-year-old man, prosecutors said. The teen is being tried as an adult due to the seriousness of the crime, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said. Both were arrested on charges of first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. Corripio is also charged with aggravated discharge of a firearm. A prosecutor said Thursday that Guzman, a suburban cab driver, picked Corripio up in his cab before the shooting. The two were arrested after detectives analyzed surveillance video and license plate reader technology that allowed them to track down the vehicle Guzman was driving, which had the name of the cab, a phone number and a visually distinct logo, prosecutors said. The surveillance video showed the car pull into an alley, where the gunman got out of the car and began firing, he said. The video then showed the gunman get back in the vehicle, which fled the scene. After the shooting, surveillance video shows the two going to a Subway restaurant to buy sandwiches and later buying drinks at a gas station, according to prosecutors. Detectives also used GPS in the cab to track the suspects’ movements. They say the two drove by the scene of the shooting afterward, and that later that night the cab passed by a memorial site for the young girl. Police say they found a gun in the cab when Guzman was arrested, and ballistics testing showed it was the gun used in the shooting. Corripio was arrested three times in 2021 for aggravated vehicular hijacking and was on probation at the time of Saturday's shooting, prosecutors said. Corripio's defense attorney said he is a high school junior who lives with his mother and father and plays soccer. Melissa was a student at Emiliano Zapata Academy, an elementary school in the city’s heavily-Mexican neighborhood, according to the Chicago Teachers Union. A prosecutor said she was wearing a pink hat as she walked with her mother to run errands. When gunfire broke out, Melissa and her mother began running across a street. Video shows Melissa looking behind her, toward the gunfire as she was shot, prosecutors say. She was pronounced dead at a hospital later Saturday. The man police say was the intended target was shot in the back and was hospitalized. Melissa Ortega's mother, Araceli Leanos, said in a statement released by a family representative Wednesday that the two had been walking together immediately before the shooting. She said Melissa had just asked if they could get a hamburger after going to the bank when ""My daughter stopped holding my hand and without explanation I found her on the floor with a puddle of blood and a bullet to her head.” Leanos said her family emigrated to Chicago from Mexico six months ago “in search of the American dream."" “Instead I get to live a nightmare the rest of my life,” she said. Prosecutors said that a 47-year-old man and his 9-year-old daughter were also in their car near the scene of the shooting on Saturday when the father saw the man flashing gang signs. He and his daughter stayed in their car, which was hit by gunfire. They were not injured, prosecutors said.
