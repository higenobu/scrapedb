2/27/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and Van Eck Associates are among large asset managers facing a ticking clock if they want to unload stakes in financial firms sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The firms also must sever business ties with VTB, which was stripped of its access to infrastructure for the settlement of trades in European markets. “Portfolio managers face a balancing act between complying with sanctions and complying with their obligations to fund shareholders under other laws and objectives, which include trying to match an index,” said Jay Baris, a law partner at Sidley Austin. “In a volatile market they must determine whether to hold the securities or sell them to a non-U.S. person at a price that could be a fire sale.” Read more: BlackRock Among Russia Bond Holders Tangled in $15 Billion Rout A Treasury official said the effective dates of the sanctions were delayed to help firms unwind positions in the affected Russian financial institutions. The extra time will “alleviate the need to rush to the market to sell,” said Darshak Dholakia, a Washington-based partner at Dechert LLP who specializes in sanctions and national security law. After May 25, investment funds will need to freeze their holdings in the sanctioned companies and won’t be able to trade their stocks or bonds under the current guidelines, Dholakia said. That would leave funds with illiquid holdings that are difficult to value. Many of the funds at issue are passively managed ETFs, which track broad stock or bond indexes that include the Russian firms. For money managers, this makes it harder to comply with the sanctions because they need to wait for index providers to make changes to the underlying indexes. They also may need to warn investors that their strategies could deviate from the original objectives. The asset managers have been down this road before. In 2017, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Venezuela, barring the trading of new debt issued by that government and its state oil company in U.S. markets. Those bonds were among the most-traded securities in emerging markets and were widely held by some of the biggest fund managers, including BlackRock and Vanguard.

For example, BlackRock’s $16-billion iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF holds debt issued by VEB. The fund tracks a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index and had a 3.8% weighting of Russian securities at year-end. BlackRock’s $308 million iShares MSCI Russia ETF, designed to give investors exposure to Russian stocks, has a stake of almost $2 million in VTB, the data show. “We are taking all necessary actions to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions laws and regulations,” BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said in a statement. Van Eck operates a $1.1 billion Russia-focused ETF with $30 million of VTB Bank depositary receipts as of Thursday. A spokesman for New York-based Van Eck said the firm is monitoring the U.S. sanctions and will comply with them. Vanguard, whose funds also had exposure to VTB Bank as of Jan. 31, said it’s reviewing the sanctions to determine how they will affect its portfolios. See also: Kyiv Under Fire as Putin Demands Ukraine Surrender Before Talks ETF provider Direxion warned investors that it indefinitely suspended the creation of additional shares for a Russia-focused fund it manages. “During this time, the fund may not meet its investment objective, may experience increased tracking error and may experience significant premium/discounts and bid-ask spreads,” Direxion said in a statement. Dimensional Fund Advisors also operates emerging markets funds that hold depositary receipts of VTB Bank. The Austin, Texas-based firm previously pared its exposure to Russian securities after sanctions were imposed in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea, according to Senior Investment Director Karen Umland. “While markets currently remain open and functioning, our portfolio management and compliance teams are actively monitoring this rapidly evolving situation,” she wrote in a post Friday on the firm’s website.

2/27/2022,"By Swati Verma (Reuters) - Gold prices reversed course to slide 1% on Friday, and palladium also dropped, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered sharp swings in the precious market. Spot gold slipped 1% to $1,884.69 per ounce by 12:07 p.m. ET (1707 GMT), swinging between gains and losses through the session. U.S. gold futures slumped more than 2% to $1,888.40. ""We think the price drop is premature, there is a risk of further escalation in the conflict and it could be just a temporary correction,"" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann. There may be expectations among market participants that the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia are not tough enough, Briesemann added. Prices of the safe-haven metal rallied more than 3% to as high as $1,973.96 in the last session after Russia attacked Ukraine. Prices have retreated more than $90 from Thursday's highs. ""The dramatic rise followed by the just as dramatic fall is very technically motivated,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. A rebound in the global shares markets also weighed on the safe-haven metal, even as analysts expect market volatility to remain elevated. [MKTS/GLOB] ""The risk premium and safe haven demand will continue to support gold, but the upside is limited by the possible rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve this March,"" said Xaio Fu, head of commodities markets strategy at Bank of China International. Palladium dropped 1.9% to $2,355.81. The metal touched $2,711.18 on Thursday, its highest since July last year. ""Palladium is the precious metal most exposed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" said Carlo Alberto De Casa, external market analyst at Kinesis. With Russia the largest producer of palladium, the likelihood of ever-stricter sanctions on the country and its companies raises the prospect of a supply shortage boosting prices, De Casa added. Spot silver fell 1.2% to $23.90 per ounce and platinum eased 0.4% to $1,053.02.

2/27/2022,"U.S. taxpayers expecting tax refunds this year are very concerned about the state of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which is facing record-low staffing issues. “The IRS is more backlogged than I've ever seen. And their computer systems are antiquated. And they just have had a lot of people leave their employment.” Robert Seltzer, Seltzer Business Management president and CPA, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “And they just have not had, you know, people replaced. So it's sort of the perfect storm for the IRS — underfunding, bad systems, you name it. It's the worst — they're in the worst position they've ever been in.” A poll from YouGov/ Forbes Advisor found that approximately 50% of U.S. taxpayers expect their refund to be lower this year after having received government aid during the pandemic. The survey, which consisted of 1,200 people, said that low-earning Americans felt especially pessimistic about the current tax season, despite IRS reassurances. At least 42% of Americans with household incomes under $50,000 don’t expect a refund and are unsure if they will get one. Tax refund delays will be “horrible,” said Seltzer. Major changes to the tax code last year could mean smaller than anticipated refunds this year, especially for the 35 million households that received the advanced Child Tax Credit (CTC). The American Rescue Plan, which passed in March 2021, increased the CTC amount from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child ages 6-17 and $3,000 for those under 6. The measure also allowed half of the amount to be distributed in advance each month from July to December last year. The remaining half would be delivered through a refund after families filed their federal tax return. If you received this credit, you may get a smaller tax refund this year because you already received the first half of the total benefit in 2021. Under normal circumstances, eligible families would receive at least $2,000 per child under the age of 17 through their refund. Now, they could get under $1,800. The survey found that 54% CTC recipients said they expected a smaller refund amount because they had received the advance last year. Meanwhile, at least 27% weren’t sure if the monthly payments would impact their refund. According to Seltzer, these concerns are justified. “If they got those (Child Tax Credit) payments throughout the year then their refund would be reduced,” said Seltzer. “Some people tried to cancel those payments and found it next to impossible to do so. But that is also consistent with the worst state of affairs (of the IRS) in my 30-plus years in the profession.” According to Seltzer, the best way to avoid delays is to file electronically. Filing a paper return “will delay your refund for months. Not weeks, but months,” he said. “I filed an amended return electronically in July, it is a simple return, with a refund of less than a thousand dollars. We still don’t have it.” The IRS also recommends registering for a direct deposit. Taxpayers can file electronically for free through the IRS or through a private tax preparer’s website. Before filing, make sure to check your return for accuracy to avoid a manual review from the IRS. Parents or guardians who received the advanced CTC payments should double check their returns as the agency warned that the Letter 6419, which details how much in advanced payments taxpayers received, could contain some errors. To file correctly, the IRS recommends reviewing your records on the IRS online account, as this will contain the most up-to-date information on your CTC that should go on your tax return. “If you’re off — even by a few dollars — the concern is your return is going to get in a holding pattern,” Greg Kling, an associate professor at USC Leventhal School of Accounting, previously told Yahoo Finance. “That’s obviously not a good thing.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money.
