12/14/2021,"Maps depicting Renaissance Tuscany are back on display at the Uffizi Galleries in Florence after being hidden from public view for more than 20 years. The wall paintings were commissioned in the late 1500s by Ferdinando I de’ Medici after the republic of Florence’s conquering of its rival Siena led to the creation the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and depict the newly unified territory.  More than 1,200 cities and towns, whose names are written in gold, are featured in the three maps designed by cartographer Stefano Bonsignori and painted by Ludovico Buti. The maps were the first large-scale representation of Tuscany and are displayed in the museum’s “hall of the geographical maps”, where Italian director Dario Argento shot a scene from his 1996 film The Stendhal Syndrome about the mysterious illness thought to strike visitors to Florence after they become overwhelmed by the beauty of the city’s artistic masterpieces. One wall depicts the map of the Florence territory, while another depicts Siena. A third wall features a map of Elba Island off the Tuscan coast. The room also contains a huge window from where visitors can get a bird’s eye view over the landscape of present-day Florence, including Palazzo Vecchio and the basilicas of Santa Croce and San Miniato al Monte. The restoration of the maps, which will open on Tuesday for a maximum of 20 visitors at a time, cost €700,000 (£600,000). “Even the smallest and most remote towns are elegantly written in gold and are often accompanied by the first known pictorial representation of the various locations,” said Eike Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi Galleries. “The inhabitants of the [Tuscan] region will be able to recognise places they love in these large maps.” The room, which also now contains seats for visitors, had been closed since the late 1990s. “It was a very old-fashioned, stuffy room that was clearly in need of restoration, although the official reason for keeping it closed was always lack of staff,” said Schmidt. “The wall paintings were darkened and you were really able to notice the dust. We’ve been able to restore them, clean them and install technology that automatically counts the number of people inside the room at one time.” The maps were commissioned by Ferdinando I to celebrate the conquering of Siena by Florence. Ferdinando I was the son of Cosimo I de’ Medici, the first grand duke of Tuscany, who commissioned architect Giorgio Vasari to build the Uffizi palace in 1560.",News/World news,Maps of Renaissance Tuscany on show for first time in 20 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/maps-of-renaissance-tuscany-on-show-for-first-time-in-20-years
12/14/2021,"Zadok The Priest booming. Pedro Pinto preening. Giorgio Marchetti officiating. Balls in bowls. A random former Euro star pulling. Yes, Big Cup last-16 draw stuck to its tried and trusted formula, with Andrey Arshavin, one-time women’s fashion designer turned indolent Arsenal playmaker turned St Petersburg ambassadorial suit, fulfilling duties as he was introduced to a gathering in Nyon and a global TV audience. Nothing could go wrong now. Just how hard can a tombola be?  PSG v Manchester United came out last as the box-office saver of a pretty dry rack of matches. Lionel Messi could mooch round the Old Trafford turf for one last time, Cristiano Ronaldo stood similarly statuesque at the other end, a superstar soccer version of Last Of The Summer Wine. For those interested in United’s version of Succession, the tie offered the chance for the club’s possible next manager, Mauricio Pochettino, to meet the current interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, someone pencilled in to be the suit working above the next manager. It was going to be brilliant. Mais non. The other half-decent tie, Atlético Madrid v Bayern Munich became the subject of an intrigue as confusing as Sunday’s almighty row following Max Verstappen winning the Vroom Vroom World Championships ahead of Lewis Hamilton. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed the Uefa suits had got their balls all wrong, the finer details of which are far too complicated for The Fiver to properly explain. The latest insult to the self-worth of Manchester United was delivered as Atlético cried foul on social media disgrace Twitter. “Uefa forgot to put United’s ball into the Atlético matchup. Atlético is studying whether it is possible to contest the draw.” “Following a technical problem with the software of an external service provider that instructs the officials as to which teams are eligible to play each other, a material error occurred,” droned Uefa’s statement. Club suits and m’learned friends were circling and so a redraw began with a lengthy Marchetti apology, with the tombola itself taking longer because actual humans had to check the computer hadn’t goofed up again. Arshavin, having redone up his loosened tie, did the business and landed Atlético the tie they had really wanted: Manchester United. Bayern meanwhile got Salzburg. And for PSG, the one they really didn’t want: Real Madrid, who pulled Benfica in the first draw and have spent the last couple of years chasing Kylian Mbappé. “That will conclude the Uefa [Big Cup] draw,” cheered Pedro Pinto rather hopefully. “You have to celebrate victories and that … was a big victory. I said maybe too much when I got hired here, but I don’t regret that. It was a big moment. I will do that again if we keep winning trophies” – New York City FC boss Ronny Deila on how he will keep stripping down to his undies if his side win the MLS Cup again, as they did on Saturday. “Should I laugh at the chaos of the Big Cup draw or feel sorry for The Fiver for having to rewrite today’s story?” – Krishna Moorthy. “Manchester City’s USA! USA!! USA!!!-based cousin Yankee Doodle New York City FC giddy-upped and won the MLS Cup for the first time over the weekend. This latest rendition of the Fairytale of New York is sure to stoke conversation about that controversial line. Y’know, the one about the team having become better after the likes of Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo skedaddled” – Peter Oh. “It says something about my snakebelly low expectations that after the botched Big Cup draw I wondered if either Weird Uncle Fiver had done the draw, if Uefa are taking your STOP FOOTBALL campaign seriously or if Uefa felt like doing you guys a solid and making themselves, not The Fiver, the punchbag for The Man today. How did we come to a point where The Fiver looks organised and superior? Where do we go from here, is there any further down we can go?” – Ferg Slade. “Like many non-F1 fans not acquainted with the finer points of articles 48.12 and 48.13, I was mystified how the driver who was in a distant second place and losing ground with five laps to go was suddenly allowed to catch up and ended up winning the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. This gave me a great idea how we could turn the dull sport of football into something far more exciting. Let’s say a team is losing 5-0, we are deep into stoppage time and a player goes down injured. The referee could simply reset the score to 0-0, allow the team that was losing to bring on two extra players and play five extra minutes of 13 v 11. I am sure the exciting finale would persuade any watching non-football fans to keep returning for more” – Dominic Tighe. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

12/14/2021,"Hotels are being turned into temporary care facilities staffed with workers flown in from Spain and Greece to relieve rising pressure on NHS hospital beds. Three hotels in the south of England are being used, including one in Plymouth into which 30 hospital patients have been discharged to be looked after by live-in carers. It is understood that the staff are staying on upper floors while patients are below.  At least three other health authorities are considering the move, which is partly driven by the severe shortage of domiciliary care workers able to look after people in their own homes, according to Anne-Marie Perry, chief executive of Abicare, a home care company contracted to set up the facilities. She said they were for people who are ready to be discharged to their homes but couldn’t be because care packages were not available. “The hospitals are on their knees and we are being contacted fairly regularly by clinical commission groups,” said Perry. “The problem Plymouth have is there is not enough domiciliary care provision so that’s one of the reasons why they can’t discharge patients.” A similar tactic was used at the start of the pandemic in spring 2020, when hotels were used to help discharge tens of thousands of hospital patients in anticipation of hospitals being filled to breaking point with Covid cases. It happened again in some places in January this year. Now, with similar warnings that the NHS faces being overwhelmed by the Omicron variant, Abicare said it has converted whole floors of hotels, and has recruited British nationals living in Greece and Spain, as well as some from the north of England to staff them in a shift pattern of three weeks on and three weeks off. On Monday, NHS Providers said bed occupancy in hospitals was at 94% to 96% and its chief executive, Chris Hopson, said on Sunday that the shortage of social care staff was a big driver of delayed discharges, with more than 10,000 beds last week occupied by medically fit patients. Perry said the cost of care - around £300 per night - was well under half that of an NHS bed, but the move is likely to raise questions about levels of care with hotels not equipped with sluice rooms and other facilities normally available in care homes. Jane Townson, the chief executive of the Homecare Association, described the move as “unacceptable” and said it “feels like [people] being warehoused”. She called for greater funding to boost the workforce that helps people in their own home. Nadra Ahmed, executive chairman of the National Care Association, said she was shocked by the arrangement and said hotels were not configured to deliver care and questioned the safety and wellbeing of residents if they needed urgent medical assistance. “Is home care so broken that we can’t support people in their own homes where they need to be?” she said. “This is another sticking plaster and the person being moved into the hotel is the person being let down.” Abicare said it had been unable to find live-in care workers based in the UK so it was using ex-pats. But has warned that with more health authorities approaching it to set up hotel facilities in the new year, it may not be able to find staff to meet much greater demand. In January NHS England issued guidance about using hotels for discharges which said it “should only be used as a short-term measure (days, rather than weeks) for the specific purpose of reducing length of stay for people in hospital and ensuring they are discharged when they no longer meet the ‘criteria to reside’ in a hospital.” Abicare said it has previously worked with Holiday Inn and Best Western hotel groups. A spokesperson for NHS Devon clinical commissioning group said: “Thirty-two beds are currently available to support people who would be delayed in hospital waiting for support at home. Feedback from patients has been excellent and since March 2020 this has saved several thousand hospital bed days. This has freed beds for people who needed inpatient care in a hospital setting.” NHS England has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Hotels being used as care facilities to relieve pressure on NHS,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/13/hotels-being-used-as-care-facilities-to-relieve-pressure-on-nhs
12/14/2021,"Refugees crossing the Channel to the UK in small boats are calling on the UK coastguard to review its procedures after claiming officials regularly redirect them to French emergency services after they make 999 calls in what they believe to be the UK part of the Channel. Relatives and survivors of the mass tragedy in the Channel where at least 27 people lost their lives on 24 November said that repeated distress calls had been made to both French and UK coastguards and that the UK had told them to contact the French rescue services.  Dan O’Mahoney, the government’s clandestine channel threat commander, told parliament’s human rights committee this month that he could not say with any certainty whether or not those on board had rung for help. The Guardian has received testimony from several refugees who attempted to cross the Channel in small boats in recent weeks and months who have made identical claims. One group of refugees interviewed by the Guardian on 18 October in Calais had tried to cross the Channel several hours beforehand but had almost drowned. They said they had called the UK coastguard, who told them to call the French coastguard. The latter eventually rescued them and brought them back to Calais several hours after their flimsy boat set sail. The occupants of a small boat trying to cross from France to UK on 20 November, four days before the mass drowning, said they had made repeated calls to both French and English coastguards when their boat got into difficulty in what they believe was the UK part of the Channel. “The English told us to phone the French even without asking for our GPS position,” said one survivor of the near drowning. “We called the French, they asked for our GPS position and told us we were in UK waters. Nobody came to rescue us – neither English nor French. Eventually we called the French organisation Utopia56 and told them our location. They called the French emergency services, who came to rescue us and brought us back to Calais.” The refugee said it was his fourth attempt to cross the Channel. During the previous three attempts French police had caught them on the beach and punctured their dinghies with knives. “I was so frightened on the boat. When nobody came to rescue us I thought we were finished. I personally thought we were going to die,” he told the Guardian. “The UK coastguard should not abandon us. They should rescue us when we tell them we believe we are on the UK side of the Channel.” A spokesperson for Utopia56 confirmed that the boat passengers had sent them a series of distress messages on 20 November. He called on both governments to take their responsibilities at sea seriously. One voice message to Utopia56 said: “Sir, we are still waiting. Nobody is coming. We are really scared that nobody is coming. Please try to send someone.” A second voice can be heard saying: “Please, please, please.” A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency denied the claims that occupants of dinghies in distress in the Channel who made 999 calls had been redirected to the French. She said that on 24 November 2021 the coastguard received over 90 alerts from the English Channel area including 999 emergency calls. “Every call was answered, assessed and acted upon. There also isn’t a circumstance under which we would ask a caller to call French authorities instead of us,” the spokesperson added. One of the challenges of rescuing small boats in the world’s busiest shipping lane is a lack of clarity about where the sea border between UK and France lies. This is not indicated on Google Maps and is not mirrored by phone networks – when a phone network switches from French to English mid-Channel it is not necessarily at the sea border. Maria Thomas of Duncan Lewis solicitors has also received similar reports of people who believe they are stranded on the UK side of the Channel being told to contact the French. She said: “These allegations are extremely concerning, and must be fully investigated. The families of those who perished deserve a full and frank account of what happened, and it is obviously critical that there is complete and transparent cooperation between the British and French authorities. “Both sides have clear obligations with respect to search and rescue operations, and the idea that a boat in distress could simply be bounced between operators is shocking.”",News/UK news,UK coastguard ‘telling refugees in British waters to contact the French’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/uk-coastguard-telling-refugees-in-british-waters-to-contact-the-french
12/14/2021,"“Hypocrisy is the grease that keeps society functioning in an agreeable way, by allowing for human fallibility and reconciling the seemingly irreconcilable human needs for order and pleasure.” Those are the words, unmistakable for their wit and moral clarity, of Janet Malcolm, from her most famous book, The Journalist and the Murderer. They’re not words she lived by personally, however. She was uncompromising in her own response to fallibilities large and small, cheerfully sending back wine at restaurants, rejecting all offers to bring contributions to dinner parties, and chiding anyone who read a certain dire translation of Anna Karenina. I remember on more than one occasion giving her a holiday present, and then watching her unwrap it, look it over, and hand it back to me, explaining that she thought I would enjoy it more than she would.  That may not have been the reaction I was hoping for as an eager-to-please nephew. But over time I understood that it was the way she expressed love and generosity, and a telling example of how her art and her domestic life were often animated by the same ambitious impulses. Her theme as a writer, as it emerged over the course of decades of now-canonical works of literary reportage, was the impossibility of objective truth – in psychoanalysis, journalism, biography, and criminal justice. But she was a moralist, not a nihilist – the fact that it was an impossible ideal made it all the more important to pursue. So she pursued it on the page, in her home, and in her relationships. She was direct and candid about everything, including her own life, and that gave her small circle of lucky relatives and friends a bond, even if it sometimes meant returning home with a piece of deficient crockery. She inherited a fundamentally ironic sensibility from her emigre parents (my grandparents), whose Prague social scene drew from the same wellspring of European post-first world war avant-garde transgression that bred the dada and surrealist movements. One Christmas, her present for her sister’s musician husband (my father) was an impenetrable piece of sound art on an old cassette tape recorder. It sounded like (and possibly was) workmen banging on metal for 20 minutes. She was a prolific creator of collages, hundreds of them, featuring scraps of images and words that she saw artistic potential in recontextualising. She kept these scraps in beautiful trays on her desk at home and in an office in Union Square, everything from takeout chopstick wrappers to tables of world temperatures to her psychiatrist father’s old patient notes. At different times her magpie eye also yielded collections of soup cans, lemon juicers, Mona Lisa paraphernalia, laboratory beakers and decaying burdock leaves, the last of which she immortalised in an eccentric and poignant 2008 book of photographs. She collected interesting people as well – professors, psychoanalysts, young aspiring writers whose work caught her attention – inviting them to tea and bringing them together at elegant dinner parties. About that crockery: what exactly was wrong with it? It was never entirely clear, but a visitor to Janet’s homes, in Gramercy Park in New York City, and on top of a hill in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, could see that she curated them as carefully as she crafted her prose, and with the same luminous effect. She captured some of her aesthetic in her first published work in the New Yorker, a 1963 poem entitled Thoughts on Living in a Shaker House: This Shaker house is neat and lowAnd everything is made just so,Its lineaments are straight and clean,The household gods are epicene. In Janet’s airy kitchens, giving way to book-lined living rooms, “just so” meant a sumptuous elaboration of Shaker austerity: clawfoot tables, bentwood chairs, off-white slipcovered sofas, and open shelves lined with yellowware bowls. The art on the walls often had that trademark ironic air of something lifted from a slightly lesser domain: a kitschy hooked rug depicting a pensive deer, a yearbook-style photograph of 1950s businessmen. It all fulfilled an exacting personal vision that, like her writing, had the additional benefit of showing that the human needs for order and pleasure were reconcilable after all. Many of us who enjoyed roast chicken and mint tea at those tables spent the rest of our lives trying to replicate the effect in our own homes. We had as much success as the generations of writers who tried to replicate her prose, inevitably falling short of the paragon but elevated by the effort.

12/14/2021,"If there was one thing there appeared to be universal agreement on before Formula One’s season decider in Abu Dhabi, it was that no one wanted the result of an enthralling championship to be decided in the stewards’ room. Inevitably four hours after the flag fell, wrangling with the stewards continued. It may well yet go on for days or longer. Fans were left with a dissatisfying conclusion that was hard to understand, confusing in its methodology and that has triggered only acrimony and rancour. There were celebrations in Abu Dhabi but outside of the Red Bull garage it was far from a celebratory event. Max Verstappen has been crowned world champion and there is no argument that had he or Lewis Hamilton won it, both would have been worthy winners in what has been an absolutely gripping fight between the two rivals. Yet the manner of the victory was bungled almost to the point of farce by the FIA.  F1’s rules, lengthy, arcane and of such volume they are hoped to cover almost any circumstance, here proved muddled and apparently open to such discretion and interpretation many are feeling they are perhaps entirely needless. When the FIA race director, Michael Masi, displayed such eagerness to have racing begin again with at least one lap to finish under racing conditions, the regulations had to bend into shape to fit that will. In the rejection of the Mercedes protests afterwards by the stewards, this became clear. Perhaps most jarring of all was this very fervour to ensure one final racing lap took place. With five laps remaining the under safety car and the stricken Williams of Nicholas Latifi taking several laps to remove the expectation was that the race would conclude behind the safety car. In any other circumstances, it surely would. Yet this was dismissed in favour of securing a final lap by any means necessary. There were shades of the same apparent cynicism that had prompted F1 to undertake two laps behind the safety car at Spa to ensure that a race had taken place and a victor could be declared. It is hard not to imagine that with the new Netflix generation of F1 fans it was deemed unacceptable to have the championship decided behind the safety car. The instruction that lapped cars could not unlap followed. To which Red Bull complained. Then Masi announced that the five cars between Hamilton and Verstappen could unlap themselves but not the other lapped cars behind them, an unprecedented halfway house interpretation of the rules and to which Mercedes complained. Masi had used discretion to dictate which cars could unlap themselves based on the rationale that they were the cars that would interfere in the racing between the leaders. Yet in order to do so the rules state that: “Once the last lapped car has passed the leader, the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap.” However the end of the following lap would have been too late as the race would have then been over. So this too was overruled and it came in immediately to allow the final lap to begin. In rejecting the Mercedes appeal Masi’s “overriding authority” over the safety car use was cited. Were it not already confusing enough for the average fan this presents some tortuous logical leaps. Masi had decided to overrule the lapped cars rule, and then in turn had to overrule the application of that rule regarding the safety car in order to achieve the end he was committed to making – a final racing lap. Lando Norris dismissed it as being done purely for TV. George Russell was outraged and deemed it absolutely unacceptable. To the Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff’s in-race complaints Masi issued a dismissive rebuttal with an almost hysterical air. “It’s called a motor race, Toto,” he said as this one-lap motor race duly played out. In a season marked by inconsistency of decision-making by the stewards on just what the title protagonists could and couldn’t do on track this was a baffling escalation, apparently placing the expediency of the show, the occasion over normal protocols. The protests may continue and some agreement may be reached but the result will almost certainly not be changed. Verstappen will remain champion and he deserves it. But F1 and its fans also deserved to have had their winner crowned in far more edifying circumstances.",Sport/Sport,FIA indecision brings a confusing end for F1 fans who deserve better | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/13/fia-indecision-brings-a-confusing-end-for-f1-fans-who-deserve-better
12/14/2021,"A police officer jailed for sharing photos from the murder scene where two sisters lay stabbed, tried to impress his friends by using racist language and claiming police covered up an attack on Asian men. The private messages on WhatsApp from the former Metropolitan police constable Deniz Jaffer were discovered after he was arrested last June by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). He and fellow PC Jamie Lewis were ordered to guard the scene where the bodies of where Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman were discovered in north London. Instead, they took photos, some showing the bodies, and shared them in two WhatsApp groups, calling the victims “dead birds”.  Both men were jailed last week for two years and nine months after admitting misconduct in public office. The sisters’ mother said Jaffer and Lewis had dehumanised her daughters for their own amusement by taking and sharing photos of them. Sources confirmed that an investigationof Jaffer’s phone after his arrest found he had used racist language in a message in which he bragged to friends about a cover-up of an attack on Asian men by white men. Investigators believe the cover-up allegation was most likely false and in interview he said he made it up, sources said. In a message on 13 June 2020, days after he took and shared the photos, Jaffer wrote on a WhatsApp chat that five Asian men, whom he referred to using a racially abusive term, had been attacked. In leaked extract of an IOPC report, which was first quoted by the Times, Jaffer wrote: “Three white fellas arrested for ABH [actual bodily harm] but we have had a chat off the record. “We will release them under investigation and close it later saying victim unwilling without contacting the P*****.” That aspect was investigated by the Met. In a statement the force said it had no record of the incident nor any arrests: “The allegations relating to the WhatsApp message from June 13 2020 were investigated by the IOPC and MPS. The IOPC encompassed the derogatory racial references within their investigation of PC Jaffer. “The Met’s directorate of professional standards (DPS) investigated the reference to the alleged incident in the message sent by Jaffer but nothing was found to corroborate the arrests or that the incident had happened.” Jaffer had claimed the group he sent the message to were people he knew and trusted and contained holiday friends. Jaffer, 47, joined the Met in March 2018 and had just over two years service when he took four photos of Henry and Smallman when he was supposed to be guarding them. He resigned on 18 August 2021, and was sacked by a tribunal in November and barred from being a police officer for life. Before joining the Met Jaffer worked as a financial trader for 20 years and had claimed being a police officer was a lifelong dream.",News/UK news,Met PC who shared photos of dead sisters made racist cover-up boast,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/met-pc-who-shared-photos-of-dead-sisters-used-racist-language-in-cover-up-boast-deniz-jaffer
12/14/2021,"Asmall-town man, perhaps wrongfully accused. A confession squeezed out of him by an overzealous police department more concerned with tying a ribbon on their case than anything else. A prison sentence served in defiance, as he maintains his innocence over a course of decades. A reconsideration of the facts, exposing the fault lines in the case against him.  With the true crime genre fast approaching the saturation point, this has all come to sound more than a little familiar. And Jody McVeigh-Schultz, director of the new HBO miniseries The Murders at Starved Rock, has seen it all. He knows that simply rehashing the plot beats of Making a Murderer won’t cut it anymore, but he also knows that this savviness can instead be used as a jumping-off point. His new three-episode, two-night event posits the concept of a true crime miniseries for an age it already dominates, in which the parties involved have the amateur-sleuth instincts bred by years of poring over real-life mysteries. The people of La Salle county, Illinois, have spent their lives putting themselves in the shoes of those investigating their homespun tragedy, and now it’s our turn to do the same to them. “We were definitely aware of the [true crime boom],” McVeigh-Schultz tells the Guardian via Zoom. “In true crime right now, you almost have to acknowledge within your own story what’s happening in the genre, with this glut. We had a story that was full of people who were obsessed with this true crime case themselves, and so we were showing how this town and the mythology built by all these DIY detectives could affect the story. One of the interesting things that struck me was how the truth evolves over sixty years. People’s memories evolve, and you end up with mythology and truth competing. The subtext of the piece is that we’re trying to get at who determines what the communal truth is. There are a bunch of different people in this story trying to do just that, to be the arbiters of the truth.” The subject of all this consternation is the fate of one Chester Weger, fingered for the 1960 slayings of three middle-aged women in the Starved Rock State Park. Despite somewhat wobbly evidence against him, law enforcement convinced the stunned Weger that it would be in his best interest to plead guilty as his one shot of avoiding the death penalty. Weger acquiesced, only to recant his statement days later in hopes of pursuing his case, at which time he was too late. The verdict was promptly delivered, but the lingering question of what really happened that night continued to perplex and fascinate this pocket of small-town America. The populace was divided between opposing factions equally convinced of their own rightness, with some insisting that justice had been served while others sift through the details in search of a deeper revelation. “So many people in town had a story that they said could prove innocence or guilt, and you have to follow every thread to prove or disprove them, one by one,” McVeigh-Schultz says. One such armchair inspector is David Raccuglia, who has a closer link to these events than most. As the son of prosecutor Anthony Raccuglia, the man who put Weger away for life, David spent his entire life in the shadow of this controversy. He set out to make a documentary about his perspective years ago, and the footage he never ended up using now forms the basis of the miniseries completing his work. McVeigh-Schultz’s crew rejoins Raccuglia and allows him to take the wheel, following as he examines the timeline and pushes for advances in DNA sampling to sway the parole board at Weger’s prison. “One of the things we realized in the making of this, where a lot of the big decisions are made in the edit room, was that we wanted to tell the story of David’s journey,” McVeigh-Schultz explains. “It starts in his childhood, when he sees Chester Weger as the boogeyman. But throughout the early 2000s when he was making his film, which ended up unfinished until we picked it back up, we go through his process of meeting everyone from the prosecution side and seeing the complete opposite side that he’s never heard before. Then we jump ahead to the point at which we joined the process, and cover the modern court case that took shape … His father really was his hero, and then he spent some time questioning that, probing the holes in this case, and that’s a fraught thing.” Even-keeled and cautiously inquisitive, Raccuglia gains a foil in one of the more reckless self-fashioned gumshoes, an eccentric character named David Marsh. As the head of the Committee to Free Chester Weger, he’s taken it upon himself to do the vital job of ferreting out what really took place on that fateful night, but his methods lack the ethical rigor required to get results. Prone to leaving lengthy voicemails chockablock with verbal harassment in the middle of the night, dismissed by many as a particularly driven kook, he illustrates the hazard of citizen police work. For the purposes of this miniseries, however, he could also be a valuable source of information. It was McVeigh-Schultz’s task to find the nugget of solid intel wedged in Marsh’s flawed process. “I’d heard he’s dangerous. I’d heard, uh, other things, about what time of the day is best to talk with him,” he says. “But he was a genuinely nice person, interesting to talk to, incredibly intelligent. As you learned his version of the story, it took an hour or two, but you start to realize, ‘Oh, not only do you believe in these things that are quite rational, you connect conspiracies to this larger worldview without skepticism whenever you get the chance.’ The town is really divided on this; they’re having restraining orders, things like that. But you also have to not discount everything a person has to say in an interview, just because some of their ideas are off-base.” McVeigh-Schultz and Raccuglia both strive to exercise more circumspection and care in their judgments. Though the director concedes that “it’s very hard not to make conclusions,” he also knows full well that there are rules he must adhere to, and for good reason. The hasty overeagerness to reach a solution was what got Weger locked up in the first place; that quality would have no place in a legitimate effort to reverse that decision. Though viewers at home might binge the latest true crime fad in the same way that they watch Wheel of Fortune, yelling instruction at the contestants onscreen, the stakes could not be farther from one another. This is a man’s life we’re talking about, not a game, and it deserves to be treated accordingly. The welfare of the accused must always take precedence over the impulse to prove one’s cleverness and get to the answer first. “The one thing that I was thinking as I approached this was, I should be mindful that the amount of things I don’t know is much larger than the amount of things I think I know,” McVeigh-Schultz says. “There’s a sense, and maybe people are subverting this, that the people who become obsessed with a case and take on the home-detective position can come in and provide some clarity or fresh eyes. A lot of people are taken by that idea, of ‘wait, maybe I can solve this!’ David sort of became aware that whenever you’re dealing with true crime, there’s almost a hero complex in this desire to be the first one who breaks it. That can be extremely problematic.” The Murders at Starved Rock starts on HBO on 14 December with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,The Murders at Starved Rock: will we ever know who killed three women in 1960?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/13/the-murders-at-starved-rock-documentary
12/14/2021,"Amazon is to start selling low-cost Covid PCR test kits to travellers in a move that promises to shake up a market that has been described as a “rip-off jungle” for consumers. The government-approved tests, which will be valid for the UK’s day-two, day-eight and “test-to-release” arrivals programmes, cost £34.99 each but will also be offered in discounted bundles. The retailer’s international arrivals service could be launched and listed on the government’s approved list of suppliers as soon as today.  The tests will be processed at Amazon’s lab in Salford, which the retailer set up last year to process tests for employees. It also set up a lab in the US, where it started selling home testing kits in the summer to US shoppers via its website. Earlier this month Amazon started selling testing kits in the UK too, although they were not suitable for travellers. However it meant the company’s name was added to the official list of Covid test providers. Amazon’s entry into the market for travel PCR tests follows complaints from some people travelling to the UK that tests provided by some of the small companies that have sprung up to serve the market arrive late or sometimes not at all. The government has been accused of failing to get a grip on the test market which is once again of vital importance to people in the UK who are hoping to travel abroad this Christmas. It has reintroduced mandatory PCR tests to track the progress and limit the spread of the Omicron variant. The Guardian recently revealed a slew of PCR testing deals had been removed from the site amid fears consumers were being misled by companies advertising tests for less than a £1. It is understood officials acted on complaints from within the industry that certain providers were manipulating the rankings by advertising ultra cheap deals that were in reality hard to access. Last week Lord Tyrie, the former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), called the marketplace a “rip-off jungle”. He said misleading online advertisements, overpricing and unacceptably poor service, had not been eradicated despite having come to light months ago. The CMA says it has written to 25 PCR providers, warning them to get their house in order or risk enforcement action. It has also begun formal investigations into two companies: Expert Medicals and Dante Labs. In the autumn, the watchdog made a series of recommendations to the Department of Health and Social Care, which manages the list of test providers. These included “significantly” improving the basic standards needed for inclusion on the list and a “comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme”. However, little appears to have changed. Rory Boland, the travel editor at consumer group Which?, said travellers were being “badly let down” in a dysfunctional market where they were exposed to extortionate prices and unreliable providers. “We are yet to see the government take any meaningful action following the CMA’s audit of the private testing system,” he said. Francis Ingham, the independent director of the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation (LTIO), a trade association where members have signed up to a code of conduct based on the CMA’s recommendations, said customer choice was a “good thing”. “We welcome Amazon’s new offering. Reliability and transparency are vital, so we hope that the company will meet the standards set by LTIO members.”",News/Business,Amazon to sell low-cost PCR Covid tests for UK travellers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/amazon-to-sell-low-cost-pcr-covid-tests-for-uk-travellers
12/14/2021,"After a long year for many of us, Christmas is at last in sight – along with the chance to catch up with loved ones. Unfortunately, the holidays also mean an increased risk of spreading Covid-19. Over the next few weeks, more of us could well be mixing socially as well as travelling to visit friends and family. Despite Plan B advising everyone who can work from home to do so, that face masks must be worn in some public indoor venues, and the NHS Covid pass becoming mandatory for entry into venues where large crowds gather; the arrival of the Omicron variant means it’s still likely that cases will rise over the coming weeks. So as we attend more events, such as Christmas parties or religious services, it’s important everyone takes action to limit the spread of transmission by adopting Covid-safe behaviours.  And while many of us are already familiar with well-known Covid-19 symptoms, such as a new and continuous cough, fever, changes to our sense of smell or taste, or general fatigue, symptoms of the new variant, experts say, may not necessarily manifest in the same way. We may not even realise we’re contagious as many people show no symptoms at all. This means it’s never been more important to play our part and remain vigilant against the spread of Covid-19 as best we can, to help keep ourselves – and each other – safe this Christmas. It’s vital we don’t become complacent as we get into the swing of festivities, or thanks to the arrival of vaccine boosters, says government chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. “While vaccines are offering us good protection, Covid-19 is still with us,” he says. “Stay safe over the festive period by taking simple but effective steps like wearing a face covering in crowded indoor spaces, testing regularly, ventilating rooms where possible and getting a booster or vaccine when offered. By doing this, we can reduce the spread of the virus and keep ourselves and others safer.” Take up vaccine boostersExperts agree that the vaccine is our best defence against Covid-19, reducing our chances of catching and spreading the virus, and of becoming seriously ill if infected. The vaccines are safe, effective and the best thing we can do to protect ourselves and loved ones this winter (especially pregnant women, who have a higher risk of complications if they contract Covid-19 and aren’t vaccinated). So far, vaccine take-up has been successful in the UK, with millions of us set to receive our boosters in the coming weeks (currently more than 46 million people in the UK have had their second vaccination, with more than 21 million having received their booster or third dose). In light of the new Omicron variant, the booster programme has been expanded to offer all adults aged 18 and over a top-up jab by the end of December. It’s important not to forget about other jabs and boosters – such as the flu vaccine, which could prove more valuable than ever. Because of the distancing measures put in place last winter, there were fewer cases of flu, which, experts say, could result in a rise in strains this year, as well as less immunity. “Both flu and Covid-19 cost lives, and the increased threat from these two deadly viruses this winter makes it even more important that anyone eligible comes forward for a flu vaccine as soon as possible and books in their Covid-19 booster when they’re invited,” says NHS deputy vaccination programme lead Dr Nikki Kanani. “The vaccines are safe, effective, and the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones.” Wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed areasResearch shows that close contact with people increases our chances of catching Covid-19, and we have a much higher risk of catching or passing it on in crowded or enclosed spaces. Covid-19 tends to spread through the tiny droplets and aerosols released when an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes – those particles containing the virus can infect anyone who comes into contact with them. Face coverings are a good way to reduce transmission, so by wearing one in busy public settings and when meeting members from other households, you can help limit transmission. Remember, it won’t always be obvious if the person next to you is infected. Face coverings must currently be worn in shops, some indoor venues and on public transport unless you’re exempt for medical reasons, or a child under 11. The same goes for transport hubs, such as railway stations and airports. Likewise, when legally required, business owners, including transport operators, should ask employees and customers to wear masks. To protect yourself and the people close to you effectively, it’s worth checking that face masks always cover the nose and mouth completely, and are made from at least two layers of material. Ventilation mattersIn May last year, the virus causing Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2, was officially recognised as “airborne”, meaning it is highly transmissible through the air. It is thought that all variants of the virus are transmitted this way and that transmission mainly happens indoors, where people are close together. That’s why it’s always worth keeping areas as well-ventilated as possible. This might mean keeping windows ajar or briefly opening up doors to create a good flow of air to help disperse the virus (during cold spells, opening doors or windows for just 10 or 15 minutes is helpful). It’s not just at home we should be ensuring that windows and doors are opened – workplaces have to be well-ventilated too to protect employees and customers. People also need to remember to check in using the NHS Covid-19 app when appropriate, so that swift action can be taken to help limit the spread of the virus if an outbreak occurs. Of course, the best places to meet in terms of ventilation are still outdoor spaces, where there is plenty of fresh air compared with crowded or enclosed areas, so thinking ahead is a smart idea. Could you suggest a walk or coffee outside, instead of meeting inside with a friend or loved one? Don’t forget to test regularlyEnsuring we test ourselves – and encouraging loved ones to test – not only helps stop the spread of the virus, but gives much-needed peace of mind, too. It’s especially important ahead of periods of “higher risk” (say, if you’re socialising indoors with many people, for example, or visiting those who are at a higher risk of severe illness if infected). “Lateral flow devices are effective at finding people with high viral loads who are most infectious and most likely to transmit the virus to others,” says Dr Susan Hopkins, of Public Health England. “It’s a very good test.” You can get up to two packs of seven rapid lateral flow tests from a local pharmacy. If you give the pharmacy a “collect code” when you pick up the tests, it helps the NHS match your details to the tests. Many schools and workplaces also offer free rapid lateral flow tests, and you can also visit nhs.uk/get-tested to order yours Aim to get in the habit of taking rapid lateral flow tests before going to a crowded event, meeting friends and family, or visiting people with a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if infected. If the test is positive, ensure you self-isolate and take a PCR test, say experts. Don’t forget to test children before and on return to school after the holidays, too. Anyone 12 or over must show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test before travelling to the UK from abroad. The test must be taken two days before travel to the UK. People arriving in the UK also have to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test on day two after their arrival (and a passenger locator form has to be completed). Remaining vigilant for symptoms is more important than ever, so if you notice any, self-isolate and arrange a PCR test as soon as possible. Likewise, if you have come into contact with anybody who may have been infected, self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of your vaccination status. Be sure to report test results (negative or positive) at gov.uk/report-covid19-result or by calling 119 – it helps the NHS monitor the spread of the virus, and ultimately saves lives. Plan B: key dates and measures Friday 10 December: face coverings compulsory in some public indoor venues, such as cinemas, theatres and places of worship in England. Monday 13 December: in England, those who can will be advised to work from home. Anyone who cannot work from home should continue to travel to their workplace. The governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had already advised people to work from home if possible. Wednesday 15 December: the NHS Covid pass on the NHS Covid-19 app will become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather – including unseated indoor events with 500 or more attendees, unseated outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees and any event with 10,000 or more attendees. People will be able to demonstrate proof of two vaccine doses via the app. Proof of a negative lateral flow test will also be accepted. This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

12/14/2021,"To think of Tiger King is to immediately transport yourself to the heady days of lockdown 2020. Remember it? Remember how filled with artificial purpose we all were? We did Zoom quizzes with all our friends! We made banana bread! We clapped for frontline workers!  Looking back, it seems relatively clear that all those things were stupid. Nobody wants to spend more time on Zoom than they have to. Nobody likes banana bread. The clapping didn’t change anything. And as for Tiger King? With the benefit of hindsight, Christ, we chose the wrong show to obsess over. Looking back, Tiger King was grubby and exploitative. Once you’d crossed the “Are these people for real?” hurdle, you found yourself sitting through a carnival of monstrous behaviour. Tiger King was the documentary equivalent of that old Black Mirror episode: as fun as it sounds to watch someone have sex with a pig, at the end of the day you actually have to watch someone have sex with a pig. Unfortunately, Netflix didn’t get this particular memo. The algorithm said that Tiger King was a hit so, guess what, now we’ve got loads more Tiger King to wade through. Last month’s Tiger King 2 tried to keep the party going, but it was clearly running on fumes. The story was over, participants had backed out and the whole thing was pasted together from scraps. It was less a documentary and more a hopelessly padded out DVD extra. As such, the buzz that accompanied the first season was noticeably duller the second time around. Sensible heads would have ended things there. But Netflix, in all its infinite wisdom, has already churned out yet another Tiger King series. This one, Tiger King: The Doc Antle Story, takes the form of a true crime documentary, aimed at a peripheral character from season one. You will probably remember Doc Antle. We met him in the second episode of the first Tiger King, running an animal sanctuary that Joe Exotic desperately wanted to emulate. Antle wasn’t as big a character as Exotic – who is? – but there was something creepy and cultish about his time onscreen. Why were all his staff young women? Was he married to all of them? Did he keep them in stables? Was there a bigger story going on? Inevitably, yes. Netflix has asked reviewers not to reveal too many specifics about The Doc Antle Story, but the short explanation is that Antle is not a great guy. Over the course of three episodes, we’re fed a slow drip of all his abuses. And there are many to get through: coercion, child abuse, underage marriage, near-starvation, animal cruelty, foggy accusations of murder. One by one, victims and acquaintances from every stage of Antle’s life reveal a pattern of behaviour that is harrowing and ugly. The Doc Antle Story, then, is not Tiger King. It’s about a predator who takes what he wants without care or thought. There is none of the dayglo sideshow fizz of Tiger King here. Joe Exotic, for all his obvious flaws, had an element of joy to him. This is the flipside. This is relentlessly dour. However, the production team doesn’t seem to realise that. For some reason the Tiger King DNA is more important to them than the actual story, so they spend much of it gunning for kook. It’s still a cavalcade of bad taste and unfortunate hair. The incidental music is lighthearted. At one point we are treated to a clip of a man juggling chainsaws. It feels to me as though the producers set out to make an extension of Tiger King and then, when they realised that they’d actually created a document of systematic abuse, panicked. Tiger King itself could get away with being cartoonish, because Joe Exotic was jailed for attempted murder. There’s something darkly funny about that, because failure is baked into the charge. Had Exotic actually killed Carole Baskin, Tiger King would not have worked. But Antle’s alleged abuse is unspeakably grim. It can’t be jollied up. The sadness overwhelms everything, and the producers’ various attempts to lighten the mood backfire hideously. Tiger King has always been grotty and exploitative. But this series, full of distraught victims whose lives have been ruined by the actions of one man, pushes the envelope too far. By throwing out three series in the space of a year and a bit, you get the feeling that Netflix is trying to create a franchise out of Tiger King; an expanded universe of all its gnarled and wrongheaded characters. Judging by The Doc Antle Story, the Tigerverse has already expanded far too much. A sharp contraction is now in order.",Arts/Television & radio,Why it’s time to say goodbye to Tiger King,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/13/tiger-king-netflix-time-to-say-goodbye-doc-antle
12/14/2021,"In 2018, a man in Germany slipped on his way to work. The fall broke one of his vertebrae, and as such his workplace insurance was obliged to pay out for the accident. This wasn’t your average commute, though: the man was walking between his bedroom and his home office when he fell on the spiral staircase between the two rooms. Against the protestations of his company’s insurer, Germany’s federal social court ruled last week that the journey, less than a minute and inside the man’s own home, counted as a workplace accident. Although the accident took place before the pandemic, the verdict comes at just the right moment: it feels like the latest brick removed from the wall that separates the home from the workplace. Last week Boris Johnson announced yet another return to home working in England, where possible. Just as many businesses had finally got their heads around hybrid working, or indeed had mandated a full return for workers, a large proportion of the country has now had to turn around again.  Perhaps you have fallen back into the smothering embrace of your dressing gown; flopped the grubby mouse mat back on the kitchen table; resisted the temptation to work from a fully horizontal position in bed rather than pay for extra daytime heating; gone back to having to stand in front of the bathroom mirror breathing deeply for several minutes at a time and reminding yourself it is not a moral failure that your partner keeps putting her teaspoons in the sink instead of in the dishwasher, and you can absolutely get past this enraging and thoughtless thing and that it doesn’t matter that she uses all seven of them every day, which means you have to wash one individually each time you want to make a hot drink, and that you love her and this is your life that you chose and you like it, you like it, you like it. The very earliest, sort-of-exciting days of working from home seem unimaginably long ago now. “I’m always at home!” quickly became something more like “I’m always at work!” or even, “I’m not really anywhere, I increasingly consider myself a mere flesh vessel for a consciousness that exists on Slack!” And now here we are yet again, back at home working, back at what feels uncomfortably like square one or, more and more, like an interminable game of Whac-A-Mole in which, as soon as we are allowed to poke our heads above ground, we get unceremoniously thumped back inside. After almost two years, nobody has the energy for more discussion about whether working from home is good or bad. Everyone except Tory MPs whose friends own office buildings and power-drunk bosses would now accept that working from home is both good and bad. But what is noticeable, and different, is the feeling in the air that has accompanied the recommendations this time around. Whereas previous WFH mandates, socialising restrictions and even full lockdowns have felt like temporary measures in our effort to work towards something closer to pre-Covid normality, this time, since most people have had the all-important vaccines, the prevailing mood is one of a dull realisation that this may just be how we live now. Covid briefings are back, as are the war and natural disaster metaphors, the scrabbling for tests and booster appointments, the dark talk of a January lockdown. When I hugged my friends goodbye after lunch on Sunday we hugged a little longer, unsure when we may see each other again. And this unease feels like just one stage of a cycle we are dismayingly familiar with, the part where restrictions are creeping back and every day feels slightly worse than the one before. When I asked people I know how they felt about leaving the office and going back to working from home, some of them were glad. They enjoy the short commute, more time with their partners, a later alarm in the morning. And some of them were not glad, annoyed by their lack of a home office, lack of routine, lack of connection-making opportunities with colleagues. The old satisfactions, the old complaints. But almost everyone this time around also expressed resignation to the grinding, repetitive inevitability of it. I once read that when explorers trek over the Ross ice shelf in Antarctica, the vast emptiness of the landscape means the next range of mountains looks so close it seems that the travellers could reach it any moment, whereas in fact they are several hundred miles away. I have often thought about this over the past two years, in the moments when everything seemed ready to get better and then didn’t and the temptation was simply to lie down and die on the tundra rather than face another five months of your housemate’s rancid little experiments in lunch. And then I have tried not to think about it. Trying not to think about it too much is probably the only sanity-preserving way to deal with the merry-go-round of Covid restrictions at the moment.

12/14/2021,"I had intended to recruit just one female backing singer but when I walked into the Crazy Daisy nightclub in Sheffield, the first thing I saw was Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley dancing. They somehow looked like a unit while being clearly different individuals. I knew they were right.  The band started work on what became the Dare album. Our music was so simple: we’d all laugh when Adrian Wright moved just one finger on the synthesiser and it sounded great. We mainly wrote the songs in a horrible disused vets in Sheffield. Ian Burden, our keyboard player, wrote our first two hits, Love Action and The Sound of the Crowd. Don’t You Want Me started off as a vocal melody from Adrian. Jo Callis, our other synth player, funked it up but it didn’t have a chorus. When we were recording at Genetic studios in Reading, producer Martin Rushent told me to go into another room. “Don’t come out until you’ve got a chorus.” Two hours later I came out with: “Don’t you want me, baby.” The first verse came more or less wholesale from a photo romance magazine I was reading. The first line was: “You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar.” Our former member Martyn Ware’s girlfriend worked in Sheffield’s only cocktail joint, Sinatra’s Style Bar, so maybe cocktail bars were on my mind. I thought pubs and pickled eggs were the work of the devil, but cocktail bars seemed glamorous. I recorded the vocals in the toilet. David Allen, the engineer, flushed the loo behind me. We left that off the record. We’d been doing shows with left-field bands such as Gang of Four and Joy Division, so I thought Don’t You Want Me was too smooth. When it became the Christmas No 1, it felt weirdly hollow. I thought: “How on earth are we ever gonna beat this?” But the song has given us 40 years of global success. I had always assumed that I’d end up carrying my belongings through Sheffield in a carrier bag with people saying: “That guy thought he was good in 1980.” When Philip came over to ask if we’d like to audition, we told him we were doing our A-levels so would have to ask our dads. My dad thought it would be sex, drugs and rock’n’roll, and both sets of parents refused, but we secretly auditioned anyway and then arranged for Philip to come over to meet our parents, but didn’t tell them he was coming until the last minute. He turned up fully made up with red lipstick and high heels, but very businesslike. My dad locked himself in the bedroom and refused to come out. Years later I found out that my grandma told him: “If you don’t go downstairs and give your daughter this chance, she will never forgive you.” And my dad then bundled us over to Joanne’s to persuade her father. Weirdly, Joanne and I had bought tickets to see the Human League in Doncaster, which turned out to be our first show with the band. We were used to posing on the dancefloor, so just added a bit of singing. We went on tour in a white Transit van, so it wasn’t very glamorous, but I remember staring at the cathedral in Cologne and thinking: “I can’t believe I’m here.” Before we knew it, we were in a huge studio recording Don’t You Want Me. I laid down the female vocal part in the middle of the night. The video was a take on The French Lieutenant’s Woman, which was a film about making a film. Duran Duran had shot their Rio video on a yacht in the Indian Ocean – we got a damp evening in Slough. Jo was supposed to be driving a Rover but he couldn’t drive, so he pretended to steer while people behind him were pushing it. When the song went to the top of the charts in Britain and the US, I thought: “This doesn’t happen to schoolgirls from Sheffield.” If we had expected it would be the Christmas No 1, we might have put bells on. When I hear it on the radio today, I still wish I’d sung it better, but I was an ordinary girl doing her best and I think that resonated. I’ve spent 40 years telling people I never worked in a cocktail bar.
