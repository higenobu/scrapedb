5/10/2022,"Plenty of true crime documentaries revel in the cold case, doling out narratively complete stories that can be presented with the comforting buffer of history. Our Father, available on Netflix from Wednesday, is different. It is a shockingly, painfully current film. Our Father tells the story of Jacoba Ballard, a blond haired, blue eyed woman who never felt she completely belonged in her family. After using a 23andMe DNA testing kit in 2014, she began to discover why. Her DNA results showed that she had a handful of half siblings from an unidentified father. As she began to investigate, the sickening truth started to reveal itself. Her biological father – and the biological father of her new siblings – was Donald Cline, her parents’ fertility doctor. Cline, it turned out, had habitually inseminated women with his own sperm without their consent or knowledge. The first gut punch of the docu-drama is that this happened at all. The second is learning just how many times it happened. Throughout the course of Our Father, the number of Ballard’s siblings ticks steadily upwards, and has continued to do so ever since. “We actually had a new sibling pop up the day the trailer dropped,” Ballard says over Zoom from her home in Indiana. Now 41 , she has made it her life’s work to understand the extent of what Cline did to his patients. Every time someone unknowingly gets a DNA test and finds their profile linked to hers, she reaches out and gently explains what has happened. It is evident in Our Father, but talking to her in person underlines the toll this has taken on her. “So many of them don’t even know they were donor-conceived, and some believed they came from their dad’s sperm,” she says of her siblings, sighing deeply. “Every time we get a new match I give them this news, and it’s like I’m ruining their life.” “That’s who Jacoba is,” adds Lucie Jourdan, the film’s director. “She was and is that person. It’s incredible.” Jourdan started pursuing the story in December 2017, after Cline had stood trial in Indiana. “There were only 22 siblings at the time,” she notes drily. Her interest seems like a turning point for Ballard and her siblings. Because, as much as anything else, Our Father is a film about failing to be heard. On discovery of Cline’s actions, Ballard informed the attorney generals on state and national level, along with every press outlet she could think of, only to find herself repeatedly ignored. After months spent banging on a succession of locked doors, the story was picked up by the morning anchor of a local Fox affiliate, and Cline was eventually taken to court. But thanks to a blind spot in Indiana state law, the siblings failed to get the closure they deserved. Despite inseminating countless women with his own sperm, Cline had not violated criminal law at the time and was let off with a $500 (£400) fine – for obstructing justice by denying the allegations (although he did also lose his medical licence). This is when Jourdan stepped in. “After everything that had happened to us, we had so little trust,” Ballard says of meeting Jourdan. “We had been approached by other people, but we needed someone who was not going to spin the story. We wanted it told accurately, we wanted everything in, and we wanted it made with our feelings in mind.” The finished film is an incredible piece of work, growing and unspooling with a palpable sense of dread as the magnitude of Cline’s wrongdoings reveal itself. “It just keeps coming like an avalanche,” says Jourdan. “And I think it echoes the exact feeling that Jacoba and the other siblings felt. It doesn’t stop, it keeps getting more intense, more ridiculous, more absurd. It’s heartbreaking. And it was so important to hear Cline’s voice in the film, saying ‘oh, there’s no more than 10 siblings’, ‘there’s no more than 15’ – just showing his lies.” Which brings us to Cline himself. Jacoba says: “Some people online have said he’s dead. He’s not dead.” Jourdan adds: “He’s active around his community. He’s going to grandchildren’s swim meets and things like that. There’s no hiding. That’s the thing, he’s still out and about. In his head, I don’t think he thinks he’s done much wrong.” Hasn’t he been in contact? “No, he has not,” says Ballard, her voice beginning to tremble. “I actually tried to contact him last year. I have been sick for two years, and I literally begged him for medical information. And nothing. It’s not just me – I have other siblings who are sick as well. We just want to get some medical information, but we can’t even get that.” Cline did call Jacoba when she first figured out he was her biological father, says Jourdan, “and he specifically said: ‘The world does not need to know.’ So to see the world knowing in real time has been absolutely incredible. When we started this, we promised the siblings we would get this out to a huge audience. I just feel grateful this has actually happened.” I was trepidatious before my interview with Ballard because, as much as Our Father was made according to her wishes, the thought of making her relive such an enormous trauma didn’t sit particularly well. But, as she is quick to explain, she can see that in this case sunlight is the best disinfectant. “Making this film was like a healing process,” she says. “But also I’m a mentor for donor-conceived people and those who are, I say, doctor-deceived. Organisations like Right to Know have reached out to me and my siblings. And we’re putting together stuff, resources for the public to help people when this comes out.” The number of Ballard’s siblings remains astonishingly high, and the expectation is that it will grow higher still. The only siblings uncovered so far are those who willingly bought home DNA kits. “We’re at the mercy of finding siblings just by, you know, hoping somebody wants to find out how Italian they are,” Jourdan says. “That’s the only way they’re finding out. What happens is, every holiday, there’ll be an influx of new siblings because everyone gets their Christmas DNA test. They’re excited to take it, and then in February they’re heartbroken.” “In the donor-conceived groups I’m in, it’s referred to as ‘sibling season’,” Ballard adds, of people who were often under the impression that they were conceived naturally. “This is something Cline instructed parents to say,” says Jourdan. “It was a very specific directive that you never ever tell your children you had fertility issues or insemination. This was part of the dialogue he had with his patients. They were trusting their doctor to give them the right advice.” So far, Ballard has uncovered siblings born between 1972 and 1988. But Cline practised medicine until 2009, so the overwhelming likelihood is that this is simply the tip of the iceberg. “The hope of the film is that absolutely everyone gets tested,” says Jourdan. “Before he was a fertility doctor, Cline was a gynaecologist. Anyone who saw him and happened to be pregnant after seeing him for any reason should test. It’s sickening, but I think it’s a call to action.” Both Ballard and Jourdan are bracing themselves for a new wave of siblings once Our Father hits Netflix. “You could watch this and be oblivious to the fact that you’re part of it, then suddenly everyone in the film is your sibling,” says Jourdan. “There’s a high likelihood that’s going to happen.” Such was the anger of watching Cline slip through justice that, in 2019, Indiana became the first US state to make it a felony for fertility doctors to use their own sperm without their patients’ prior knowledge and consent. Ballard and Jourdan hope the shockwave caused by Our Father will be enough to take this nationwide. “Of course, this should not be legal,” says Jourdan, palpably angry about a situation that has revealed 44 other doctors who have used their own sperm to inseminate patients – all of which has come to light since the trailer dropped. “Why is this a fight? The hope is that a federal law will be passed but, my God, it’s frightening. And it’s happening internationally. Why is this a thing? Why was it so rampant and why are we still battling this?” Jourdan also holds out hope that Our Father will reignite the case against Cline. “Maybe there’s some hotshot lawyer out there who watches this and figures out a loophole,” she says. “Oh my God, would I love that. That would be the cherry on top.” Ballard is understandably more resigned. “I don’t think we’re ever going to stop this from happening,” she sighs. “Unfortunately, in our world, some people are just inherently evil. But if we can get new laws, maybe, you know, they’ll think twice. Maybe they’ll know that there are consequences to their actions.”  Our Father is on Netflix from 11 May.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Every time I find a new sibling, it’s like I’m ruining their life’: the fertility doctor who went rogue",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/10/our-father-netflix-every-time-i-find-a-new-sibling-i-feel-im-ruining-their-life
5/10/2022,"Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance faces a fight against insolvency for some of its key companies after Credit Suisse withdrew from a long negotiation over debts. GFG will face an insolvency hearing in private on Tuesday, after more than a year of trying to hold off its creditors and find a source of new funding after the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital. Funds run by Credit Suisse were in turn significant backers to Greensill. Companies in GFG Alliance owe the Swiss investment bank more than $1bn (£810m). The first hearing will decide whether GFG’s problems were primarily caused by Covid-19 and so whether it qualifies for more leeway, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Financial Times first reported on the planned hearings. Citigroup filed winding-up petitions on behalf of Credit Suisse more than a year ago, but it has held off enforcing them while Gupta has tried to find new financing. GFG has repeatedly said it is close to securing new funding, but its prospects have been affected by several criminal investigations. The UK Serious Fraud Office is investigating alleged fraud related to GFG and Greensill, while the French government has alleged in private that it has concerns over money laundering in the metals group’s European operations. Investigators have attended GFG properties in both the UK and France in search of evidence in the past month. Credit Suisse declined to comment. GFG Alliance was approached for comment.",News/Business,Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG faces insolvency fight after Credit Suisse ends debt talks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/sanjeev-gupta-gfg-credit-suisse-debt
5/10/2022,"The Women’s Super League season ended in dramatic fashion. With the title still to be decided with 45 minutes to play, it went right down to the wire. Here we nominate some standout performers this the season. “Sam Kerr is inevitable” – that is the caption that flies around social media most weekends. When the Australian striker is on the pitch for Chelsea, there is little doubt about the outcome. Despite standout seasons from players across the league, including an honourable mention for Arsenal’s Beth Mead, Kerr stands apart from the rest. Twenty goals in 20 games leaves her with the FAWSL Golden Boot. However, it’s not just the sheer number that she scores but the importance of those goals. Whether it’s the header against Tottenham to pull a 10-player Chelsea back into the game or her sublime volley on the spin to complete the final-day comeback against Manchester United, she appeared in the biggest moments to help Emma Hayes’s side to retain the title. When Rehanne Skinner took over the Tottenham role in November 2020, Spurs were stuck in a potential relegation battle. By the end of the season, she had guided them to eighth and clear of any danger. However, no one could have predicted the heights they would reach this season under her calm stewardship. They swapped relegation for a Champions League race, beating Manchester City and earning draws with Arsenal and Manchester United. Skinner is never one to get carried away, she has too much footballing intelligence for that. Despite their form fading over the past few weeks, not helped by a backlog of games, a thin squad and injuries to key players, she led her side to an impressive fifth-place finish. One of the best parts of each season is seeing young players come to the forefront. Whether it was Maya Le Tissier playing every FAWSL minute for Brighton or Emma Harries’ strong run of form for Reading, there have been plenty of glimpses into the future. Once again, however, it is difficult to look past Lauren Hemp as the standout. Still only 21, the England winger has been an integral part of Manchester City’s success in the second half of the year. Her ability to take on defenders is second to none and she’s added even more goals to her game, finishing the season with 10 and six assists. Many will look at Arsenal’s defeat against Birmingham as the key moment of the season, but Chelsea’s injury-time win against Aston Villa was equally important. Carla Ward’s Villa side put in a resilient performance that day at Kingsmeadow that ruffled Chelsea’s feathers. But just as it looked like the title pendulum would swing back in Arsenal’s favour, the inevitable happened. In the 92nd minute, Sam Kerr popped up in the right place to break Villa’s hearts. The celebration said it all – Brandi Chastain-esque as the shirt came off and she raced towards an ecstatic Emma Hayes. New faces have once again added quality across the league. Yui Hasegawa has been a diamond for West Ham; Hannah Blundell and Molly Bartrip have become stalwarts for Manchester United and Tottenham respectively. However, Louise Quinn’s standout performances across the season have caught the eye. When Quinn arrived at Birmingham alongside a new manager and a raft of new faces, the task felt immense. Ultimately relegation came, but in a tumultuous season Quinn added calm leadership to her side and earned the praise of many. Her defensive qualities are clear to see, most notably winning player of the match in defeat to Manchester United. With five goals to her name, she has also shone at the other end of the field, finishing as Birmingham’s top scorer. Picking one goal out of a season is the hardest task, especially with the quality that has been on show this term. Caroline Weir’s wonder goal in the Manchester derby is right at the top, almost an exact replica of her strike in the same game last year. This time, it ensured the three points stayed with City, a win that proved vital to them gaining Champions League qualification. Elsewhere, Katie McCabe’s hit against Aston Villa was a hand-over-your-mouth moment, while Sam Kerr’s final-day volley against United is one to have on repeat. The FAWSL this year was topped and tailed by two of the best games of the campaign. Arsenal’s 3-2 win against Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium was a scintillating display of football. Meanwhile, Chelsea’s comeback against an invigorated Manchester United on the final day was one of the most dramatic ends to a football season you will see. Sandwiched in the middle, however, was a Manchester derby filled with suspense befitting the fixture. After Georgia Stanway took an early shower for a high challenge, City took the lead against the odds through Bunny Shaw. United fought back and looked to have made their numerical advantage count as Lucy Staniforth and Alessia Russo scored a quick double. But City refused to be beaten, Ellen White popping up late on as she does so often to ensure the points were shared.",Sport/Football,From Kerr to Skinner: our WSL awards of the 2021-22 season | Sophie Downey,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/10/from-kerr-to-skinner-our-wsl-awards-2021-22-season
5/10/2022,"For Kristin Urquiza, there are two dimensions: before Covid, and with it. It’s as if the arrow of time veered off into an entirely new direction, to a world where nearly one million of our loved ones have vanished and millions more are struggling with the long-term effects of a mysterious illness. “It feels like my father disappeared,” Urquiza said. Her father died on 30 June 2020, at the age of 65, in an Arizona hospital with only an ICU nurse holding his hand. “That shadow, or that loss, is omnipresent.” And compounding the wrenching grief: many Americans, especially political leaders, don’t want to talk or even think about it, she said. They want to push the pandemic as far behind them as possible, even as people continue dying from Covid every day. “It’s a taboo subject,” she said. “There’s a rush to downplay and normalize this experience.” She aches to think that her dad’s death will always be associated with this crisis – one that no one wants to see. The US is edging toward a grim milestone: one million dead from Covid-19. But there has been little recognition of the massive fatalities from the pandemic; no memorial day has been set aside to mourn everything and everyone lost to Covid. Urquiza wants to change that. She is the co-founder of Marked by Covid, a grassroots group with more than 100,000 members who are advocating for a national day of remembrance. The US Congress is now considering legislation to create a Covid Memorial Day. When Urquiza was a girl, she watched as the Aids memorial quilt was spread over the National Mall in Washington DC. “I was very young, but I remember very concretely understanding the magnitude of loss and it being breathtaking to me.” She remembers then-first lady Hillary Clinton looking at the quilt panels – seeing, remembering, honoring the dead. She wishes leaders and Americans would do the same now with Covid. “I feel like nobody recognizes, really, what we’ve been through and what that means,” she said. “That’s part of the reason why we’ve been focused on memorialization as an act – to recognize not only who we’ve lost, but be able to put a line in the sand as to the gravity of this moment, so that hopefully we can apply some lessons learned to the next time we need to address something on a global scale like this.” At first, when the pandemic swept across America, Urquiza’s parents were very cautious. But after Arizona Gov Doug Ducey declared that the virus was no longer a threat, Urquiza’s father, a lifelong Republican, returned to life as normal. He was an outgoing guy, the life of the party. He loved going to birthday parties and karaoke with friends. He soon caught the virus in Arizona’s deadly 2020 wave, and then he was gone. The 19 days between his first symptoms and his last breath “broke me in a way that I didn’t know I could be broken,” Urquiza said. “I felt like I had a front row seat to a war that nobody else saw.” She was overwhelmed, not just by wave after wave of grief but also by fury and incomprehension. “How in the world can this happen in the richest, most developed country? This is not what I was brought up to believe this country was. My dad did not deserve this. The other people going through this don’t deserve this. And nobody is saying anything.” And she was struck by the deep inequities worsened by the pandemic. In her professional life, people were concerned about the pandemic, but it wasn’t walloping them with gale-force winds as it was her childhood community. “We’re all on this sinking ship, but we’ve all learned that not everybody has the same perspective,” Urquiza said. “The deep inequities in our society are in Technicolor for us to either confront or try to push away.” For years, she worked at a non-profit focused on stopping tropical deforestation in order to protect Indigenous rights and slow climate change. “Given my experience working with frontline communities and advocacy and organizing, I really dove into this to be able to help other families have a voice,” she said. People of color are often disproportionately affected by crises, from climate change to health inequality. Even those who survive are pulled into their wake. “Disasters punch down: we have to leave the jobs, professions, responsibilities, to really take on more of that private pain, suffering, loss – to support our communities.” She wants to transform all this grief into something meaningful – something that could even stop future tragedies from striking with such vicious breadth. This is an opportunity to understand what went wrong and correct the path, to find time’s arrow and redirect it back to a reality that makes more sense. But before that can happen, first the country needs to look at its losses and understand them, Urquiza said. To acknowledge: “This was real. It happened. It had profound effects.”",News/World news,‘The loss is omnipresent’: the grieving daughter fighting for a US Covid memorial day,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/kristin-urquiza-marked-by-covid-us-memorial-day
5/10/2022,"Welcome to The Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) rugby union newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Tuesday, just pop your email in below: A few months ago Eddie Jones turned up at an England Under-20 camp to run an eye over the next generation. Every national coach dreams of finding a teenage gem, someone with a little bit of genuine X-factor, so Jones asked the assembled coaches if they reckoned there was anyone potentially good enough to feature at the 2023 Rugby World Cup. If there’s one who might, came the reply, it’s that dark-haired lad over there. If he was under many people’s radar at that stage, he is certainly not a secret any more. Henry Arundell is his name and, after only six league appearances for London Irish, his meteoric rise shows little sign of slowing down. In early February the 19-year-old full-back scored a stunning length-of-the-field try for England U20s against Scotland U20s in Edinburgh which suggested he had something special about him. At the end of last month he also scored two fine tries, one of them a glorious chip and regather, in the Exiles’ Premiership Cup semi-final against Leicester. Often, at this point, young players can rest on their laurels or start to find defences less accommodating. Arundell has simply flicked the turbo switch and accelerated to another level. Another class individual score helped Irish complete an astonishing comeback to draw 42-42 with Wasps this month before he came off the bench in Toulon on Sunday and scored a try which had even seasoned former pros ooh-ing and aah-ing in admiration. If you have not already seen it – and it has gone properly viral – it is truly a wonder to behold. With his side trailing on a damp early afternoon at the Stade Mayol, there was barely even time for Arundell to consider his options after Nick Phipps had shovelled a hasty pass in his direction close to his own line. If there was plenty to admire in his instinctive decision to have a go and surge past the initial cover into open field, the best was yet to come. Twice a pair of Toulon defenders reckoned they had him covered; twice he expertly wrongfooted them on the outside before diving into the right corner to score a try worthy of winning any game. As it was, the conversion flew wide and Irish lost by a point, but there was no disputing the unexpected star of the show. From a military family, educated at Harrow School and attached to London Irish’s academy since his early teens, the million dollar question is what happens next. Arundell is understood to be eligible to play international rugby for England, Scotland, Wales and Cyprus and, even prior to the weekend, senior officials at Twickenham were under instructions to “get Arundell” before anyone else nips in and caps him. There must, therefore, be a strong chance of the young man touring Australia with England this summer, if only to dissuade Scotland from picking him to go to South America as part of their senior squad. The Scots are looking for a long-term successor to Stuart Hogg and Gregor Townsend has been quick to pounce on dual-qualified Premiership-based players who might have to wait longer for a chance to shine south of the border. An amazing 114-yard try from England U20s player @henry_arundell at the weekend in the @ChallengeCup_ 😮pic.twitter.com/FpLvFVkc5m But as the Rugby Football Union’s rugby director, Conor O’Shea, made clear immediately after the Six Nations, England are currently well aware of the need to sharpen their attacking edge and give defences something other than a strong pack and a decent kicking game to think about. “I think what Eddie will be looking through now is how you stretch defences,” said O’Shea. “Getting a bit more gas into the team is something we are very conscious to do. We need to score more tries, we know that.” “Gas” is certainly something Arundell can provide and, with London Irish now out of Europe and unable to make the Premiership top four, there is an obvious chance for Jones to invite him to a scheduled England mini-camp in London between 22-24 May. “There is definitely interest [from England] but Henry is the first to know there are parts of his game he needs to work on,” said Declan Kidney, London Irish’s director of rugby earlier this month. “What you don’t want him to do is get one or two caps … isn’t it better if he gets in there as the full package? I am sure the powers that be will do the right thing around the lad because he has got talent.” Sometimes, though, talent writes its own go-faster scripts. Modern rugby, as underlined by the athleticism of Teddy Thomas and Finn Russell’s quick thinking for Racing 92 against Sale in Paris on Sunday, is entering an era when taking a chance is increasingly encouraged. There will be days when Arundell does not score length-of-the-field wonder-tries and looks like a youngster with much still to learn. But every sport craves athletes capable of illuminating a stadium in an instant and rugby union, no question, has unearthed a twinkling new star.",Sport/Sport,The Breakdown | Rugby’s newest star Henry Arundell has the X-factor that all teams crave,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/rugby-union-newest-star-henry-arundell-has-x-factor-all-teams-crave-the-breakdown

5/10/2022,"Doctors have stressed the importance of Covid vaccinations for pregnant women after a major review found the shots were not only safe, but reduced the risk of stillbirth by 15%. Researchers at St George’s, University of London, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists analysed 23 published studies and trials that enrolled 117,552 pregnant women vaccinated against Covid, to assess the safety of the shots. The vast majority of the women received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines which provided 89.5% protection against Covid infection seven days after the second dose. There was no evidence of greater risk from miscarriage, preterm birth or other pregnancy complications. “We wanted to see if vaccination was safe or not for pregnant women,” said Asma Khalil, professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at St George’s hospital in London. “It is safe, but what’s surprising, and it’s a positive finding, is that there was a reduction in stillbirths.” “So far, most of the data on vaccines in pregnancy have been about protecting the pregnant woman herself from Covid. Now we have evidence that the vaccines protect the baby too,” she added. The results are published in Nature Communications. Almost all pregnant women admitted to UK hospitals for Covid treatment are unvaccinated. And while vaccine uptake among pregnant women rose from 23% in August to 54% at the end of last year, doctors believe thousands are still unvaccinated. In December, the government’s vaccine watchdog, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, made pregnant women a priority group for jabs after studies found women were more likely to become seriously ill if they caught Covid while pregnant. The infection is also linked to a greater risk of stillbirth and preterm birth. The vaccines appear to reduce the risk of stillbirth by protecting against severe disease, but the study found only hints that the vaccine reduced preterm births, too. “The best way to protect pregnant women and their babies is to get the Covid vaccine,” Khalil said. “Even if a pregnant woman thinks they will be fine if they get Covid, that it will be mild for them, there’s a potential advantage for the baby.” Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the paper provided further reassurance that Covid vaccination was safe in pregnancy. “We know women have been hesitant about having the vaccine due to concerns over the effect on their baby.

5/10/2022,"Whenever Katerina Pavlakis had friends over for dinner, it was not just the food that her guests would comment on. It was also the fact that she seemed so unflustered – “that I was cooking up all these things, and I wasn’t even stressed,” she says. Only then did Pavlakis realise that not everyone shared her experience in the kitchen – that, in fact, even people who enjoyed cooking and were good at it could find it a source of frustration. That made Pavlakis curious: what made cooking so effortless for her, and so frustrating for others? After talking to friends and customers in the shop she runs with her husband in north Wales, she worked out where many were going wrong: they were trying – and struggling – to follow recipes. There, she could relate. “I do love recipe books, and I have loads of them,” says Pavlakis. “But I cannot follow a recipe for the life of me.” Pavlakis’ approach has always been to improvise: adding a pinch of this or a dash of that, sometimes only figuring out what meal she is making once it is already under way. But as random as it may seem, “there is a method”, she says. In the online courses she runs as the Intuitive Cook, Pavlakis teaches people how to gain confidence and skills in the kitchen by throwing out rules, recipes and even ingredients lists. It may seem counterintuitive, especially for beginners. But this more off-the-cuff approach to cooking has recently been gaining traction. The New York Times last year published a cookbook of “no-recipe recipes”, designed for those without the patience or inclination to follow detailed directions. The celebrity chef David Chang, founder of the Momofuku chain, espoused a similar philosophy in his book Cooking at Home, subtitled: “How I learned to stop worrying about recipes (and love my microwave)”. To Pavlakis, it suggests fatigue with the overcomplication of cooking, and the pressure on everyone to produce restaurant-quality meals. Mainstream media portrays cooking as a “kind of aspirational hobby”, she says – leaving people feeling intimidated and overwhelmed by the number of sources on what and how to eat. Recipes that assume that everyone owns a mandoline slicer, or keeps preserved lemons in the fridge, can make people feel that they have failed before they have even got started. More to the point, Pavlakis says, even following a recipe to perfection does not necessarily build confidence or skills. It is a little like the difference between following Google Maps’ directions, and actually knowing your way around. Taking an “intuitive” approach to cooking, informed by what you have to hand and what you like to eat, can help to minimise food waste and turn cooking into a lifelong habit – not a source of stress, or only for special occasions. And, Pavlakis adds, it is not as high-risk as you might think. Here are few tips to get you started, from Pavlakis and other intuitive types. People often cling to recipes out of fear of making something inedible, says Pavlakis – “you really have to try very hard”. She hears more complaints of meals being bland than ruined. The biggest challenge in learning to cook intuitively is getting over that insecurity, she says, “and daring to do what you want”. Try a small tweak in your next meal, then a bigger one. “Nine times out of 10,” she says, “it will probably turn out pretty good.” Pavlakis suggests being led by the contents of your fridge, and reverse-engineering a meal from there. That way you won’t end up with half-used ingredients or odds and ends that will get thrown away. Thinking in terms of “flavour worlds” – herbs, spices and ingredients that we might consider “typically French”, say, or “typically Thai” – can steer you towards a particular dish or complementary pairing. Add oregano to tomatoes and you’re likely Italy-bound; turmeric or cumin might suggest an Indian curry. “It really does give you a completely different experience,” says Pavlakis. Even leftovers can often be repurposed into something entirely new. Many recipes follow a similar process, Pavlakis says. “If you step back and start looking for the patterns, you can see which step fits where – then it becomes easier to change them, swap them or leave them out.” She tends to follow a three-step method of base (onion, garlic, other “aromatic” vegetables and spices, cooked in some kind of fat), body (fresh produce and protein, often liquid) and top (herbs and flavourings). With tweaks to cooking time, temperature and amounts, this can lead to a hot pot or saute, stew or soup, sauce or stir-fry. Even a traybake combines the base and body step. Likewise, in building flavour, you could think in terms of background, foreground and accents, with each layer complementing or contrasting the one before it. “If you’ve got those basic blocks, that’s when you can start playing,” Pavlakis says. Many of us have become detached from our sensory experience of food. Pavlakis suggests a straightforward experiment: split a jar of passata or tin of tomatoes between ramekins, then add to each in turn a little salt, a lot of salt, olive oil, sugar, chilli flakes, balsamic vinegar, spices or herbs. (Keep one plain, as the “control”.) Mix, taste and assess your response – you may be surprised by the difference even small amounts make. “It’s so effective because we don’t usually pay that much attention,” says Pavlakis. Chris Mandle, who writes the no-recipe Scraps newsletter on Substack, suggests swapping shallots for onions if that’s all you have, or green olives for black if you like one but not the other. “What’s the worst-case scenario? Chuck it in and try.” Some swaps might not be neat – kale can be too thick and fibrous to stand in for spinach, for example – but there is often more room for flexibility than you might think, says Mandle. “If you don’t have dark chocolate for your chilli con carne, Worcestershire sauce will work, or cocoa powder, or even the last dreg of coffee from your mug.” It might not taste exactly as the recipe developer intended – but that doesn’t mean bad. “Chances are, when you cook a recipe twice with the exact same ingredients, it’ll taste a bit different anyway,” says Mandle. Baking is often spoken of as more technical than cooking, a science compared with an art. But even so, there is often room for adapting for taste. “A creme fraiche lemon cake can very easily become a ricotta grapefruit cake, or a buckwheat maple syrup biscuit could be made wholemeal and honey,” says the pastry chef Nicola Lamb, author of the recipe development newsletter Kitchen Projects. Likewise, sugar can often be reduced (by up to 25%), and yoghurt or creme fraiche added without consequence – “as long as the cake mix still looks like cake mix”. Much of baking is working with ratios, as with the Victoria sponge – “the classic non-recipe recipe,” says Lamb. “Equal parts everything – flour, butter, sugar, eggs – gives you a pretty perfect sponge, with a bit of technique.” But, Lamb adds, precision is important: “I would never dream of baking without a scale.” Both Pavlakis and Mandle swear by Samin Nosrat’s book (and Netflix show) Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. Mandle says it showed him how to work with those elements – “and not let them boss you around”. For example, in need of salt, he used up half a tin of sardines by flaking them into a pasta sauce in place of anchovies. “It was so good! Once you know why you’re adding acid into a dish – like salad dressing, or a cabbage slaw – it’s much easier to swap out the champagne vinegar you don’t own for freshly juiced lemons instead.” The addition of acid, sweetness or fat can also help with rebalancing a dish that seems in danger of going south. If the taste of onion or garlic is too biting, maybe it needs to sweat further in the pan. Or if a stew or dal tastes flat, try bringing it into focus with chilli, salt or a squeeze of lemon or lime. Be intentional in tasting before and after, says Pavlakis. “If you can’t detect any difference, be bolder.” If an addition does backfire, think of it as a chance to learn about your particular tastes – not those of a recipe developer, who is often required to play it safe. Nosrat says “cooking is all about using your senses” – especially common sense. “If you feel that some combination of ingredients would be disgusting, then it probably is,” says Pavlakis. “Your intuition is telling you something there – the same way as when you leaf through a cookbook, one recipe catches your attention, while five others don’t.” Be curious about what sounds delicious to you, and how you might repurpose those elements – then try it out. You can only hone your intuition through trial and error, says Pavlakis – not by reading about cooking, or watching other people. But the benefits may be felt beyond the kitchen. “There’s a lot of talk about getting out of your comfort zone, trying something new, learning to take risks – this is an extremely safe way to practise that as a life skill.” Sign up to the Intuitive Cook’s courses at theintuitivecook.co.uk, Chris Mandle’s Scraps newsletter at scrapsfood.substack.com and Nicola Lamb’s Kitchen Projects at kitchenprojects.substack.com",Lifestyle/Food,Who needs recipes?

5/10/2022,"Russian hackers are seeking to target western countries supporting Ukraine in its efforts to resist Moscow’s invasion, the head of GCHQ has said. Jeremy Fleming, the director of the British spy agency, said in a speech on Tuesday morning that while fears of a fully fledged online war between Russia and Ukraine had perhaps failed to materialise, there remained “plenty” of cyber activity as part of the conflict. As well as affecting Ukraine directly, there had been “some spillover of activity affecting other countries”, Fleming said, and evidence that Russian actors were trying to escalate the conflict further afield. “We’ve seen indications that Russia’s cyber operatives continue to look for targets in countries that oppose their actions,” the GCHQ chief said. “That’s why we have increased our efforts to ensure UK businesses and government urgently improve levels of cyber resilience.” Fleming did not provide extra evidence, but last month, Britain’s National Cyber Security Agency, an arm of GCHQ, joined forces with its US counterpart, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in producing an advisory notice warning against a potential Russian escalation. At the time they warned there was a risk some Russian criminal hackers “have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government” and that they could be willing to engage “in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people”. Russia has been accused of staging more than 200 cyber-attacks on Ukraine since launching its invasion on 24 February, according to an analysis from Microsoft, targeting government agencies and media companies with hacking attempts or destructive malware designed to disable systems. Fleming said the UK, in conjunction with the US and other allies, was engaged in continuing “to support Ukraine in shoring up their cyber defences” – a recognition that the country is the frontline of what could yet spread into an international cyber conflict. Last month, Ukraine said Russian hackers had tried to take out the country’s power grid, and came close to cutting off power for about 2 million people using a variant of the Industroyer malware. Although these attacks were aimed at Ukraine, there remains the risk that such malware could spread uncontrolled. In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by operatives from the GRU, or main intelligence directorate of the Russian army. Fleming also used his speech to highlight that the National Cyber Force (NCF), a new offensive hacker group, run jointly by GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence, was involved in tackling cybercrime. “Through the NCF we are actively undermining the cybercriminals’ assumption that they can act with impunity on the internet. We have disrupted criminals, making it clear that they are being observed, and going after their ability to profit from illegal activities,” he said. The NCF activities have included actions to prevent cybercriminals “from profiting from their crimes” – though it was not spelled out how – and “denying them access to their cyber tools and malware” which are used to carry out attacks. Later this month, Fleming added, Suella Braverman, the attorney general, would set out further details on how far the NCF can go in its efforts to maintain national security. She would “set out the government’s latest legal views on the responsible use of cyber capabilities”, he said.",News/Technology,"Russian hackers targeting opponents of Ukraine invasion, warns GCHQ chief",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/russian-hackers-targeting-opponents-of-ukraine-invasion-warns-gchq-chief

5/10/2022,"The chairman of Tesco has said there is an “overwhelming case” for a windfall tax on energy companies to help those suffering the most from the cost of living crisis, as some customers have started rationing the amount of food they buy at the supermarket. John Allan said the country was facing “real food poverty for the first time in a generation,” and that people were finding it even harder to mitigate soaring energy costs. “There’s an overwhelming case for a windfall tax on profits for those energy producers, fed back to those most in need of help with energy prices,” Allan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. In a striking intervention, Allan also criticised the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for raising national insurance at a time when so many households were struggling with squeezed budgets. “If I’d been the chancellor, I wouldn’t have done it,” Allan said. “It’s hitting people on modest incomes disproportionately and it’s absolutely the wrong time to do it. If I were in government, I’d roll that back.” Allan, who is also the chairman of the housebuilder Barratt and a former president of the CBI lobby group, said he had witnessed Tesco customers last week rationing their food purchases. “I was hearing for the first time for many years of customers saying to checkout staff: ‘stop when you get to £40’, or something,” he said. “They don’t want to spend a penny over that, as opposed to having everything checked out.” He said Tesco’s surveys of its customers had shown that inflation was the principal concern for most people, and that Britons who had never used a food bank before were having to resort to one. Sunak has hinted that a windfall tax is a possibility if energy companies do not properly reinvest bumper profits, having previously ruled it out. Boris Johnson has argued against such a tax, saying it would discourage companies making from the investments that would in the long run lead to lower energy prices. Asked whether a windfall tax would deter energy companies from investing in energy infrastructure, including renewable energies, Allan said: “They are expecting it [a tax] and they wouldn’t be much fazed by it. It should be short-term only.”",News/Business,Tesco chairman backs energy windfall tax to fight living costs crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/tesco-chairman-energy-windfall-tax-john-allan
