5/5/2022,"The producers of the animated hit show Bluey have been forced to deny a report that suggested the show could be cancelled after an outcry from devastated fans around the world. “EXCLUSIVE: ‘No, not Bluey!’ Insiders claim iconic Australian cartoon – loved across the world – may ‘end after just three smash hit seasons’ as child behind famous character’s voice gets too old,” the Daily Mail story said. I’m an adult man with no kids and I am absolutely devastated about the news that Bluey is ending. Imagine how kids are feeling. What am I gonna watch with my nephews and nieces now? #Bluey When the story was published on Wednesday night the ABC and production sources told Guardian Australia it was “completely untrue” but the news continued to spread. On the @OfficialBlueyTV story, both the producer and the broadcaster say it is completely untrue. A spokesperson for Ludo, the production company that makes the program, told Guardian Australia: “We absolutely love Bluey and there are no plans to end the show. “We always finish a season before planning the next one and right now we’re halfway through series three and really excited about the future – we can’t wait to share new episodes.” Some of you have spotted some online speculation on the future of #Bluey. We absolutely love the show and there are no plans to end it. The community of fans around the world continue to blow us away and if we ever had an update on Bluey’s future you’d hear it from us first. pic.twitter.com/PmdLjpmjvj The Daily Mail’s story was based on an “insider” who claimed a young actor’s voice has matured, “leaving producers with the choice to either re-cast the role or – more drastically – end the show”. Daily Mail Australia editor Barclay Crawford said he “absolutely” stands by the story which, he said was based on two sources who work on the show. “The statement from the production company came in the hours after publication – when we’d given them an ‘end of the day’ deadline to respond,” Crawford told Guardian Australia. There have been 26,000 Facebook interactions in posts across multiple Daily Mail affiliated pages. Bluey was a trending search on Twitter. When it launched in Australia in 2018, Bluey quickly became the most downloaded show in the history of ABC’s on-demand service and has now racked up more than half a billion views. Bluey is breathing new life into the children’s television production sector, which has struggled since the Coalition scrapped the children’s TV quota. The number of children’s titles produced in Australia dropped from 14 in 2019-20 to seven in 2020-21, and six of those – including Bluey series 3 – were financed by the ABC.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘No, not Bluey’: report hit show could be cancelled ‘completely untrue’, Australian producers say",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/no-not-bluey-report-hit-show-being-cancelled-completely-untrue-australian-producers-say
5/5/2022,"New Zealand-born Sydney-based artist Claus Stangl has taken out one of Australia’s top art honours with his portrait of Academy Award-winning director Taika Waititi. On Thursday, Stangl was announced as the winner of the packing room prize, a sub-category of the Archibald prize, Australia’s leading prize for portraiture. The packing room gong is decided by the staff at the Art Gallery of New South Wales who receive, unpack and hang the portraits for the annual exhibition. “I really couldn’t believe it when he said that I could do it and I could paint him,” Stangl said of Waititi. “He’s a guy who’s completely comfortable in front of the camera, as well as working behind the lens.” Head packer Brett Cuthbertson, who has the casting vote for the packing room prize, said this year would be his last on the judging panel. He will retire after 41 years with the Art Gallery of NSW. “In this world full of war and Covid, [it] is pretty miserable at times. This guy has a vision and a twisted sense of humour that we all need right now,” Cuthbertson said. The packing room prize is worth $1,500 but Stangl also remains in the running for the Archibald prize – the country’s oldest art award – and the people’s choice prize. The Archibald prize, decided by a panel of judges, is worth $100,000. The people’s choice prize, decided by visitors to the exhibition, is worth $5,000. No artist has ever won all three prizes in the same year. Archibald prize entries must have been painted in the past year from at least one live sitting with the artist. The $50,000 Wynne prize will go to the best landscape painting of Australian scenery or figurative sculpture, while the $40,000 Sulman prize will be awarded to the best subject painting, genre painting, or mural project in oil, acrylic, watercolour, or mixed media. This year, more than 1,900 entries were received for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes. The remaining winners will be announced on 13 May.",Arts/Art and design,Taika Waititi portrait wins packing room prize at 2022 Archibalds,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/05/taika-waititi-portrait-wins-packing-room-prize-at-2022-archibalds
5/5/2022,"A three-year-old girl remains in a critical condition after she was found unconscious in a bus parked outside a childcare centre in central Queensland. Police say Nevaeh Austin was left unattended for six hours in hot temperatures outside Le Smileys Early Learning Centre in Gracemere, near Rockhampton, on Wednesday afternoon. Rockhampton reached a maximum temperatures of 29.2 degrees on Wednesday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology website. Paramedics responded at 3pm and took Nevaeh to Rockhampton hospital, before she was airlifted to the Queensland Children’s hospital overnight, where she remains in a stable but critical condition. Capricornia police district detective inspector Darrin Shadlow said Nevaeh was the only child left on the bus and that two staff had been working on the vehicle before the incident. “When they returned to the centre, the driver and one other person who were in the bus at the time had forgotten that she was there,” Shadlow told reporters on Thursday. “In the afternoon, the staff found her on the bus. She was taken into the centre where they were performing CPR and triple [zero] were called.” Shadlow said police would investigate whether staff had breached procedures that were put in place after the death of a child in a minibus in Cairns in 2020. He said Nevaeh’s family was “distraught” and currently in Brisbane awaiting news about her condition. In a statement issued on behalf of the family on Wednesday, police asked media to respect their privacy. Brittany Lauga, Queensland’s assistant minister for education, said Nevaeh was “fighting for her life” and that the incident “simply shouldn’t have happened.” “I know this little girl is very much in the thoughts of all of us … wishing for a full recovery. My thoughts are with this little girl’s family and friends,” she said. “Families need to have peace of mind that when they send their children off to school, kindy or daycare, they will come home safe. “We don’t yet know the full circumstances of what has occurred but, of course, there will be a full inquiry.” The Guardian has contacted Le Smileys Early Learning Centre for comment.",News/Australia news,Police investigate after Nevaeh Austin allegedly ‘forgotten’ on childcare bus for six hours and left in critical condition,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/police-investigate-after-nevaeh-austin-was-allegedly-forgotten-on-childcare-bus-for-six-hours-and-left-in-critical-condition
