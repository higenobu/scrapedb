1/10/2022,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Tennis star Novak Djokovic won a court battle Monday to stay in Australia to contest the Australian Open despite being unvaccinated against COVID-19, but the government threatened to cancel his visa a second time. Federal Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly reinstated Djokovic’s visa, which was canceled after his arrival last week because officials decided he didn’t meet the criteria for an exemption to an entry requirement that all non-citizens be fully vaccinated. The judge also ordered the government to release Djokovic within 30 minutes from a Melbourne quarantine hotel where he has spent the last four nights. Government lawyer Christopher Tran told the judge after the ruling that the minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, Alex Hawke, “will consider whether to exercise a personal power of cancellation.” That would mean Djokovic could again face deportation and could miss the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 17. Speaking with television network Prva in Belgrade, Serbia, the tennis star's brother, Djordje Djokovic, described the judge’s ruling as a “great defeat for Australian authorities.” He also alleged that “the latest information is that they want to arrest him,” in an apparent reference to Australian authorities. He did not immediately provide further details on the claim. “This is definitely politics, all this was politics,” he added. The office of Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews confirmed that Novak Djokovic has not been arrested. Kelly said the threat of a further visa cancellation meant the “stakes have now risen rather than receded.” “If this man is to be summarily removed upon a personal exercise of cancellation power, he cannot return to this country for three years, am I right about that?” Kelly asked lawyers for Home Affairs Minister Andrews, under whose authority Djokovic’s visa was earlier canceled. Tran and colleague Naomi Wootten confirmed that Djokovic would be banned from Australia for three years. The government canceled 34-year-old Djokovic’s visa shortly after he arrived in Melbourne late Wednesday to play in the Australian Open. There was a public backlash at news that Djokovic, who has previously declined to reveal his vaccination status, would compete in Melbourne because Australians who aren’t vaccinated, or are inoculated with vaccines that aren’t recognized by Australian medical authorities, face tough travel and quarantine restrictions. Court documents say he is unvaccinated. Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s conservative government is seeking re-election for a fourth three-year term at polls due by May. While his government was widely praised for containing the nation's COVID-19 death toll at the start of the pandemic, omicron cases have been rapidly surging. He has been criticized for shortages of rapid antigen tests and for refusing to make the tests available to all for free. He has sought to place the blame for the controversy on Tennis Australia, which is organizing the Australian Open. Djokovic has been under guard in hotel quarantine since Thursday, when his visa was canceled. He appealed the cancellation at the virtual court hearing Monday amid a growing public debate over the positive coronavirus test that his lawyers used as grounds in applying for a medical exemption to Australia’s strict vaccination rules. Djokovic argued he did not need proof of vaccination because he had evidence that he had been infected with the coronavirus last month. Australian medical authorities have ruled that a temporary exemption for the vaccination rule can be provided to people who have been infected with COVID-19 within six months. Judge Kelly noted that Djokovic had provided officials at Melbourne’s airport with a medical exemption given him by Tennis Australia and two medical panels. “The point I’m somewhat agitated about is what more could this man have done?” Kelly asked Djokovic’s lawyer, Nick Wood. Wood agreed with the judge that Djokovic could not have done more. Transcripts of Djokovic’s interview with Border Force officials and his own affidavit revealed a “repeated appeal to the officers with which he was dealing that to his understanding, uncontradicted, he had done absolutely everything that he understood was required in order for him to enter Australia,” Wood said. Djokovic’s lawyers submitted 11 grounds for appeal against his visa cancellation. The lawyers described the cancellation as “seriously illogical,” irrational and legally unreasonable. Lawyers for Home Affairs Minister Andrews said in their submission that the vaccination requirement could only be deferred for arriving travelers who have had a COVID-19 infection if their illness was acute. “There is no suggestion that the applicant (Djokovic) had ‘acute major medical illness’ in December” when he tested positive, the written submission said. Andrews' lawyers eventually conceded that the authorities' decision to proceed with interviewing Djokovic in the early hours of Thursday and cancel his visa before he could contact Tennis Australia or his lawyers was unreasonable in the circumstances. Djokovic was told at 5.20 a.m. on Thursday that he had until 8.30 a.m. to respond to a notice of intention to cancel his visa. His comments were sought instead at 6.14 a.m. The decision to cancel his visa was made just over an hour later. Judge Kelly said if Djokovic had been given until 8.30 a.m. he could have consulted others about the decision. Neither Ministers Andrews nor Hawke immediately responded to requests for comment. The virtual hearing crashed several times because of an overwhelming number of people from around the world trying to watch the proceedings. At one point, an expired court link was apparently hacked and broadcast pornography, The New Daily News website reported. Djokovic is a nine-time Australian Open champion. He is the defending champion and has won the last three titles at Melbourne Park. Djokovic has 20 Grand Slam singles titles, a men’s record he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. ___ McGuirk reported from Canberra.

1/10/2022,"Ted Cruz used Twitter on Friday to accuse Joe Biden of signaling “weakness and surrender to Putin” over Ukraine – but the Texas senator could not escape a crisis of his own, stoked by widespread accusations of weakness and surrender in the face of the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, over remarks about the deadly Capitol attack. Related: Trump has birthed a dangerous new ‘Lost Cause’ myth. We must fight it | David Blight On Wednesday, a day before the first anniversary of the attack by supporters of Donald Trump attempting to overturn the election, Cruz described “a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol, where we saw the men and women of law enforcement demonstrate incredible courage”. A police officer who confronted the rioters was one of five people who died. Nonetheless, having stoked opprobrium in circles where the riot is played down or denied, Cruz went on Carlson’s primetime show. Carlson, widely condemned for promoting conspiracy theories about 6 January, is rumoured to have presidential ambitions in competition with Cruz. He went fiercely on the offensive. “You called this a ‘terror attack’ when by no definition was it a terror attack,” Carlson said. “That’s a lie. You told that lie on purpose, and I’m wondering why you did.” Cruz said: “The way I phrased things yesterday, it was sloppy and it was, frankly, dumb.” Carlson said: “I don’t buy that. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t buy that … I do not believe that you used that accidentally. I just don’t.” For Cruz, the interview got worse from there. The commentariat duly piled on. From the left, Jim Newell, at Slate, said Cruz had been “groveling for forgiveness” but “all Carlson would do was insist he beg harder. “This was Ted Cruz in maximal damage-control mode. He would only undergo this sort of debasement if he felt he’d made a mistake serious enough to threaten his political career and hamstring his chances in a GOP presidential primary. “It is a Cruz [we have] seen only one other time: the day after his speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, when he refused to endorse Donald Trump. It took him months to recover his standing among the Republican base after that. “Here, he is perceiving the same level of political threat among the base for having said, merely, that the 6 January riot was a ‘violent terrorist attack’.” Whether Trump runs again or not, Newell wrote, “these will be the politics of the 2024 Republican presidential primary … condemnations of what happened at the Capitol on 6 January will be taboo.” Cruz also took hits from the right. The Republican operative and Trump ally Roger Stone called him “a pandering, philandering asshole”. Ali Alexander, an operative in attempts to overturn the election, said Cruz was “dumb and lying”. Hits came too from the notional centre, from factcheckers in particular. For CNN, Daniel Dale pointed out that far from being “sloppy” on Wednesday, Cruz had called 6 January a terrorist attack at least 17 times before. On air, Carlson ridiculed the idea. “Of all the things that 6 January was,” he said, “it was definitely not a violent terrorist attack. It wasn’t an insurrection. Was it a riot? Sure. It was not a violent terrorist attack. Sorry.” Many disagree. As the New York Times reported, “Congress has enacted a statute that defines domestic terrorism as criminal offenses that are dangerous to human life, lack a foreign nexus and appear to be seeking ‘to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion’.” Related: Strategy shift: Biden confronts Trump head on after year of silent treatment Mary McCord, a senior national security official in the Obama and Trump administrations, told the paper some of the events of 6 January were therefore “acts of domestic terrorism, and that’s accurate regardless of whether it applies to each individual”. Cruz would seem to agree, writing on Twitter: “I was ONLY talking about the limited number of people who committed violent assaults on police officers. For over a decade, I’ve referred to those who violently attack police officers as terrorists. If you assault a cop you should go to jail.” But he also continued to apologise, to any Fox News viewers who might “misunderstand what I was saying”. Amid the furore, some also chose to consider past statements by Carlson. In the Washington Post, the columnist Greg Sargent pointed out: “Carlson himself has applied the T-label to … leftists, [calling] Black Lives Matter … a ‘terrorist organisation’.”",Politics/The Guardian,‘Weakness and surrender’: Ted Cruz seeks to move on from Tucker Carlson mauling,https://news.yahoo.com/weakness-surrender-ted-cruz-seeks-141326774.html
