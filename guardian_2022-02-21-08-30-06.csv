2/21/2022,"The last time I hugged my mum was early on a July morning in 2019 as I put her in a taxi outside my house in Canterbury, Kent. I should have been driving her to Heathrow myself. I’d picked her up at 6am when she’d arrived from Australia, but I was feeling fractious after five weeks together in my cramped terrace house, the longest we’d spent under one roof in 20 years. And I knew she’d be back before long. I blamed the baby, said she wasn’t in the mood for a four-hour round trip, and ordered a taxi instead.  The day was already warm and Mum was wearing a striped T-shirt. She cried as I hugged her, but after living overseas for 15 years I was used to that. She wondered when we’d see each other again or, more to the point, when she’d see my one-year-old daughter, her only grandchild. We talked tentatively about Christmas, but I was due at my in-laws that year so I said we’d wait and see. Almost as soon as she got home she emailed to ask if she could book another five-week trip for November. Exhausted by work and the baby, I said it wasn’t a good time, but we’d arrange something soon. We tried for my daughter’s 2nd birthday the following May, but by then the pandemic was well and truly in the way. In the end she stopped rebooking flights and accepted the airline’s travel voucher. My mum died on another July morning, almost two years to the day after the last time I saw her. I woke up to the message every expat fears – call home, urgent – and I knew. She’d been due to have surgery on a broken ankle, and I guessed she must have died on the operating table. My stomach churned as I dialled and heard my aunt’s voice, barely a whisper between our sobs. “She’s gone, Katie. She died.” I’m just one of many Australians overseas who lost someone close during the pandemic and never got the chance to say goodbye in person. While I’m thrilled to see joyful reunions playing out at airports across the country this week, it’s also incredibly painful for those of us who will never have that moment. Mum died suddenly and unexpectedly, not on the operating table after all but of a pulmonary embolism while waiting for surgery, 12 days after falling over while on holiday. She was only 68. It happened so quickly that even if we were living in the same country I might not have been there in her final moments. But if the borders hadn’t been shut for two years she would have at least got more than one Christmas, one birthday and one airport reunion with the granddaughter she had waited so long for. And my daughter would have something more than just a face on a screen to remember her by. I’m lucky I didn’t have to face the pain of knowing Mum was terminally ill when I couldn’t get home to her, like so many others did. Watching a loved one waste away through a screen – or worse, hearing they’ve died while you’re still biting your fingernails through quarantine – must have been hell on earth. I was also lucky that, against the odds, I made it to her funeral. The day Mum died I tweeted about not being able to get home, and it was widely shared. Somebody tagged Australia’s high commissioner to the UK, George Brandis, and the next morning I woke up to a message from him offering to help on compassionate grounds. Within minutes, someone from his office had gotten in touch and the wheels began to turn. We forked out thousands for airfares and PCR tests, but we were on the plane to Sydney within three days. There were 13 people in economy, and when we got there we discovered Katie Hopkins was in the same hotel – both facts were infuriating. After two weeks of quarantine with my three-year-old (exactly as fun as it sounds), I was home at last in Mum’s house. I’d thought if I could just lie on her bed, open her wardrobe and sink my face into her clothes, touch her fingerprints on her phone screen, I’d get the goodbye I needed. I didn’t, of course. I felt nothing when I stepped into her house. Even when I went to see her the day before the funeral and held her hand at last, I felt empty. Her body was there in the casket – bruised and disappearing after waiting so long for me – but she was gone. Still, that day in her house I gathered up the pieces that meant something. The striped T-shirt. A diary. Two of the rings she always wore, one a narrow band of tiny diamonds handed down from eldest daughter to eldest daughter for four generations, that I never take off. It’s the lost moments I find hardest to reconcile. Saying no to that trip she so desperately wanted to make. Not driving her to the airport that day. Maybe if I had we would have talked about some of the things we needed to. She always liked to corner me into tricky conversations in the car. A classic mum move. For all these reasons this week will be hard, despite how happy I am it’s finally here. Yet today the wattle is blooming in the park across the road. They call it mimosa here, but it has the same army-green leaves and fluffy yellow flowers as the trees behind the house I grew up in. I breathe in its unmistakable scent and I’m eight again, twisting off a stringy branch to give Mum, which she puts in a little crystal vase on the windowsill. I have moments like this every day, and they give me hope that perhaps goodbyes don’t really matter. She is with me, no matter what happened or didn’t happen later. She is with me.

2/21/2022,"Jamal Edwards, known for founding media platform SBTV, which helped catapult grime and a wave of new artists to a global audience, has died aged 31. Edwards was also a director, author, DJ, entrepreneur and designer, and was awarded an MBE in 2014 for his work in music.  The careers of some of the world’s most successful musicians – including Ed Sheeran, Dave and Jessie J in a long list – were launched through SBTV, Edwards’ platform, which began as a YouTube channel, before they were signed by major labels. Edwards said he started SBTV “on a £20 phone” while he was still at school and grew it into a leading online youth broadcaster. Edwards’ YouTube channel was established in 2006 and now boasts 1.2m subscribers and nearly 1bn total views. The channel, named after Edwards’ rap name SmokeyBarz, featured early music from artists including Stormzy, Rita Ora, Krept & Konan, Bugzy Malone and more. “I always looked on grime like the punk movement, in terms of lyrics and rebellious attitude,” Edwards told the Guardian in a 2017 interview. A trademark format was SBTV’s F64 – a fresh 64 bars of new and original lyrics – from established artists like Wiley to newcomers and up-and-coming stars. Edwards was born in Luton in 1990 and grew up in Acton, west London. He received a BTec diploma in media moving image from Ealing College and worked at retail chain Topman to financially support himself while developing SBTV. When he found success, Edwards undertook extensive philanthropic work, including in mental health and the funding of youth centres. He worked to break down taboos about men’s mental health, speaking of his own anxiety, and in 2021 launched a project aimed at refurbishing and reopening youth centres. Tributes poured in for Edwards on social media from people in the music industry, politics and beyond. Rapper AJ Tracey posted: “RIP Jamal Edwards, west london legend status.” Dave added: “Thank you for everything … words cannot explain.” Lethal Bizzle called Edwards “one of the pioneers in UK music”. “Today I was on set when I found out the tragic news that my good friend Jamal Edwards had passed away and I’m honestly heartbroken,” Bafta-winning actor Adam Deacon said on Twitter. “Jamal was one of the nicest, most down to earth and humble men I’ve met in this industry. He always gave me time even when no one else would.” 1/2 Today I was on set when I found out the tragic news that my good friend Jamal Edwards had passed away and I’m honestly heartbroken.

2/21/2022,"Pep Guardiola has said that Manchester City are in a fight for the Premier League title after their 3-2 home defeat against Tottenham on Saturday. City’s first loss in 17 Premier League games leaves the champions on 63 points, six ahead of Liverpool, who have a match in hand and visit the Etihad Stadium on 9 April.  Guardiola was clear that City are now in a tussle with the Merseyside club, having led by 12 points earlier this month. “We have to fight for every game and every game we are going to win we will be closer,” the City manager said. “I said weeks ago we have to make a lot of points to be champions and this is what we will try to do. “I think we performed well – honestly. I never said the title race was over. It’s normal. In January and February the teams at the bottom won their games because everyone fights for everything. It will be difficult. We know it. “But it’s happened. We lost a game. We will recover with training sessions and prepare for the next game.” City were never ahead in the match, having to equalise strikes from Dejan Kulusevski and Harry Kane before the latter’s 95th‑minute winner. “They defended in the 18-yard box and it was so difficult,” Guardiola said. “They allowed us to go outside and closed all the channels inside, and then after that they could run with their quality but they didn’t run much. It was difficult. Every time we played inside we had to then move outside and we arrived there and crossed. But for many reasons we were not there to score. “The first goal came from the quality they have and the second is difficult to defend and the third was our mistake. We were close to drawing, and maybe winning, but congratulations to Spurs.” The victory halted a run of three consecutive league defeats for Antonio Conte’s team. Eric Dier said: “This win is important if we take it in the right way. If we recognise that if we play with that intensity, with that commitment, that unity; if we play with that every game we can really push on from this. “I think we have to take this win in the right way, not get carried away but recognise what we need to do as a team to get results and play well. We have to take it with humility and understand that as a team we can be very good.”",Sport/Football," ‘I never said title race was over – we have to fight for every game,’ says Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/20/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-tottenham
2/21/2022,"Boris Johnson will proclaim that the lifting of all remaining Covid restrictions in England this week marks a “moment of pride” when he unveils the government’s long-term strategy for living with the virus, despite concerns from scientists, health experts and Labour that the move is premature. The legal requirement for anyone with Covid to isolate will be ditched a month earlier than planned, while free PCR and lateral flow tests will be axed to rein in public spending and attempt to restore people’s confidence that life can return to normality.  The national contact tracing service is expected to be wound down and schoolchildren will no longer be told to get tested twice a week. Fresh guidance is expected to be issued, similar to that already published about seasonal flu, designed to let individuals make their own judgments about the risk of catching or transmitting Covid. Following meetings over the weekend the cabinet will be assembled to rubber stamp the plans on Monday before a Commons statement by the prime minister and a press conference in the evening, likely to feature the government’s two leading pandemic advisers, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. The changes will be announced on Monday and start to come into effect from later in the week. On Sunday Johnson insisted the country was “in a different world” from when the pandemic started and said he wanted to “shift the balance” away from rules to advice for dealing with Covid. He told the BBC that people should still be careful and that coronavirus “remains a dangerous disease” for vulnerable and unvaccinated people, but said it was time “to see our country really getting back on its feet”, with workers going back to their offices “in the normal way”. To prepare for the threat of new variants emerging, it is understood that some measures will be kept in reserve. Health sources suggested these could include lab capacity for sequencing tests and back up contact tracing and mobile testing. So far, 91.4% of those eligible for a vaccine have had their first dose, falling to 85% for the second and 66.1% for the third. Daily case numbers have fallen to around a fifth of the record peak seen at the start of January 2022, while deaths have remained below 200 a day for the past week. Labour argued the move to scrap all remaining Covid restrictions was premature, and accused ministers of wanting to “declare victory before the war is over”. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said Johnson was acting like a football manager whose team was 2-1 up in the closing minutes of a game and decided to take off the best defender. “I’m not clear that the scientific advice supports this,” he said, adding that he stood with those groups who had raised concerns, such as the NHS Confederation, World Health Organization and British Medical Association, “any day of the week and twice on Sunday”. He accused Johnson of having been motivated by “political weakness, not by public health”. Tory MPs welcomed the move, particularly given it would “put daylight between us and the opposition”. However, one critic of the prime minister said it had “been brought forward as a galvanising effort for the party” given the pressure Johnson is under for being investigated by police over parties at No 10 during lockdown. A source claimed no modelling had been commissioned by the government to examine the possible effect on Covid rates of charging for tests. David Spiegelhalter, professor of public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said there was significant uncertainty about the impact of the plans. “I can see the figures are looking encouraging, but the consequences are very difficult to predict. It may be fine, it may not be,” he said – adding that surveillance of the virus should continue through the Office for National Statistics’ infection survey. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said Johnson’s plans were the “latest in a long line of reckless policies”. “Keeping some measures in place, including, for example, the requirement to wear masks in indoor spaces and requirements to self-isolate for a few more weeks would be helpful,” he said. “Breaking chains of transmission means there would be fewer people unwell and in hospital, healthcare resources would be freer to address their extensive backlogs, and more people would have received their booster doses thus ensuring they are better protected.” Experts have expressed particular concern about clinically extremely vulnerable people, for whom Covid still poses a more serious risk. The specialist guidance that has been in place for much of the pandemic is not expected to continue. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said that the government had “deliberately abandoned” this group. Removing free lateral flow tests would “create a massive health inequality” for clinically vulnerable people whose friends, family and colleagues could not afford to take tests before contact, Peters said, while removing the requirement to self-isolate would further ramp up “risk and anxiety”.",News/World news,Johnson to say ending Covid rules in England is a ‘moment of pride’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/johnson-to-say-ending-covid-rules-in-england-is-a-moment-of-pride
