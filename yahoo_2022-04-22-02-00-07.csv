4/22/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced U.S. citizen Shadeed Abdulmateen to death for intentional homicide of a 21-year-old woman, his former girlfriend, state broadcaster CCTV reported. In its verdict the Ningbo Intermediate People's Court in Zhejiang Province, found that after a disagreement over the pair's break-up in June 2019 the defendant arranged to meet and talk with the victim, a Chinese citizen surnamed Chen, at a bus top in Ningbo before going on to kill her with a ""folding knife"". The court held that the defendant's ""premeditated revenge killing, stabbing and cutting Chen's face and neck several times, resulting in Chen's death, was motivated by vile motives, resolute intent and cruel means, and the circumstances of the crime were particularly bad and the consequences particularly serious, and should be punished according to law,"" CCTV reported.

4/22/2022,"Somebody was dumb enough to aggravate Mike Tyson and paid the price for it. Video obtained by TMZ shows Tyson on an airplane, leaned over the back of his seat and throwing a flurry of punches down at someone. That someone, according to TMZ, was an “extremely intoxicated” unidentified man who wouldn’t stop bothering Tyson, who at first took a selfie with the man and apparently was OK with his behavior – until he wasn’t and unloaded on him. You can watch the video here:   As you can see from the video, the man was bloodied but extremely fortunate to still be conscious after absorbing multiple punches from MIKE TYSON. According to TMZ, Tyson walked off the plane seconds later, and the man received medical attention and spoke to police about the incident but nothing further.
