5/12/2022,"When Thomas Hardy’s wife Emma died in 1912 she left behind the recollections she had been writing of her life in Cornwall before her marriage, evoking her joy as a young woman riding over the cliffs of Beeny and St Juliot. She also left the many diaries she had kept through two decades of increasing alienation from a husband who seemed to have abandoned her for the separate reality of his novels. The bereaved Thomas confronted these documents in shock, encountering in their pages both the young woman he had loved and a horrifying picture of their failed marriage. From the unexpected depths of his grief and remorse came his great sequence of elegies, Poems of 1912-13. With remarkable steadiness and fine judgment, Elizabeth Lowry goes right into the midst of this legendary literary maelstrom and opens a space for fiction. She inhabits the household at Max Gate, the house Hardy built in Dorset, in the days after Emma’s sudden death and before the poems gave lasting shape and voice to the lost woman on the Cornish hills. Was Hardy the jailer of a neglected wife? Was Emma thwarted in her own writing? Why did it all go so wrong – and did the trouble start with Tess of the d’Urbervilles? Slowly and feelingly, the novel pores over questions about the costs of art, refusing to shout out answers, letting many perspectives tell upon each other. The diaries Hardy read were, according to his second wife, “diabolical”. He burned them: Emma’s own version of her life story went up in flames. Lowry takes on the challenge of imaginative re-creation. Here is Emma reinstated as narrator of herself: persistent in her love, acute about her husband’s work, chronically rejected, finding no adequate company or purpose, and eventually feeling caged in an attic room, resented and avoided by the man preoccupied with invented people in the study below. By 1896 she thinks of herself as dead already. “This is how we exist now: two people in their coffins, two ghosts, stacked one on top of the other.” The charges against Hardy are many and clear, but the novel itself is not one of accusation; Lowry is certainly not out to cancel Thomas Hardy. The Chosen is underwritten at every turn by the enduring power of the poems, and it leads us back to them. It follows carefully the stages of Hardy’s inchoate sorrow and reawakening desire, his attachment to his labouring-class family and distance from them, his efforts to honour a restless mind as well as the woman standing solidly in front of him – who in autumn 1912 is his lover Florence Dugdale, expecting to be made his wife. This is Lowry’s third novel. The Bellini Madonna (2008), a densely plotted mystery with an alluringly off-putting narrator, was followed in 2018 by Dark Water, finely crafted and hugely ambitious in its study of 19th-century psychology and its shadowing of Melville. These are all novels interested in the attractions and dangers of great minds and in the limits of understanding; they work with narrators we might call, after Hardy, “self-unseeing”; they offer partial, counterpointed versions of the story. Lowry can shape glittering sentences when she wants to, as in The Bellini Madonna, but in The Chosen she chooses restraint. The writing steers us towards calm thinking even while Emma is soundlessly screaming in her prison or Hardy is holding her corpse. The very mobile tone won’t let this be all tragedy or melodrama or farce or shimmeringly remembered romance. Everyone at Max Gate has their own keen sense of the absurdities involved in mourning. The wreaths laid for Emma are “plump as life buoys” (but are saving no one, soon look deflated, and are merely rained on rather than flung out across a flood). Plangent reveries are liable to run up against acerbic interruptions – from Hardy himself, or from his sharp, capable, loyal sister Kate, one of the most memorably drawn figures in this composite portrait of Hardy and the people he loves. “Don’t go soft on me,” she says, shaking off sentiment before it takes hold. The wit can be touchingly gentle and suggestive. Thomas and Kate sit quietly together, she remembering how proud they all were at the Higher Bockhampton cottage when he was a schoolboy bringing his certificates back across the fields. Fondly she prompts him to decline “table” in Latin. Mensae, mensae, mensa, he begins: “That’s the vocative you know, mensa. It means ‘O table’.” “Why would anyone want to address a table?” “I have absolutely no idea.” They say no more, but fleetingly we see how the late poem The Little Old Table (“creak, little wood thing, creak”) might come from this moment of familial closeness. And we see how differently the vocative will be used in the lines of Hardy’s poetry that we sense below the surface of the novel: “Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me”. Where Poems of 1912-13 intensify around single visions, utterly concentrated, The Chosen works by looking around at everything going on in the house. Max Gate is vividly realised in all its tree-shadowed gloominess, gobbling coal and effort, too large yet grimly confining. There are admirers at the door, the pie is cold, someone needs to pay the grocery bills, the maid’s family would go hungry without her wages. Hardy is learning to notice all this: the passions and difficulties of these others who live around him, the practical work that makes possible his days of absorption. Unmoored as he is, adrift and a stranger to himself, he is thinking hard about what he has failed to notice. “Too late, he sees it all.” It’s changing him, perhaps, though there’s no simple moral to be drawn, and he must set off again on his solitary journeys while someone else sees to the fire.

5/12/2022,"The Philadelphia 76ers’ slim chances of winning their first NBA title in 39 years pretty much cratered Tuesday when they were blown out by the Miami Heat in the fifth game of their second-round playoff series. The Sixers need to beat the Heat two in a row just to survive. Then the Sixers would need to win eight more games over two series for the title. That hardly seems likely, given the way they wobbled in the dismal 35-point loss to Miami, even with Joel Embiid, the banged-up superstar center who has had the best season in his career. Word had leaked out Monday through ESPN that Embiid had lost to Denver’s Nikola Jokić for the second straight year in balloting for the league’s Most Valuable Player award, and Embiid tried to swat the rejection away by saying he would really rather win a title. And yet … “I wonder what else I have to do to win it,” Embiid said in a news conference after Tuesday’s game, “and to me, it’s like, at this point it’s like, it’s whatever. It’s all about focusing, not that I wasn’t focused on the bigger picture, but you know, it’s really time to really put all my energy into the bigger picture, which is to win the whole thing.” It should be no surprise that the sports fans in Philadelphia have not taken the leaked news well. Jokić’s impressive season notwithstanding, this, to them, appears to be the latest example of the Most Valuable Player trophy not being won by the actual most valuable player. “Jokić is a peerless offensive player,” the columnist Marcus Hayes, who is far from a homer, wrote in Tuesday’s Philadelphia Inquirer. “He’s a better passer and shooter than Embiid. Embiid is close – more power, better moves to the basket, better in transition. Defensively, though, the chasm is massive. Which means, in totality, Embiid is better. He does things Jokić cannot. He’s a combination of Shaquille O’Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Dirk Nowitzki. Jokić is Larry Bird, plus two inches and 50 pounds.” Embiid does the simple stuff that does not lead to sellout houses on the road. Consider this stat: The Sixers were second in the league in home attendance, but 29th among 30 teams in road attendance (the Bulls, Lakers and Warriors were the top three). Awards that should be purely subjective – based on the gut – have been diminished by analytics, but, if you really must, Jokić’s player-efficiency rating of 32.94 was higher than the 31.24 rating posted by Embiid, who also finished behind Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. Much to his credit, Jokić had a higher value to his team, per those statistics, by driving the injury-ravaged Nuggets to an unlikely playoff berth, but Embiid had the second highest value while carrying the Sixers through a farce far more ludicrous, the Ben Simmons holdout. Now speculation has arisen that the Brooklyn Nets, who were suckered – or, rather, convinced – to take Simmons from the Sixers in a blockbuster February deal, might trade Simmons, besieged by back and personal issues, before he plays even one game for them. “I don’t know if a guy could’ve done more than he did this year,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said this week. “He played without the second-best player all year.” Embiid propelled the Sixers to 51 regular season victories, as many as Boston and Milwaukee, without Simmons, who chafed at being considered “second-best”. The Sixers then beat Toronto in four of six playoff games before Embiid’s face literally was broken. With the Sixers leading by 35 points and less than four minutes to play in the series finale against the Raptors, Embiid, who already was playing with torn ligaments in his shooting thumb, was elbowed by Pascal Siakam, fracturing the bone around his right eye. He missed the first two games of the Miami series. The Sixers lost both of those games. But then Embiid returned, wearing a face mask that made him look like a cyborg. Philadelphia won the next two games. Then, for an inexplicable reason, the MVP news leaked, becoming a topic Embiid had to address Tuesday. “I’m not mad,” Embiid said of not winning the MVP award, which is expected to be formally announced this week. “That’s two years in a row I put myself in that position. It didn’t happen. It is almost like, at this point, it is whatever. Whatever happens, happens.” The MVP award is voted upon by a panel of news media, based on regular-season performance. Of course an NBA MVP would happily trade his Maurice Podoloff Trophy for the Larry O’Brien championship trophy, and Embiid still had a shot at the latter Tuesday night. Philadelphia has not had much to cheer since the Eagles won the Super Bowl more than four years ago. The Phillies were supposed to be better this year with the additions of Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber, but they already appear dead in the water, getting no-hit by the Mets on one weekend and coughing up a six-run ninth-inning lead to their division rivals the next. The Flyers are looking for yet another coach after missing the playoffs for the sixth time in 10 seasons – a dismal run that is now costing them longtime fans. Their average home attendance was the lowest this year since 1973, or two years before their last Stanley Cup. The Eagles appear to be getting better, but they will need a few years to peak, if they ever do. Embiid, the native of Cameroon, has all but carried the sports dreams of an entire working-class city in the meantime. He started his NBA career very slowly, with leg injuries costing him two seasons, but endeared himself to the city’s fans by playing hard, and often playing hurt. The city celebrated when Embiid won his first NBA scoring title this spring. Siakam earned a permanent place among Philadelphia sports villains – booed for all eternity – by elbowing Embiid’s face. Many Sixers’ fans thought the elbow was intentional, thrown because Embiid had playfully taunted the Toronto fans minutes earlier. Everywhere you go in Philadelphia, you see shirts with “PHILA” on the front and Embiid’s No 21 on the back. He made $31.58m this season, but he has been made a hero, a rare honor. He looked rundown on Tuesday, but he has been hoisting a team all season by blocking shots and taking charging fouls and seizing rebounds, the unspectacular but valuable things.",Sport/Sport,‘What else can I do?’: Joel Embiid swerves MVP snub as Sixers fight on,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/joel-embiid-nikola-jokic-nba-mvp
5/12/2022,"Swedish film-maker Ninja Thyberg certainly did not take the easy route with her first feature. Pleasure, which arrives in US theaters this weekend, takes on a subject rife for denigration or moralism: ambitious 19-year-old Bella Cherry, played by Swedish newcomer Sofia Kappel, trying to break into the American porn industry in the late 2010s. Based on years of research in the Hollywood-adjacent world of Los Angeles adult film, Thyberg’s debut portrays female friendship, pragmatic striving and power dynamics in an industry as liable for abuse – and professionalism – as any other. Pleasure often lingers on the quotidian aspects of the business – contracts, pre-shoot douches, set lighting, gossip with co-workers. The unrated film, which premiered at the 2021 Sundance festival, opens on Bella’s bare crotch, as she contorts herself in the shower to shave her vulva before her first shoot. Another act of ambition: this is Kappel’s first-ever acting role. The 24-year-old first met Thyberg through a mutual friend, who recommended her based on an early character description for Bella. “My initial thought was: absolutely not,” Kappel told the Guardian. But she was looking for challenging, uncomfortable experiences – there is, unsurprisingly, a lot of nudity in Pleasure, though lack of clothing is so perfunctory as to become unremarkable – and was sold on Thyberg’s vision of a film about porn as a professional business and microcosm of society. “I think the porn industry as a subject is very interesting since it’s very present in our lives but we don’t talk about it. We act like it doesn’t exist,” she said. And yet it is nearly ubiquitous; various international studies have put porn consumption rates at 50% to 99% percent among men, and 30% to 86% among women, according to the American Psychological Association. Porn, as Pleasure implicitly argues, is less a seedy corner of society than a mirror. “Everything that would be present in our society will also be shown in the porn industry,” said Kappel of the film. “We are a racist society, and the porn industry is also racist. We’re a sexist society, and the porn industry is also sexist. We live in a patriarchy, and the porn industry is also that.” Pleasure is a nearly decade-long journey for Thyberg, a former anti-porn activist who developed the feature from her 2013 short film of the same name. The short took a much more critical view of the industry, based on research conducted via the internet. For the feature, Thyberg knew she needed first-hand experience – “I wanted to challenge people’s prejudices, so I felt I had to this properly and get to know [adult film performers] and then build a story, not decide beforehand what the story would be,” she said. So Thyberg traveled to Los Angeles and, starting in 2014, spent five years researching for the film – getting to know adult film performers, befriending producers, observing sets, networking through Mark Spiegler, one of the industry’s top agents, who plays himself in the film (as do numerous real-life performers). The research checked many of her existing biases. Thyberg said she arrived in LA nervous to talk to female performers, and with somewhat of a “victim perspective” – “I thought that they were taking part in this very patriarchal system and playing along with these super stereotypical gender roles because they don’t have the theoretical perspective that I have,” she explained. “I was on a high horse … I had a very good intention, but I was coming from a [patronizing point of view]. “I started to understand how it’s the complete opposite,” she added. “They know so much more about patriarchy than I do, and they are super aware of everything.” The realization changed by Thyberg’s understanding of feminism and her approach to the film. “I became so aware of how we look down on women, and how much that is part of reproducing a male gaze,” she said. Kappel described the months spent researching her character as a similar evolution. “When I got to the US, I had a lot of prejudice toward the sex industry and especially toward women in the sex industry,” she said. Shadowing adult film sets and building relationships with performers changed her mind. “I realized that it was so obvious that it was work,” she said. “It’s turned boring very, very quickly. “What I realized very quickly was that the question ‘Why?’ is so problematic,” she said. “Because I would never ask someone who works at a supermarket or a pharmacy, ‘Why would you work there?’ But as soon as there’s sex involved or especially toward women, when they’re using their bodies – they’re objectifying themselves rather than giving that power to men – you want to ask why. Why would you do that? “I think a better question to ask would be: what do you get out of it?” she added. That question elicits highly individualized answers. People work in the sex industry to pay medical bills, to make extra money, for artistic expression, or for fun. Not that the industry is perfect. Adult performers have reported widespread mental health concerns, and are particularly susceptible to dismissal – many will conflate performing sex acts on cameras as asking to be hurt. “They don’t feel like they can speak up, because they’re not going to be believed,” said Thyberg. Pleasure is, ultimately, a film about work, one that suffuses a business often described in stark terms with grey areas and fine lines – between empowerment and exploitation, erotic and obscene, ambition and corruption. Bella – blonde, blasé, an expert at the dissociative pout – befriends the other women living in a house owned by their mutual agent. She competes with other girls, tries to build an online following, eyes the “Spiegler girls” (porn’s A-listers) with envy and takes on increasingly risky, hardcore material in a bid to shoot up the industry ladder. She participates in a fetishized “interracial” porn (“it sounds racist because it is racist,” a black colleague tells her.) A BDSM shoot directed by a woman, in which Bella is rope-bound and whipped, evinces the industry’s best practices: safe words, check-ins, clear boundaries and expectations. It’s a sharp contrast to the most harrowing scene of the movie, exemplifying the industry’s worst potential. In the scene, Bella arrives to a bare set – her, two male actors, one male director. The director notes the material will be “rough” – slapping, choking, spitting – but there is no rehearsal, warm-up, or discussion of safe words, check-ins or boundaries. The director just begins shooting. When Bella shuts down, he pressures her to continue (“Feels good to say yes, right?”) Thyberg’s camera effectively mimics Bella’s blurred perception, splintered by trauma – sounds fading in and out, a shoe, a face, the wall, the camera, a snippet of memory. On the drive home, she pulls over and vomits. It’s a difficult scene to watch and, paired with the compassionate, professional BDSM shoot, one of the film’s most evocative sequences of the industry’s ethical spectrum. In reality, the scene was tightly rehearsed and padded with numerous safety guardrails. Kappel chose to do stunts, and practiced months prior with Bill Bailey, the lead male actor. A close friend from Sweden was on hand during the shoot, as was co-star Revika Anne Reustle. Both had the authority to call cut if she made eye contact with them. There were established boundaries – no feet near her face – and plenty of snacks during frequent breaks. “The situation was very safe and very therapeutic for me, because even though I had to get in a headspace that was hard and uncomfortable for me to get in, I got to do it in a very safe space,” she said. Ultimately, Pleasure morphed into a story about “being a woman in a male-dominated world”, said Thyberg, as told through one woman’s navigation of one insular, frequently stigmatized industry. The film, and particularly a muted ending open for interpretation, avoids moralizing against porn at large. “You can’t quit patriarchy – you can only handle it and deal with it,” Thyberg said. “The things that [Bella’s] going through that are bad in the film don’t have anything to do with having sex on camera. It has to do with inequality, with power abuse, with structures that exist in any industry.” Pleasure is in US cinemas from 13 May with a UK and Australian date to be announced",Arts/Film,‘I wanted to challenge people’s prejudices’: is Pleasure the most revealing film about porn ever?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/pleasure-ninja-thyberg-porn-drama-sofia-kappel
5/12/2022,"Underwear-clad models stand in a rainforest, surrounded by ferns. Sunlight shines through the morning mist. “Humans,” intones renowned primatologist Dr Jane Goodall. “What unusual animals we are.” As the camera pans over a closeup shot of a male model’s boxer briefs, the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees says, “It’s a big job making our world a better place, but getting started? Well, that’s as easy as changing your underwear.” This 30-second ad, for Australian underwear company Boody, is now airing. Billboards from the campaign will soon be erected around Sydney and Melbourne. “It’s interesting,” says Associate Prof Michal Carrington, a researcher in ethical consumption at Melbourne University. “Because you wouldn’t expect Dame Jane Goodall to be fronting a campaign for underwear.” Elliot Midalia, co-managing director of Boody, says: “We didn’t want to just get any influencer or celebrity. “Jane was the top of our list, and we’re so happy that she said yes. We couldn’t believe it.” Goodall’s fee – a sum Boody are not contractually allowed to disclose – was paid directly to the Jane Goodall Institute. It’s not the first time Goodall has appeared in advertising – she has also modelled for Stella McCartney and appeared in commercials for HP. While the final cut of the commercial shows Goodall surrounded by models, the ad was shot in two parts. Goodall was filmed against a green screen in London, while the rest of the campaign footage was captured in Australia. “She had a laugh about it, made a few jokes about how funny it was that she’d be out there with underwear models around her,” says Roy Leibowitz, one of the campaign’s creative directors. “She’s so professional, it just seemed to come easy.” Goodall’s outfit in the advertisement was also made by Boody. Midalia says they already had plans to make a turtleneck (“her signature,” as he puts it), but when the institute confirmed she would work with the brand, “we quickly expedited that”. Carrington describes an endorsement from Goodall as “significant”. “Someone like Jane Goodall is not going to be part of any campaign that’s going to detract from … her credibility.” Boody is a B Corp certified business, a 1% for the Planet participant, and manufacture their garments from Forest Stewardship Council-certified bamboo. Midalia describes that ad’s message as “really about sustainability, about getting people to make a switch to an underwear that supports the planet”. While Carrington says the conservation message is important, she questions the efficacy of such a positive approach. “Pulling my academic hat on,” she says, research suggests that when you want to engage people in an ethical decision, “no matter what the message, or the cause, you really need to switch people on morally”. She notes that the campaign does not explain the impacts it is trying to address, from the destruction of native forests to the way cotton farming might deplete water resources. The most effective messages, Carrington says, create “what we call moral shock”. “This ad campaign doesn’t really give that sense of moral shock, or that sense of why … The sense that people in their own actions are implicated.” On the other hand, Carrington says, “there is a whole argument going on about how much responsibility a consumer can have”. “While it’s great to see companies taking responsibility themselves and developing [more sustainable] products … how much responsibility do we want to place on the consumer? “From a cynical perspective you could say ‘Well why isn’t there legislation out there to stop the harmful effects of clothing?’”",News/Science,G-strings in the mist: ‘You wouldn’t expect Jane Goodall to be fronting a campaign for underwear’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/12/g-strings-in-the-mist-you-wouldnt-expect-jane-goodall-to-be-fronting-a-campaign-for-underwear
5/12/2022,"In this de facto, if far from de jure, latest iteration of the Ted franchise, Mark Wahlberg once again forms a strange, almost inexplicable bond with a supernatural creature who tests him in a number of painful, problematic ways. However – surprise! – instead of a stuffed teddy bear that’s come to life, this time the agent of chaos is God himself, that omnipresent, omniscient, all-powerful scamp. God first makes the life of Wahlberg’s Stuart Long hard by taking away his little brother via a sudden death when they are little kids, and then giving him a nature that gets him into trouble throughout his life, keeping him from finding a vocation until he finally Finds a Vocation, ie the desire to become a priest. On the plus side, Stu at least has a number of nice people rooting for him and helping him out, including his feisty mom Kathleen (Jacki Weaver). There’s also a saintly girlfriend named Carmen (Teresa Ruiz) who first leads him to the church, and variously supportive fellow seminary students (Aaron Moten and Cody Fern) who, like most of the supporting cast, deserve canonisation for offering very strong performances as unexpectedly well defined characters. And I am loth to admit this but that also goes for Mel Gibson; if you can separate the dancer from dance, he is an actor capable of bringing a face like a long stretch of ravaged road and a credible impression of pain to the role of Stu’s alcoholic dad Billy. Still, Gibson’s connections to a particularly retrograde, Opus Dei-adjacent branch of the Catholic church represents a problem for a movie that wants us to celebrate the faith’s ability to be more inclusive and accepting of renegades. Is this really what Jesus would have wanted? There is a nice soundtrack by Dickon Hinchliffe, sometime Tinderstick and composer of several great soundtracks for directors such as Claire Denis, Debra Granik and Maggie Gyllenhaal. What he’s doing working with the likes of Gibson is puzzling but we all have our crosses to bear. There are also good bits in this based-on-a-true-story drama, including the aforementioned performances and a commitment to theology so sincere it’s not afraid to bore an audience with lots of pin-head-fine debates about Godhood. If Gibson weren’t part of the package it might be possible to like it more.

5/12/2022,"The firing of a Mississippi assistant principal for reading pupils a humorous children’s book, I Need A New Butt!, has been upheld by his school district. The book describes a boy who tries to find a new bottom after he sees a “crack” in his current bottom which makes him afraid it is broken. In March, Toby Price, an assistant principal at Gary Road elementary school in Hinds county, Mississippi, was fired after reading the book to 240 children in a Zoom session. Price was called to the district superintendent’s office and told that he was being placed on leave. In a letter, the superintendent called the book “inappropriate” as it “described butts in various colors, shapes and sizes (example: fireproof, bullet proof, bomb proof)”. “The book contains statements and cartoon pictures regarding bodily anatomy, bodily functions and removing clothing to expose private areas of the body in various positions,” the district said. Price was fired two days later, after being accused of violating the Mississippi Educator Code of Ethics. He appealed. But on Monday his lawyers informed him the firing was upheld. In a report reviewed by the Washington Post, the district said: “Mr Price’s contract should be terminated due to his incompetence, neglect of duty, and for good cause.” According to the report, two board members voted yes, one voted no and two abstained. An educator for 20 years, Price plans to pursue an appeal with the chancery courts of Mississippi. If that does not work, he plans to take his case to the state supreme court. “If that’s where it ends up, that’s where it ends up,” he told the Post. “We expected this part to happen but at the same time it doesn’t make it any easier,” he said, adding: “It still stings.” A GoFundMe campaign launched to support Price and his family has raised more than $125,000. Price said he had turned down out-of-state job offers. His firing ignited a firestorm of criticism from free speech advocates who argue it could have a devastating effect on students and educators, especially as conservative-fueled gag orders make their way across schools in the US. In Hinds county, 21% of residents live below the poverty line. “We have a lot of reluctant readers,” Price told the New York Times, adding: “I am a firm believer that reluctant readers need the silly, funny books to hook them in.”",News/US news,Mississippi school district upholds teacher’s firing for reading I Need a New Butt! to kids,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/mississippi-teacher-firing-upheld-i-need-a-new-butt

It is filmed on a clever little 360-degree camera on a stick you hold in front of you. There’s another camera filming from a distance, and a drone buzzing overhead some of the time, but essentially you are all alone. It’s a beautiful but dangerous programme. Dangerous in that, when it comes to interviewing, there’s safety in numbers. And, here, the number is one. If you are interviewing someone in a studio, or out and about, for radio or television, you invariably have colleagues around you. They are there for technical or editorial reasons, but they are also a kind of comfort blanket. I didn’t realise this until the blanket wasn’t there. A long time ago, I did this thing for radio where I invited people around to my place, cooked, and interviewed them over dinner. I made spinach soup in British racing green for Stirling Moss, lambs’ testicles for Vinny Jones, and chicken bonne femme for Jenny Agutter. I don’t recall what I made for David Mellor, but I do remember his response when I asked him something about the demise of his first marriage. He glared at me and said: “Let’s leave that, shall we?” Silence. It was awful. It would have been awkward as hell in a studio, too, but – with just the two of us there, at my little dinner table – it was unbearable.

I cope with it no better as an interviewee, filling any awkward moments with all sorts of stream-of-consciousness babble that ends up, to the quiet delight of the interviewer, getting me in lots of trouble. Winter Walks, with me all alone as interviewer and interviewee, was the apotheosis of this. I wandered along, babbling heaven knows what. It’s available on iPlayer now, but I won’t be watching.

I feel loyal customers are being penalised.PH, Kidlington, Oxfordshire Insurers have indeed penalised loyalty for years so they can fund bargain premiums to attract new ones, but in January they were banned from doing this by the Financial Conduct Authority. LV told me that during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 when cars were driven less, it passed savings on to its customers and that the average cost of motor insurance across the sector was the lowest since 2015. It’s true that the cost of many car insurance policies fell by an average of 6% during the pandemic, but LV actually raised yours by 10% in 2020 and by 15.6% in 2021. When I pointed this out to LV, it clarified opaquely that savings were passed on “where possible”, but that “other factors”, including claims inflation and the cost of repairs, had to be priced in. Car insurance premiums are rising across the board this year, but the average increase in the first three months of 2022 was only 2%, according to figures from Confused.com, and the average premium this year is still lower than in 2019. LV says its eye-watering price rise is due to changes in its risk modelling and an increase in claims and repair costs. After my intervention, it agreed to apply a “discretionary discount” of £22 to your premium, which still leaves you with an 18% increase.

Although this was a bit of a stretch, the scale at which he helped change the nation’s outlook was similarly huge. Guatemala was originally called Guate by the Indigenous people, but the Spanish later added mala, meaning bad. Mau’s first move was to add an “a”, creating “Guate! Amala!,” or “The love of Guate.” The slogan was part of a larger campaign to shine a positive light on the country, showcase the people working to improve their country, and recruit a thousand volunteers to help spread these messages. They received 20,000 sign ups in the first weekend. This large-scale, systemic thinking and the man behind it is the focus of Mau, a feature-length documentary directed by Austrian documentarians Benji and Jono Bergmann that traces Mau’s life and career, drawing connections between his unique ability to speculate on possible futures and his own upbringing in the rural Canadian mining town of Sudbury. “My first design project was designing my own life,” Mau earnestly explains in the film. “Understanding that I would not accept what it was and I would have to create a new one.” Before leaving for Toronto for college, Mau had never left Sudbury, a nickel mining town whose landscape was so violently altered by the industry that Nasa used the black, chemical-poisoned terrain to train astronauts for moon missions. Mau’s upbringing was nothing short of abject: his father was a miner and a violent, alcoholic “maniac”. Mau’s personal journey – the unlikely transcendence of this childhood to become the world’s leading graphic designer – provides a strong, relatable storyline that anchors the film. Inspired by Montreal’s Expo 67, Mau embarked on a long design career. His list of accomplishments is singularly impressive, from the seminal book S,M,L,XL that Mau designed in close collaboration with Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to the iconic graphic identity for Zone Books. Eventually expanding his scope to all types of design, he was enlisted by brands like MTV and Disney. For Coca-Cola, Mau helped reimagine what corporate responsibility might mean for a corporation viewed by many as part of the problem. He is credited by their leadership as helping spark a new way of thinking with their organization. When Mau was asked to reimagine the Muslim holy city of Mecca, he responded to the project brief with his own: Let’s not design for the next ten years, let’s design for the next 1,000 years. Not everyone could think through these huge design problems. The film is fun and easy to watch with an upbeat tone and pacing that matches Mau’s likable energy and what he calls “fact-based optimism”. He urges viewers to ignore the media’s negativity, instead focusing on the myriad ways in which people are collaborating across borders, religions and languages. “When things are bad and getting worse, people do what makes sense. They behave selfishly. They close the border, they lock the doors. When people see that we are investing in the future, they behave in the opposite way, they come out, they contribute, they want to be in.” The message of being positive and optimistic is extremely refreshing and important today, especially in the face of algorithmic filter bubbles of outrage and doomscrolling that have turned many to pessimism, including large swaths of the creative class. “If you are a designer, your responsibility is to inspire people. We can’t make people go, we can only inspire them,” Mau says in the film. “You cannot make them do new things. The way we will change the world is by leadership, by design, by inspiration.” The film plays another vital role: laying bare and revealing the paradoxes of the way design is sold to the public. In the film, a who’s who of design’s leading public speakers give effusive praise for Mau, bordering on advertisement – often without specificity. In a culture of WeWork-style salesmanship and a design media that repeats even the most absurd claims about design’s effects, the messaging around design’s possibilities often veers into out-of-touch paternalism from a small group of elites. The film at times falls into this trap, which distracts from Mau’s real talents and tangible, remarkable successes. It also raises real questions about how the public can buy into big ideas about how to improve society through design. Nonetheless, the positivity and optimism Mau espouses is much needed today, and the film captures this spirit. The message is simple: you have to design the world the way you want it, whether rethinking an entire country, or simply designing the life you want. While not everyone has the luxury to “only work on what you love”, we all have – to some degree – the ability to choose our own path. Whether for changing our own lives or the collective buy-in to solve the world’s biggest problems, design can be applied to everything. Mau connects the dots in an entertaining portrait of a generational talent who has perfected the craft of design. Mau is released in US cinemas on 13 May with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,Bruce Mau: the world-class designer whose work continues to endure,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/bruce-mau-the-world-class-designer-whose-work-continues-to-endure
5/12/2022,"A missing photograph of a prisoner, which should have been marked “GB2”, has dominated evidence in Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial on Thursday, with allegations before the federal court that “GB2” was a terrified captive teenage boy shot in the head by Roberts-Smith. A retired SAS comrade, anonymised before the court as Person 11, has been called by Roberts-Smith to give evidence in his defamation action against three Australian newspapers, whom he says defamed him in a series of reports that alleged he committed war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. On his third day in the witness box, the questioning of Person 11, a close friend of Roberts-Smith’s, focused on a November 2012 SAS mission to Fasil, in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province. Under cross-examination, Person 11 was shown photographs of three prisoners, allegedly taken from a Toyota Hilux ute interdicted by Australian troops on a road through the village. The prisoners – known as Pucs for “person under control” – have tape on the back of their clothing giving details on where they were arrested including VEH for “vehicle”, RD for “road”, and, on one man’s tape, “driver”. The three men are marked with the callsign of the soldiers who detained them – Gothic Bravo. The men are marked GB1, GB3, GB4. Their photographs – front and back – were taken at the Australian base at Tarin Kowt. Person 11 told the court he did not recognise the men in the pictures. Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, told the court there was “no picture of GB2 in existence”, because the second prisoner detained from the Hilux never made it to the Australian base. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Owens showed Person 11 a photograph of a young Afghan man who had been shot dead, his body lying next to an AK47. Person 11 said he had never seen the young man alive, nor did he recognise the photograph of his body. Owens put it to Person 11 that the young man was GB2, and that he had been pulled from the car by Australian soldiers, detained, and handed over to Person 11 and Roberts-Smith during the raid on Fasil. “Mr Owens I don’t recognise these individuals nor do I recall having Pucs handed over to me,” Person 11 replied. Owens alleged the young man was taken into a compound by Roberts-Smith, who then shot the man with his pistol. “I reject that, Mr Owens.” Owens said: “I want to put it to you that the reason there is no photograph of the second Puc from Gothic Bravo is that he was murdered by Mr Roberts-Smith in the compound.” Person 11: “I disagree with that.” Owens said the AK47 next to the young man’s body was a “throw-down”: a piece of compromising equipment placed on or near the body of a deceased person as a post-facto justification for an illegitimate killing. Person 11 denied Australian troops ever engaged in the practice of using throw-downs. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the allegation he murdered a young prisoner at Fasil. Giving evidence last year, he told the court the account was “baseless”, and the event could not have happened because he never fired his pistol in combat in Afghanistan. “I never had to engage with my pistol,” he said. Roberts-Smith also rejected assertions he used “throw-downs”. He maintained all of his actions in Afghanistan abided with the Australian troops’ rules of engagement, and the Geneva conventions. Another Australian soldier on the Fasil mission has earlier given evidence in the newspapers defence that Roberts-Smith told him he had murdered the young man. Anonymised as Person 16, the soldier said he had arrested two of the four men inside the vehicle, including the young man. “I made him out to be late teens … not a fully beard, a bit chubby, and shaking in terror.” Person 16 told the court he handed the two prisoners over to Roberts-Smith, and about 15 minutes later, Roberts-Smith said over the troops’ radio network “two EKIA”. EKIA is an initialism for “enemy killed in action”. In the days after the mission, Person 16 said he saw Roberts-Smith at the SAS’s Camp Russell within Australia’s Tarin Kowt base, and asked him: “What happened to that young fella who was shaking like a leaf?” Roberts-Smith allegedly replied: “I shot that cunt in the head. Person 15 told me not to kill anyone on the last job. So I pulled out my 9mm, shot the cunt in the side of the head, blew his brains out. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” Roberts-Smith told the court the account was untrue and that the conversation never happened. In his opening address to the court last year, Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, described the Fasil allegation against Roberts-Smith as “beyond ridiculous” and “insane”. “It’s Colonel Kilgore on ice,” he said, referencing the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now. “While the three fighting-age males were arrested and taken to Tarin Kowt, the adolescent boy was released,” McClintock told the court. Person 11 has concluded his evidence. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Captive Afghan teenage boy allegedly shot in the head, Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/ben-roberts-smiths-brs-defamation-trial-hears-captive-afghan-teenage-boy-allegedly-shot-in-head
5/12/2022,"Queensland’s opposition has defended its support for a failed motion that called for transgender athletes to be barred from playing women’s sport. Katter’s Australian party state leader, Robbie Katter, introduced the motion in parliament on Tuesday, saying the call to ban trans athletes from women’s sport was about protecting “women’s rights”. The motion was voted down after it failed to win support from Labor or the Greens. However, it was backed by all members of the Liberal National party, along with members of KAP and One Nation. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, said he didn’t believe it was fair for trans women to participate in women’s sport. “I don’t believe it’s a fair contest. And I think in sport, you want a fair contest, and I think that’s fair and reasonable,” Crisafulli said. “There’s nothing in that motion that I think Queenslanders will be overly uncomfortable with.” Despite his party’s support for the bill, Crisafulli said the issue was not his “priority” or something he’d move a motion about. “If you’re asking me whether or not it’s my priority, it doesn’t fit into the economy, service, delivery or transparency,” he told reporters. The KAP and LNP were criticised by the Labor government and the Greens over their support for the motion. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The sports minister, Stirling Hinchliffe, said the bill was centred on an “extreme rightwing trope” and accused the KAP of attempting “to cause fear and division”. “I’m surprised … [the KAP is] using the relatively rare private member’s motion opportunity on this issue, rather than something more relevant to Queensland,” he said in parliament on Wednesday. “The Palaszczuk government has been supportive of funding these core issues of women in sport, however … it’s not the role of the state to determine who can and cannot play sport based on any factor, including gender.” The Greens member for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, said the motion was “completely unnecessary” and labelled it “disgusting, conservative dog-whistling politics”. “I think it is telling that we are hearing not a single word from the opposition to speak against it,” he told parliament. Berkman’s Greens party colleague, South Brisbane MP Amy MacMahon, said the motion was not about women’s rights, but about misogyny. “Sports is for everyone,” she told parliament. “I’ve been a consistent critic of the [2032] Olympics as a big waste of money … but one bright spark would be Brisbane committed to being the most trans-inclusive games in history, welcoming trans athletes with open arms.” Matilda Alexander, patron of the LGBTI legal service, said “any motion to promote discrimination … is irresponsible and has the potential to divide and harm vulnerable people in our community”. She said debates about trans women that are playing out in Queensland and during the federal election campaign are “incredibly damaging” to LGBTQ+ communities. “The harm that has been done to the trans community just by raising these issues … is immeasurable,” Alexander told Guardian Australia. “Every time this becomes a matter of national debate, rather than a matter of national acceptance of people’s human rights, it traumatises.” A fact sheet published by ACON’s TransHub says there is no consistent research that suggests trans or non-binary people have any athletic advantage. It also notes that the Sex Discrimination Act already allows “sport organisations to exclude trans athletes on a case-by-case basis on matters of strength, stamina and physique.” “Women’s sport, and increasing the participation of all women in sport, is essential, important and should be protected,” the ACON fact sheet says. “Trans women have been competing openly in the Olympics since 2004 and women’s sport continues to grow and thrive.” Guardian Australia has contacted opposition leader David Crisafulli for comment.",News/Australia news,LNP defends its support for a call to ban trans athletes from women’s sports in Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/lnp-defends-its-support-for-a-call-to-ban-trans-athletes-from-womens-sports-in-queensland
