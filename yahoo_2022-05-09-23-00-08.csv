5/9/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that he was in favour of a new type of ""political European community"" that would allow countries outside the European Union, including Ukraine and Britain, to join the ""European core values."" Speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Macron called his re-election last month a signal that the French had wanted more Europe. But he made clear that Ukraine's desire to join the bloc would take several years and as a result needed to be given some hope in the short-term. ""Ukraine by its fight and its courage is already a heartfelt member of our Europe, of our family, of our union,"" Macron said. ""Even if we grant it candidate status tomorrow, we all know perfectly well that the process to allow it to join would take several years indeed, probably several decades."" Rather than bringing down stringent standards to allow countries to join more quickly, Macron suggested creating a parallel entity that could appeal to countries who aspired to join the bloc or, in an apparent reference to Britain, countries which had left the union. He said this ""European political community"" would be open to democratic European nations adhering to its core values in areas such as political cooperation, security, cooperation in energy, transport, investment of infrastructure or circulation of people. ""Joining it would not necessarily prejudge future EU membership,"" he said. ""Nor would it be closed to those who left it.""

5/9/2022,"Held annually without fail since 1875, the Kentucky Derby is the oldest continuously run sporting event in America. Set to take place on May 7, the most famous horse race in the entire world means different things to different people. To some, the day is about tradition and history. To others, it’s about gambling and the thrill of the race itself. To others, the moment is all about mint juleps and big hats. Find: 22 Side Gigs That Can Make You Richer Than a Full-Time Job
2022 Stimulus Checks: Is Your State Giving Out Money This Year? To the rich people who own the four-legged contestants, however, the Kentucky Derby is all about the prospect of getting even richer. A trip to the winner’s circle earns owners a traditional wreath made of roses, a gold trophy and an etching of their names in history — but it also adds seven figures to their stacks. In 2022, the total purse is $3 million, and the 3-year-old Thoroughbred that comes in first at Churchill Downs in Louisville will earn its owner $1.86 million of that haul — and that’s just one race. Here’s a look at what the winners from Kentucky Derbys past have earned their owners dating back to 1930, and what those winnings would look like when adjusted for inflation into 2022 dollars.
