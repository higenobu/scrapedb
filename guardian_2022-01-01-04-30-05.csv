1/1/2022,"In March 2020, as the Covid pandemic took hold, the language learning app Duolingo reported double its usual number of sign-ups. Stuck inside under lockdown orders, people had time on their hands and were looking for ways to occupy it. It wasn’t long before I joined its 500 million users in an attempt to recapture the feeling of learning Portuguese during three months spent in Brazil several years ago: that heady thrill of realising I had conveyed the meaning I meant to, the strange alchemy of suddenly understanding what people around me were saying. Could an app give me that?  Ninety days, hundreds of new words and plenty of lessons, “crowns” and “streaks” later, it didn’t feel like it. Was the app teaching me anything at all? Entering 2022 with renewed enthusiasm to learn the language, I decided to see what the experts say. Ingrid Piller, a linguistics expert at Macquarie University, says the process of picking up a new language can feel mysterious because there are several elements going on at the same time. These can be divided into the linguistic and the social. On the linguistic side, you must learn new words, grammatical structures and pronunciation. If you are taking up a language as an intellectual exercise, or so you know how to order a meal on a trip to Paris, apps are really useful. But if you want to converse and impart meaning, then that’s where things get difficult. “Language is about interacting with other people, it’s not something we do alone,” Piller says. “The really big challenge of language learning is actually for our minds to bring all these elements together creatively and make decisions [in the moment]: how do I pronounce this? What kind of words do I choose? And how do I put these together in a grammatically correct sentence, or in larger chunks that produce conversations?” An app can help you with the linguistic, but not the social. And because apps such as Duolingo borrow elements from gaming, they are pretty good at teaching you those building blocks. During lockdown, I spent about 15 minutes a day doing lessons and quizzes, and perfecting my pronunciation of my favourite phrase in Portuguese, “a gente” (we) – it just sounds good! But the more you want to learn, the more diverse your language learning should be, Piller says. You might take classes, watch videos and read Twitter in the other language, while keeping the app as a useful tool on the side. “You get achievement points for logging in every day and unlocking the next level. Some apps do this better than others, but the gamification element is really important in keeping people glued to the screen,” Piller says. Using the app regularly will give you better results than doing a 20-hour language course over a semester, but then nothing for three months. It’s all about consistency. But the dopamine hit I got from the gaming elements in the app wasn’t the same as the thrill I got from booking a table in a restaurant over the phone in Portuguese. There is something vulnerable about learning a language; you have to overcome your fear of sounding stupid. And that’s where true achievement lies – in taking a risk to connect and being understood. An app has none of that social peril – it’s safe, and therefore slightly empty. “We come to think about all kinds of achievement in this metricised way,” Piller says. “[Apps] give us a metric sense of achievement, but it’s a quantity without a quality.” Just as social media apps provide a vehicle for connection, but not connection itself, the magic of language learning happens in the world, not on the screen. And it is a kind of magic. While I was in Brazil, I met a guy who told me he and his girlfriend would sometimes go on dates where they only conversed in English. He said it felt like they were different people discovering each other anew. It’s a comforting thought at a time when travelling overseas is so difficult – the idea that our worlds are created through language, and with a new language we can recreate our familiar worlds afresh.",News/Technology,People flocked to language apps during the pandemic – but how much can they actually teach you? | Shelley Hepworth,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2022/jan/01/people-flocked-to-language-apps-during-the-pandemic-but-how-much-can-they-actually-teach-you
1/1/2022,"Ajuicy watermelon is made to sound like cunnilingus while banana and rockmelon make a potent visual and aural connection. Director Sheridan Harbridge wryly recalls the early challenges of using fresh produce to simulate sex on stage: “How do you find a classy way to smack fruit together?” In a new production of “apocalyptic romcom” 44 Sex Acts in One Week, written by playwright David Finnigan, the humble tomato makes its debut “to simulate the sound of a jade yoni egg going into my vagina”, reveals Rebecca Massey, who plays both sex coach author Malaine Gutierrez and Devil Wears Prada-style editor Irene Gamerman.  Using fruit on stage as a live radio play is “messy, so messy”, muses Harbridge. “How do you protect the actors and the audience from so much fruit and juice and stickiness? We’ve had to get a really good sound artist in to control the chaos. The traffic and placement of props has become more important than the dialogue.” Centred in this den of steaminess, Emma Harvey plays clickbait blogger Celina Valderrama who, desperate to avoid being fired, offers to review and perform all the acts in Gutierrez’s new how-to sex manual. Lowbrow meets highbrow as an ecological crisis and a pandemic hit, presciently part of a script written well before Covid-19 emerged in the world’s consciousness. Finnigan, who previously wrote the controversial stage and radio play Kill Climate Deniers, says of 44 Sex Acts and its satire of the wellness boom: “It’s an extremely smutty piece but it’s got a playful edge. There is a lot suggested and they’ve [Massey and Harbridge] found this brilliant technique that allows them to go big.” The best-laid ambitions butted against coronavirus, however. Massey and Harbridge, who appeared together in Kill Climate Deniers at Griffin Theatre in 2018, had formed their own production company, Moonshine & Tits, later sensibly rebranded as Club House Productions, with the aim of mounting works that could respond quickly to the cultural and political zeitgeist. When the pandemic closed theatres in 2020, they wanted to record Finnigan’s new script as a radio play, complete with foley and fruit-sex sound effects (Harbridge’s idea). Optimistically, 44 Sex Acts was shifted to the stage after Sydney theatres first reopened, with the fruit sounds to be made in front of audiences. Then, the trouble started: a lockdown shuttered 44 Sex Acts at Belvoir St theatre after just three performances in December 2020. State border closures cancelled a Brisbane festival season at the Brisbane Powerhouse in September 2021. Likewise, the pandemic again struck out a planned return season for Belvoir’s Festival of Everything that same month. The pair clung to their bananas and carried on. They programmed the play for Sydney festival in 2022 because they were “deranged by then”, says Harbridge, laughing. “Not from being wise, or resilient, it was just too late to turn back.” Massey recalls thinking: “Fuck this, we’ll go big.” Finnigan has since tweaked the script, and the staging “this time is really using the space fully”, says Harbridge. Understudies are lined up in case any performers are forced to drop out, and there are unconfirmed plans to tour the work, where borders permit. In a déjà vu piece of Covid-19 intimate bubble casting, Harvey’s blogger character Celina enlists a man, Alab Delusa, played by Harvey’s partner in real life, Matthew Hardie, to help perform the 44 sex acts, ranging from bondage and discipline to orgy participation. This use of real-life acting partners as sex experimenters recalls the earlier production, when Harbridge herself played Celina, with Harbridge’s own partner, Michael Whalley, playing Alab Delusa (Whalley has since returned to Melbourne to continue playing Ron Weasley in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child). There is also a “B story” in the play involving mosquitoes and frogs, says Massey, which is going to be “looped” with sound effects of water. But the fruit is the real star: both on stage and in her own life, Massey walks around supermarkets “banging things and stroking them to see what sort of noise they make”. Touch fruit, this new Sydney festival season will be the first time that playwright Finnigan has seen 44 Sex Acts in One Week performed on stage. This time last year he was stuck in London as international borders closed. Finnigan still has his sights on lancing the US$1.5tn wellness market and on the “big boom of people seeking alternative sexuality resources” and the “whole lot of grifters who have moved in to sell everything you can think of with no qualification needed”. “If you need a selenite cleansing disc for your jade yoni egg at a DIY vaginal steaming kiosk, you can get that at the drop of a hat,” he says. “The wellness industry now has this frightening political edge to it. Perhaps it always had. These obsessions with getting back to ‘primitive humanity’, there’s a lot of stuff entailed in that. “You get further into the world of these motivational sex gurus, who are teaching you how to ‘cure your cancer with mindful masturbation’. “I don’t know what the ethics are there, but it seems questionable.” 44 Sex Acts in One Week is at the York theatre, Seymour Centre, from 12 to 16 January as part of Sydney festival",Arts/Culture,"Orgies, BDSM and smacking fruit: the ‘smutty’ play recreating 44 Sex Acts in One Week",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/01/orgies-bdsm-and-smacking-fruit-the-smutty-play-recreating-44-sex-acts-in-one-week
1/1/2022,"One of the best things about returning to the office is all the incidental steps involved. I’m not a natural gym dweller – I just hate the places – so to keep my body moving in our sedentary modern lives I have to walk. My way to do enough walking to make up for the lack of other exercise (other than yoga) is to get off the bus or train one or two (maybe three on a good day) stops before my destination and walk the rest of the way.  I’ve been doing this for more than 15 years, so I can safely say it works in keeping my weight down, spirits up (mostly) and muscles toned (enough for me). And it gets addictive, especially if you have an Apple watch, or a Fitbit or some other step counter. When we go back to the office, I’ll be walking 2km from the bus stop to my desk every morning and afternoon. In the morning, it’s a good opportunity to listen to RN Breakfast (what will I do without Fran Kelly?) and in the evening, it’s all about walking the work off and de-stressing. I might listen to a podcast, convince a colleague to walk with me, catch up on family phone calls or just notice the city around me. It can get a bit sweaty in Sydney summers but I just do it in gym gear and get changed at work. It’s a big chunk of my daily move target and I don’t even notice doing it. My only tip is to start slow and build a routine. If you’re not a morning person, just start out doing it after work. Pretty soon, you won’t even think about your old stop.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: shorten the commute, walk off the weight and lift the spirits",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/easy-wins-shorten-the-commute-walk-off-the-weight-and-lift-the-spirits
1/1/2022,"A retreating ocean is often the first sign of a tsunami. The water along the shoreline is dragged back dramatically, exposing parts of the shore and seabed that are normally underwater. It’s helpful to frame the first two years of the pandemic in similar terms to this ocean drawback. Detaching from our own specific circumstances, and our own specific pandemic pain, we have a unique opportunity to actually see the metaphorical seafloor of the world.  Exposed by the pandemic were the often invisible systems that organise our society. These systems are comprised of everything from the expectations of ongoing and unlimited growth via the systems of capitalism and globalisation, to the systems of class, systemic racism and patriarchy, to the more localised systems of government and public service, to the social systems of the nuclear family and individuals, and how our communities, cities, households and green spaces are organised. Also exposed in the drawback of two pandemic years has been our internal seafloor – that of our own psyches. We got to see what we are made of, with previously unimaginable circumstances creating a chance to really test ourselves, see where we fracture and where we are strong. Just like a tsunami, we can expect further devastation to come. But this exposure of our systems could also show us how to rebuild stronger. So what did we see when the virus exposed what’s underpinning our lives and our very selves? And what will we do with this newfound clarity? Economics writer George Megalogenis wrote that the “wicked genius” of Covid was to seek out where the holes and gaps were in our open economic model. In his Quarterly Essay titled Exit strategy: politics after the pandemic, Megalogenis identified that the weak points in Australia’s pandemic response were in the areas that the government had privatised. “Covid says ‘You’ve left me a gap in your safety net – I’ll start killing’,” he told Richard Glover’s Conversations in 2021. “Australian privatisation was where the weak points were. The commonwealth contracts everything out in aged care” and “the damage done last year in Victoria was when the virus got out of hotel quarantine – also staffed by contract workers including security guards and cleaners who were under trained, underpaid and unaccountable.” But at least until Omicron came along in the final weeks of 2021 – apart from a few notable exceptions including the slow vaccine rollout, the privatisation of aged care and hotel quarantine and lack of support for the university sector and the arts – Australia’s government systems turned out to be robust enough to largely protect the population and the economy. Australia suffered a relatively low death and infection rate compared with the rest of the world, due to border closures and a high level of compliance with lockdowns. And the economy was spared the worst, largely due to the Jobkeeper and Jobseeker schemes. The approach of the federal government (and its NSW counterpart) has changed in response to the rapid emergence of the Omicron variant, stressing the “personal responsibility” of citizens and dramatically changing requirements for testing and isolation – with as yet unknown consequences. But in the initial waves of infection in 2020, according to the ABS, if “Australia had experienced the same crude case and death rates as three comparable countries – Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom – there would have been between 680,000 and 2 million cases instead of the 28,500 that did occur, and between 15 and 46 times the number of deaths”. Still, the pain was not evenly distributed. While wealthier, white-collar workers were able to work from home (and during lockdown have access to more green spaces and beaches), the brunt of exposure to the virus was found in more working-class jobs such as manufacturing, in insecure work such as food delivery and the gig economy, and in migrant and female-dominated care work, especially in the so-called “LGAs of concern”. Healthcare staff have been quitting in record numbers – due to illness, stress and burnout – and the majority of them are women. According to the Grattan Institute, women also bore the brunt of the economic and psychological impact of the virus, and their lifetime economic disadvantage will be compounded. According to a report by Australian Unions, “government responses have not adequately addressed the way the Covid-19 crisis is reproducing and deepening existing structural inequality faced by women, and intensifying work and family pressures. In many ways, government policies have made it worse.” Then there is the looming “shadow pandemic” of worsening mental health outcomes. During lockdowns, suicide rates were down but self-harm increased, particularly in young people. This does not bode well for a mental health system that was already under pressure. Two years in, despite this mess at the crossroads of capitalism, gender, class, intergenerational disadvantage, race and work, we have not moved to fix the systems that underpin inequality. On a more personal level, the pandemic revealed the limitations of the nuclear family – and the need for a “village”. Healthy families need other people around to help – friends, aunts and uncles, teachers, grandparents and neighbours. Part of what was exposed on the seabed was the necessity of communities and personal support systems to stay connected to families, and acknowledgment in a person’s workplace of the whole load an employee might be carrying in their life – not just in their work. Work bled deeply into domestic life and domestic spaces, much more work fell to women, parents found it impossible to work and supervise schooling at the same time, and many families felt overwhelmed and marooned without access to the village. And then there’s the even more personal reckoning – a glimpse at our own psyches. Were we resilient? Calm? Kind? Or fearful and fretful? The great Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: “Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.” And so it was here. The past two years have shown us what we are made of – and provided to us the sort of character test that only usually comes round with world wars and depressions. While countries such as America are experiencing high levels of public rage and anger, over everything from mask mandates to slow service in restaurants, in Australia the rage hasn’t been as marked, although it has been there in anti-lockdown protests and in our shops. Australia’s low level of mortality and relatively high level of compliance with lockdown rules – particularly in 2020 – are probably connected. There was the sense of caring for the stranger and not wanting to do something to endanger people in your community. This sense of cohesion bodes well for a healthy society – it’s something hopeful to hang on to. So what will we do with our newfound clarity? Seeing the truth of one’s own lives laid bare by the pandemic will no doubt prompt some to reorganise. And there’s a certain amount we can reorganise in our own lives. Maybe you have already started remaking things that were revealed during the pandemic to be broken. Friendships that were revealed to be too one-sided or unfulfilling may have been jettisoned, marriages and relationships ended, jobs quit, fitness regimes embarked on, cities swapped for the coast or country. Maybe the pandemic accelerated what was always going to happen. Or maybe it gave you a nudge of the carpe diem kind, or maybe the unique pressures of lockdowns broke the back of things that would otherwise have drifted along for decades to come – intact mostly, but never really stress-tested. Changing these elements that make up our lives – our friends, our partner, our job, family, our health and fitness, the place where we live – seems big. It’s remaking our lives. Swapping Larry for Barry, Bondi for Berry, making sales for making soap, while enormous within the unit of one life, is not grand stuff that alters the course of human history. What’s needed are systemic shifts that lead to a reorganisation of society that can better absorb large shocks – and to support each other through those shockwaves. It’s ground-up stuff. The pandemic began in Australia in March 2020 – but for me, it will be forever linked with something that started earlier. November 2019 and the skies were red and full of ash. We all wore masks that summer … just a different sort. The past two years and the things we’ve seen have given us a taste of the radical planetary reorganisation that will need to occur when the climate crisis really bares its teeth. Like all painful experiences, once this chapter of the pandemic is over, we will want to forget. With all our lovely distractions back – bars and restaurants and gyms and hairdressers – we can paste over the issues all of us have with our set-ups and our systems. We think a move to the country – our own personal revolution – is change enough. But of course it is not. We have seen the bottom of the seafloor in all its ugliness, beauty and degradation. Such clarity is a dark gift. The real work is ahead.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The pandemic has allowed us to see so much.

1/1/2022,"Critically understaffed public hospitals in New South Wales are planning to fly in nurses from overseas, a leaked memo reveals, as managers beg staff to cancel leave and take on extra shifts amid surging Covid cases. It comes as a state health policy change will allow health workers who are close contacts to be recalled to their jobs, the Guardian understands, before completing their seven-day isolation period, if they are considered essential. More than 2,000 health workers are currently isolating due to Covid exposure.  At St George hospital in Sydney’s south, the burden of increased hospital presentations and isolation orders was laid bare in a grim end-of-year email sent to all nursing staff, pleading for them to cancel leave. The internal email, obtained by Guardian Australia, warns the hospital “can’t seem to keep up with the exposures and positive staff”, despite concerted efforts to source nurses. “We have commenced the process for overseas recruitment,” the email stated. The last resort had been taken after managers approached more than seven local nursing and midwifery labour agencies, an effort which yielded just one additional registered nurse. Additionally, the hospital had approached private hospitals for workers and pulled back secondments, but had not been able to staff its wards sufficiently. “Across the facility, the patients numbers in the departments are unprecedented,” the email stated, noting the hospital had been forced to reopen its second Covid ward again. “It doesn’t really seem quite right to be wishing a happy new year,” the email said. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary, Brett Holmes, said hospitals were going to “extraordinary lengths” and managers were “turning themselves inside out trying to find staff”. “Overseas recruitment is a glimmer of hope right now,” he said.

Guardian Australia has seen an email sent to St Vincent’s staff pleading for nurses to work shifts on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, offering a $250 bonus on top of usual penalties as an incentive to work. The offer was extended for nurses in admin roles. “Our current staffing vacancies in nursing is unprecedented and at crisis level,” the email said. The internal email also explained the hospital was “changing our model of care” to focus on emergency department presentations and ICU patients in the first instance. The email urged any nurses who had patients who could be suitable for discharge to do so as soon as possible. Guardian Australia has also been told of concerning staffing ratios in the emergency department at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in inner-Sydney, as well as at various hospitals across the city. On Friday, NSW’s Covid outbreak became one of the fastest growing in the world, with daily cases almost doubling to 21,151 on New Year’s Eve. Six people died with Covid. Hospitalisations in NSW grew to 832 on Friday, having more than doubled in the week since 382 were in hospitals the previous Friday. Intensive care hospitalisations were rising steadily, with 69 people in ICU beds – 39 of whom were unvaccinated. A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Sydney local health district confirmed it had “approached several nursing agencies to recruit additional staff to join our healthcare team”, and that it was “standard practice” for an LHD to organise its own staffing, including choosing to recruit internationally. Earlier, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, claimed his state’s health system “remains strong”, and said the national close contact definition changes agreed to on Thursday would “put downward pressure in that space”. “We have the best health system in the country, arguably the best in the world, and that is because of years of investment,” he said. “We’ve seen a significant increase in case numbers, but what is pleasing is that our health system remains strong,” Perrottet said. However, Holmes said union members were “copping abuse” because patients were presenting to hospital expecting a smoother experience because of how Perrottet was describing hospital pressure. “Patients and family members are presenting to hospital expecting a robust, high-functioning health system and become extremely agitated when they experience the widespread staffing crisis first-hand,” he said. “Our members want the NSW premier and health minister to admit the current situation in our hospitals is dire and call on the public not to abuse health staff as the system struggles under increased demand,” Holmes said. When asked by Guardian Australia how current pressures in NSW hospitals compared with the worst of the Delta outbreak, Holmes said “I think it’s there now”, noting that during lockdown, presentations for illnesses from car accidents and other life events diminished, but were occurring now.0 “We’re now fully open, all of those normal everyday presentations are still occurring, and yet we’re still seeing large numbers of patients coming into the health system with Covid – as a result of this government’s decision to let it rip,” Holmes said. Holmes said the current issues in hospitals were a combination of a surge in Covid cases, combined with Covid exposures forcing staff into isolation. “Our members are going above and beyond, shift after shift. Despite everything that is being thrown their way. Enough is enough. The government cannot continue piling more upon nurses and midwives and ignore the conditions they are dealing with.” The chief health officer, Kerry Chant, noted that while hospitalisations had more than doubled in a week, some of those recorded in the hospitalisation figure were in hospital for other reasons, and that this phenomenon was occurring given the extent of the spread of Omicron. The NSW Ambulance commissioner, Dominic Morgan, also appeared at the premier’s Covid update on Friday and warned residents, even those who are Covid-positive, to reserve calling 000 for serious symptoms and illness. He said one in three people who called ambulances currently were not deemed high enough priority for transport to hospital, and said people calling for PCR results and other non-emergencies “tie up our emergency medical call takers and divert us away from the cardiac arrests, the chokings, the drownings”.

1/1/2022,"Leading health bodies are urging the federal government to defer “mayhem” changes to Medicare Benefits Schedule telehealth arrangements that would hit vulnerable patients as Covid cases surge. The changes, due to come into effect on 1 January, will restrict phone consultations for a long list of specialist items in favour of video conferencing or face-to-face appointments.  The Clinical Oncology Society of Australia (COSA) president and medical oncologist, Prof Fran Boyle, said the timing of the changes was “appalling” considering the dramatic increases in Covid cases across the nation. She said the changes to MBS item numbers, intended to help people with cancer and other illnesses, would limit access to care for vulnerable demographics, particularly in remote areas. Telehealth services were dramatically expanded as a temporary Covid measure in March last year, to reduce community transmission and protect patients and health care providers. Pre-Covid, telehealth was used in a limited way for people living in rural and remote areas to access specialists via video conferencing facilities at health centres. On 13 December, the Department of Health announced $106m would be provided over four years to support continuing telehealth services as a permanent fixture in the Australian health system, a move broadly welcomed by health bodies. Days later, it was announced 128 telehealth items would end from the new year on the recommendation of the MBS Review Taskforce. Boyle said she only became aware of the changes two weeks out when they were publicly released. “They made their own quiet plan,” she said. She said most of her patients would be “hit like a hammer” when the changes came into effect. “Most people have no clue it’s about to happen,” she said. “We will have to reorganise a week of patients, which is a stress they don’t need. “It looks like they’re giving everybody something – you can keep telehealth as a specialist service without a distance requirement, but only if it’s done by video. “What’s going to be a major problem for patients this coming week is the phone consultations will no longer have the medicare item number they’d be expecting from the last year.” Boyle said “overwhelmingly” patients took up phone consultations as video added a “layer of complexity” and wasn’t an option for many – notably older people and others with limited access to technology and reliable internet in regional and rural Australia. And, with cases doubling in NSW almost every day, she said patients would be “very worried” about coming back into clinics. “They had only just started getting back their confidence,” Boyle said. “I can bet you they won’t want to next week and we won’t want them to either. The people in the country who are still the most vulnerable to Covid are people with cancer, because they really struggle to get immunity even with two or three vaccines. “It was an OK plan if there was no virus and it was business as usual, but business cannot be usual for cancer patients. These people are anxious enough already about their own vulnerability, the timing couldn’t be worse.” Boyle said the one item remaining for phone consultations with cancer specialists – a “rarely used” item number for brief conversations with a patient you already knew – was a “small concession”. “Sometimes a backflip is required and I’m pretty sure they know how to do that now,” Boyle said.

That’s certainly not transpired.” Khorshid said the AMA had been in negotiation with the federal government for a “long time” and had been supportive of access to phone items, while the health department had been “very much of the mind” they should be limited. “Presumably with concern they’ll cost more money,” he said. “We’ve made it very clear by removing phone items you’re creating inequity in the community. “People least able to access videoconferencing are often people with the most health needs – rural and elderly Australians. “Patients will have almost no awareness, it’s very little notice and very much last minute.” Cancer Australia data indicates only 2% to 5% of monthly specialist services were delivered by telehealth video call in the first part of 2020, compared with 10% to 24% via phone. A recent study on patient satisfaction with telehealth consultations similarly found patients undergoing phone appointments were more likely to continue with the service than those who used videoconferencing. The lead researcher Dr Andrew Parsonson said lack of infrastructure and technical difficulties with the videoconferencing technology may have been key barriers to overcome the scaled implementation of consultations via video. Rare Cancers Australia, a consumer advocate group, said it was also “deeply concerned” about the restrictions of telephone consults. “Cancer disproportionately impacts older Australians who are not as technically proficient as younger patients,” chief executive Richard Vines said. “Denying them access to telephone consultation is heartless. “The video conferencing facilities currently available at some of the major cancer centres are neither reliable nor intuitive. On each of the last four occasions when my wife has attempted remote consultation we have needed to revert to the telephone for effective communication.” Breast Cancer Network Australia said it was “too soon” to remove telehealth items from the MBS and called on the federal government to defer the changes as Covid cases place increased pressure on the health system. The network’s director of policy, advocacy and member support, Vicki Durston, requested a deferral to the changes to provide more time for clinicians and consumers to have a “seat at the table” to inform decisions that affect cancer care. “This is of particular concern to our network of people with breast cancer who have relied heavily on telehealth over the past two years for their treatment and follow-up care,” she said.

1/1/2022,"On days like these, as the calendar ticks around, as we link hands and sing of our joy at being one notch further on the doomsday clock, it is customary to talk about hopes for the future and life lessons learned from the last 12 months of kicking balls, running around tracks, driving fast cars and all the rest. Except of course, there are no actual lessons to be learned from professional sport, which is basically lighted shapes moving on a screen, digital celebrity worship, a confusion of desires coopted into a pay-per-view entertainment product.  Perhaps at if we dig a little deeper and adopt a twinkly, world-weary frown, we might say the only lesson to be drawn from sport is that there are no lessons, that what really matters is, you know, the friends we made along the way, the show, the harmless distraction. Which is fine, but it doesn’t explain why nobody really thinks that, and why we are all still so violently addicted to this, splayed on our backs like dying woodlice, maws crammed with 24-hour rolling hot opinion-substance, big match acton live-streamed to the inside of your eyelids. Or why so much energy is expended on picking shapes and stories out of that confusion, anointing heroes and castigating villains, like dogs barking at the skies. All of which is a flowery and circuitous way of (1) avoiding another folksy review of the year; and (2) getting on to the strange fate of Bruno Fernandes, whose up and down year has been capped by a particularly strange week. Welcome to the ballad of Bruno. This is a footballer who spent the first half of 2021 as a Ballon d’Or candidate, team leader and exemplar of dressing-room standards. Last January Manchester United were top of the league and Fernandes was the best player in the country, mining his own rich seam of goals and assists, “demanding more” from those around him and creating a sense of life and purpose in the Solskjær bubble. Fast forward to Thursday night and Fernandes missed the win against Burnley having been booked (for whinging) against Newcastle. In the meantime a kind of opinion-creep has wheedled its way in, a digital wave of revisionism. With a whiplash sense of urgency, Fernandes has been fingered as something else: a whinge-bag, penalty fraud and general tactical misfit, perhaps even a dressing-room toxin, to be rooted out by the fearless hand of Ralf. This is of course a familiar process with the current United, a sporting institution so fraught with ghosts and ghouls, so frightened by its own shadow it has become a real time Murder On the Orient Express, a place where in the end everyone is guilty, everyone did it, and everyone must pay. Fernandes will survive this. He remains United’s most effective attacking player. But it is all a little wild, and pointlessly destructive. Gary Neville started the whinge-bag thing in his punditry spot during the Newcastle game. Neville is always brilliantly watchable, and clearly has his own inside track. But it is also a funny line coming from an ex-player whose own very successful career was basically powered by high-grade whinge-baggery, who spent 15 years propelling himself around the pitch with a full bladder of whinge cradled beneath each arm, the droning, screeching, whinge-piping soundtrack to the glories of Fergie-era United. Until a recent run of poor form the whinge-baggery of Fernandes was seen as an asset. Here is a man who will not accept mediocrity, who works like a demon and demands the best. So what changed? The most obvious problem is tactical. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjær the plan was simple. Basically, give it to Bruno. His job was to float in between the lines with three mobile runners ahead of him, to provide instant, high-risk forward passes or shoot himself. Bruno was the end point of every attack, his job simply to provide the final click of the hammer. Three things have interrupted this. First, Solskjær’s team dissolved, driven in part by a doomed urge to move on from this slightly linear style. Secondly Cristiano Ronaldo arrived, which changes everything, not just tactically, but culturally. An ambitious creative Portuguese footballer will always say playing with Ronaldo is a dream. In reality, and at this late stage, it’s a nightmare. That presence is too heavy, the gravity too strong. There is only room for one basking tactical nabob in a Ronaldo team. And he’s not going to be called Bruno. The third thing is the distinct blueprint of Ralf Rangnick, whose 4-2-2-2 system (or 4-4-2 on Thursday night) sees Fernandes pushed to the left of the attacking “box”, a different role that will require some grooving. He can make this work. Even Bad Bruno has burped up a load of goals and assists in the Champions League and made 44 chances from open play, more than anyone else in the Premier League. The problem as ever is the more generalised flux around him. Manchester United are particularly gruelling in this respect, a genuinely weird list of disconnected objects – Ronaldo, Harry Maguire, a swarm of bees, Donny Van De Beek, doomed romanticism, three slices of cheese – that will always become incoherent at times. And because football is a TV show, and TV shows need villains, it was always likely the great finger of blame would hover over the occasionally frustrating attacking player who isn’t called Cristiano. Even the small details count. Fernandes looks like a nag. His “body language” (really? This is a thing now?) can be hilariously terrible. He looks like the kind of person gets who really angry in a queue and cries when it’s his turn to be served. He looks like a comically frustrated high-end pastry chef. He looks like a touching cartoon kangaroo lost in the big city who just wants a friend. He also deserves a little more respect. The skinny kid who came in from the outside, who comes home from every game and watches it again in full, noting his own stats (which is, let’s face it, exactly what you or I would do) is also the best signing since Ferguson left the club. Those Peak Bruno times have been among the few moments of clarity, the closest United have looked to a more evolved entity, divorced from the past, the ghost train, the haunted house. Plus, one folksy end-of-year reflection: Fernandes was good in the dark times too, when crowds were absent, when things could have simply wound down into entropy, and when his hunger and his whinge-baggery really did seem to fill those lighted spaces. I went to a few of those games, and was always grateful for a bit of Bruno, who may have his own brittle edges, but who is quite clearly a part of the solution.",Sport/Football,Bruno Fernandes in danger of being swept away on digital wave of revisionism | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/31/bruno-fernandes-manchester-united-body-language-digital-revisionism
1/1/2022,"Two years after Boris Johnson made “levelling up” the lodestar of his new administration, the public still struggles to understand what the prime minister means by it. A new YouGov poll has found that half of those questioned either had no idea what the phrase signifies, or were not completely sure. The government’s flagship domestic policy resembles a ghost vessel drifting in a mist of Whitehall obfuscation and procrastination. After a torrid period, Mr Johnson badly needs this to change in the new year. However fuzzy the follow-through, the political logic of his original pledge to level up England remains crystal clear: as it seeks to hold together the new electoral coalition forged in the 2019 “Brexit election”, improving the situation and prospects of voters in the north and Midlands is fundamental to the government’s hopes of re-election. The pots of money distributed piecemeal via the various levelling-up funds – described as a “drop in the ocean” by the Centre for Cities thinktank – will not cut it. Having promised to restore pride, regenerate places and deliver economic growth in the “red wall”, a convincing plan is urgently required to demonstrate how this will be done. The indications are that this will not be forthcoming, partly for fear of antagonising voters in the more prosperous south.  The twice-delayed levelling-up white paper is now expected by the end of January, and briefings suggest its emphasis will be on devolution and the reform of local government throughout the country. The mayoral model is likely to be promoted beyond the city regions, and Cameron-era local enterprise partnerships may be targeted for replacement by more democratically accountable bodies. Given that the secretary of state for levelling up, Michael Gove, has been told by the Treasury that no more money is on offer, proposing to redistribute power instead carries an obvious attraction: it allows high-minded talk about community spirit and “trusting the people”, but comes without an expensive price tag. Sadly for Mr Gove and the prime minister, real empowerment cannot be delivered on the cheap. Levelling up regions and places that have been neglected for decades – and which bore the brunt of post-crash austerity – requires significant long-term investment in public services, improved infrastructure and a costly revolution in vocational education and adult retraining. Greater devolution is a praiseworthy goal in an overcentralised country where all roads (and high-speed rail lines) lead to London; but without the necessary resources, and significantly expanded local revenue-raising powers, it will amount to an abdication of strategic responsibility by the state. One recent study observed that the slashing of government grants to local authorities since 2010 hit “urban areas with a legacy of industrial job loss especially hard”. A proliferation of elected mayors across the country looks more like a distraction than a solution to the problems of postindustrial England. In a speech last summer, Mr Johnson took inspiration from the example of Germany’s efforts to narrow its east-west economic divide after reunification. But successive German governments spent €2tn reducing the gap, whereas Rishi Sunak has effectively capped the government’s main levelling-up fund at £4.8bn for this parliament. If the government will not draw the appropriate lessons from the German experience, the Labour party should spell them out: this amorphous agenda may have become an object of mockery, but what it does and does not deliver from now on will be crucial in deciding the outcome of the next election.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on levelling up: a flagship policy adrift and becalmed | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/31/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-a-flagship-policy-adrift-and-becalmed
