The closed-end fund has been fighting with Asset Value Investors and Staude Capital, which had been agitating for policy changes to address the fund’s wide trading discount to its assets. The fund invests in Loeb’s $20 billion flagship hedge fund. AVI’s Tom Treanor described Bates’s resignation as “unfortunate” and that an “overwhelming majority” of shareholders independent of the fund manager supported the activists. “We continue to believe this raises serious questions around governance at the company,” Treanor said in an emailed statement. During a recent meeting, one of the activists told Bates that they would attack him in other business areas if he refused to accept their proposals, according to the Third Point statement.
