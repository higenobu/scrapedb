1/1/2022,"CHESTERFIELD â€” County police have found the baby reportedly abused by his mother in a social-media video, but add the mom is still on the run. A police statement Friday said that the four-month-old son of Astrid Sanchez Diaz was located earlier in the day and is safe. Police Sgt. Winifred Lewis said the baby was turned over to a family member and is in their custody. As of 5 p.m. Friday, Lewis said, the mother has not been found. In the video, the 20-year-old Sanchez Diaz is alleged to be violently shaking her son while arguing with and threatening the child's father.
