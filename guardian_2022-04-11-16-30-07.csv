4/11/2022,"Heathrow says it is increasing resources as fast as possible, as March proved to be the busiest month for passengers at the UK’s biggest airport since the pandemic began. The west London airport, which is aiming to hire 12,000 staff to cope with an expected summer holiday boom, admitted that resources were “stretched” as a surge in bookings creates long delays over the Easter holiday period. “Following a very weak January and February, passenger numbers in March were the highest since the start of the pandemic, following the government’s removal of all travel restrictions, making the UK the first country in the world to do so,” the airport said. “The aviation sector has been rebuilding capacity ahead of a summer peak, so resources are stretched. Heathrow is working closely with airlines and ground handlers to make sure this increase in demand can be met while keeping passengers safe.” Last month Heathrow said that it was embarking on a recruitment drive to cope with a travel boom that would see some days at the airport return to almost pre-pandemic passenger levels. However, the airport said it would feel significantly busier because of additional pre-departure checks. “Half of global markets still require Covid checks including testing, vaccination status and quarantine, which is causing particular congestion in check-in areas at peak times,” the airport said in an update on Monday. “Heathrow is advising passengers to check with their airline to confirm when they should get to the airport. Other airport processes are currently working to plan and Heathrow is working with Border Force to ensure sufficient levels of resource are in place to cope with the large number of passengers returning to the UK over the next couple of weeks.” Heathrow, which intends to reopen Terminal 4 before July, said last month that it is “particularly concerned over Border Force’s ability to scale up to meet demand” for the summer crowds. Failures in passport e-gates as well as additional Covid requirements have at times caused long queues in the immigration halls. “It is fantastic to see the airport coming back to life after two years, and I want to thank all team Heathrow colleagues for working together to serve our passengers,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow. “Everyone at Heathrow is doing everything we can to make sure passengers get on their way as smoothly and safely as possible.”",News/UK news,Heathrow ‘stretched’ amid busiest period since pandemic started,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/heathrow-airport-stretched-amid-busiest-period-since-pandemic-started
4/11/2022,"UK growth slowed more than expected in February amid a slump in car manufacturing, despite a sharp recovery in overseas holiday bookings after the easing of Covid restrictions. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by only 0.1% in February, down from a monthly growth rate of 0.8% in January when the economy was recovering from the coronavirus Omicron variant. City economists had forecast a monthly growth rate of 0.3%. Overall, the economy was 1.5% bigger than its pre-pandemic level in February. Raising questions over the strength of the economy before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, manufacturing slumped as car producers continued to struggle with sourcing parts amid global supply chain disruption and shortages of vital components. Activity in the sector fell 0.4% on the month, driven by a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment and a 4.3% fall in computer, electronic and optical products where disruption to the availability of microchips has hit production volumes around the world. Tourism rose sharply after the easing of pandemic restrictions led to an increase in people booking holidays in the UK and overseas, with growth of 33.1% for travel agencies and tour operators. Hotels recorded a 23% rise in activity as more people travelled across the UK, contributing to the first month of positive growth for hotels and camping grounds since August. However, growth in the services sector of the economy slowed amid a drop in the health sector, largely reflecting a fall back from high levels in the NHS test and trace and vaccination programmes in December and January when Omicron was at its peak. Some businesses said disruption from storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin during the month had hindered trade, including in the building industry, restaurants and takeaways, hairdressing and beauty and leisure parks and holiday centres. Some firms reported a positive impact, such as those in fencing, torch sales and temporary off-grid power. Business leaders warned the economy was likely to struggle in future months as soaring inflation damages consumer spending power. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government needed to provide more financial support to companies and businesses to deal with rising cost pressures. “February’s slowdown is likely to be the start of a prolonged period of considerably weaker growth as rising inflation, surging energy bills and higher taxes increasingly damages key drivers of UK output, including consumer spending and business investment,” he said.",News/Business,UK economy slows more than expected as car production slumps,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/11/uk-economy-gdp-car-production
4/11/2022,"Attackers win games, but defences win titles. Manchester City were without Rúben Dias – the centre-back that led them to Premier League glory last season – and his absence was obvious to see. On an individual level he is the best defender City possess and ensures calm among his colleagues, which limits mistakes throughout the backline. Liverpool’s opener came from Dias’ replacement, John Stones, failing to deal with a cross, heading it immediately into a dangerous area, allowing the visitors to recycle the ball and eventually level through Diogo Jota. To Stones’ right was Kyle Walker, a man who has looked more dependable alongside Dias, but he made a couple of key lapses in concentration. First, he allowed Sadio Mané to get inside him and score the second equaliser. Second, he sat two yards behind his colleagues, allowing Liverpool to beat the offside trap and they would have scored if not for a fine Ederson save. City have the firepower to beat anyone but they still risk being let down by defensive frailties without Dias. Will Unwin Match report: Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool Perhaps the most damning aspect of Manchester United’s abysmal performance at Everton is that it came as no surprise to the away supporters who again called for the Glazers to get out of their club. Or, for that matter, anyone else. On paper, United appear the best opportunity for a relegation-threatened team to collect three crucial points over the next month. On the pitch, that is precisely what transpired as a collection of indulged individuals continued to go through the motions. The 20-time champions remain light years away from seriously challenging Manchester City or Liverpool. They were flattered by last season’s second-placed finish, profiting from Liverpool’s injury problems, and a managerial change may not remedy their deep-rooted malaise. Erik ten Hag, the Ajax coach, is expected to succeed Ralf Rangnick having impressed in interviews with the United hierarchy. He needs to interview them. Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 1-0 Man Utd Sean Dyche’s midweek claim that Everton don’t know how to win came back to bite him. Wednesday’s win over the Toffees was only his team’s fourth league victory all campaign. Defeat to Norwich took the rock-bottom club to five wins and kept Everton four points clear of Dyche’s team, when at Turf Moor it seemed Frank Lampard’s side were on the downward trajectory. Burnley were poor at Carrow Road, their spirit perhaps sagged by relying on hapless Manchester United to do them a favour at Goodison Park on Saturday. Norwich, the league’s lowest scorers, were made to look like interchangeable, free-flowing attackers, with Teemu Pukki leading the line expertly while Wout Weghorst, Burnley’s purported January saviour, was anonymous. Dyche may rue Maxwel Cornet’s glaring second-half miss and Charlie Taylor playing Pukki onside for the second goal. But it was Norwich who looked the group playing for their Premier League lives. John Brewin Match report: Norwich 2-0 Burnley Sometimes silence helps block out the noise. Thomas Tuchel conceded that sometimes there was nothing he could say to Timo Werner to help him during his barren run but said the striker “made his point” by scoring his first league goals since October in Saturday’s 6-0 rout at Southampton. Tuchel added that Werner has learned to cope with the weight of expectation that comes with being a marquee signing. The German could spearhead Chelsea’s attack in their Champions League quarter-final second leg at Real Madrid on Tuesday with Romelu Lukaku unlikely to recover from an Achilles injury. “He took his chance and could have scored more but these are the kind of performances strikers need and we need from the strikers,” Tuchel said. “At some point there are no words, you have to help yourself.” Ben Fisher Match report: Southampton 0-6 Chelsea Son Heung-min may have claimed the headline-grabbing hat-trick at Villa Park but Spurs’ top scorer acknowledged that Hugo Lloris erected the platform for the 4-0 victory. Lloris made seven saves in the opening 45 minutes as Aston Villa staged a storming bid for an equaliser. “He saved us today,” Son said. “We scored goals but if Hugo wasn’t there, probably we were 3-1 down or 4-1 down. Hugo saved us in tough times when we needed him. He was turning like a superman – it is insane.” Spurs’ bid to qualify for the Champions League by claiming a top-four place is now in their own hands, and Son was happy with how his side dug in. “We showed a lot character, especially after the first half when some teams would lose in this situation.” Peter Lansley Match report: Aston Villa 0-4 Tottenham The curious story of two strikers. One struggling to find the net, despite his team having an impressive season; the other on a roll, netting important goals to finally extinguish relegation worries. West Ham’s Michail Antonio was challenged yesterday by manager David Moyes to reignite, having not troubled the Premier League charts since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, supporting artist to his more flamboyant partner, Ivan Toney, is the definitive worker bee with end product. Antonio was anonymous during Sunday’s 2-0 defeat where fatigue affected the Hammers, who shortly travel to France for their delicately-poised Europa League quarter-final second leg. How Moyes would love to see 10-goal Antonio end all this frustration against Lyon. Mbeumo blasted the opener for Brentford, following a terrific, selfless role in the now-famous Stamford Bridge raid. “Bryan this season has been mentally strong and can bounce back in games,” said Thomas Frank afterwards. Antonio must do the same. Julian Taylor Match report: Brentford 2-0 West Ham Should Wilfried Zaha stay on penalties after his latest faux-pas? Crystal Palace’s leading scorer nodded home his 11th league goal of the season on the rebound, matching his best top-flight tally of last season, in Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Leicester but only after Kasper Schmeichel had twice saved his spot-kicks. Zaha, whose slip against Norwich in February was his first miss from the spot in five attempts, took a rather languid run-up at the King Power Stadium before allowing Schmeichel to save. But after Caglar Soyuncu was adjudged to have encroached, Zaha was allowed to retake – and this time the Leicester goalkeeper saved the shot down the middle, only to concede on the rebound. Patrick Vieira confirmed Zaha will stay on penalties, however. “I will not change just because he has missed today,” the Palace manager said. “He’s our penalty taker and if we get one in the next game, he will take it.” Peter Lansley Match report: Leicester 2-1 Crystal Palace Mikel Arteta has faced diverse challenges at Arsenal but is now tasked with one of his biggest: getting their Champions League push back on the rails when four of their next six games are against Chelsea, Manchester United, West Ham and Spurs. It will test what the manager, who has generally had a very impressive season along with his team, is made of. Arteta got things wrong in the damaging defeat to Brighton, moving Granit Xhaka to left-back and ensuring a midfield already weakened by Thomas Partey’s absence was now ripe to be dominated by bright, imposing opponents. He has clearly lost trust in Nuno Tavares and it deals him a headache for a run-in whose margins will be exceedingly fine. If Arsenal lose control of the engine room against direct rivals the consequences will be severe, perhaps even for their grip on a top-six place.. Nick Ames Match report: Arsenal 1-2 Brighton Watford’s latest dismal result marked their ninth consecutive defeat at Vicarage Road but Roy Hodgson was at a loss to explain. The Hornets manager has secured eight points away but defeats in all four home games since his arrival in January, have left the team marooned in the relegation zone. “Why is it we don’t win at home? I don’t know,” Hodgson told reporters. “I understand the question, but I don’t know there are any real words to answer it.” Watford’s wastefulness in front of goal and an error-strewn defensive display, with the defender Samir culpable for two of the goals, proved costly against upwardly-mobile Leeds. While Jesse Marsch’s appointment has had the desired effect to ease any fears of the drop, Hodgson has failed to galvanise Watford and relegation looks inevitable. Simon Mail  Match report: Watford 0-3 Leeds Arsenal spent several months dithering as to whether to buy Bruno Guimarães from Lyon or not. In the end the 24-year-old Brazil midfielder was sold to Newcastle in January and on Friday the Gunners were given reason to regret their indecision. Guimarães illuminated an otherwise distinctly average match – won 1-0 by Newcastle courtesy of Chris Wood’s late penalty – with his blend of intelligence, technique, incision and improvisational ability to play between the lines. “Bruno’s going to be a mainstay of our team,” said the Newcastle’s manager, Eddie Howe, whose side are now within touching distance of safety. “He’s got that technical flair and positional intelligence but he’s also got great steel and resilience; he’s a winner with a great attitude. He’s got no fear. I think Bruno’s the complete package.” Howe’s gain is Arteta’s loss.

4/11/2022,"The parent-child relationship has been the nucleus of 33-year-old Ocean Vuong’s writing. The American poet’s family fled Vietnam to a refugee camp in the Philippines before migrating to the US. His father abandoned them. His mother worked in a nail salon. In one of the most compelling poems in his Forward prize-winning 2017 debut collection, Night Sky With Exit Wounds, he imagines dragging his father’s body out of the sea, turning him over, and seeing a gunshot wound in his back. His 2019 novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, is a series of letters from a Vietnamese-American son to his illiterate mother — a tale that mirrors much of Vuong’s own life. Time Is a Mother is his second poetry collection, and was written in the aftermath of his mother’s death. There’s something about Vuong’s writing that demands all of your lungs. The succinct line arrangement and absence of full stops in poems such as Dear Rose force you to breathe heavy, as throughout this episodic poem Vuong talks tenderly to his dead mother about her journey as an immigrant from Vietnam to the US. He fills the poem with vivid imagery: flying bullets, corpses, Wonder Bread dipped in condensed milk and the fermentation of fish. He also wonders if she’s still illiterate: you bought me pencils reader I couldnot speak so I wrote myself intosilence where I stood waiting for you Mato read me do you read me now Being led by urge and compulsion feels central to the emotional landscape of Time Is a Mother, sometimes to the point of recklessness. The painterly opener, The Bull, sets the tone for this sense of wild abandon. The narrator of the poem is bewitched by the bull’s beauty; its kerosene-blue eyes and fur so dark it purples the night around it. “I had no choice. I opened the door”. Vuong, to varying degrees, illustrates what it means to be out of control. Some of the moments feel like stock images; playing air guitar in a backwards wedding dress as seen in Beautiful Short Loser, or hitting “rock-bottom in my fast car going nowhere”, in The Last Prom Queen in Antarctica. But it’s the candid, unphotogenic angles with bad lighting that are the most memorable, as in Rise & Shine, where he touches on drug addiction. Scraped the last $8.48from the glass jar.Your day’s worth of tipsat the nail salon. Enoughfor one hit. Poems like American Legend reveal the heights of Vuong’s self-destruction. Here, we see the lengths one might go to for intimacy, as a son crashes his car to get physically closer to his father. he slammedinto me &we huggedfor the first timein decades. Still, underneath the macabre scenes is an innocent curiosity and thirst for truth and beauty. These ghost poems are about the cavernous corners of loss, grief, abandonment, trauma and war, but that doesn’t result in nihilism or apathy for life; in fact, Vuong approaches death like an entrance rather than an ending. “I was made to die but I’m here to stay”, he asserts in The Last Dinosaur. Not Even is packed with laconic matter-of-fact sentences that blast. He writes with an audacious energy here. Sentences such as “Some call this prayer, I call it watch your mouth”, feel like one liners. He fills the poem with pregnant pauses, sometimes suffixing phrases with “Ha” to inspire awkward laughter. Absurdity is in abundance in this poem, but it’s the way Vuong uses comedic timing that surprisingly provides the most arresting and evocative moment: Rose, I whispered as they zipped my mother in her body bag, get out of there.Your plants are dying. You may have heard these stories about Vuong’s life, his family history, and the tragedies of his people who lay “mangled under the Time photographer’s shadow” before. You may well hear them again in the future, but because Vuong plays with time by the millisecond — slowing down or speeding up old memories or conversations — he uncovers new enlightening details that have a life of their own. He stood alone in the backyard, so dark the night purpled around him.I had no choice. I opened the door& stepped out. Windin the branches. He watched me with kerosene-blue eyes. What do you want? I asked, forgetting I had no language. He kept breathing,to stay alive. I was a boy –which meant I was a murdererof my childhood. & like all murderers, my godwas stillness. My god, he was stillthere. Like something prayed forby a man with no mouth. The green-blue lamp swirled in its socket. I didn’twant him. I didn’t want him tobe beautiful – but needing beautyto be more than hurt gentleenough to hold, I reached for him. I reached – not the bull –but the depths.

4/11/2022,"Watching Fox News can be like entering an alternative universe. It’s a world where Vladimir Putin isn’t actually that bad, but vaccines may be, and where some unhinged rightwing figures are celebrated as heroes, but Anthony Fauci, America’s top public health official, is an unrivaled villain. Given the steady stream of misinformation an avid Fox News consumer is subjected to, the viewers – predominantly elderly, white and Donald Trump-supporting – are sometimes written off as lost causes by Democrats and progressives, but according to a new study, there is still hope. In an unusual, and labor intensive, project, two political scientists paid a group of regular Fox News viewers to instead watch CNN for a month. At the end of the period, the researchers found surprising results; some of the Fox News watchers had changed their minds on a range of key issues, including the US response to coronavirus and Democrats’ attitude to police. The findings suggest that political perspectives can be changed – but also reveals the influence partisan media has on viewers’ ideology. Polls have previously shown that viewers of Fox News, the most-watched cable news channel in the US, are far more likely to believe the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen than the average American, and are more likely to believe falsehoods about Covid-19. The extent of the network’s influence on American politics was highlighted this week, with a report that Joe Biden has privately referred to Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox News, as “the most dangerous man in the world” and “one of the most destructive forces in the United States”. David Broockman and Joshua Kalla, political scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Yale university, respectively, paid 304 regular Fox News viewers $15 an hour to instead watch up to seven hours of CNN a week during the month of September 2020. The switchers were given regular news quizzes to make sure they were indeed watching CNN, while a control group of Fox News viewers continued with their regular media diet. Much of the news cycle in September 2020 focused on policing and protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which began after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot and seriously injured by police in late August. During the protests Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager from Illinois, shot and killed two men and wounded another. The events became a political tool for Republicans, including Donald Trump, who later announced he would send federal law enforcement agents to Kenosha. By the end of September, the CNN watchers were less likely to agree that: “It is an overreaction to go out and protest in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin” and less likely to believe that: “If Joe Biden is elected President, we’ll see many police get shot by Black Lives Matter activists”, when compared with their peers who continued watching Fox News. The CNN switchers were also, as Bloomberg’s Matthew Yglesias reported, 10 points less likely to believe that Joe Biden supporters were happy when police officers get shot, and 11 points less likely to believe that it is “more important for the President to focus on violent protests than the coronavirus pandemic”. In addition the CNN viewers were 13 points less likely than the Fox News viewers to agree that: “If Joe Biden is elected President, we’ll see many more police get shot by Black Lives Matter activists.” In an email interview, Kalla said he and Broockman had not necessarily expected people’s opinions to change. “I think the most surprising finding is that shifting people’s media diets from Fox News to CNN for a month had any effect,” Kalla said. “People who watch cable news tend to be very politically engaged and have strong opinions about politics, limiting the impact of the media. Similarly, they also tend to be strong partisans who might not trust any source not associated with their party.” The people in the experiment, Kalla said, were “overwhelmingly pro-Trump Republicans”. Given Trump had spent much of his presidency bashing CNN – a regular chant at his rallies was “CNN sucks!” – the results are particularly surprising. “A lot of people might expect this audience to completely resist what CNN had to say, but we see people learning what CNN was reporting and changing their attitudes, too. It is therefore surprising that watching CNN had any impact at all in this experiment,” Kalla said. Fox News, and liberal networks, can influence their viewers through “agenda-setting” – covering a certain topic relentlessly – and “framing”, Kalla said – by emphasizing certain aspects of an issue. Kalla and Broockman were particularly interested in a third method of influencing: “partisan coverage filtering” – which they defined in the study as the process where “partisan outlets selectively report information, leading viewers to learn a biased set of facts”. They gave a hypothetical example of how news channels might cover a war. In the example, CNN might cover the cost of the war and the number of military personnel and civilians who died. Fox News, on the other hand, could focus on the severity of the threat that Trump’s military campaign had countered, and feature stories of liberated civilians welcoming American soldiers. “This leaves viewers of each network with different factual understandings of the conflict, and subsequently different levels of support for the conflict and the president,” Broockman and Kalla wrote. Most of the CNN switchers stuck to the length of the task, according to the study. But once it was over, and the $15 an hour was taken away, “viewers returned to watching Fox News”, Kalla said. While the study proved that people are susceptible – at least under the right conditions – to different political opinions, in the longer-term the skewing of media has had a broader, and negative, impact on the way the US functions, Kalla said. “When politicians do something bad, we hope that voters will punish them, irregardless of their party – otherwise, politicians won’t have to work hard to make our lives better in order to keep their jobs,” Kalla said. “However, this type of behavior becomes less possible if the media engages in partisan coverage filtering. If CNN doesn’t cover bad things Democrats do or good things Republicans do, and if Fox News doesn’t cover bad things Republicans do or good things Democrats do, then voters become less likely to learn this information and less able to hold their elected officials accountable. “This is troubling for the functioning of a healthy democracy.”",News/Media,What happens when a group of Fox News viewers watch CNN for a month?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/11/fox-news-viewers-watch-cnn-study
4/11/2022,"When the horrors inflicted on Bucha’s residents emerged last week, the Russian grandmaster – and serial Vladimir Putin apologist – Sergey Karjakin was asked for his response. “Have you seen the pictures, Sergey?” the questioner probed on social media. “The senseless killings of innocent people. Men, women and children. Tortured by the Russian army. Bound hands behind their backs, and shot in the back of the head. Have you seen it, Sergey?” Karjakin, who represented Ukraine until 2009 before transferring his allegiance to Russia, had indeed seen the images. And his reply was chilling. “I wanted to say it was a good fake,” he said. “But no. It was a bad fake.” Even before this latest incident, Russia’s Lord Haw‑Haw had been given a six-month ban for his bombastic support of the invasion of Ukraine, which breached chess’s code of ethics. Now, having slipped further beyond the pale, further beyond redemption, he faces ostracism. Few will shed any tears at that – or at Russia’s teams being banned from most international events, including the Winter Paralympics and World Cup playoffs. Why, after all, should it be allowed to glory in its sporting achievements when thousands of innocents have been slaughtered and millions have fled? But not everything is as clear cut. Last week it emerged that Wimbledon was ready to ban the world No 2 Daniil Medvedev over fears that his victory “could boost the Putin regime”. Previously the sports minister Nigel Huddleston had also suggested Medvedev and other Russians would have to give assurances they are not supporters of Putin to play. But if you are a classical liberal, this demand might also make you a little queasy. Why, after all, should the sins of a country’s dictator lead to a sports star being punished? It feels like a violation of the laws of natural justice, especially when that player deliberately stays out of politics. I was making this point to a chess insider when he interjected. Sport is torn down the middle on this, he said. But when you talk about natural justice, start by thinking about it from Ukraine’s side. Why, he asked, should any Ukrainian – who is very likely to have been personally affected by the war, with perhaps family or friends dying – be asked, potentially, to play someone from Russia when their country remains under attack? Even if you strip the personal and emotive arguments from the debate, there is also a practical question: how ready will Ukrainian athletes be for competition when so many have had to flee or fight? Some Ukrainians have also indicated they do not want to face Russians, at least in chess. So if you let the Russians play, he argued, you are in effect cancelling the Ukrainians. My acquaintance knows Russian players. Many of them do not support the war. But, he pointed out, they have all financially benefited from the Russian regime over the years, and so their sporting victories are nevertheless tied to Putin. He made a final point: we are not squeamish about implementing economic sanctions on Russia, many of which will unfairly affect ordinary citizens. So why should rich sports stars be an exception? It amounted to a persuasive case but I remain unconvinced that Medvedev should have to sign a document distancing himself from Putin to play at Wimbledon. Not only would that be a completely empty gesture – anyone could sign but not mean it – but conversely it could also put his family in harm’s way. Especially when there are new laws in Russia about public dissent and the enemy within, and some politicians are openly making jokes about spring cleaning, using a Russian play on words of “to clean” a house and to send political opponents to prison. Where, ultimately, might all this lead? With Chinese athletes being told they must speak out against the mistreatment of the Uyghurs before competing in the Birmingham Diamond League? Many athletes from countries with dictatorships already have to walk a dangerous tightrope. Is it really fair to introduce the equivalent of a force 10 gale while they do so? If we want to target Putin’s allies, surely it would be better to focus on those Russians in senior positions on sports federations first? As things stand, sport remains torn. Athletics, rowing and badminton have implemented bans on participants from Russia and Belarus at major events. Others, including tennis and chess, have allowed them to play under a neutral flag. Inevitably high-powered lawyers are involved, with the Russians maintaining that a blanket ban is unjustified. But Professor Jack Anderson, a former arbitrator at the court of arbitration for sport (Cas), says that sports bodies have legitimate legal reasons to uphold the ban. “It can vary from sports but the general principle – and Cas has said this in the context of the Olympics, Russia and doping – is that, just because an athlete is eligible to compete at an event, it doesn’t automatically mean they will be invited,” he says. “There are also safety and operational reasons in the sense that, if Russian athletes compete, others will boycott. “As with many of these things it will be decided on a case-by-case basis. But my first reaction when I hear that Cas is deciding something in this area is that maybe the only court that should be looking at Russia and Ukraine at the minute is the international criminal court.” As Anderson also points out, the pity of not being able to play at a sports event is nothing compared with the pity of war. While sports operate in a bubble, this bubble must be burst by the reality of what is happening in Ukraine.",Sport/Sport,Dilemma over Russian athletes threatens to tear sports down the middle | Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/11/dilemma-over-russian-athletes-tennis-ukraine-medvedev
4/11/2022,"The creators of the Uluru Statement from the Heart have declared a voice to parliament an urgent issue for the federal election campaign, saying “history is calling” the next parliament to take action. The Uluru statement leadership has put forward two dates on which Australians could be called to decide, in a referendum, whether to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution: 27 May 2023 or 27 January 2024. “The time is now right. The stars will soon align. The politicians were not ready for Uluru in 2017. But now the Australian people are,” the group said. “We call on all sides of politics to support our call. History is calling.” Labor says it would hold a referendum in its first term should it win government. Guardian Australia understands the party’s preference is for a 2024 date. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, on Sunday evening said he would want a referendum in the first term and “would consult with First Nations people about the timing and the detail of that”. “This was promised by the government. At the beginning of this term, they went to the last election saying they’d advance a voice to parliament, and nothing’s happened. It is so typical of a government that’s all promise and no delivery,” Albanese said. “I would want as well to reach across the aisle. We know, historically, to get constitutional change you need bipartisan support to do that. “And I would be hopeful that we will have a mandate, very clearly, from the Australian people if we’re elected.” Albanese said “all that the voice is asking for is for First Nations people to be consulted about matters that affect them directly”. “That’s just good manners. It’s a very generous offer, and we should accept that offer,” he said. “We should be proud of the fact that our history includes the oldest continuous civilisation on the planet, a history of some 65,000 years, and it should be a source of great pride.” The Coalition would not be drawn on setting a date for a referendum but the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, on Monday said the government remained “committed to getting it right”. “The Morrison government has consistently said that we will go to a referendum once a consensus is reached and at a time it has the best chance of success,” Wyatt said on Monday. “For the Indigenous voice to work, it must have a strong foundation from the ground up. That’s why we’re taking the next step and starting with the Local & Regional Voice – as per the process set out in the final co-design report. “The Morrison government is committed to recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution and has backed this commitment with $160 million reserved for a referendum. We know that progressing change to the Constitution is a challenge – and we’re committed to getting it right.” A weekend meeting in north Queensland brought together delegates who participated in the creation and signing of the original Uluru statement. In a subsequent joint statement they declared a referendum was “urgent”. “After years of pushing for our voice to be heard, it feels like we have never been this close,” Prof Megan Davis, one of the key architects of the statement, said. “The constitutional recognition discussion has been going for well over a decade. The hard work is done. We are ready. The Australian people are ready. “[This statement] is a reflection of urgency … We need a referendum.”",News/Australia news,‘The time is now right’: parties urged to make Indigenous voice an election issue and set referendum date,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/the-time-is-now-right-parties-urged-to-make-indigenous-voice-an-election-issue-and-set-referendum-date
4/11/2022,"Scott Morrison has signalled he will have more to say during the election campaign about banning transgender women from playing women’s sport, as one of his senators seeks donations for an “action fund” to get that message out. Campaigning in the marginal seat of Gilmore on Monday, the prime minister said he shared the views of the Tasmanian Liberal senator Claire Chandler, who has advanced private member’s legislation allowing sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. The bill would amend the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex was not discriminatory. As Morrison endorsed her proposal on Monday, Chandler sent out an email to supporters asking for donations to a $45,000 fund that would enable “push back” against “radical activists pushing their gender fluid ideology and silencing women”. She noted in the email the “good news is that prime minister Scott Morrison is supporting this action to champion women and girls, saying it’s terrific”. On Monday Morrison also spoke in glowing terms about the Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, who co-founded the Save Women’s Sport organisation, which campaigns to restrict trans women playing in female sporting competitions. The PM told 2GB radio that Deves was “standing up for something really important”, noting it was “a sensitive issue”. “Katherine is, you know, an outstanding individual … and she’s standing up for things that she believes in, and I share her views on those topics,” Morrison said. “I think it’s important that they’re raised and it’s got nothing to do with, you know, the broad agenda debates. This is just about, you know, common sense and what’s right. And I think Katherine’s right on the money there.” Morrison made similar comments during a trip to Tasmania in late February. On Monday he told travelling reporters Chandler had been “outspoken and brave on these issues”. “And I’ll have more to say about that at another time.” Even though Morrison validated the proposal in February, the government did not move to bring on the legislation for debate when parliament sat for the budget session. The proposal is divisive within the government. Chandler’s Tasmanian colleague Bridget Archer has blasted it as “a vanity bill” and “not government policy”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Archer crossed the floor this year in an effort to secure protections for transgender children during the parliamentary debate about religious discrimination. A parliamentary rebellion by moderates forced Morrison to shelve the government’s proposal after the amendments aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students sparked a backlash from religious schools and government conservatives. In February Archer characterised Chandler’s women’s sport proposal as “unnecessary and divisive”. Chandler declared on Monday that Labor and the Greens were “fighting to kill this bill, and the mainstream media is misrepresenting it”. By donating to the fund, Chandler said, supporters could “stand up and protect the rights of women and girls by getting the word out so more Australians demand MPs and senators back my Save Women’s Sport Bill”. “Your support today will help stop the threat of the Labor-Greens grabbing more power and dismantling women’s sex-based rights.” Equality Australia’s chief executive, Anna Brown, criticised Morrison’s use of the issue for “cheap political points”, saying politicians should be standing up for LGBTIQ+ people. “Enough is enough,” she said. “The political parties that wish to form government this coming election must commit to governing for all Australians, and to ensuring that every person in Australia can live their life with dignity and respect, no matter who they are, or whom they love.”On Monday the advocacy group released the results of a survey of more than 5,000 LGBTIQ+ people, which found that one in three were undecided or were considering changing their vote this election. “After a series of divisive debates focused on the lives of LGBTIQ+ people, many of our community have become sceptical of the political parties and are yet to make up their mind about who they’ll vote for,” Brown said.The survey found that the environment and climate change and LGBTIQ+ issues were the two most important issues for LGBTIQ+ people, followed by healthcare and the cost of living and wages.Of the LGBTQI+ issues canvassed, people said removing religious exemptions in anti-discrimination laws, ending LGBTQ+ conversion practices and ending unnecessary medical treatment on intersex people without personal consent were the most important federal issues.Equality Australia estimates that there are more than 850,000 LGBTIQ+ voters, representing about 5% of the 17 million people enrolled to vote.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison renews support for trans women sport ban amid senator’s fundraising drive,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/scott-morrison-renews-support-for-trans-women-sports-ban-amid-fundraising-drive
