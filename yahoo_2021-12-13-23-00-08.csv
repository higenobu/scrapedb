12/13/2021,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Monday it may be forced to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in response to what it sees as NATO's plans to do the same. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's RIA news agency in an interview that Moscow would have to take the step if NATO refused to engage with it on preventing such an escalation. His comments further raised the stakes in an East-West standoff in which Russia is demanding security guarantees from the West while the United States and its allies are warning Moscow to pull back from what they see as a possible invasion of Ukraine - something Ryabkov again denied was Russia's intent. Intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe were banned under a 1987 treaty agreed between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan in what was hailed at the time as a major easing of Cold War tensions. Washington quit the pact in 2019 after complaining for years of alleged Russian violations. Ryabkov said there were ""indirect indications"" that NATO was moving closer to re-deploying INF, including its restoration last month of the 56th Artillery Command which operated nuclear-capable Pershing missiles during the Cold War. 'COMPLETE LACK OF TRUST' ""Lack of progress towards a political and diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to our response being of a military and technical military nature,"" he said. ""That is, it will be a confrontation, this will the next round, the appearance of such resources on our side. Right now there aren't any, we have a unilateral moratorium. We call for NATO and the U.S. to join this moratorium."" NATO says there will be no new U.S. missiles in Europe and it is ready to deter new Russian missiles with a ""measured"" response that would only involve conventional weapons. But Ryabkov said Russia had a ""complete lack of trust"" in NATO. ""They don't permit themselves to do anything that could somehow increase our security - they believe they can act as they need, to their advantage, and we simply have to swallow all this and deal with it. This is not going to continue."" Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden held two hours of talks last week on the Ukraine crisis and Moscow's demand for what it calls legally binding security guarantees from the West. Ryabkov said Russia would present its follow-up proposals to the United States, and possibly also to other NATO countries, in the coming weeks. Putin's spokesman, however, said he expected the Russian ideas to be presented this week.

12/13/2021,"Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia is recommending that the City Council change the laws related to sexually oriented businesses. Why it matters: Police believe crackdowns on SOBs will help reduce the crime rate in Dallas, especially on the Northwest side of the city. What’s happening: Police recommend city ordinances change so that SOBs will be required to close at 2am. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Police also want the city to change the minimum employment age at these businesses to 21, to comply with a new state law. Driving the news: The public safety committee will be briefed today on crime data around strip clubs. Another council committee has requested a task force examine the issue and present a report next year. Context: Fort Worth, Plano and Grand Prairie require SOBs close at 2am. By the numbers: Police have made 2,082 arrests at adult businesses since 2019, most of which occurred between 10pm and 6am, according to a Dallas Police Department report. In that same time, there have been nearly 12,000 calls for police at the SOBs, including 2,396 from 2-6am. There have been 549 aggravated assaults this year in the northwest patrol division, where most of Dallas’ strip clubs operate. About 24% of those assaults occurred from 2-6am, as compared with 20% between 10pm and 2am. What they’re saying: “This is to address being able to better regulate hours of operation for businesses that we have seen have criminal activity and where it’s been most prominent, and there’s data to support that with the presentation,” Council member Adam Bazaldua said at a meeting last month. The other side: City Council member Omar Narvaez has said he’s waiting on more information before making a decision on the change. “Sex work is not anything that any of us should be looking at as derogatory or something that’s shameful,” he said at the same meeting. The bottom line: Mayor Eric Johnson has been supportive of Chief Garcia’s plan to reduce crime. That’s likely to continue. Like this article?

12/13/2021,"Mushrooms might not be considered a superfood, but studies have shown that mushrooms have a plethora of health benefits to offer. Nutritional benefits vary with the kinds of mushrooms you are consuming, but even the basic types, like button, enoki, and oyster, which you can easily get at the supermarket, are loaded with fibre, vitamins, and minerals. Yahoo Life SEA has put together four health benefits that mushrooms provide and ways to easily incorporate them into your diet. A Singapore study in 2019 had looked into the association between mushroom consumption and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and concluded those who had more than two portions of mushrooms weekly has lesser odds of MCI compared to those who consumed less than a portion. Study has shown that higher mushroom consumption is associated with a lower risk of cancer, especially breast cancer. Rich in a type of antioxidant called selenium, research has shown that it helps to protect the body from damaging free radicals that can cause cancer and other health conditions such as heart diseases. Found mainly in oyster and shiitake mushrooms is beta-glucan, a form of soluble dietary fibre that is linked to boosting heart health and improving cholesterol levels in individuals. Along with the antioxidant selenium, which in this study shows a 24% reduction of heart diseases with a 50% increase in selenium intake, can help to boost your heart’s health in the long run. Mushrooms, especially white and oyster mushrooms, have been studied and concluded to help improve insulin resistance and assist in blood sugar control. This can potentially help those suffering from Type 2 Diabetes and “be a valuable choice for diabetic control.” Easy to prepare, mushrooms in general are highly nutritious, with a healthy amount of fibre, antioxidants, and various vitamins in every serving. Mushrooms can be easily cooked and added to your meals, even substituting meat and seafood products in dishes thanks to their umami flavours.
