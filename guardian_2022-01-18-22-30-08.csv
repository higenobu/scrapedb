1/18/2022,"Player of the series Pat Cummins was class personified, both as a courteous, seemingly ego-free captain who had Australia playing in his image and the standout fast bowler of his generation.  Breakthrough player Scott Boland arrived mid-series with little by way of fanfare and walked off at the end in Hobart with 18 wickets at 9.5 runs apiece. Build the man a statue. Best moment The final session on day two of the Boxing Day Test, when the Melbourne Cricket Ground turned into “The G” and Australia’s quicks charged in with a wall of noise behind them. Thrilling stuff. One thing I would have changed The schedule change made it understandable in this instance – and the twilight period does make for a stunning backdrop – but one day-night Test match per Ashes series is plenty.The 2023 Ashes series will be … a golden chance for Australia to claim a series win in England for the first time since 2001 unless the hosts can perform a handbrake turn on their flatlining form in the meantime. Player of the series If you asked any of England’s batters which one bowler they would not want to face it would be Pat Cummins, who in his first series as captain was fast, accurate, and led his team excellently. Breakthrough player I’ve been massively impressed by Cameron Green. Technically he looks a very sound right-hand bat who can play long innings at the highest level, and as a bowler he is tall, strong, hostile and unsettles players with pace and bounce. Best moment England’s highlight has to be Mark Wood getting six wickets in Hobart. I think he’s such a great character, who brings the team energy, enthusiasm and a point of difference. His first three overs in the final Test went for 30 and his resilience, the way he stuck at his task and came back to earn his reward, is a lesson for all cricketers. One thing I would have changed I would rewind to the first morning and get England to bowl first. If I’m allowed a second change, obviously I’d also have played Anderson and Broad. The 2023 Ashes series will be … very hard to predict for England, and by then we might have lost Jimmy Anderson, but I think we will be more competitive. Player of the series Scott Boland, a man having the time of his life against the most joyless opponents imaginable, a glorious and instructive note of contrast. Breakthrough player Cameron Green, who can be basically anything from here, genuine all-rounder, giant swooping eagle-man predator in the gully, and a cricketer of real grace. The numbers. The numbers are going to be ridiculous. Best moment For Australia: first ball of the series. Also, everything else that followed. For England: n/a. One thing I would have changed Complete systemic restructure of professional game, abolition of the ECB in favour of body driven by engagement not profit, quota of annual ringfenced free-to-air TV, serious national investment in public facilities, genuine, no-bullshit 10-year plan to re-engage cricket in schools and lost parts of the demographic. Nobody gets to call themselves “chief executive” or “managing director” (lol) or draw vast personal bonuses. The 2023 Ashes series will be … very different. This is a low. Details matter. Chris Woakes hooping it around at Edgbaston, one or two semi-functional batters and the root and branch machine will be packed up in the shed for the next three years. Player of the series Pat Cummins. Just pips Mitchell Starc, who had a superb all-round series. Cummins took 21 wickets at an average of 18, led his team brilliantly, and did it all without whining, snarling, sledging, or posturing. Breakthrough player Cameron Green. With all respect to Scott Boland’s Edwardian bowling average, Green looks utterly formidable. The idea of how good Australia could be in the next 10 years now they have a genuine all-rounder is a little terrifying. Best moment Cummins and Starc at the MCG. The way Starc got Rory Burns with the first ball of the series is the moment people will remember, but his spell with Cummins on the second evening at the MCG was as good as Test bowling gets. One thing I would have changed Everything? The one thing that would have made the most difference in the short term would have been a few proper warm-up games. Even that wouldn’t have saved England. The 2023 Ashes series will be … either a new low for England, or a landmark on the upslope from this tour. It depends entirely on the decisions the management make in the next couple of months. Player of the series Travis Head. How different might the series have been without his momentum-shifting hundreds in Brisbane and Hobart? Well, probably not that different. But still, a towering effort. Breakthrough player Turns out the bowler of the series was an 83mph seamer in his 30s. Unhappily for England it was Scott Boland, Australia’s most spectacular Ashes debutant in a generation. Best moment The first ball. Who would ever want to forget the ferocious noise at the Gabba, the searing pace of Mitchell Starc, the thrilling clunk of shattered stumps? Well, probably Rory Burns. One thing I would have changed England’s preparation. Poorly drilled teams play desperate cricket, and England’s capitulation did immeasurable damage to the Ashes brand. Two first-class games should be a bare minimum in future. The 2023 Ashes series will be … largely unaffected by Covid, riotously entertaining and probably an England win with a new-look team. Life moves pretty fast, you know. Player of the series A last minute call-up to the captaincy, Pat Cummins did everything with grace, was the series leading wicket-taker, and one end of an electric spell of fast bowling that wonderful Melbourne evening. Breakthrough player Cameron Green. He bangs the ball in with unerring accuracy, fields like an angel at gully, and by the end was unfurling divine cover drives that defy his 2m height and wingspan. Best moment Jonny Bairstow’s hundred and Usman Khawaja’s double would be up there, but for Ashes-defining momentum, it has to be Starc’s yorker to topple Burns with the first ball of the series. One thing I would have changed Chosen to bowl at Brisbane. England’s batting morale never recovered from being 11 for three in the first half hour of the series, while a jaunty bowling performance might have stayed that death spiral. The 2023 Ashes series will be … pimped for all its worth. Cummins will be photographed in the royal box at Wimbledon and England will be better with a Dukes in their hand and the clouds on their back. Player of the series Scott Boland. Sure he didn’t play the first two, but featured so dramatically from then on. Averaging 9.5 with the ball is like averaging 120 with the bat. Old school. Breakthrough player Also Boland, but he deserved the main gong too given his returns were so far ahead of everyone else’s. Beneath the radar, but every time he bowled, wickets came. Best moment Marnus Labuschagne dancing off to cover, getting bowled behind his legs, and ending up flat on his face. Also Stuart Broad repeatedly having the celebrappeal shot down – then declining to review. One thing I would have changed England’s batting. The coaches for England’s batting. The system that produces England’s batting. The 2023 Ashes series will be … not as bad as this one. Surely? Won’t it? Player of the series Cameron Green. Only one Englishman scored more runs than him, and only one took more wickets – plus they were often important runs (his partnership with Travis Head in Hobart turned the game) and important wickets (70% were top-five batters). Just 22, he is quite the prospect. Breakthrough player Not long before his 33rd birthday Scott Boland’s breakthrough was both late and ludicrous, his figures in the second innings of his debut Test in Melbourne – four overs, seven runs, six wickets – reading like some kind of practical joke. Best moment The first ball of the first match sensationally set the tone for a miserable campaign both for Rory Burns individually and the England team as a whole. One thing I would have changed For all the pain involved this series may come to be seen as important and even beneficial for England, however ideally I wouldn’t have watched any of it, read anything about it or spoken to anyone with any knowledge of it. The 2023 Ashes series will be … an unhealthy obsession for all of English cricket and general distraction from more useful stuff.",Sport/Sport,Ashes 2021-22: our writers’ end-of-series awards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/ashes-2021-22-our-writers-end-of-series-awards

1/18/2022,"Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment fund manager, said pushing climate policies was about profits, not being “woke”. In his annual letter to CEOs , Fink said businesses, cities and countries that do not plan for a carbon-free future risked being left behind. He argued that the pursuit of long-term returns was the main driver behind climate policies, after being criticised for seeking to influence companies.  “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’,” he wrote. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients.” West Virginia’s treasurer said this week that the state’s Treasury investment board would no longer use a BlackRock fund, after the fund manger urged companies to cut their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. The official said this would damage West Virginia’s economy. In his Dear CEO letter, Fink wrote: “It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long term. Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company’s success.” After Fink wrote two years ago that climate risk was an investment risk and that the firm would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions, many companies set out plans to become carbon-neutral. BlackRock had previously been criticised for not pushing hard enough on the issue. Last spring, BlackRock – which manages about $10tn (£7.4tn) in assets – reportedly threw its weight behind a shareholder campaign to oust several directors on the board of the US oil giant ExxonMobil. The coup launched by dissident hedge fund activists at Engine No 1 replaced two Exxon board members with its own candidates to help push the oil company towards a greener strategy. Fink predicted in this year’s letter that “the next 1,000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies, they’ll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonise and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers”, adding that established companies should strive to do the same. He said a “tectonic shift” had happened in recent years, with sustainable investments globally reaching $4tn. Fink also said that companies had a moral responsibility to adapt to “a new world of work” that had been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. He said “that world is gone” – where companies expected workers to come to the office five days a week, mental health was rarely discussed in the workplace, and wages for those on low and middle incomes barely grew.",News/Environment,"BlackRock’s Larry Fink: climate policies are about profits, not being ‘woke’",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/blackrock-larry-fink-climate-policies-profits-woke
1/18/2022,"The court of appeal has overturned a ruling that found that a government contract given to a polling company with links to Dominic Cummings was unlawful. The lord chief justice reversed a ruling made last year after he found the original judgment to be “unprecedented”, and questioned how it perceived an alleged bias.  Last June, a high court judge ruled that the Cabinet Office’s decision to award a contract to the market research firm Public First “gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful”. Public First is run by policy specialists James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, both of whom previously worked with Cummings when he worked for Michael Gove. The company was given a contract for more than £550,000 in June 2020 for focus groups and other research – including testing public health slogans such as “Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”. The campaigning organisation the Good Law Project (GLP), which brought the case, plans to appeal to the supreme court. June’s ruling was the first in a series of judicial review legal challenges brought by the GLP against government Covid-19 contracts awarded with no competitive tenders under emergency regulations Mrs Justice O’Farrell found that the “apparent bias” was not due to the existing relationships between Cummings and Public First, but because of a failure to consider any other research agency or record the objective criteria used in the selection. However, in a judgment on Tuesday, the court of appeal overturned her ruling. The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, sitting with Lord Justice Coulson and Lady Justice Carr, found that the original judgment was an “unprecedented outcome”. Burnett concluded: “The fair-minded and reasonably informed observer would not have concluded that a failure to carry out a comparative exercise of the type identified by the judge created a real possibility that the decision-maker was biased.” In response, the GLP said: “We don’t think the court of appeal is right. And so we plan to ask the supreme court to hear an appeal.” In a statement, it added: “We believe there is proper and widespread public interest in the extent to which the law restrains public servants from awarding valuable public contracts to their friends without adequate safeguards to protect against the risk of bias.” In a document setting out its grounds for appeal, GLP lawyers said: “Mr Cummings should not have been permitted to determine that the contract should be awarded to his personal friends without safeguards to mitigate the risk of bias.” Cummings said the court of appeal ruling was “total vindication for my decisions on moving super speedy on procurement to save lives”. He added: “Remember all the ignorant nonsense from pundits/minor social scientists/remainiacs?” In a reference to the Good Law Project chief, Jolyon Maugham, he said: “Lord chief justice crushes kimono-fox-killer.” Frayne, founding partner of Public First said: “Our research team worked unbelievably hard for seven days a week – from early morning till late at night – during the height of the pandemic, helping refine messages that prevented many casualties. Today’s judgment rightly pays tribute to the team’s efforts and they should be proud of their work.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We welcome the court of appeal’s ruling that this contract was awarded entirely lawfully. This includes the court’s firm rejection of the allegation of apparent bias, overturning the previous judgment. “Throughout the pandemic our priority has always been to save lives and the work by Public First helped to improve vitally important health messages.”",News/Politics,Government wins appeal over contract for firm linked to Dominic Cummings,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/government-wins-appeal-over-contract-for-firm-linked-to-dominic-cummings
1/18/2022,"Nick Kyrgios is simultaneously an open book and an enigma. He says what he thinks and does the unthinkable. Sometimes that comes in the form of throwing a tantrum or berating the chair umpire. Other times it is raising funds for communities devastated by bushfires or becoming the pandemic voice of reason. To this day it is unclear whether he has a sizeable chip on his shoulder or genuinely does not give a toss. A similar indecision can also be felt by the viewer, of wanting to both like and dislike him and flirting with both in equal measure. Love him or hate, though, one cannot help but watch him.  Kyrgios had missed all the warm-up events to his ninth Australian Open after problems with asthma and then coming down with Covid-19, which he said had him sleeping 17 hours a day. The Australian was underdone when he rolled into Melbourne on a private jet on Sunday ahead of this Tuesday-evening opener. Nobody knew how he would fare against Liam Broady, the British qualifier who has never before made the main draw of this grand slam and has not progressed past the second round in any other. Unfortunately for the 28-year-old Broady and his supporters at home in Stockport, his debut was short-lived, ending in a 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 defeat in one hour and 54 minutes. For the local favourite up the other end, this potential banana skin of a match morphed into a warm-up for his round-two antagonist, Daniil Medvedev, who swept past Switzerland’s Henri Laaksonen in straight sets. The Russian world No 2 was runner-up here last year and won the 2021 US Open, and yet this will mean little to Kyrgios, who beat him both times they played in 2019. He holds the same winning record over the world No 1, his arch-nemesis and recent “bromance” buddy, Novak Djokovic. Such unpredictability is the essence of his personality, described by himself as “spontaneous” and “unorthodox”. It is the foundation of the public’s addiction to him, which was no more evident than on Tuesday night. John Cain Arena is the people’s court. It is also Kyrgios’s court, his haven for showboating shenanigans. Seemingly straightforward contests have gone very wrong for Kyrgios in the past, but when he’s on he is on, and by the time he had wrapped up the first set in 34 minutes he had served 10 aces to Broady’s none. At the end of proceedings there were 21. One whacked a very brave ball-boy on the hip. Broady had his moments, too, including a leaping smash to help him win a first-set service game to love, and several more eye-catching moments thereafter. In his opening service game in the second, he rallied from 40-0 to deuce and survived three Kyrgios advantages only to cede the game anyway. This was largely the story of the match – he hung in there admirably but ultimately fell short. Kyrgios won the next service game to love, sealing it with another shot through the legs. He did not even move his feet, just stuck out his tongue, gave it a wiggle and broke into a grin. The early theatrics were not just of his own making. Broady walked on to the court to chants of “siu” and heard them again every time he went to serve. Midway through the second set he was about to release his serve toss when a spectator shouted “underarm, man”. He burst out laughing, Kyrgios did too, and then they were both standing there spluttering and smiling for a good 10 seconds. Before long Kyrgios was copping the “siu” treatment from the Cristiano Ronaldo enthusiasts. “Fucking every point,” he quipped back. “I thought they were going to do it for 10 minutes,” he said afterwards. “They did it for two hours. I know I’ve got the crowd in the palm of my hand. Obviously Liam’s a great player, but his experience on that court, in that situation, when the crowd’s going nuts, he’s never experienced that before. That’s the reason why, at break points, I’m trying to get the crowd up and get him to feel the pressure.” It was all in good spirit, which is effectively how he views his career. Playing tennis is a fun thing to do – when he feels like it. “I like to feel good and I like to just enjoy my life. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I play a bit of tennis on the side.” That much is apparent in the 26-year-old’s rankings slide to world No 114. The 26-year-old now finds himself in the triple-digits for the first time since July 2014, when the then 144th-ranked teenager blew world No 1 Rafael Nadal off centre court en route to the Wimbledon quarter-finals and subsequently shot up to 66th. The intervening seven and a half years have been a wild ride. Of brickbat and bluster, moral high grounds and meltdowns, and a generally untamed predilection for controversy. “If I’m ranked 1,000 or 10 in the world everyone knows what I’m capable of on tour,” he said last week. “I’m not a player that hasn’t proven himself … I talk a lot, but I also have beaten a lot of players and I have won a lot of tournaments. Tennis etiquette does not really apply to this particular player. Emotions are never suppressed and protocols not always adhered to. Even when Kyrgios is not talking, he is talking. Each triumphant fist pump, indignant glare and underarm serve is an open window into his state of mind. The swagger and the shoulder slumps are transparent. Every last bead of sweat that drips from his brow has something to say. After the match, his actual words were of surprise. “The first couple of days [with Covid] I was bedridden, I didn’t know if I’d be able to play,” he said. “I couldn’t ask for a better team because the last week has been tough with the isolation. I was lucky enough to have a tennis court to just hit some serves. “I’m just super happy to be here again. We’ve all had a tough couple of years, and to play in front of you guys, it was a lot of fun … this is my favourite court in the entire world.”",Sport/Sport,Nick Kyrgios swats aside Liam Broady in Australian Open first round,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/nick-kyrgios-swats-aside-liam-broady-in-australian-open-first-round
1/18/2022,"Northern Ireland is at risk of becoming “the dirty corner of Europe”, campaigners say, if more ambitious targets are not set for the country as it seeks to approve its first dedicated climate legislation.Officials at the devolved Stormont institutions say that the environment strategy for Northern Ireland lags considerably behind the commitments made by Great Britain and Ireland, adding to concerns Northern Ireland may be becoming a serious outlier in climate and environmental governance. Stormont’s agriculture and environment committee heard this month that the targets outlined in its draft climate strategy are “significantly less ambitious” than those set by England, Scotland and Wales.The draft strategy’s target of 70% of water bodies reaching “good” status by 2027 falls “significantly” short of Scotland’s target of 81%, the committee heard. It is understood the strategy at present does not include an aim to recycle 70% of all waste by 2030, as recommended by the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC), nor does it set targets for food wastes and overall waste as Scotland and Wales have done.Pledges to increase new woodland plantation by about 1,400 hectares annually to 8.8% coverage by 2030 – with Northern Ireland having the lowest tree cover in Europe – were also said to be significantly behind corresponding pledges in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.Currently out for consultation, Tuesday is the deadline for the public to respond to the draft strategy.“The environment strategy is weak, flawed and fails to address the legacy of a country with declining water quality and no clean air strategy,” said James Orr, director of Friends of the Earth Northern Ireland.“With only two months to go in this executive to pass progressive climate legislation, all eyes are watching to see if Northern Ireland can grasp the last chance in this mandate to build a society that works with nature or be ridiculed as the dirty corner of Europe.”Northern Ireland has for a number of years been the only devolved administration without its own specific climate change legislation and targets for emissions reduction. The 2008 UK Climate Change Act only requires emissions cuts as a cross-jurisdiction aggregate.Two competing climate bills are now making their way through the Northern Irish assembly – the first a private member’s bill introduced in October 2020 that would set a legally binding 2045 net zero target, and another, tabled in July 2021 by the agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, aims for carbon emissions to be reduced by 82% by 2050. Upcoming elections for the devolved parliament are to be held no later than 5 May.Poots, echoing farming groups’ claims that the 2045 target could wipe out half of the country’s livestock farmers if enforced, has said the first bill would “decimate” Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry – which recorded a turnover of more than £5bn in 2019 and employs about 25,000 people.The Green party NI leader, Clare Bailey, who tabled the first climate bill, said: “If Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK with no climate legislation and no net zero target, it risks undermining the UK’s climate action on a national level.“Northern Ireland has the highest per-capita emissions of anywhere in the UK, so it’s crucial that emissions are rapidly reduced here to ensure the UK meets its national targets.”The climate act is one of a number of environmental pledges at the heart of the “New Decade, New Approach” agreement that restored the devolved governing institutions in January 2020, after a record shutdown period of more than three years. An independent environmental protection agency regulator and a “green new deal” package promised for Northern Ireland are both yet to be delivered.Civil society organisations say the requisite science and technology is already in place to enable a rapid transition towards net zero and that the choice between the two climate bills is fundamentally a political one.“Northern Ireland’s inability to fulfil climate commitments is due to political failings, rather than a lack of scientific evidence,” said Dr Amanda Slevin, chair of the Climate Coalition NI group.She accused Poots of having used CCC findings “selectively”, saying that his bill “gives the Department [of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs] the authority to change the [climate] targets both in terms of the level of emissions reductions and the date by which they are to be achieved. In effect, the bill’s targets are not fixed.”Although the CCC chair, Lord Deben, has said it would be “morally wrong” to hold Northern Ireland to the 2045 net zero goal, the organisation stresses that its 82-84% reduction target is a minimum for Northern Ireland and that it should be reviewed over time.Poots said: “My executive climate change bill, which is currently undergoing legislative passage, is evidence-based and science-led, and its at least 82% emissions reduction by 2050 target for Northern Ireland has been advised by the independent and world-renowned expert statutory advisory body – the UK Climate Change Committee.“This at least 82% target is a highly ambitious but an equitable contribution for Northern Ireland to fully contribute to UK net zero through a balanced pathway that will both protect the environment and boost the Northern Ireland economy. It also is scientifically compatible with the emissions pathway required to keep to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels] global warming limit.” ",News/UK news,Northern Ireland’s plan for the environment ‘weak and flawed’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/northern-ireland-environment-plan-weak-flawed-dirty-corner-europe
1/18/2022,"There were 922 Covid deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to 7 January, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. This was a rise of 58% from the previous week. However the increase is artificially high because the figures in the previous week’s release were affected by the Christmas and Boxing Day bank holidays.  Of all deaths registered in the first week of January in England and Wales, 7.5% mentioned Covid – up from 6.9% in the last week of 2021. A total of 130 care home residents’ deaths were registered involving Covid-19 in England and Wales in the first week of the new year, up from 64 in the previous seven days, however, the rise was affected by the closure of register offices with two bank holidays in the final week of 2021. The ONS weekly death count includes all deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate and now exceeds 176,000 deaths. The government only counts those deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test which stands at more than 152,000. The seven-day average figure for cases in England has been falling in recent days and stood at 1,531 cases for every 100,000 people on 12 January, the latest date for which figures were available. Northern Ireland’s rate was higher, at 1,911 cases per 100,000, while Scotland and Wales reported rates of 1,394 and 1,347 per 100,000 respectively. The average of people being treated for Covid in UK hospitals has risen by 63% since the turn of the new year according to the latest available government data. A total of 19,452 patients were being treated in UK hospitals on average in the week to 14 January, the highest weekly figure since 19 February 2021. However, the total number of patients hospitalised with Covid has been falling in more recent days: it stood at 19,345 on Friday, having reached a post-Omicron high of 19,906 on Monday 10 January. In the past week an average of 794 patients have required mechanical ventilation for Covid but, a sign of the combination of lower severity of the Omicron variant and high vaccination coverage, this is less than one-third of the number of that required in mid-February 2021. The figures come as the government is reportedly considering ending all Covid restrictions in England, including the mandatory isolation period for infectious people. The legal requirement to self-isolate is one of several pieces of Covid legislation due to expire in March. The isolation period was recently reduced to five days for those with negative lateral flow tests.

1/18/2022,"Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right mass murderer behind the country’s worst peacetime massacre, has appeared in court asking to be released on parole after serving 10 years in prison in near isolation for killing 77 people in a double bomb and gun attack in 2011. Breivik – who legally changed his name to Fjotolf Hansen in 2017 – attacked the country’s government quarter in Oslo with a van bomb before heading to a youth camp being held by the country’s Labour party on the island of Utøya where he killed 69 people, most of them teenagers, in a gun attack.  Despite the gravity of his crimes, Breivik, 42, is entitled under Norwegian law to apply for parole after serving a decade in prison of his 21-year sentence, and can reapply each year for a parole hearing. The hearing, being held in a gymnasium at Skien prison to the south-west of Oslo under the auspices of Telemark district court, is expected to last three days and is being livestreamed. Appearing on the first day of the hearing in a black suit and gold tie, Breivik – with a white supremacist message attached to his lapel and pasted on his briefcase – also made Nazi salutes. Breivik was led into the hearing without handcuffs by officers, clutching a sheaf of papers. During the opening presentation by the state prosecutor, Breivik held up the message on his briefcase, drawing a reprimand from the court. Few observers in Norway believe Breivik has any realistic prospect of being released following the hearing, instead voicing their concern he would use the occasion to broadcast his extremist views. Families of the victims and survivors had feared Brevik could inspire likeminded ideologues and grandstand his extreme views during the hearing. “The only thing I am afraid of is if he has the opportunity to talk freely and convey his extreme views to people who have the same mindset,” said Lisbeth Kristine Røyneland, who heads a family and survivors support group, said ahead of the hearing. Since being in prison, Breivik has continued to try to represent himself as a far-right European leader, attempting to rally support for his views. He has been trying to start a fascist party in prison and reached out by mail to rightwing extremists in Europe and the US. Prison officials seized many of those letters, fearing Breivik would inspire others to commit violent attacks. Opening the proceedings, Hulda Karlsdottir, a prosecutor for the Norwegian state, chronicled the murders Breivik committed and told the court that the hearing was not related to Breivik’s prison conditions but the “danger” Breivik would pose should be be released. Karlsdottir, who started the hearing by stating the conditions of Breivik’s imprisonment, told the court: “The main topic here is the danger associated with release.” Among commentators writing ahead of the hearing was Øystein Milli, of the Norwegian tabloid VG. “Usually I do not predict the outcome, but this time I am as sure as one can be. He will not be released. From what we know, there is little indication that Breivik has moved anything when it comes to his position, and that there is zero remorse to be found,” wrote Milli. Among the state’s witnesses at the hearing is psychiatrist Randi Rosenqvist, who has assessed Breivik on a number of occasions as to the risk he poses. Rosenqvist said before the hearing that she could “not detect great changes in Breivik’s functioning,” since his criminal trial when he bragged about the scale of his slaughter, or his 2016human rights case in 2016, when he raised his hand in a Nazi salute. “In principle and practice someone seeking parole would have to show remorse, and to show that they understand why such acts cannot be repeated,” she said. The court that convicted him in 2012 found him criminally sane, rejecting the prosecution’s view that he was psychotic. Breivik did not appeal his sentence.Agencies contributed to this article",News/World news,Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik appears before parole hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/norwegian-mass-killer-anders-breivik-begins-parole-hearing
1/18/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  When I was writing last week’s newsletter, I felt like I could still legitimately recommend Wordle as game of the week, because plenty of people still hadn’t heard of it. At the time it had 300,000 players. Now, though, it has millions, and has become ubiquitous; the most viral game since … Pokémon Go? The last week has seen a whole cycle of news purely about this appealing daily word game. Its creator Josh Wardle – who famously has no interest in monetising his creation, made as a gift for his partner – told the Guardian he was totally overwhelmed by its success. Amusing tributes popped up, from the evil Absurdle, which actively pulls the answer further and further away from you with every attempt, to the absurdist nightmare Letterle (the clue is in the name). Attack of the clones Then, some opportunistic baddies cloned the game and released it on app stores for profit – one of them even bragged about it on Twitter, and seemed surprised when thousands of people, including some quite famous game developers, called them out. Thankfully, what could have been a “this is why we can’t have nice things” moment was salvaged when the clones were removed from the App Store last week. The Twitter bragger even apologised, to their credit. More clones keep popping up, but it seems that at least someone at Apple has an interest in keeping lovely things pure and untainted. Wordle’s uncomplicated innocence is part of what makes it so damn appealing: in an age where literally everything seems to be trying to collect our data and monetise our attention, from our phones to sodding smart fridges, it’s no wonder that the world has responded so positively to something that’s simple, fun and free. Highly contagious One of the first times I experienced a game going properly viral was back in 2014, when my then-young stepson introduced me to Five Night’s at Freddy’s, a shonky horror game about a haunted pizzeria stalked by horrible Chuck E Cheese-style animal mascot automatons. I have no idea how the kid heard about the game. Could have been YouTube, could have been playground chat. But before long practically every child I knew had, somehow, played it. Parents were asking me about it. It’s a pretty scary game, and a lot of younger kids were pretty upset by it – it was its generation’s equivalent of the nightmare-inducing snatches of horror movies that I glimpsed through the slightly-open door of the living room when I was supposed to be in bed, as a child. Five Nights at Freddy’s had had no hype, no coverage on the gaming websites or social media accounts that I followed, no traditional path to popularity. It just arrived, out of nowhere, at a time when YouTubers were constantly looking for horror games to performatively scream at, and became inordinately successful. I was baffled and intrigued. Pokémon Go in 2016 is probably the biggest viral game of all time – there was a point where you couldn’t go outside without seeing people drifting around, convening at random phone boxes or shops or one of the game’s other arbitrary landmarks, staring at their phones, looking for a Psyduck or a fabled Snorlax. That summer I was in my home town of Edinburgh and ended up directing a whole group of wandering Pokémon hunters down an obscure close, where I’d just found a Haunter after 20 minutes of searching. Pokémon Go was laser-targeted at my generation of grown-up Pokémon kids, but it really felt like everyone was playing it at one point, right across age groups and in every country. It was a truly shared experience, and that’s always the crux of a viral game: they connect us to each other, somehow. And as proven by Pokémon Go developer Niantic’s subsequent games, most of which have been at best mildly popular despite sharing near-identical design, there’s no planning for a game’s viral success. There’s no recipe for them. Who on earth would have picked Wordle out of a crowd? Or Flappy Bird, the brief mobile gaming sensation that nearly broke its poor creator, Dong Nguyen? It’s not usually the ‘best’ games that blow up in this way. Flappy Bird wasn’t exactly wonderful to play – and Fortnite is far from the best multiplayer shooter around (don’t @ me). This is the interesting thing about virality, really; you can’t account for what resonates. In retrospect it’s easy to draw connections between, for instance, Among Us’ rise to fame and the isolation and paranoia of lockdown, but it’s not like the game was designed with that in mind. It just kinda happened. Isn’t that the beauty of it? For some reason I only seem to be playing games that aren’t quite games recently (but not for much longer, I guess – Rainbow Six Extraction and Elden Ring will soon kick off a ludicrously busy year for video games). For now though, I’m going to recommend Radiohead and Epic Games’ KID A MNESIA EXHIBITION. It’s an interactive walkthrough of the seminal 21-year-old album(s), with absorbing visualisations, scrawled words and lyrics, black-and-white forests, wandering lost-looking stick-men with looming, grinning faces, and much else. Here’s why you should play it: I don’t mean this unkindly, but a lot of games don’t engage all that much with the rest of culture, and it shows. KID A MNESIA is what happens when someone from outside the game world designs a gamelike experience, which is to say, it’s like nothing you will have played before, and it will feed your brain. Appropriately, I felt an encroaching sense of ennui and alienation exploring this trippy and emotionally charged place. My partner, the biggest Radiohead nerd I know, describes it as “pleasantly disconcerting, which is Radiohead in a nutshell really”. Interestingly, it was originally going to be a physical exhibition, but Covid stomped on that idea, and the band and their collaborators started to explore the idea of a virtual thing instead – which means this is one of the few good things to have resulted from the pandemic. Available on: PC, Mac, PS5Approximate playtime: 1-2 hours A rundown of games industry CEO compensation released last week makes for grim reading. Infamous Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick took home $152.6m last year, 1,560 times the median salary at his company, which spent most of 2021 battling allegations about what a toxic, sexist working environment it is. Even he can’t compete with Robert Antokol of free-to-play and casino-game developer Playtika, however, who took home over $372m. That’s $186,000 an hour. This Twitter thread from Doom creator John Romero taught me something I didn’t know: in 1902, the American government tried to force Native men living on reservations to cut their long hair. “I wear my hair long as a proud Yaqui and Cherokee man, and will continue to do so until the day I die,” Romero says. The nominees for the developer-centric DICE awards have been announced. All last year’s big hitters are there – space platformer Ratchet & Clank and art-deco shooter Deathloop lead the nominations – but there are also nods to 2021’s less obvious games, such as Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Before Your Eyes, Inscryption, The Forgotten City, and personal favourites Unpacking and Death’s Door. Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking – an interesting experiment for video game history buffs Would you play a video game for 500 hours? Today’s question comes from reader Dominik Kurseja: What are the games that you wish you’d had more time to play? And if/when you revisited them, were they as good as you remembered? I asked Julia Hardy, presenter of the Top Gear Gaming Show (among much else), for her answer. Going back to replay older games can often be a mixed bag, as the lens of youth was Vaseline-thick – and the bar was low when it came to controls, which can ruin a perfectly good nostalgic replay. A good rule of thumb though is that puzzle games generally hold up. I recently spent a LOT of time revisiting Dr. Mario on the Switch (the music is still super catchy). And after a trip home to see the folks, I found my old Game Boy and got re-obsessed with Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening; my poor Link had been left in a complicated dungeon I couldn’t beat. “ I got the remake too – it’s so lovingly done and close to the original that it feels like the greatest remaster of all time: basically the same, but better looking and slightly tweaked to be a better play experience. Its now my go-to Sunday game. Other notable mentions for games that are actually good to revisit: Mario Kart, Super Mario World, the Sonics, Doom, and most point ‘n’ clicks (especially Day of the Tentacle / Sam and Max; avoid Leisure Suit Larry, as it’ll make you weep for women of the past).” If you’ve got a question for Question Block or anything to say about the newsletter, email us on pushingbuttons@guardian.co.uk.",Arts/Games,"Why the pure, uncomplicated Wordle is what viral games are all about",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/18/pushing-buttons-wordle
1/18/2022,"Five payment companies including Mastercard have been fined a total of more than £33m for operating illegal cartels when providing prepaid cards for local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people. The companies were found by the Payment Systems Regulator to have broken competition law by agreeing not to compete with each other for the authorities’ custom.  The regulator said that by acting in this way, the providers may have denied the councils access to cheaper products, and vulnerable people may have missed out on better quality services. The cards in question were used to distribute welfare payments to vulnerable members of society, such as the homeless, victims of domestic violence and asylum seekers. Benefits payments or emergency funds could be uploaded to the cards and used to pay for goods and services without the holder needing access to a bank account. The PSR launched an investigation in October 2017 and carried out dawn raids on premises in February 2018. It found evidence that between 2012 and 2018 five companies – Mastercard, allpay, Advanced Payment Solutions (APS), Prepaid Financial Services (PFS) and Sulion – were involved in a cartel, although some did not participate for all of that time. The cartel was organised against the backdrop of the National Prepaid Cards Network, which was sponsored by Mastercard and brought together public sector bodies that were potentially interested in prepaid cards and programme managers. The five parties arranged for the programme managers not to target or poach each other’s customers, and colluded on the allocation of potential business contacts that came in via network events. Between 2014 and 2016 there was a second cartel involving APS and PFS, with the companies agreeing not to target each other’s public sector customers when a contract was up for renewal, including through a tender. Despite the rule-breaking uncovered by the investigation, vulnerable card recipients would still have received their full benefits, but councils may have paid higher fees than in a competitive market, and there was no incentive for providers to improve the scope of the services. Chris Hemsley, the managing director of the regulator, said: “This investigation and the significant fines we have imposed send a clear message that the PSR has zero tolerance for cartel behaviour.” He added: “This case is particularly serious because the illegal cartel behaviour meant there was less competition and choice for local authorities. This means they may have missed out on cheaper or better-quality products which were used by some of the most vulnerable in society.” Mastercard, which was fined £31.5m, said in a statement: “Mastercard is committed to upholding all regulatory and legal standards and we apologise that the actions of two former employees resulted in the standards expected of us not being met in this instance. “We have taken this issue very seriously and have put further controls and training in place to ensure it cannot occur again, while working with the PSR to settle this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.”",News/Business,Mastercard fined £31.5m over illegal UK prepaid cards cartel ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/mastercard-fined-315m-for-uk-prepaid-cards-cartel
1/18/2022,"Dominic Cummings has published new revelations on his blog, claiming the prime minister was warned on multiple occasions about a party in Number 10 during the first lockdown, where invitees were asked to “bring your own booze” to the garden.  The PM’s former chief adviser, now turned nemesis, was the first to reveal a party organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, during the first lockdown, when it was only permitted to socialise outdoors with one other person. Johnson has admitted he was at the gathering, but claims to believe it was a work event, which he told MPs in the House of Commons. But Cummings now claims Johnson lied to the house – a serious charge – claiming Reynolds was warned the event broke the rules by another senior official and took the PM’s guidance that it should go ahead. He also claims to have told the prime minister himself that the event was against the rules. “The events of 20 May alone, never mind the string of other events, mean the PM lied to parliament about parties,” Cummings wrote on Substack. There are a number of senior officials who worked closely with Cummings and Johnson during that period in Downing Street who are known to have been unnerved by some of the antics in Downing Street. The Guardian has spoken to one official who claims to have raised concerns within the office, and multiple other newspapers and broadcast journalists have also been told concerns were raised – off the record. Cummings claims that his vocal concerns were witnessed by others. “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.” The track record is not great. Cummings had made similar claims before – including that other officials heard the “let the bodies pile high” remark made by the PM ahead of the second lockdown. Though this has been claimed by another source off the record, no one else has ever gone on record. Cummings claims to have told Reynolds in person that his invite broke the rules and that an email was sent by another very senior official. “This email will be seen by Sue Gray (unless there is a foolish cover-up which would also probably be a criminal offence),” Cummings wrote. Cummings then claimed to have told the prime minister in person that the invite broke the rules. “Amid discussion over the future of the cabinet secretary and PPS himself, which had been going on for days, I said to the PM something like: Martin’s invited the building to a drinks party, this is what I’m talking about, you’ve got to grip this madhouse,” he wrote. “The PM waved it aside.” Cummings himself was pictured with a glass of wine next to Reynolds and Johnson, as well as Johnson’s wife Carrie, in the Downing Street garden on 15 May in a picture leaked to the Guardian. Cummings claims that was, indeed, a work event. He said that officials regularly had meetings outside to ensure good ventilation. “The meeting ended roughly 6-6.30. The PM and I continued talking as it broke up.” He said either the PM or Reynolds had brought out a bottle of wine but that they had continued “chatting about Covid, about domestic priorities, and about how to sort out the Cabinet Office which had totally collapsed.” Cummings, a fierce critic of Carrie Johnson, said she was permitted to join them. “Nobody has been as critical of her as I have for her influence on the PM and No 10 but it is an unarguable legal fact that she was allowed by ‘the rules’ to be in the garden in her own home.” Yes, Sue Gray is permitted to interview Cummings who has said he will answer questions. It is not yet clear whether she will decide to do so but his evidence could lead to a major expansion of the investigation – and delay its publication. Cummings himself was infamously found to have breached the first lockdown, though he claimed he was following guidance, when he drove his family to Durham while his wife was sick, and later visited Barnard Castle claiming to have been testing his eyesight for the drive back to London. His excuses, made in a Downing Street rose garden press conference, stretched the limits of credibility. He has since emphasised that his main reason for leaving London were threats he had been receiving and that he believed his family were at risk. There are other times too when Cummings has overpromised and underdelivered – including promising to deliver evidence that former health secretary Matt Hancock had lied, but never published it.",News/Politics,What has Dominic Cummings said about No 10 parties?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/what-has-dominic-cummings-said-about-no-10-parties
1/18/2022,"For Brian Donnelly – known as Kaws since his graffiti beginnings in 1990s New York – art has always been a communication tool. From street art to vast public commissions, he says, “it’s a chance to create a dialogue”. His desire to bring art to the masses is partly why his work spans collectable toys and streetwear collaborations, as well as paintings and sculptures that sell for millions. His new exhibition will allow him to connect with a large number of eyeballs in, he says, “a new and massive way”. The show, New Fiction, is at London’s Serpentine Gallery, and simultaneously on two free online platforms: the gaming behemoth Fortnite and the augmented-reality (AR) app Acute Art. With more than 400m player accounts, Fortnite is massive, especially when compared with the estimated footfall of an average Serpentine show (around 35,000). While the uninitiated might dismiss Fortnite as just another shooting extravaganza, players are increasingly spending time in its more peaceful zones, such as creative mode, where they can mooch about the Fortnite metaverse without fear of elimination. “You can hang out with your friends and explore new features,” says Fortnite’s partnerships director, Kevin Durkin. This could mean honing your dance moves but also watching a film or an Ariana Grande concert (as players did in August 2021), or, as of today, visiting an art gallery.  In April 2020, rapper Travis Scott wowed an audience of 12 million with a show on Fortnite. It was like a stadium concert, only with a lower carbon footprint and rendered in Fortnite graphics (the costume changes were stunning). Donnelly, who had produced the artwork for one of Scott’s tracks, says: “That was the first time that I was, like, ‘Wow, this is such a bigger thing than your impression of what a video game is.’” On a much smaller scale, Donnelly went on to partner with Fortnite for Halloween 2021, enabling players to buy a Kaws “skeleton companion” outfit (or skin). Kaws’ companions are what he’s best known for: a group of characters he created in the 90s that are part cuddly, part cool, with Xs for eyes, each one conveying a very different theme or emotion. Numerous companions can be encountered at the Serpentine show (with yet more to discover in the Fortnite version), alongside vivid abstract paintings. As you enter the physical gallery, the first plinth appears to be empty. To see what’s hovering magically above it, Acute Art’s smartphone app can reveal an AR rendering of a floating companion figure that first appeared in balloon form, as a commission for Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade in 2012. “It’s a work just like any other in the show,” says Donnelly. “Like a bronze sculpture, you want to view it, walk around it, understand the volume.” But you don’t have to go to the gallery to see it. I try the app in my living room and marvel as I view it from all angles, along with a David Shrigley worm. Donnelly first teamed up with Acute Art in 2020 to produce a series of AR public art pieces. It was fortuitous, he says, that it launched just as the world locked down. “Being able to create works,” he says, “and the version that I’m viewing in Brooklyn is the version you could be viewing in India, I just started to get really obsessed with the opportunities within that.” For non-digital natives, enjoying online artworks can require a shift in mindset. The cliched cultural question of modern times used to be, “But is it art?” Now, in the age of virtual shows and NFTs it has become, “But is it real?” Donnelly concedes: “There’s no comparison when standing in front of a painting or a piece of sculpture. So I was sceptical, thinking about digital versions. But when I started working with Acute, [I realised that] working with them is the same back and forth as when I work with the bronze foundry, or the factory that I make toys in. And the quality they achieve, it seems very real.” Donnelly is yet to make an NFT. “I haven’t felt the piece or [had] the thought that made me think, ‘This is the right thing to make one for,’ ” he says. Even so, the unfakeable element of NFTs appeals: “Thinking about my toys, and how many counterfeits are made in the world … Is this a possible way of navigating around that? I don’t know. I’m learning as much as I can. “Being born in 74,” he continues, “you’re witnessing all these things that are new to you. And you can’t assume that the way you’re perceiving something is the way your children will perceive it. And if an NFT is real to the next generation, who’s to say it’s not?” Donnelly’s children are five and seven and, he says: “I’m wondering what it’s going to be like in 10 years, when they’re into screens. I started doing work on the street before social media, before the internet.” And yet Donnelly is living the generation X dream of still being cool to kids today, including my 11-year-old son. “I always think of what reached me in my bedroom in Jersey City, when I was a kid,” he says. “Like, what got me interested in art? It was magazines and skateboard graphics. They got me out of my room and exploring.” He imagines that for many Fortnite players, his exhibition will be “the first time they walk around a space like that, experiencing painting and sculpture in the video game that they’re completely comfortable in and used to.” Just as buying fabric patches from Keith Haring’s Pop Shop in the 1980s helped the young Donnelly feel comfortable walking into galleries, he says: “I’d love to throw bridges to a new generation.” New Fiction, Kaws is at the Serpentine Gallery, London, until 27 February, with an AR version on the Acute Art app. The exhibition is on Fortnite from 3pm GMT on 18 January",Arts/Art and design,‘Who’s to say it’s not real?’ Street artist Kaws on creating Fortnite’s first exhibition,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/18/kaws-fortnite-serpentine-street-art-augmented-reality
