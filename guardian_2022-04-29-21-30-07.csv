4/29/2022,"Four distinct political blocs were revealed by the first round of the French election: a radical left, something approximating a centre-right, the far right, and those who looked at the choices on offer and said “none of the above”. One of many noteworthy things about this French election was how seriously the abstentionists were taken. In his victory speech, Emmanuel Macron acknowledged them directly, saying: “I think as well of all of our fellow countrymen that abstained. Their silence demonstrated a refusal to choose to which we must also respond.” The next morning Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister during Macron’s first term, vowed to change the institutions to address the millions of people who felt a sense of abandonment and didn’t vote. Abstentionism was also covered prominently in the media. TV channels featured a count of abstentions alongside the votes. Le Monde splashed a bar chart comparing the abstentions wiith the candidates’ vote share, and countless articles in the papers discussed why it had happened and what it all meant. The news cycle is notoriously fickle, and to take Macron and Le Maire entirely at their constantly changing word would be foolish, but it does seem there was a recognition among some French political types that Macron was elected on the lowest turnout since Pompidou’s election in 1969 and that he will be governing with the backing of just 38% of registered voters – many of them hesitantly at that. Taking abstentionists seriously is key – especially in an age where voters feel alienated by politics. A recent report on attitudes towards democracy from the IPPR thinktank found that just 6% of voters in Britain think their views are the main influence on government policy, and 55% of 18-24-year-olds believe democracy serves them badly. This chimes with Peter Mair’s classic work of political science, Ruling the Void, which showed that as parties come to resemble each other more closely and disconnect themselves from a mass base, abstention increases. The reduction of politics to different flavours of the same product seems to have driven some of the abstention in France. I spoke to first-round voters who backed Jean-Luc Mélenchon and abstained in the runoff, concerned by the mutual lack of seriousness on the climate crisis between Macron and Marine Le Pen and the degree to which Macron’s government has moved to the right on the far right’s key issues. Discussions of abstention can easily become sucked into misguided debates about privilege – Bernie Sanders supporters who planned to abstain rather than vote for Hillary Clinton were told to check their class and racial privilege. In France, some criticised those who opted for the “white vote” (submitting a blank ballot) in the same terms: “a white vote is white privilege” read some graffiti widely shared on social media. Yet Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest departement in mainland France with a 30% immigrant population, had the highest abstention and blank ballot rate at 47.8% in the second round. A middle-aged mixed-race waiter I spoke to in Bagnolet, Seine-Saint-Denis, told me he thinks of himself as apolitical “because nothing they do will change my little life”– hardly a smug expression of privilege. Overall, abstentionism was significantly more pronounced among poorer people, with an abstention rate of 40% in households with an income of less than €1,250 (£1,050) a month, which then decreased with each more affluent income bracket. Deciding to disengage from politics – at least in terms of voting – is not the decadent bourgeois act it is sometimes painted to be, which is why taking abstention seriously really matters. The Tories are now gaining a reputation as a working-class party because they did better among people in the lower NRS social grades than Labour. Even if we accept these metrics as representative of class in Britain, what this ignores is that huge amounts of working-class people did not vote. Exact statistics are difficult to find, but turnout in the 2019 election was 67.3%, and an analysis by political scientists found that voters in traditional working-class areas were far more likely to abstain than other groups. Macron’s moment of uncharacteristic humility and the French media’s centring of abstentionists were important – and other countries could learn from this. Politicians and journalists publicly acknowledging the problem of abstentionism and actively working to re-engage those voters could play a key role in reviving trust and faith in democracy.

4/29/2022,"A barrister was unlawfully discriminated against by her chambers, which, encouraged by Stonewall, wrongly treated her gender-critical views as transphobic and bigoted, an employment tribunal has been told. Allison Bailey is suing Garden Court chambers and Stonewall after she was asked by her chambers to delete two tweets criticising the LGBTQ+ charity’s position on trans rights and which Stonewall had complained about. Bailey, a lesbian and founder of the gender-critical group LGB Alliance, refused to delete the tweets and alleges unlawful discrimination and victimisation, claiming she suffered detriment at the hands of the chambers, including a reduction in work offered to her by clerks. People who are gender-critical disagree with the view that gender identity should be prioritised over biological sex. As evidence in the case began on Friday, Bailey’s barrister, Ben Cooper QC, told the London central employment tribunal in written submissions: “The claimant’s essential case is that gender identity ideology had become entrenched at an organisational level at Garden Court and, associated with this, importance was attached to the relationship with Stonewall, which resulted in a view of the claimant and her beliefs, at least amongst those dealing with the issues, as being transphobic and bigoted.” Garden Court chambers was a member of Stonewall’s Diversity Champions scheme, under which businesses pay the charity for advice and assessments on creating inclusive workplaces. In one of the two tweets Bailey was later asked to remove, she tweeted thanking the Times for “fairly & accurately reporting on the appalling levels of intimidation, fear & coercion that are driving the @stonewalluk trans self-id agenda”. The tweets led to complaints to the chambers, including one from Stonewall which, Cooper told the tribunal, had been solicited to submit an objection by Michelle Brewer from the chambers’ trans rights working group. Bailey is claiming direct discrimination on the basis of her gender-critical views, which were previously found to be a protected philosophical belief under the Equality Act in the Maya Forstater case. She is also claiming indirect indiscrimination, arguing that the gender critical movement “is comprised predominantly of women and disproportionately of lesbians” and so they were more likely to be disadvantaged by the chambers’ policies. This is disputed by Garden Court chambers which says research by both the Equality and Human Rights Commission and YouGov shows that women are more likely to have positive attitudes towards transgender people than men. It accepts gender-critical views are a protected philosophical believe, but its barrister, Andrew Hochhauser QC, said in written submissions: “The law makes clear that there is a distinction between a protected belief and manner in which it is expressed. There is no licence to abuse.” He told the tribunal Brewer did not procure a complaint from Stonewall, nor did the LGBT campaign group influence the chambers investigation carried out by Maya Sikand QC, a part-time judge and member of Garden Court’s management board. He said that Sikand received advice from Cathryn McGahey QC, vice-chair of the Bar Council’s ethics committee, and that the two tweets were “probably over the borderline of acceptable conduct”. Hochhauser added: “The outcome was that she [Bailey] was asked to delete the two tweets. She refused. Nothing happened. No further action was taken. She remains at Garden Court.” He called the claim that clerks withheld work from Bailey “ludicrous” and said it was not supported by any written or oral evidence. The hearing is expected to last for four weeks.",News/Law,"Barrister was discriminated against for gender-critical views, tribunal hears",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/29/barrister-allison-bailey-stonewall-discriminated-against-for-gender-critical-views-tribunal-hears

Sarah Malcolm, a servant, was convicted of murdering her mistress and two other members of the household – but insisted she was innocent. It was a notorious case and Hogarth obtained access to her cell in Newgate prison, where he sketched her two days before she was to be hanged. Her eyes are sad and pensive, looking away from us as if she is going over her life in her thoughts. Hogarth seems sympathetic to her in his visual language. He would probably have made her face more brutal if he believed her guilty. She is portrayed as a victim of a dark and labyrinthine justice system whose shadows surround her as it prepares to swallow her up.

4/29/2022,"When you’ve seen one laser carving clouds of smoke to create illusory 3D spaces that warp and shift before your eyes, you’ve seen them all. And I saw this special effect in Back to the Future: The Musical, so the two installations that use it in the latest subterranean art spectacular in the cavernous club-like depths of 180 The Strand cut no dry ice with me. There are other parallels between this exhibition and Back to the Future, which is at the Adelphi, down the street. Both are science fiction. But whereas the story of Marty McFly and his time-travelling DeLorean wittily plays with ideas about crossing your own timelines, there are no ideas or wit in Future Shock. It is a light show without a gig. The electro music accompanying most of the installations sounds so samey in its soothing beeps that it just washed over me. At least in Back to the Future you get some laughs, and a car flies over the audience at the end. This is like being at a pretentious nightclub where no one dances. It started well, with a cinematic environment by Ryoichi Kurokawa that’s like a canyon dwarfed by two towering projections, one pastoral, the other urban. Trees and rocks, corridors and rooms melt and shapeshift and finally merge in a captivating visual rush that feels like a real glimpse of the art of the future. As virtual reality and AI make our capacity to generate – or get machines to generate – almost infinitely supple spaces and images, what can’t artists create? Illusion is back. Visual sensation is back. O brave new world, I thought, as I moved through the gloom into the next space where blue lights had me bedazzled. But the mind can only go five minutes or so without wanting to piece everything together and find meaning. It quickly transpires there is none here. Lawrence Lek’s virtual-reality sci-fi film about an imaginary post-apocalyptic China looks good(ish) yet rambles pointlessly: it is a game waiting for a player. Weirdcore, “one of the UK’s leading audiovisual artists”, isn’t anything like weird enough, just putting you in a chillout space with mildly interesting patterns and sounds. And so it goes on: a succession of gimmicky entertainments that try to disguise with slick sound and vision their fundamental absence of purpose. The artists in Future Shock may well be at the cutting edge technically, but even if the great art of tomorrow is made with digital media and machine learning, it won’t look like this. Art needs content, intellect, emotion and poetry – or at least a couple of those – but this is just an urban son et lumière. The world is filling with “creatives” who play about with digital toys and create groovy effects that don’t have much function but to distract. That is fine, in its place: the skills demonstrated here could, and probably will, provide nightclub atmosphere, theatre designs and rock-festival lighting to set the sky on fire. Fantastic. Just don’t claim it is art. It is all so slick. Nothing shocks or offends. Can this be a deeper problem with virtual reality as art? The truth may be that we need the sordid, irritating presence of filthy life to feel something as art. The only sign of that here is in a freaky installation by Actual Objects that confronts you with talking, lifesize virtual human beings. Moving, gesticulating and speaking in horribly real yet obviously unreal ways, these uneasy simulacra of ourselves are genuinely disturbing. This is proper science fiction. Will we soon be in a world where it’s hard to tell actual humans from fake ones? One of the characters is a ranting middle American guy who held me with his asinine views and unnerving actuality. That was a bit of real future shock, from deep in the uncanny valley. Then it was back to lights dancing in the dark and music they found on scrap paper in Brian Eno’s bins. I suppose you could take reassurance from this. If the future is no worse than a slightly silly labyrinth of pretty but ephemeral electronica, we will be lucky. Outside, the news was waiting. If you need mindless escapism from the real world, this is as close to it as an art exhibition can get.

4/29/2022,"In mid-October, as Sir Gary Hickinbottom’s commission of inquiry into the government of British Virgin Islands led by the premier, Andrew Fahie, was taking laborious public oral evidence for a 44th day, a US Drug Enforcement Administration informant was, according to court papers, meeting some self-proclaimed Lebanese Hezbollah operatives on the BVI island of Tortola to discuss how to shift cocaine through the territory en route to Puerto Rico, Miami and New York. Hickinbottom was taking mind-numbingly dull evidence on how to apply for BVI citizenship, and whether the process was open to manipulation. The DEA source acting as a Mexican drug-runner, meanwhile, according to the court papers, was setting up a series of meetings that was to conclude with the arrest on Thursday of Fahie onboard a private jet in Miami where he was allegedly being shown designer shopping bags containing $700,000 as payment for the intended storing of 3,000kg of cocaine for four days. The payment was to keep the stash from the inquiring eyes of the port authorities, and police, the papers filed in Florida claim. Fahie is expected to appear in court in Miami on Friday in relation to the charges. Ironically, the day before, Fahie, unaware that all his meetings were being recorded and videoed, had confided to what he believed to be the Mexican drug-runner, but was in fact a DEA informant, that he “believed in witches and magic, and how to read lies in people”, according to the papers. The contrast between the stately evidence-gathering of the commission of inquiry and the methods of the US police agencies could not be more stark: Yes Minister meets Miami Vice. Indeed before his arrest on Thursday, Fahie had thought he would survive politically, an interview with the Guardian in November suggested. He believed the as yet unpublished Hickinbottom inquiry might reveal maladministration, inefficiency and corners cut, but overall the initial lurid allegations of corruption made at the commission’s launch by Augustus Jaspert, the previous BVI governor, in January 2021 were, he thought, going to be unproven. Fahie and his fellow ministers – represented at the inquiry by the Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox – had used the court hearings to mount a counter case alleging the colonial UK government had been improperly interfering with the work of the elected politicians. Cox, whose work for the BVI resulted in allegations that he was moonlighting, had been assiduous in arguing that the London government over-reached its mandate. Hickinbottom submitted his report, known to contain 40 recommendations, to John Rankin, the current governor, before Easter, but he took his time to digest its contents before a deferred publication, probably in June. There is no indication whether or not he knew of the DEA sting operation. Certainly it is clear from the affidavit submitted to the Miami court on Thursday by Special Agent Shad Aschelman that the DEA operation had been under way since October. But it was not until 20 March the BVI port authority managing director, Oleanvine Maynard, and her son Kadeem allegedly met with what the affidavit describes as a DEA confidential source (CS). The CS told Maynard he was a member of the Sinaloa drug cartel and he needed a BVI port to store an initial 3,000 tonnes cocaine for 24 to 48 hours until “a window was open” to take the shipment on to Puerto Rico, the papers say. Maynard said they could get the licences, and added they would set up “shell companies” into which the payments to her could be made. She allegedly demanded an upfront payment. Her son, according to DEA audio, allegedly said he had been drug-running for 20 years. According to the papers, the CS asked if the premier would want to be involved. Referring to the premier as “head coach”, Maynard allegedly said: “I know the type of person he is. If he sees an opportunity, he will take it. He is a little crook sometimes. He is not always straight.” The CS allegedly gave Maynard $20,000 as a goodwill gesture. The next day, 22 March, less than a fortnight before Hickinbottom submitted his report on 5 April, Kadeem allegedly texted the CS on WhatsApp to say: “The head coach wants to play with the team this season.” The CS had explained he could get the drugs to the BVI for about $4,000 a kg, but it would sell for $26,000 or $28,000 in Miami and for up to $38,000 in New York, the papers say. On 23 March, Kadeem allegedly explained that “head coach” was in, but he needed $500,000 up front to square another government official and to sort out the airports. On 7 April Fahie and the CS allegedly met on Tortola where the premier, the DEA says, complained he was not paid much by the British government. The CS proposed Fahie be given a 12% cut of the sales in return for allowing the cocaine to pass through the BVI ports. Fahie, according to the affidavit, pulled out a calculator and worked out the street value of the cocaine in Miami was $78m, and if he got 10% he would receive $7.8m At one point during the meeting the confidential informant allegedly gave Fahie $20,000, saying: “This is a good faith gift to seal that we have an agreement.” Fahie allegedly seemed suspicious of the DEA informant, asking him if he was an undercover operative. The CS said he was not and reassured Fahie: “Well, first of all, you’re not touching anything” – a reference to the planned shipments of cocaine. Fahie allegedly replied: “I will touch one thing, the money.” He allegedly said Britain had been trying to get him out of office for years, adding: “I have plenty of people and I don’t sell them out to the British with their plans. Their plans are to catch people, they want to capture people but me I see what they are doing and protect people.” It was agreed that on 27 April $700,000 would be ready on a private jet at Opa Locka airport in Miami for Maynard to take back to the BVI, the court papers claim. In Miami the CS allegedly went through the plans for the payment one more time with Fahie explaining $1m was coming down from New York. It would be divided into sums of $700,000 and $300,000 for CS operatives in Mexico. Fahie was then allegedly taken to the plane to see the money in the designer bags that was due to be flown to the BVI. It was there on the plane that he was arrested and he claimed: “Why I am being arrested – I do not have any drugs or money?”",News/World news,‘Head coach wants to play’: the US drug sting that led to BVI premier’s arrest ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/head-coach-wants-play-us-drug-sting-bvi-premier-arrest-andrew-fahie
4/29/2022,"Russian intelligence was behind a chemical attack on Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel peace prize-winning editor of the Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, US officials have said. Muratov has previously said he boarded a train on 18 April heading from Moscow to the city of Samara when he was splashed with red paint containing acetone by an attacker who told him: “Muratov, this is for you from our boys.” At the time, the veteran journalist posted on his Telegram channel photographs of his face and body covered in red oil paint, saying his eyes were “burning terribly” after the assault. The US declassified intelligence assessment, first reported by the Washington Post, concluded that the operatives were working for unnamed Russian spy services. Since Novaya Gazeta was founded by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has covered some of the country’s most sensitive topics, including the wars in Chechnya, the persecution of the LGBTQ+ community and Russian government corruption inside and outside the country. Six of its journalists, including Anna Politkovskaya, have been killed in retaliation for their reporting. The paper announced on 28 March it was suspending operations for the duration of the war after it received repeated warnings from the state censor, Roskomnadzor. Hours after the train attack on Muratov, a pro-Russian military telegram channel called “Union Z paratroopers” claimed responsibility for the incident, posting footage of the attack online. According to an English translation of the post, the group vowed to “come after” those supporting what it claimed were lies about alleged atrocities that took place in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, outside Kyiv. “As we promised, in the near future our veterans will remind the ‘great patriots’ that the blood of our Glorious Sons will not go unanswered. You, bastards, write about the Ukrainian-invented ‘Bucha tragedy’ and support this lie, but you don’t notice how our guys’ throats are cut! We will come after all of you, just wait!!!,” read the group’s statement, which has since been deleted. A Novaya Gazeta investigation also linked the attack to the Union Z paratroopers group, identifying one of the alleged attackers as the Russian far-right activist Nikolai Trifonov. Pavel Kanygin, a former Novaya Gazeta journalist and longtime colleague of Muratov, said it was “very likely” the country’s security services were behind the assault. “I believe the American intelligence is correct. I am 100% sure this sort of attack can’t happen without the prior knowledge and approval of Russia’s security services,” Kanygin said. “The fact that Trifonov has not yet been investigated further shows the authorities condone these actions,” Kanygin added. Muratov, who received the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for his efforts to support journalistic freedoms in Russia, had initially decided to continue publishing Novaya Gazeta while obeying a number of Roskomnadzor rules that forbade journalists from describing the conflict as a “war” or “invasion”. However, at the end of March, Novaya Gazeta announced it was halting its publication until the end of what Russia calls its “special operation” to avoid being shut down and losing its licence. Since the start of the war, Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on protesters, independent news outlets and foreign social media networks. In early March, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, signed off on a draconian law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. A group of Novaya Gazeta journalists this month launched a Europe-based media outlet called Novaya Gazeta Europe without Muratov. On Thursday, Novaya Gazeta Europe announced Roskomnadzor had blocked access to its website in Russia.",News/World news,"Russian intelligence behind poisoning of Nobel-laureate editor, says US",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russian-intelligence-behind-poisoning-of-nobel-journalist-dmitry-muratov-says-us
4/29/2022,"The online electrical goods seller AO has warned that its profits will dive this year as it faces falling sales and customers cancelling warranties on its products to save money amid the cost of living crisis. It said underlying profits would be only £8m for the year to 31 March 2022, down from £64m last year, reflecting higher costs from driver shortages, extra marketing spending in Germany as well as lower sales and warranty cancellations. Sales fell 6% to £1.6bn in the year but remain 52% ahead of pre-Covid levels. The company said it had noticed “higher warranty cancellations than average historical trends” in March as customers “responded to the escalating cost of living”. It said the latest trading figures indicated the trend was continuing, potentially forcing a writedown of the value of its insurance contract leading to a “material impact on full-year profits”. The company also said its spare cash had shrunk since March, when it stood at £50m, and it continued to review its German business where competition “remained intense”, leading to higher costs. AO said it was delaying the reporting of its full-year results for up to two months because of the complex calculations, particularly given its German business review. Shares in AO dived more than 20% to 69p on Friday morning, as the company said consumer demand for electrical goods had “progressively weakened”, which was compounded by global supply chain disruption and affecting product availability. There was also concern about future performance. AO said: “In view of the volatile market conditions, inflationary cost pressures and logistical challenges in the supply chain, together with the escalating cost of living for consumers, we remain cautious about our revenue and profit outlook in the near term.” The warning comes after Sainsbury’s, the owner of Argos, warned this week that it expected sales of general merchandise items such as TVs, computers and washing machines to fall this year as consumers grew more cautious. It also highlighted production and port delays in China, where the Covid pandemic has led to a string of city-wide lockdowns. AO’s share price also came under pressure as John Roberts, the group’s founder and chief executive, announced plans to sell £5m shares, or about 5% of his holding, over the coming year. Andrew Wade, an analyst at Jefferies, said he was not expecting profits to recover in the year ahead. He said AO had missed his profit expectations by more than a quarter. The figures for the year to March indicated that sales in the UK fell by about 15% in the final six months, he added, which was “clearly a disappointing trend”. However, he noted that AO continued to take a larger share of the shrinking market.",News/Business,Appliance seller AO forecasts profits to dive as consumers cut spending,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/appliance-seller-ao-forecasts-profits-to-dive-as-consumers-cut-spending
4/29/2022,"Perched to the south-west of the borough of Bury, Radcliffe has long been a place of contradictions and political turmoil. The packed terrace houses, once homes to workers in a thriving paper industry, have sweeping views over lush green fields. These wards in the town, north of Manchester, see some of the area’s tightest fights – split between Labour, the Conservatives and the independent group Radcliffe First. The two constituency seats in Bury are among the UK’s most marginal, turning Conservative in 2019 when Bury South’s Tory MP, Christian Wakeford, dramatically defected to Labour over growing anger with Boris Johnson. His predecessor, Ivan Lewis, quit Labour amid a disciplinary process and had campaigned for Wakeford. James Daly, Wakeford’s northern Tory neighbour, has an even tighter seat – 105 votes – the most marginal in England. Both Boris Johnson and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, have campaigned here in recent weeks. As a longtime Labour activist, Paddy Hennessy, put it: “If we don’t win both of these back then we might as well pack it all up now.” Despite the ostensibly favourable political climate, Labour has jitters about Bury, where every seat is up for re-election. Starmer launched his local campaign in the town, unusual for a council that Labour already holds. Nick Jones, the leader of the Conservative group, says he has “no doubt” his party could gain seats, possibly moving the council to no overall control. The Labour leaflets on Wednesday night are targeted at the independents with a picture of Johnson, “he wants you to vote Radcliffe First” – a sign of how Johnson is now seen as an electoral asset for Labour. But the Conservatives have kept their campaigning focused on the incumbent Labour council and away from national politics – with no pictures of Johnson in sight – including opposing plans for green belt homes, the Greater Manchester clean air charges and on potholes. “When we knock on doors, we’re not there to talk about Downing Street. We talk about potholes in their street. The street lights, the bins. Ultimately, it’s a tired, out-of touch Labour council,” Jones says. Both parties are fighting to take the credit for a new Radcliffe high school, one that briefly hit the media spotlight when Wakeford said Tory whips had threatened to cancel it if he rebelled. Wakeford is Bury’s most famous defector – but out in the evening light is Gareth Staples-Jones, who defected to Labour in the same week as Wakeford, though from Radcliffe First. Born to a Labour-supporting family, he is canvassing a few streets from the paper mill where his grandfather was a wagon driver. On the corner of the street is the terrace house where his mum grew up. “I get so emotional about Radcliffe,” he says. “These streets have three generations of families living on them, not many places are like this any more. I’ve been in so many kitchens talking about things like antisocial behaviour. And I solve it that week, but then six months later the problem is back. You start to realise that people need bigger change on a national level, money, gaps in the law. That means everything round here. That’s why I made the jump to Labour.” At each house, there is a new, diverse opinion, from full-throated Labour, to Conservative supporters, to many undecideds. Most people bring up Partygate, but often the disparaging comments seep out into general condemnation of politicians. “All the main parties irritate me,” says Sue Kagan in her neat front garden. “None of them speak for us. With Labour, it was Corbyn who did it for me. I’ve usually vote Green as the alternative. But it does feel there is a real disconnect even more with people’s everyday struggles and politicians.” Starmer’s efforts to change the party have been noticed but many express scepticism about the Labour leader. One voter called down the drive, “tell Keir to be a bit bolder”. Another longtime Labour voter, 61-year-old Loretta Anthony, said she disliked Starmer. “I am really wavering this time, I’m sorry to say I don’t like the guy. We really need someone with a bit of backbone, to stand up to people who say ‘oh you can’t do this or that, it’s not right’.” But Johnson is similarly unpopular. “He’s a clown.” The cost of living is the other key factor on people’s minds. Rich Shaw, 31, is another waverer, but says he will vote next week. “I want to know exactly what each party says about getting people into work, getting good pay, good hours,” he says. There are still many staunch Labour voters, who mention a long family association. “Labour is for the working class,” Susan Henderson, a care home worker, says from her doorstep. “When Labour was in power, that’s what they were for. The Conservatives are happy for the rich to get richer and poor to get poorer.” Staples-Jones is optimistic that the anger he is hearing on the doorstep can be channelled into positive action for change. “When you really strip down voting, it’s about an emotional decision about how people feel – and the main thing they are feeling is pissed off. They need to know there are people who understand that, who feel the same way they do and that they are going to fight for their best interests.” He concedes his own seat hangs in the balance – but says he would not be deterred if he loses, describing a new sense of motivation among activists. “I feel excited and energised now. It’s a reawakening.” Labour are tentatively optimistic about getting a better hearing from Jewish people. A number of young Charedi families have moved into Radcliffe in recent years and Hennessy also canvasses in Prestwich, which has a large secular Jewish community. Most people in Labour are cautious about whether Starmer has won back those who rejected the party under Corbyn. There is talk of “long Corbyn” among Jewish and “red wall” voters who disliked the previous leader. But there are small signs of progress. Hennessy estimates around 10-15 people every session – about 150 homes – are switching. Several say Wakeford has made an effort to be a voice on antisemitism, though last week he was confronted by angry voters at an event at Whitefield synagogue, who said they felt “cheated” by his defection. But this election it is the Tories who are feeling more heat on antisemitism – two Conservative councillors have had party support withdrawn after antisemitic Facebook posts were unearthed. Several Labour activists recount how appalling the atmosphere was in 2019 among Jewish voters. “We used to get shouted off the doorstep and now we aren’t,” Staples-Jones says. “Two years out from an election, that is not such a bad place to work from.”",News/Politics,Marginal Bury gives Labour local election jitters as Tories circle,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/marginal-bury-gives-labour-local-election-jitters-as-tories-circle
4/29/2022,"Moscow has confirmed it carried out an airstrike on Kyiv during a visit by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, as Ukraine acknowledged heavy losses from Russia’s attack in the east but said the invader’s casualties were “colossal”. The defence ministry in Moscow said in its daily briefing on Friday that two “high-precision, long-range air-based weapons” had destroyed the production buildings of the Artyom missile and space enterprise in the Ukrainian capital on Thursday night. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Friday one body had so far been recovered from the rubble of a 25-storey residential building in the capital’s Shevchenkivskyi district after the strike, which Guterres’s spokesperson described as “shocking”. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the US-funded media organisation, said one of its staff, the journalist and producer Vera Gyrych, had died “as a result of a Russian missile hitting the house where she lived” in one of the strikes during Guterres’s visit. The missile attack, which came a day after Guterres met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow and soon after his talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, drew international criticism and a furious response from Kyiv. The Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, on Friday described the strikes – denounced by the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as a “heinous act of barbarism” – as “an attack on the security of the secretary general and on world security”. Lord Malloch-Brown, the former UN deputy secretary general, said the international community “will recognise they cannot have their UN secretary general treated in this disrespectful, casual and frankly, dangerous way, by Putin”. Zelenskiy said overnight that the attack “says a lot about Russia’s true attitude to global institutions, about the efforts of the Russian leadership to humiliate the UN and everything that the organisation represents. It requires a strong response.” A day after the US president, Joe Biden, called on Congress to send up to $33bn (£26bn) to help Kyiv, Ukraine said it was taking heavy losses as Moscow’s forces, having failed to seize the capital, redoubled their efforts to fully capture the eastern Donbas region. But it said casualties in the invading army were even worse. “We have serious losses, but the Russians’ losses are much much bigger … They have colossal losses,” a Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Friday. Britain’s defence ministry on Friday backed up that assessment, saying Donbas remained Russia’s strategic focus but due to strong Ukrainian resistance, “Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces”. Zelinskiy’s office said Russia was pounding the entire frontline in Donetsk, one of the two Donbas provinces, with rockets, artillery, mortar bombs and aircraft, while Ukraine’s general staff said Russia was shelling positions along the line of contact. The governor of the eastern city of Kharkiv, Oleg Sinegubov, said on Friday five civilians had been killed on Thursday in what he described as almost continuous shelling, with more than 2,000 buildings damaged or destroyed since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February. Zelenskiy’s office also said an operation was planned on Friday to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, the devastated south-eastern port city that has been the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting and the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war. “An operation to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal factory is planned for today,” it said in a statement. The sprawling steel plant is the site of Ukrainian troops’s last stand in the besieged city but is also sheltering hundreds of civilians. Russia last week said it had gained full control of Mariupol except for the huge industrial area. Guterres said on Thursday the UN was doing “everything possible” to ensure the evacuation of civilians from the “apocalypse” in Mariupol and Osnat Lubrani, a UN representative to Ukraine said on Friday she was travelling to nearby Zaporizhzhia to prepare for a “hopeful” evacuation. Britain’s government said on Friday it was sending experts to help Ukraine with gathering evidence and prosecuting war crimes, with a team due to arrive in Poland in early May to investigate what the UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, called Russian “barbarity … and vile atrocities, including against women”. The bodies of 1,150 civilians have been recovered in the region around Kyiv since the withdrawal of Russian troops from the area earlier this month, with 50-70% of the corpses displaying bullet wounds from small arms, the Kyiv police force said. Ukrainian prosecutors said they had identified 10 Russian soldiers suspected of committing war crimes – including premeditated murder, cruel treatment and other violations – in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha during their occupation of the town in March. The UK is also deploying about 8,000 troops as well as 72 tanks and 120 armoured fighting vehicles, artillery guns, helicopters and drones for exercises across eastern Europe, defence officials said in a statement. “The security of Europe has never been more important,” the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said, calling it “one of the largest shared deployments since the cold war”.",News/World news,Russia carries out airstrike on Kyiv during UN chief’s visit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-carries-out-airstrike-on-kyiv-during-un-chief-visit-ukraine-antonio-guterres
4/29/2022,"Those of us with a hatred of costume drama are in good company. Although the three actors of Stute theatre turn up for their tribute to the Brontë sisters, I Am No Bird, in regulation bonnets and historically accurate cotton dresses, something is amiss. After a pretty piano song, they try reading some Brontë prose. But the corsets are too tight and the mood too genteel. The passages come across as melodramatic where they should be impassioned. Instead of the maverick Brontës, they are giving us heritage theatre. It can’t last. In something of the iconoclastic spirit of Isobel McArthur’s Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of), they strip back the trappings of chocolate-box history in an attempt to capture what made the sisters striking in the first place. Breaking the rules was one of them. It isn’t long before they’re dropping the needlework in favour of talking to the audience, taking phone calls and appearing to go off script. In a cheerful hour-long show, they run briskly through the story of Charlotte, Anne and Emily – plus ambivalent mention of brother Branwell. They alight in particular on the advice of poet laureate Robert Southey that “literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life: and it ought not to be”. That was just a forewarning of the male-centric publishing industry and misogynistic press to come. Central to this all-female show is the principle of women’s empowerment. Sophia Hatfield, who co-writes with director Lisa Cagnacci, plays Charlotte as a woman torn between obedience and rebelliousness, trying to keep control of her own play even as she recognises the creative disruptiveness of her sisters. “Is it advisable to bring someone like Heathcliff into the world?” she asks Emily, uncertain whether to be shocked or thrilled. Claire-Marie Seddon’s Emily, the least conformist, has no time for such reticence. Emma Swan’s Anne is happy to go with the flow. When in doubt, they whip out the trumpet, violin and clarinet, set up a vocal loop and sing sweet harmonies under the musical direction of Farhaan Aamir Shah. It makes for a bright and breezy show, but for all its anarchic impulses, it remains at heart a biographical drama, dedicated to the facts as much as the feminism.  At Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, until 30 April. Then touring until 14 May.",Arts/Stage,I Am No Bird review – stripping back the Brontës’ chocolate-box history ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/29/i-am-no-bird-review-stephen-joseph-theatre-scarborough
4/29/2022,"From the arid moonscapes surrounding Almería to the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada outside Grenada and the dense forests north of Seville, Andalucía is a destination like no other. This rugged swathe of southern Spain is home to endless sunshine, Moorish castles, sugar-cube pueblos blancos, jaw-dropping landscapes and a vast choice of produce. Olive groves, vineyards, wheat fields, black Iberian pigs snuffling through meadows for acorns, rice fields, trees laden with almonds, figs, citrus fruits and pomegranates – it is as lush and plentiful as it is rich in gastronomic history. Over the centuries, the Phoenicians, Romans and Moors have all left their mark, not only on the territory itself but also on the plate, creating a unique amalgam of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and North African flavours – augmented with a slew of vegetables that came later from South and Central America. And, impossible to ignore, the cerulean Mediterranean is alive with silvery anchovies, sardines, squid, red mullet, crab and fat prawns, joined on the Atlantic coast of Cádiz by the famously succulent atún rojo (bluefin tuna), which is still caught frequently using a technique developed by the ancient Phoenicians. The landscape is covered with vineyards, olive groves, citrus fruits and wheat fields Cruise through one of the region’s colourful food markets, such as Málaga’s Atarazanas – which is particularly bountiful thanks to its proximity to the fertile Axarquía hinterland – to marvel at the cornucopia. Cádiz and Seville boast their own diversity of produce, extending to bull’s meat, retinto beef, white truffles and seasonal snails. The Atarazanas market in Málaga Drop into any streetside tapas bar and the offerings will include olives, boquerones (marinated anchovies), chorizo, jamón serrano, tortilla and maybe a bowl of gazpacho. This chilled soup is quintessential Andalucía, a fusion of fresh summer vegetables that may well have evolved from a recipe said to have been imported by the Romans, with tomatoes from the Americas piling in centuries later – history in a bowl. Boquerones, a dish of marinated anchovies, is a tapas staple Move up an echelon and you’re likely to be dished up gambas pil pil (prawns cooked in garlic, chilli, paprika and olive oil), berenjenas con miel (fried battered aubergines drizzled in honey) and remojón – a luscious salad of cod, olive and orange doused in extra virgin olive oil, the leitmotif of every tapa. Gambas, olives and berenjenas con miel And then there’s Andalucía’s fine dining scene, led by its 18 Michelin-star restaurants. Situated just outside of Cádiz, Angel León’s peerless three-star temple of seafood, Aponiente, is its apex. This is followed by two-starred entries for the exquisite seasonal dishes at Ronda’s Bardal, wild creativity at Marbella’s Skina, and a slick revamp of Moorish recipes at Córdoba’s theatrical Noor. Whatever the establishment, wine naturally enters the frame. Andalucía’s renowned tipple is sherry – aged in barrels over decades, whether in the original Jérez region or in Montilla-Moriles, just south of Córdoba. A visit to a bodega is a must. Everyone develops a taste for a specific type; from bone-dry fino and saltier manzanilla (classics with seafood and tapas), through to fuller amontillados and palo cortados (served with game, chicken, blue cheese or foie gras) to the more honeyed oloroso and, sweetest of all, raisiny pedro ximénez. But sherry is not all that’s on offer, and another of Andalucía’s pleasures is sampling its burgeoning variety of unfortified wines, including some produced in Europe’s only desert near Almería – yet another Andalucian anomaly. Andalucía’s signature drink is sherry, aged in barrels in the Jérez region or in Montilla-Moriles Where to staySo where to indulge in this dazzling abundance? Ikos Andalusia – a new, luxury all-inclusive resort on the shores of Playa Guadalmansa near Marbella - makes an excellent base. Among its 8.5 hectares (21 acres) are no less than seven restaurants, where Michelin-starred chefs and master mixologists use Andalucía’s ingredients to create tantalising menus, taking guests on a gastronomic journey around the Med and beyond. Ikos Andalusia Start with all things Spanish at Oliva restaurant, where traditional tapas such as croquetas, gazpacho and pimientos vie with its signature paellas – seafood, vegetable and chicken takes on Spain’s national dish are available, as are plates showcasing the region’s ultra-fresh fish and tender Iberian pork. Paella at Oliva For those keen to dig deeper into the food scene of the region, Ikos runs its Dine Out programme, where guests can eat at some of the area’s favourite restaurants for no extra cost. With options in Marbella and Estepona, you can dine like the locals do along the beachfront or in the picturesque alleyways of Estepona’s old town. Clockwise from top left: chef Anthony Jehanno; Ikos Andalusia’s Provence restaurant; outdoor dining at the Ouzo restaurant; chef Lefteris Lazarou Back at the resort, Provence restaurant is the place to take in sweeping views of the Mediterranean while sampling sophisticated southern French dishes by Michelin-star chef Anthony Jehanno: think tuna tartare, sea bass carpaccio or that perennial gourmet favourite, duck rillettes. From Gallic to Greek, Ouzo offers modern Greek cuisine with a menu devised by Michelin-star chef Lefteris Lazarou, who makes seafood the star – fish soup laced with Kozani saffron, Saganaki prawns or slow-cooked octopus. A short hop away, at the informal Fresco, another Michelin-star chef, Ettore Botrini, artfully showcases Italian cucina with lux pastas, outstanding pizzas and cooling desserts such as slippery panna cotta speckled with berries. Sunset at Ikos Andalusia Next, for an elegant pan-Asian and fusion dining experience, head to Anaya, where Thai chef Thiou serves up spicy tom yum soup, fragrant curries and fresh Thai salads. And for relaxed dining, families can enjoy sea views and Mediterranean plates at Flavors, while the all-day Beach Club offers healthy international dishes: salads, ceviches, seafood, grilled meats and innovative vegan plates. Then kick back with a cocktail, lapping up the balmy Mediterranean air and ambient DJ sounds as you watch the sun dip over Andalucía.

4/29/2022,"We’re sprawled under mulberry trees on a Turkish divan – a rickety platform strewn with kilim cushions and low tables – wondering how it gets better than this: gorging on freshly squeezed pomegranate juice and traditional gözleme, a Turkish crepe cooked over an open wood fire and filled with crumbly white cheese and spinach, after our walk through the “ghost village” of Kayaköy. This tranquil tableau of crumbling homes and hearths, hillside chapels and pathways – which inspired Louis de Bernieres’s epic novel Birds Without Wings – sits among south-west Turkey’s outstanding collection of classical-era archaeological sites. But after seeing our share of 2,000-year-old temples, theatres and tottering colonnades at the likes of Patara and Xanthos, Tlos and Pinara, it’s something else to wander the sun-bleached shell of this village, abandoned amid geo-political turmoil early in the last century. There’s something of interest for all of us, whether it’s the lessons of Turkey’s recent history (the adults), the many tortoises and goats (the children) or the promise of the gözleme (the teenagers). Hillside Beach Club nestles in Fethiye Bay This alluring corner of Turkey has been welcoming holidaymaking families for decades – and creating lifetime returnees of many. It’s easy to see what brings them back, not least because it’s home to world-class resorts, such as Hillside Beach Club (more about that later), but also because of the exceptional variety of activities on offer. From Kayaköy, we’re headed just around the corner to take the leap from the almost 2,000-metre summit of Babadağı mountain, the starting point for one of the world’s great paragliding rides. After an exhilarating 20 minutes in the air, in tandem with experienced pilots, we put down with barely a bump on the beach at the popular resort of Ölüdeniz. The ruins of Patara feature a 2,000-year-old amphitheatre and crumbling colonnades Talking of beaches, some of the Mediterranean’s best are found along Turkey’s Turquoise Coast, as the concertina of island-strewn bays and pine-clad coves around the port city of Fethiye is known. To understand why the name has stuck, look no further than the exquisite family-friendly lagoon at Ölüdeniz or the magnificent pristine strands at Dalyan and Patara – where an enforced ban on development protects the populations of nesting loggerhead turtles. Elsewhere along the coast, a full range of watersports including sailing, sea kayaking, paddleboarding, wakeboarding and scuba are widely available. Gözleme, a traditional Turkish flatbread filled with white cheese and spinach On land, the roster of activities is no less impressive, with the region’s network of way-marked walking trails especially hard to beat. Chief among these is the 300-mile Lycian Way from Fethiye to Antalya, one of Turkey’s greatest walking routes. Others choose to explore dramatic canyons such as Saklikent or go mountain biking, while those looking for something more gentle take to boats, snorkelling and sunning themselves among the so-called “Twelve Islands” (there are in fact more) scattered across Fethiye Bay. Watersports at Fethiye Bay With all this and a restorative Turkish bath to squeeze in, not forgetting the excellent shopping, it’s often a case of stretching the day to make time for Fethiye’s atmospheric fish market, where guests have only to pick from the heaped seafood stalls for their selection to appear, cooked to order, at their table. Hillside Beach Club has three private beaches Add to this the winning hospitality of the locals, and the season-long sunshine, and it only remains to decide on the best place from which to enjoy the Turquoise Coast. Look no further than Hillside Beach Club, tucked into the most perfect of Fethiye Bay’s endless nooks and crannies. Nowhere along the coast nails the needs of families quite like this resort, backed by lush forests and fronted by three private beaches. In the main beach, you’ll find a world-class watersports centre offering every conceivable boarding or boating activity – even barely conceivable ones such as fliteboarding, a motorised surfboard which allows users to hover over the waves at high speed. Other beaches offer kid-free escapes for the adults (add beachfront cocktails), and a protected 300-metre swimming lane. Relax in style, or take part in a range of family activities Hillside Beach Club offers facilities for every family, regardless of the age of its members. Older children can join their parents for a range of family activities including yoga classes, sailing and diving lessons, and creative arts workshops, while there’s a “baby park” for infants up to three, plus a baby buffet and even a dedicated chef to cater for the more demanding tastes of toddlers in the main restaurant. More developed tastebuds are catered for with a spread of Turkish, Mediterranean and Italian flavours, open grills, wood-fired ovens, and the all important ice cream corner. In short, the place – like the Turquoise Coast itself – has it all. Truly, it doesn’t get better than this.

4/29/2022,"Boris Johnson is allowing a “wild west” culture of misogyny to grow in Westminster by failing to tackle “the arrogance of privately educated men,” England’s only female metro mayor has said. Tracy Brabin, the Labour mayor for West Yorkshire, said: “The idea that somebody who was elected by the public is watching pornography on his phone whilst being at work – I think it’s an aggressive act in the first instance, because women and others will see you doing that. And it’s an arrogance that they are above the law. “I think unfortunately it comes from the top. This behaviour will only get worse because of the dereliction of duty of the leader. If you don’t lead with principles, dignity, inclusivity and equality then it’s a wild west. It’s a free for all.” Her comments came amid renewed focus on misogyny and sexual misconduct in parliament as a string of female MPs came forward with examples of sexism and harassment. Labour and some senior Conservatives have demanded to know why the whip has not been withdrawn from the pornography watching MP, who has been identified by two party colleagues. The Conservative chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, has said the unnamed MP should be referred to an independent complaints process. Brabin, the former Labour MP for Batley and Spen, is the only woman among the 10 metro mayors in England. She heads the M10 group of mayors, which include the Conservative Andy Street and Labour’s Sadiq Khan, and represents 2.3 million people in West Yorkshire – meaning she is Labour’s most powerful woman outside Westminster. In an interview to mark her first year in office, Brabin said she felt more pressure to deliver as the only woman and that political parties, including Labour, must do more to get women into leadership roles. Brabin, a former Coronation Street actor, said she had not directly been subject to misogyny during her five years in parliament because, she said, there was cross-party affection for her after the murder of her friend and predecessor, Jo Cox. The former shadow culture secretary received a slew of online abuse after wearing an outfit that showed part of her shoulder as she spoke at the dispatch box in February 2020. She responded to her abusers at the time by tweeting that she was “not a slag, hungover, a tart, about to breastfeed, a slapper, drunk [or] just been banged over a wheelie bin”. She said: “It was really shocking. Not frightening, it was just shocking. Men interpreted what happened in a sexual way. People say about Boris Johnson, or other people who come to the dispatch box: ‘They look tired, or dishevelled,’ but it’s not sexualised. Women are always sexualised.” Brabin compared sexualised online abuse with the comments by Tory MPs who accused Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, of using a “Basic Instinct” ploy to distract the prime minister by crossing and uncrossing her legs in parliament. “That’s what happened to Angie,” she said. “It doesn’t say much about Boris Johnson that his colleagues think he’s so easily distracted he’s like some teenager that just can’t keep it in his pants, but maybe they know him better than we do.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson allowing ‘wild west’ of misogyny in parliament, Tracy Brabin says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/boris-johnson-misogyny-parliament-tracy-brabin-labour
4/29/2022,"An overambitious schedule, a heavy cold and mental fatigue finally caught up with Magnus Carlsen at the Oslo Esports Cup this week. The world champion had won the previous two legs of the online Meltwater Champions Tour, and was expected to make it three in his home city, but it was Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda who edged ahead in Thursday’s final round. Leading scores were Duda (Poland) 14/21, Le Quang Liem (Vietnam) 13, Carlsen (Norway) and Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (India) 12, Shak Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan) 11. A novel format was that the eight grandmasters were all present in the same studio and sat at the table as in an over-the board tournament, but instead of a chessboard between them there were computer screens. Coincidentally or not, the incidence of unintended mouse slips and clicks seems to have been higher than normal. Carlsen has rarely performed at his best in Oslo, which was the scene of one of his most devastating defeats when he lost 2.5-13.5 to Wesley So of the US in the 2019 Random Chess final. This time he was still in contention on Thursday despite two previous mini-match losses, but played limply against Mamedyarov and the world No 7 won 2.5-0.5. Afterwards Carlsen apologised for his performance: “It’s not nearly good enough … I have no energy in my body whatsoever.” The No 1’s setbacks began early on and reflected his busy schedule. In the afternoon before his round two match, he led the Norway team in a solidarity match against Ukraine where viewers could donate to war relief. Carlsen beat his old rival Vasyl Ivanchuk, but lost to Yuriy Kozubov and Kirill Shevchenko as Ukraine won 11-5. He then arrived, late and with a heavy cold, for his Esports Cup match and lost 1.5-2.5 to Le Quang Liem. Carlsen recovered and trounced Praggnanandhaa, who had beaten him earlier this year, by 3-0. The 31-year-old then looked set for a comfortable tournament victory until disaster struck against Jorden van Foreest, the winner of Wijk 2021 and a member of Carlsen’s world championship backroom team. The position at move 20 is complex, but Carlsen had a winning tactic available in 20 Bxa6! Bxa1 21 Nxb7!. Instead he chose 20 Ra2??, only to be shocked by the simple capture 20…Bxa2. This is an example of how long-distance diagonal queen and bishop moves are among the hardest to visualise, which applies even more if a backward capture is involved. Van Foreest drew their other three games to win the mini-match 2.5-1.5, but Carlsen caught up next day with an easy win against the Canadian streamer Eric Hansen. Their third game began with a Grunfeld (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5) where Carlsen’s 7 Qa4+ is rare. The queen later went to c2 and f2 to join an attack on the king which became decisive when Black missed the defence 25...exf4 26 Bxf4 f5! The drawing of lots to decide the pairings for the Fide Candidates, to be played in Madrid in June, was made in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Starting numbers are: 1 Duda, 2 TBC, 3 Fabiano Caruana (US), 4 Teimour Radjabov (Azerbaijan), 5 Alireza Firouzja (France), 6 Hikaru Nakamura (US), 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi (Fide/Russia), 8 Richard Rapport (Hungary). Place two remains subject to Sergey Karjakin’s appeal against suspension. If that appeal fails, the place will go to Ding Liren (China). One pairing already stands out – Caruana and Firouzja, the two pre-tournament favourites, will meet in the 14th and final round. The American Cup, a knockout event between eight top US players, ended on Thursday night at St Louis with victory for the world No 4 and 2018 title challenger, Caruana, who successively defeated Jeffery Xiong, Samuel Sevian, Leinier Domínguez and Levon Aronian to take the $50,000 first prize. Several of Caruana’s games lasted more than 50 moves as the 29-year-old took the opportunity to hone his play before the Candidates. The American Cup for Women, with a $25,000 first prize, included a contestant with a potentially significant future. Alice Lee, who lost to the US No 1 woman, Irina Krush, in Thursday’s final, is only 12 years old and has made a rapid advance in the past year, gaining over 300 rating points and qualifying for the WIM and FM tites. Lee has won four gold medals in world youth championships, has a Fide rating of 2348 which ranks her as No 1 under-16 girl in the world, and scored her first international master norm at open level in February at Fort Worth, Texas. This last result, achieved at 12 years four months, may be the second youngest IM norm ever by a female, behind only the legendary Judit Polgar, who did it at 11. The Beth Harmon of the 2020s? Time will tell. England’s Zoe Veselow (girls under nine), Kushal Jakhria (under seven) and Bodhana Sivanandan (girls under seven) were all in gold medal positions at the start of the final round of the European Schools Championships in Rhodes.

4/29/2022,"For so many of us, a sense of stillness and inertia has set in over the past two years – and my children and I are more than ready to shake it off. The first real week of spring felt like a great time to escape. Spring is about renewal and new hope. The daffodils were out, the magnolias too. We need that optimism in our lives and, as a family, we definitely need to feel some freshness. I’ve always loved the freedom and independence that comes with driving. It’s there on a subconscious level, but also on a practical one. I’m able to make my own plans and not rely on the timetables of others. Also, we live in a market town in Norfolk and, while there is a reliable bus service to Norwich, that’s it. To get anywhere else you need a car. Our day-long road trip trying out an electric car was a huge adventure for me, 12-year-old Lucy and 14-year-old James. Although we live quite near to the coast, it had been a couple of years since any of us had been to the sea, and we wanted to see what we could discover along the way to Southwold. The journey of about 120 miles saw us meandering through the countryside: we took in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, zig-zagging between all three. It sounds like a long journey in a car, just for a relatively short time at our destination, but driving the fully electric BMW iX made it feel particularly exciting, especially because the luxurious quiet inside the car meant we could properly chat. The kids are full of their own opinions and perspectives, and one of the great things about them being older now is that they point out things that I’m missing. They act as extra eyes while mine are on the road. I’ve lived in East Anglia since I was 18, but we were going through pretty villages and beautiful scenery that I hadn’t seen before. It was a gorgeous day, with a sort of hazy sunlight that put a golden cast over everything. At one point, in Suffolk, we went round a bend and there was a windmill with an old Massey Ferguson tractor driving in the field in front of it and seagulls flying behind. The way the sun was falling on this bucolic scene made all three of us go: “Wow.” I know it’s a moment we’ll all remember. There were a few wow moments with the car too. I enjoyed the instant power and response, and the acceleration as I needed it. The steering is very responsive and the car sticks to the road like glue. It really is a pleasure to drive; the car absorbed every little bump and it’s very, very quiet. Composer Hans Zimmer created the car’s soundtrack, but honestly it is so well soundproofed that with the doors and windows shut, I could hardly hear any outside noise. The car already felt like it was floating, but the panoramic roof made it seem like it was flying. The seat massager was also an exciting surprise; with each mile that we travelled, being in the car became increasingly impressive as we discovered the myriad onboard features. Everything felt user-friendly and intuitive. The augmented reality navigation was a revelation, adding to a feeling of safety both for us in the iX and those around us on the road. The kids got straight into the car’s tech. James swiped nimbly and got the hang of all the features immediately. Lucy loved the wifi and had her phone connected as soon as she was in. She said the back seat was like a big luxurious sofa. Discovering the iX uses an eco-friendlier olive-leaf tanning process for the leather seats created an interesting family discussion topic. And the big advantage for me was that they didn’t fight over who got to sit in the front. Sitting in both parts of the car had advantages as far as they were concerned and neither of them felt sick in the back, which is what usually happens. I also really valued that we could have this day out with zero driving emissions. I feel particularly riled in our small town when people leave their engines chugging as they pop into shops. I worry for my children’s generation. My children are very environmentally aware, as are lots of people their age, and I’ve always been keen that they think in terms of kindness, to people, animals and the planet. When it comes to people my age, I am mindful of Barack Obama’s words: “We are the first generation who can feel the effects of climate change and the last who can do something about it.” There’s so much more that we, Joe Public, can do. The roads on our journey offered the most amazing dappled sunlight. It really felt like the beginning of spring. We drove down towards a nearby forest. I knew there was a cycle loop around there, but we had never actually discovered it. We investigated and decided this was where our next bike ride would be. Having one adventure leads to another. We finished the day in Southwold, by the sea. The beach huts were amazing colours, but the day had turned blustery and chilly by then. I could feel the cobwebs blowing away. The pandemic made me realise that I am naturally quite introverted and have no desire to be among crowds. But I don’t want to stop having adventures. I want to consider nature and the value of the experience. To have a day where my children and I created memories, to be able to explore over that distance and know we weren’t producing carbon emissions on the drive, that was worth a great deal. It’s probably the longest we’ve spent in a car together for some time and it was so refreshing to take time out and enjoy what good company my children are, how funny they are.

4/29/2022,"How long were the last days of Rome? By some estimates, about 200 years, so I hope you’re sitting comfortably after a week in which: a female MP was baselessly branded an exhibitionist; a male MP was accused of watching porn in the Commons chamber; it was reiterated that 56 MPs are reportedly under investigation for sexual misconduct (three of them in the cabinet); and an MP recently convicted of child sexual assault was revealed to have put in a forward-dated resignation letter, ensuring he’ll collect his full April salary. Meanwhile, the prime minister remains under police investigation over a number of allegations that he broke his own laws to attend parties. Rome-wise, we could have another few thousand weeks of this. Don’t worry – it’ll feel longer. Still, let’s kick off with the Conservative MP accused by two of his own female colleagues of watching porn in the chamber (and also in a select committee). The man has not been suspended, and may or may not be pending investigation under parliament’s Mickey Mouse grievance procedures, suggesting that what’s NSFW at your job remains very much SFW at theirs. In place of a functional system of discipline, we have a number of fellow Conservatives offering their idiosyncratic brand of help with illuminating the story. “I can’t even get a wifi signal in the chamber!” trilled Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith. Defence secretary Ben Wallace linked any “poisonous” behaviour with parliament’s drinking culture, saying: “My advice to any MP is actually to avoid the bars. To finish your day’s work and go home.” I mean, for a Tory local election slogan, I quite like: “Go back to your constituencies and prepare to watch porn on the job there.” But as a national mood-capturer goes, it’s not exactly Labour Isn’t Working. Maybe Keir Starmer could go with Labour Isn’t Wanking; see if that’ll move the dial in Wandsworth. Having said that, watching porn in the Commons obviously has nothing to do with wanking and everything to do with power. Unlike the entirely blameless Angela Rayner, men who obtrusively watch porn where they know it might make others feel uncomfortable genuinely are engaged in a form of exhibitionism. If it helps the Conservative hierarchy get a grip, maybe they should think of THIS as the gateway drug to indecent exposure. And so to the sheer scale of Westminster’s cross-party sexual misconduct problem. Fifty-six accused MPs really is an astonishing statistic, given the arcane Westminster system’s barriers to reporting. It is certainly statistically likely that the overwhelming majority of those 56 are men, meaning that up to one in eight male MPs are currently accused of inappropriate behaviour and worse. Women who work in Westminster are beyond fuming that this continues to happen and that nothing ever changes. One female Tory MP told Politico that things had actually got worse under Johnson because of the “culture of rule-breaking”, where nothing happens to dodgy MPs. As for the guys who can’t wait to call the current scandal a “dead cat” for whatever they deem the real issue of note, they should probably understand that for women this stuff isn’t a “dead cat”, or for the young male staffers who have also experienced unwanted and distressing advances from older male MPs. The ever more pressing wider issue that this does feed into is the collapse of trust in the whole of politics, potentially equal to or exceeding that engendered by the MPs’ expenses scandal. Speaking of Rome – and indeed of collapse – when Edward Gibbon came to identify key factors in that empire’s decline, he cited such things as flashiness prioritised over economic growth, a widening gap between rich and poor, perverted obsessions, high taxes that were then misspent, a decay of ideals … I dunno – feels like one or two of those ring a contemporary bell. Anyway, I’ll tell you a phrase you never hear anymore: “cut-through”. Whatever happened to people honking dismissively about “cut-through”? A year ago, you couldn’t move for know-it-all allies of this administration waving around a glass of brosé while explaining that this or that would never cut though to ordinary voters – that any amount of substandard behaviour is “priced in” to the public’s support for Boris Johnson and his administration. Voters didn’t care about this or that standard in public life, we kept hearing. Industrial levels of lying in government, raging incompetence, unfitness for high office alleged by his own lieutenants, cronyism, contempt for elderly and vulnerable people, getting donors to pay for luxury holidays and interior design schemes – these moral failings didn’t matter, we were told time and again, because voters didn’t think they mattered. A form of high-concept severance had taken place, where all sorts of individuals who should have known better were quite happy to effectively assert that morality had been successfully divorced from politics. Yet this has not in fact happened. Far from forgetting that standards in public life matter, and feeling their absence only as the occasional twinge of a phantom limb, much of the public has spent much of this year absolutely furious about what they perceive as outrageous misbehaviour in politics, which they know only too well would not be tolerated in their own workplaces or their own homes during lockdown. And this was before we got the latest explosion of sexual misconduct that could and should blow up into a proper scandal. The risk of knowing the price of everything is that you can end up forgetting about its value. Ordinary people are turning out to have longer memories.

4/29/2022,"It is the part of the theatre programme where the cast usually list their biggest roles, awards and assorted appearances on The Bill and Casualty. But in the programme for the new West End run of the hit play Jerusalem, Mark Rylance has also used his actor biography to criticise cuts to arts education. “If, in modern day England, an institution like Eton deems drama important enough to have two theatres, why are we allowing our government to cut arts education from the life of the rest of our young people and our hard-pressed teachers,” he writes, in a biography that points up his schoolteacher parents’ devotion to amateur dramatics and his grandfather’s experience of acting in a prisoner of war camp. Twenty British prime ministers (from a total of 55) were educated at Eton college, where fees are £14,698 per term. Privately educated ministers have dominated Boris Johnson’s cabinets. The PM attended Eton, as did Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister of state for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency. About 20 productions are staged in a typical year at Eton, which has three theatre spaces and its own resident designer, theatre director and film-maker. Eton’s alumni include the actors Eddie Redmayne, Damian Lewis, Dominic West and Tom Hiddleston. Last year, leading figures in the arts criticised the funding cuts made to creative arts subjects at universities and Labour warned that schools in England faced a “creativity crisis”. In the Jerusalem programme, Rylance also takes the opportunity to hail a teacher who encouraged him, at the age of 12, to get involved in school plays. This meant that by the time Rylance auditioned for Rada in 1978 he had “already designed and built sets and lighting, and acted, danced and sung in 18 productions” including plays by Shakespeare, Greek tragedies and musicals. Rylance is returning to the role of Johnny “Rooster” Byron in Jez Butterworth’s play, which was a sensation when it was first staged at the Royal Court in 2009 and transferred to the West End and Broadway. Several members of the original cast, including Mackenzie Crook, have reunited for the current 16-week run at the Apollo theatre in London. Rylance adds, in his biog, that the producer Sonia Friedman, whose company is presenting the revival, “became his angel” after he left his post as artistic director at Shakespeare’s Globe. Friedman’s company and associates have supported Rylance in seven productions.",Arts/Stage,Mark Rylance calls out Tory arts cuts in new Jerusalem programme ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/29/mark-rylance-tory-arts-cuts-eton-jerusalem-programme
4/29/2022,"My friend Keith Smith, who has died aged 84, was an architect whose professional career took him through local authority work, new towns, private practice and teaching at the University of Sheffield. From the mid-1960s he was part of a team of architects, including James Stirling and Michael Wilford, working on the development of Runcorn New Town. Keith was leader of the design team that produced the Esso Motor Hotel, which in 1974 was commended by the RIBA, and later led the team that produced the Runcorn law courts and police headquarters that were featured in the Architect’s Journal in 1977. Of all the buildings designed by Keith, he was most proud of these. Born in Hull, to Esme (nee Speak) and Cyril Smith, an engineer, Keith went to the grammar school in the city. He trained as an architect at Hull School of Architecture, and after qualification started work in the city architect’s department in 1960. In 1964 he moved to Lymm, in Cheshire, where we first met as neighbours, to join the Runcorn Development Corporation, becoming its deputy chief architect by 1966. When the new town was amalgamated with neighbouring Warrington in 1989, Keith moved into private practice. During this time, he also began teaching architecture at Sheffield University, and by 1991 was a full-time senior lecturer in the department, running the third-year BA programme as well as tutoring postgraduate students. Keith believed that the role of the architect was to encourage the client to embrace solutions that followed artistic principles rather than the whims of current fashion or the individual. It was passing on these perspectives to his students, both at Sheffield and internationally as a visiting lecturer, that he found most rewarding. In 1984 he acquired a derelict shell of a stone-built barn in the village of Ravenstonedale in Cumbria, and over time transformed it into an exquisite home with gardens and views out over the surrounding fells. Keith did much of the manual labour himself, with help from family and friends, bringing in skilled local craftsmen for specialist work. Keith met Margaret Woods when they were both students, and they married in 1961. She was a secondary school teacher, and after they moved to Harrogate in 2007 they joined the local art group and developed their own considerable painting and drawing skills. Also in his student days, Keith was the clarinetist in the 2:19 jazz band, and he played the saxophone well into his 70s. A great admirer of Steve Bell’s cartoons, Keith hated pomposity, privilege, hypocrisy and entitlement. He was a great friend and family man. Margaret survives him, as do their children, Clare and Paul, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",Arts/Art and design,Keith Smith obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/29/keith-smith-obituary
4/29/2022,"Airbnb staff will be able to work from almost anywhere they want, the company has announced, and they won’t see their pay docked if they move outside metropolitan areas. The new model will apply to staff in the US, but also those in the UK and other countries. To make it work, the company said it would focus in-person collaboration on roughly quarterly get-togethers and aim to bundle work together into two product releases a year, its chief executive and co-founder, Brian Chesky, said. “We want to hire and retain the best people in the world (like you),” Chesky wrote in an email to staff. “If we limited our talent pool to a commuting radius around our offices, we would be at a significant disadvantage. The best people live everywhere, not concentrated in one area. And by recruiting from a diverse set of communities, we will become a more diverse company. “Now, I understand the anxiety of not seeing people in an office– – how do you know if your employees are doing their jobs when you can’t see them? For me, it’s simple: I trust you, and flexibility only works when you trust the people on your team.” Employees will not be entirely free to move as they see fit. For tax reasons, they will need to have a permanent base in the country they’re hired in. If they work overseas, they can spend no more than 90 days a year in any given country, and are responsible for handling their own work authorisation. And they do still need to consider time zones, and think about how to actually get to the gatherings. Crucially, however, the company will no longer pay people based on regional differences. “Starting in June, we’ll have single pay tiers by country for both salary and equity,” Chesky said. “If your pay was set using a lower location-based pay tier, you’ll receive an increase in June.” Other companies that have embraced remote work have been less generous. Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft all ask employees to take a pay cut if they move somewhere with a substantially lower cost of living. Airbnb is recovering from a difficult pandemic. The company, whose bookings plummeted as international travel fell away, laid off a quarter of its headcount in May 2020, scaling back its investments in hotels and ultra-luxury apartments and pausing plans to move into transportation and content creation. It went public in December 2020, an uncomfortable period for a travel-focused company, but has maintained a market cap of around $100bn in the 18 months since.",News/Technology,Airbnb embraces home working with location-blind equal pay model,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/29/airbnb-embraces-home-working-with-location-blind-equal-pay-model
4/29/2022,"Warning lights are flashing in the eurozone economy, with first-quarter growth in France stalling and shrinking in Italy, as Russia’s war in Ukraine drives up energy costs across the continent. Figures from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics body, showed growth in GDP across the single currency area slipped to 0.2% in the first three months of 2022, down from 0.3% in the final quarter of 2021, when Omicron weighed on activity. City economists had forecast a growth rate of 0.3% for the 19 euro area countries, highlighting the economic risks from the war in Ukraine amid soaring wholesale oil and gas prices exacerbated by the conflict. Raising the spectre of stagflation as living costs soar while growth in GDP falters, France’s economy unexpectedly ground to a halt in the first three months of the year, recording zero growth as supply chain disruption and higher energy costs held back activity. Italy’s economy shrank, Spain lost momentum, while Germany rebounded from a contraction in the fourth quarter when Omicron and supply chain problems had weighed heavily on the euro area’s largest economy. Suggesting a weaker period ahead as the conflict continues to push up the price of energy, hitting net importers of gas across the continent, separate figures for April showed eurozone inflation hit a record high of 7.5%. Prices jumped by 0.6% in April alone. Energy was the biggest single factor, driving up costs with a 38% year-on-year increase as wholesale prices for oil and gas soared, amid fears over disruption to supplies across the continent as the war continues. The figures come as the European Central Bank faces pressure to raise interest rates, with inflation more than three times its official 2% target rate. Economists said the eurozone was at heightened risk of slumping into contraction in the second quarter, raising the risk of recession for several countries as the rising cost of living forces consumers to rein in their spending. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “Manufacturers will take a bigger hit in Germany than in other parts of the eurozone but the increase in energy prices will affect the entire region, as will the fall in export demand and business confidence.” Tensions over the continued supply of Russian gas to the rest of Europe have risen in the past week as the Kremlin cut off Poland and Bulgaria after Vladimir Putin ordered importers to pay in roubles to sidestep western sanctions. Analysts have warned that an end to Russian gas supply is becoming a growing risk, with Germany expected to be among countries hardest hit given its reliance on Russia for 40% of total imports. Melanie Debono, a senior Europe economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Germany was still expected to grow by 2% this year, although there were mounting risks to the downside. The German economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter after a contraction of 0.3% in the final three months of 2021. “An embargo on Russian gas, especially if overnight, poses a real threat to the outlook; it would all but certainly drag the economy into recession, dragging the rest of the eurozone along with it,” Debono said. The slowdown in the eurozone compares with a 0.4% contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid a weaker contribution from trade and government spending. The UK economy is forecast to grow by about 0.5% in the first quarter. However, analysts have warned of risks of a summer recession amid a rise in inflation to the highest levels since the 1990s.",News/Business,Eurozone growth slips as Russia-Ukraine war pushes up energy costs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/eurozone-growth-slips-as-russia-ukraine-war-pushes-up-energy-costs
