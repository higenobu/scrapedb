5/12/2022,"The boss of John Lewis has urged the governmentto intervene with a financial package of support to protect families from the cost of living crisis on the same scale as it did to help the nation deal with the Covid pandemic. Dame Sharon White, a former second permanent secretary at the Treasury, said the government needed to act urgently as families struggle to pay utility and food costs as energy bills and inflation soars. “The time has absolutely come for action whether it is an emergency budget or whether it is another vehicle,” said White, speaking on ITV’s Peston show on Wednesday night. The chair of John Lewis Partnership, which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain, said that action needed to be taken before summer with consumers facing another increase in energy bills of as much as £1,000 annually from October. She said: “The decisive action we saw, I thought the government did incredibly well at the pace and scale during Covid, I think we need to see the same decisive action taken at speed and at pace.” White added that the UK faces “at least as pressing a challenge with the cost of living crisis” as it did with the pandemic, making the cost to public finances an “imperative”. “The hit is either going to happen to households, to families, to people on low incomes, or we take a decision that given the scale and everything that’s happening … actually a temporary hit on public finances is worth it.” White is the latest prominent retail leader to publicly call for urgent government action, after Tesco’s chairman John Allan said on Tuesday there was an “overwhelming case” for a windfall tax on energy companies to help those suffering the most from the cost of living crisis. Allan warned that the country was facing “real food poverty for the first time in a generation.” Johnson, who has persistently argued against a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, failed to rule it out when he was interviewed on LBC radio on Thursday morning.",News/Media,John Lewis boss calls for Covid-style cost of living aid package,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/12/john-lewis-boss-says-cost-of-living-help-must-match-covid-package
5/12/2022,"The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is to hold talks with the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefčovič, in the first meeting since the UK threatened to remove parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. The attorney general for England and Wales, Suella Braverman, is said to have approved the scrapping of large parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal, according to reports. The move came as a leading US congressman, Brendan Boyle, described the government’s plans to move away from a treaty it signed two years ago as a “very frustrating” and “counterproductive” pattern that is causing concern in Washington. The Washington ad hoc committee to protect the Good Friday agreement described the UK’s plans as “neither strategic or wise” and said it would not have the support of Joe Biden. We look forward to meeting @ConorBurnsUK this Friday. Tearing up the Protocol, which is boosting the NI economy, & starting a trade war with the larger EU in order to protect the GFA is neither strategic or wise & won’t sell @POTUS. Fully implementing GFA much more promising Braverman has advised that legislation to override the Northern Ireland protocol would be legal because the European Union’s implementation of it is “disproportionate and unreasonable”, the Times has reported. In evidence to her findings, Braverman says the EU is undermining the Good Friday agreement by creating a trade barrier in the Irish Sea and fuelling civil unrest, the newspaper said. The development echoes a major row 18 months ago within the Tory party after the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, unveiled plans to override parts of the protocol as part of draft internal market legislation. Lewis claimed the government’s legislation would break international law only “in a very specific and limited way” but the plans were ultimately abandoned. Liz Truss on Wednesday rejected the EU’s proposals to resolve a standoff over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland, saying it would not shy away from taking direct action in a move Ireland said would trigger legal action by Brussels. On Wednesday the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned the EU would launch legal action and possibly impose countermeasures against Britain that could range from sanctions on goods such as Scottish salmon and whisky to suspension of the entire trade deal negotiated by the former Brexit minister David Frost. Coveney told RTÉ on Thursday he believed there was a “landing zone” and that checks should not be conducted on goods destined for Northern Ireland only, a compromise already on the table. However, he said the EU would not respond to threats to scrap the protocol in parts if Brussels did not give in to the entire UK demands. “That is not the way to approach the issue and I think everybody knows that,” he said. The threats by the UK government to introduce a law to disapply parts of the protocol which, if implemented in full, would mean physical and customs checks on food and some other goods, were already causing a rift within the Tory party and with EU leaders. Between 30 and 50 Conservative MPs canvassed by colleagues said they had significant doubts about whether they could vote for a bill that would unpick an international treaty. Most dismissed the prospect of the bill’s success and described it as a negotiating tactic. Senior MPs warned there were a number of ministers prepared to resign if faced with passing the bill into law. Sources close to Truss have stressed that no final decision has been made and that any potential legislation is intended to run in parallel with further talks. Coveney said a briefing by Truss to the press on Wednesday had gone down “very badly” within Europe. The UK is also coming under pressure from the US to drop its antagonistic approach in the wake of the election in Northern Ireland. Boyle said the UK should listen to the majority of people in Northern Ireland who, he said, did not vote for the protocol to be abandoned. “Ever since almost the moment that Boris Johnson and David Frost negotiated the Northern Ireland protocol and signed it, it seems as if every other month or so, they’re threatening to rip it up and unilaterally walk away, so it is a very frustrating cycle that we’ve had to deal with over the last several years, completely counterproductive, and not in accordance with the expressed wishes of the majority of Northern Ireland. “Literally two days ago, the people of Northern Ireland elected pro-protocol parties and candidates by a margin of 60% to 40%, right? So I think we should actually listen to the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland,” he said. The Northern Ireland minister, Conor Burns, styled under a new title of special representative to the US on the protocol, was dispatched to Washington this week to speak to senior US figures about the negotiations. Boyle said the UK embassy had asked on Wednesday for him to meet Burns but it was unclear whether a meeting could be arranged in time. He was sceptical of the need for changes to the protocol.",News/Politics,Attorney general approves scrapping of NI protocol – reports,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/attorney-general-approves-scrapping-of-ni-protocol-reports-liz-truss-brexit
5/12/2022,"Finland must apply to join Nato without delay, its president and prime minister have said, confirming a radical change in the Nordic country’s defence policy triggered by the Ukraine war after decades of military non-alignment. Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin made the call in a joint statement, adding: “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.” Marin said last month that Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, would be deciding whether to apply to join the US-led alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused public support for Nato membership to treble in Finland, with the latest poll by the public broadcaster Yle showing 76% of Finns in favour compared with about 25% before the 24 February attack, with only 12% against. Finland and neighbouring Sweden are officially non-aligned, but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden, which is also expected to announce its decision on whether or not it will apply to join Nato this weekend, has not fought a war for 200 years. While military non-alignment has long satisfied many Finns as a way of staying out of conflicts, Russia’s invasion of sovereign Ukraine has led an increasing number of Finns to view friendly relations with Russia as an empty phrase. Ukraine’s fate has been particularly disturbing for Finland to watch as it fought two wars with Russia between 1939 and 1944, repelling an attempted invasion but losing about 10% of its territory in the subsequent peace agreement. Finland‘s rapid shift towards Nato is likely to pull along neighbouring Sweden.",News/World news,"Finland must apply to join Nato without delay, say president and PM",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/finland-apply-join-nato-without-delay-president-pm
5/12/2022,"Gaspar Noé brings his cauterisingly fierce gaze to the spectacle of old age: the world of those about to enter the void. He brings to it a particular structural insight which I don’t think I have ever seen represented so clearly. Dying is bifurcated: a real-time split-screen experience divided between the carer and the cared-for. An old married couple, people who have had a lifetime to wonder which of them will die first and which of them will have to take up the burden of care, find that it is not so clear during the terrible endgame itself. Veteran director Dario Argento and actor, screenwriter and director Françoise Lebrun play a couple who live together in a small, chaotic Parisian apartment covered in an amiable clutter of books and papers. He is evidently a film-maker or maybe a writer, working on a book about cinema and dreams entitled Psyche; she is a retired psychiatrist. They have a son, Stéphane (Alex Lutz) who is himself the father of a small boy, and burdened with drug issues and money and marital worries. The movie opens – ominously – with a video clip of Françoise Hardy performing the 60s chanson Mon Amie la Rose, about the mortality of flowers. Then Argento and Lebrun enjoy a modest meal on their rickety terrace: these are Lebrun’s final moments of lucidity. We learn that she suffered a stroke a few years ago and has been descending into dementia since then; recently the rate of decline has accelerated. Noé splits the screen into two, dual stories running concurrently, showing in one half Argento’s character pottering thoughtfully about the flat, in denial about what is happening: reading, snoozing, clattering away at his manual typewriter and also leaving surreptitious phone messages, like a lovelorn teenager, for a woman called Claire with whom he has been miserably in love for decades. Meanwhile, on the left-hand side of the screen, Lebrun’s character, with the impassive, leonine expression of dementia patients, wanders off into the streets without telling her husband, or throws all his notes away, or dangerously leaves the gas on, all in a miserable haze of unknowing. Stéphane comes around to see them, deeply upset by what is happening, and by his own inability to persuade them to enter a care home; this is a subject complicated by his own history with his psychiatrist mother, stricken by the fact that he and they now live in a world of drugs, legal and illegal. Noé will periodically contrive a camera-cut in either of the frames and resume from another point of view; occasionally the two scenes will overlap creating a Hockneyesque perspective-dissonance. Brutally, the medium is the message. These two people will never again share the same screen. This is a movie without the pornographic and psychedelic sheen of Noé’s previous work, but those earlier pictures had a recurring trick: forcing audiences to the edge of nausea by making them stare into a vortex of flickering stroboscopic light. In this movie, death is the vortex: the dark focus, whose gravitational pull gets stronger – and harder to avoid thinking about – with every passing year. And Vortex tells us something else about old age, something which a severe and high-minded movie like Michael Haneke’s Amour would not grasp: death is chaotic, like life. It ends with things undone and in messy disarray. This is a work of wintry maturity, but real compassion.  Vortex is released on 13 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Vortex review – Gaspar Noé’s stunning split-screen descent into dementia,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/vortex-review-gaspar-noes-stunning-split-screen-descent-into-dementia
5/12/2022,"For most of human history, we were caught in a stagnation trap. Improvements in technology and productivity led to population increases, and all those new people gobbled up the surplus, so that overall living standards always reverted to the historical average, barely above subsistence. Thomas Malthus, the unfairly maligned English clergyman, assumed this would always be the case. And yet, at least in the fortunate global north, things have been very different for the last century or so. How come? This is the question the economist Oded Galor devised his rather grandiosely named “Unified Growth Theory” to address. (He uses lots of metaphors from physics, including “phase transition”, “economic black hole”, “gravitational forces”, and the like.) His answer, briefly, is that we sprang free of the Malthusian trap because of the effect the Industrial Revolution had on fertility rates. Rapid technological change placed a higher value on education, and families invested more in children’s schooling, which meant they could not afford to have so many children as before. So productivity gains were not swallowed up by burgeoning population. This virtuous cycle has persisted until the present, and might even, Galor suggests with unfashionable optimism, help us combine continued growth in living standards with reductions in carbon emissions. The outline of this theory in the first half of the book is enjoyable and intriguing, if somewhat schematic in its picture of quasi-physical “fundamental forces” or “great cogs” operating over millennia of human history. The second half tackles what economists call the great divergence: why, given the above story, do we see such extreme global inequalities now? Here we enjoy a brief interlude in which the author gives some causal weight to ideas. Different legal systems and political institutions meant that some countries were in a position to profit more than others – for example, England’s 1689 bill of rights, its financial system, and the relative weakness of its artisan guilds (so that they could not block threatening inventions), are all argued to have given it a head start. Galor also follows Weber in suggesting that Protestantism was crucial to the development of modern capitalism, and that the most important invention of the Enlightenment was the idea of progress itself. So far, so plausible. But, like a deep-time materialist, Galor is always looking to reduce the superstructure of ideas to something more tangible. Climate and geography, then, caused underlying differences in political systems: in places where native crops were suited to “large plantations”, such as Central America and the Caribbean, people were incentivised, so he argues, to adopt “centralised land ownership, which led to unequal wealth distribution, coerced labour and even slavery”. We may be thankful, then, for drizzly Europe. It is tempting for a “unified theory” of the “journey of humanity” to try to provide the key to all mythologies, and the book becomes more speculative and dubious, suggesting that the economic performance of entire modern societies can be explained by a kind of cultural memory of their ancestors’ interactions with one kind of crop or animal versus another. Galor also proposes that languages with politeness distinctions (tu and vous in French or du and Sie in German) have thereby enshrined more rigid hierarchies, and so harmed individual business enterprise. This reminded me pleasantly of the remark attributed to George W Bush: “The problem with the French is that they have no word for entrepreneur.” The book’s desire to uncover the “great cogs” of history devolves into a kind of impersonal conspiracy thinking. The penultimate chapter, more dangerously, claims to explain the differences in economic development in the modern world through population genetics. Galor argues that ethnic diversity has had conflicting effects: on the one hand it “has diminished interpersonal trust, eroded social cohesion, increased the incidence of civil conflicts, and introduced inefficiencies in the provision of public goods”. On the other hand it has “fostered economic development by widening the spectrum of individual traits, such as skills and approaches to problem-solving”. If this is so, then perhaps, a bean counter might dream, there is an amount of diversity that is just right. Galor finds that there is just such a “sweet spot”, and it can be found in a geographical Goldilocks zone – neither too near nor too far, in terms of migratory distance, from our ancestors’ first journey out of Africa – where the “diversity” of the population is allegedly ideal for creating an economy such as the Netherlands’ or Malaysia’s rather than Ethiopia’s or Bolivia’s. Here we encounter the limitations inherent in the publishing genre of “successful thinker lays out his pet theory as if it were the uncontroversial truth”. The original version of this argument appeared in a 2013 paper co-written with Quamrul Ashraf (“The ‘Out of Africa’ Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity, and Comparative Economic Development”), and attracted a highly critical public response from a number of biologists and anthropologists. “The argument is fundamentally flawed by assuming that there is a causal relationship between genetic diversity and complex behaviors such as innovation and distrust,” they observed; indeed, such “haphazard methods and erroneous assumptions of statistical independence could equally find a genetic cause for the use of chopsticks”. They warned, too: “The suggestion that an ideal level of genetic variation could foster economic growth and could even be engineered has the potential to be misused with frightening consequences to justify indefensible practices such as ethnic cleansing or genocide.” Galor responded at the time: “The entire criticism is based on a gross misinterpretation of our work and, in some respects, a superficial understanding of the empirical techniques employed.” He ends his recapitulation of the same argument here by asserting that “geographical characteristics and population diversity” are “predominantly the deepest factors behind global inequalities”, which sounds rather like we can’t do anything about them. Happily, at least, he does suggest that a country such as Ethiopia, which in his view is too genetically diverse, might be helped by “policies that enabled diverse societies to achieve greater social cohesion”. Meanwhile, Bolivia, which is allegedly too homogeneous, could achieve better economic growth by being more diverse and so benefiting from more “intellectual cross-pollination”. And so, though it has often seemed as if we can do little about his hidden “great cogs” and “fundamental triggers”, it appears cheeringly in the end that politics and ideas might at least sometimes trump their effects on the story of how we got here and where we might go next.

5/12/2022,"Seven of the nine runners in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday hold entries in next month’s Derby and Stone Age’s recently acquired status as clear favourite for the Epsom Classic may be under threat if one of them can register a convincing success. Desert Crown has already shortened from 33-1 to 6-1 second-favourite for the Derby in the past 10 days without leaving Newmarket, as other potential candidates have come up short in their trials. El Bodegon, meanwhile, beat Stone Age in a Group One at St Cloud in October, and both Magisterial, a maiden winner at Leicester last month, and Aidan O’Brien’s Bluegrass also have the right profile to jump towards the top of the ante-post market with a victory. Desert Crown (3.35), however, already looks like more than a talking horse, as his winning time in a five-and-a-half length stroll on debut at Nottingham last November marked him down as Group-class colt in the making. Odds of around 3-1 look fair for Sir Michael Stoute’s colt to punch his ticket to Epsom. York 1.50 Copper Knight is going for his third straight success in this race but needs a career-best at the age of eight to win off 104, so Strong Power makes more appeal at around 12-1. Much improved on the all-weather this winter after joining Alice Haynes, he raced off 95 on his latest start in early April but runs off his 8lb lower turf mark here. Salisbury 2.05 Teumessias Fox starts out in handicaps on a mark of 84 and that looks workable based on his wide-margin success at Newcastle in early March. York 2.25 Little to choose between the three principals – Thunder Kiss, Noon Star and Ville De Grace – but the latter’s success in the Group Three Pride Stakes in October came in a strongly run contest and she may just have the edge at this trip. York 3.00 La Trinidad rarely runs a bad race in big-field handicaps over this track and trip, and a return to the form of his victory in a similar contest last July – off a 4lb lower mark – could well be enough for a third career win on the Knavesmire. York 4.10 Boonie looked to be an improved performer when scoring on his three-year-old debut at Nottingham last month and could have too much speed for King Of Bavaria, the favourite, who is dropping back in trip. Many horses were struggling to quicken on the ground here on Wednesday but Emily Upjohn was emphatically not among them. John and Thady Gosden’s filly shot away from her field with a sustained burst of speed two out in the Musidora Stakes, eventually crossing the line five-and-a-half lengths clear of Life Of Dreams, and is now clear favourite at around 6-4 for the Oaks on 3 June. This was a seventh Musidora winner for the Gosden stable and the record of the previous six in the Classic at Epsom a few weeks later is uninspiring, with the only three fillies that went on to run in the Oaks all beaten. Everything about Emily Upjohn’s win here suggested she will be the one to break the sequence, however, as the step up to a mile-and-a-half is likely to see further improvement from a filly with stamina on both sides of her pedigree. “A mile-and-a-half will be right up her alley and she couldn’t have done it any better, really,” John Gosden said afterwards.

We’ve been lucky enough to win [the Oaks] three times and she very much deserves to be in that league.” Frankie Dettori, Emily Upjohn’s jockey, suggested the winner is at a similar point at this stage of her career to Enable, the 2017 Oaks winner, who went on to take 11 Group One races in all. “The ground is a lot deeper than you think,” Dettori said, “and everybody was struggling from four out. I kept her together and from the two-and-a-half to the winning post I didn’t see another horse. “Enable won at Chester [before winning the Oaks] and she was probably on the same par. Every race she’s improving, she won by five lengths and I’m delighted with her.” Tuesday, who finished third in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket when making only the third start of her career, is the 4-1 second favourite for the Oaks while Charlie Appleby’s With The Moonlight, the Pretty Polly Stakes winner, is a 9-1 shot and the only other likely runner at single-figure odds.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Stone Age’s status as Derby favourite under threat at York,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/emily-upjohn-made-clear-favourite-for-oaks-after-winning-musidora

In February, BT entered into exclusive talks with the US firm to merge BT Sport with the Discovery-owned Eurosport, which broadcasts a wide range of sports including tennis and cycling and holds the pan-European rights to the Olympics in the UK. “We have finalised the sports joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery to improve our content offering to customers, aligning our business with a new global content powerhouse,” said Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. Under the terms of the 50:50 joint venture, which will be operated by Warner Bros Discovery, BT will receive a £93m payment in instalments over three years after completion of the deal. BT will also receive up to £540m based on performance of the operation over a period of four years. This could pay out sooner if either the £540m performance cap is hit, or Warner Bros Discovery trigger a call option to take full control. The two companies said that the BT Sport and Eurosport brands would both initially continue to operate in the UK market “before being brought together under a single brand in the future”. “Our growing portfolio of premium entertainment content promises to deliver consumers a richer and deeper content proposition, not only providing greater value from their subscriptions but bringing sport to a wider entertainment audience,” said Andrew Georgiou, president and managing director of Warner Bros Discovery sports Europe. BT has spent billions on sports rights to drive the growth of BT Sport since it was launched a decade ago to stem the loss of millions of broadband customers enticed by its rival Sky’s offers bundling internet connectivity with sport and entertainment programming. The business succeeded in its job, although it only has a few million customers and turns just a small profit, and BT is now focused on its £15bn plans to roll out next-generation broadband and 5G mobile networks across the UK. “As a global sports and entertainment broadcaster Warner Bros Discovery is the perfect partner to work with us to take BT Sport to the next stage of its growth,” said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s Consumer operation. BT, which has had to seek clearance from the Premier League and Champions League to push through the change in ownership, has also extended a reciprocal channel supply deal with Sky that is crucial to its sports broadcasting business until 2030.",News/Business,BT and Warner Bros Discovery join forces to create pay-TV sport business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/bt-and-warner-bros-discovery-join-forces-to-create-pay-tv-sport-business
5/12/2022,"Among the rightwing crusaders promoting Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, wealthy pillow entrepreneur Mike Lindell occupies a key niche, spending lavishly on lawsuits to ban voting machines in some states, endorsing big lie advocates for top offices in 2022 and financing an anti-voting machine film, plus related projects. In some respects, Lindell is an unlikely figure to emerge in the hotbed of US politics and the conservative ecosystem. As the chief executive of MyPillow he was once better known for his TV adverts than his extremist politics. But Lindell has become an ally of a still-powerful Trump who is eying a 2024 bid to return to the White House. Lindell has also become a popular figure on the right himself, making several appearances at recent Trump rallies. But election experts and voting watchdogs say Lindell’s legal blitz to ditch voting machines, and other drives that sustain Trump’s baseless claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election, are deeply flawed and dangerous and potentially further damage voter confidence in elections. Lindell though sounds undaunted, telling the Guardian that he has spent about $30m to retain about 70 lawyers, cyber consultants, private investigators and other staffers for his projects to prove widespread fraud in the 2020 elections, despite mountains of contrary evidence, and expand his crusade to get rid of voting machines. Last month Lindell pumped about $500,000 dollars into an Arizona lawsuit filed by two Trump and Lindell backed state candidates for Secretary of State and Governor, Mark Finchem and Kari Lake, respectively, to obtain a preliminary injunction against voting machines that Lindell has repeatedly charged are defective. Lindell said that he plans to underwrite similar anti voting machine lawsuits in the next few months in many other states including Colorado, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan and Alabama. “I’d like to file the lawsuits in all 50 states,” he said. “I didn’t come all this way not to succeed. We’ve got to get rid of them all.” To further spur his conservative agenda, Lindell has publicly endorsed several candidates for top posts in battleground states including Lake and Finchem, who early this month benefitted from a Trump sponsored fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago that Lindell attended. Lindell is also backing a candidate in Colorado for secretary of state, Tina Peters, a Mesa county elections clerk indicted on 10 counts for tampering with voting equipment in an effort to reveal what she thought were sizable election machine errors, who Lindell headlined a rally for last month. A judge on 10 May barred Peters from running the county elections this year; Peters remains a candidate to be Secretary of state but first has to win a June Republican primary. And in Michigan Lindell has bet on two Trump loyalists, Matt DePerno and Kristina Karamo who, respectively, were endorsed by a state Republican convention to be the Republican candidates this fall for attorney general and secretary of state. To promote his messages more widely, Lindell said he’s recruited ex-Fox News reporter Lara Logan, who claims she was “pushed out” by Fox after making incendiary comments comparing Anthony Fauci to notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, to do a documentary about voting machine fraud and the voting machine companies that Lindell boasts will be “huge”. Moreover to help spread dubious claims of widespread election fraud, Lindell late last year launched Cause of America, a grassroots group whose self-styled mission is to “restore trust in local elections”, which Lindell said he’s subsidizing to the tune of $100,000 to $200,000 a month. Currently, to facilitate the CEO’s pricey lawsuits to get rid of voting machines, which legal and voting experts say face long odds, Lindell has retained a team of lawyers including Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz and Kurt Olsen, who was was subpoenaed on 1 March by the House committee binvestigating the 6 January Capitol attack by a mob of Trump loyalists. Election watchdogs say Lindell’s lawsuit spending spree is promoting conspiratorial views of voting fraud and has scant chance of legal success, but carries big risks to further confuse voters about the risks election fraud in 2020. Even William Barr, Trump’s own conservative attorney general, admitted in late 2020 there was no evidence of widespread fraud. “This is just another effort by proponents of the big lie to spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and undermine confidence in American elections,”Larry Norden, senior director for elections and government at the Brennan Center, said. “Like most other states, Arizona conducts its elections entirely on paper ballots and audits the machine results with a review of those ballots after the election is over,” he added. “ Every post-election review of the 2020 Arizona election, including the partisan review led by Cyber Ninjas, confirmed that Joe Biden won.” Norden stressed too that “hand-counting of ballots in any but the tiniest of jurisdictions is far too time-consuming and prone to human error to be feasible. Even in very small jurisdictions it would require trained election staff working in multi-member teams with oversight.” Other voting watchdogs offer similar views. “These ridiculous lawsuits are designed to continue undermining Americans’ confidence in every aspect of our electoral system, allowing Lindell and his cronies to decry any outcomes they don’t like as fraudulent,” Melanie Sloan, a senior adviser to the watchdog group American Oversight, said. ”Hand-counting ballots actually increases opportunities for fraud, but given that Lindell and Finchem were active participants in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, it’s obvious there is no low to which they won’t stoop to foist their candidates on America, democracy be damned.” Lindell though is bullish about winning the class action lawsuits, despite dozens of other lawsuits by Trump lawyers to overturn the 2020 results that alleged fraud and that courts rejected “There’s no reason they won’t succeed,” Lindell boasted, adding that “the likelihood is very high”. Since Trump’s defeat, Lindell’s adamant advocacy that the election was rigged and his legal attacks on voting machines have sparked substantial legal headaches for the Minnesota-based mogul, a 60-year-old former crack addict and born-again Christian who once said Trump had been “chosen by God”. Two voting machine companies Lindell has portrayed as part of an election rigging operation have filed defamation lawsuits against him, and he has countersued at least one of them. Dominion Voting Systems filed a $1.3bn defamation lawsuit in February against Lindell, and a month later a judge declined Lindell’s efforts to dismiss the suit. Another voting equipment firm, Smartmatic, has also sued Lindell for defamation for an undisclosed amount. Further, the House Capitol attack committee subpoenaed Lindell’s phone records from 1 November, 2020 to 31 January 2021 as part of their inquiry, which prompted Lindell to sue the committee, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Verizon to block the panel’s effort. Not surprisingly, Lindell angrily decried Pelosi and the committee’s inquiry as “election deflection. It’s all political and criminal.” Lindell, however, attended Trump’s “Save America” rally on the Ellipse prior to the Capitol attack where Trump urged the crowd to “fight like hell”, and he also attended a Trump rally in Georgia on 4 January where Trump railed without evidence that there was significant fraud. On 15 January, Lindell met briefly with Trump at the White House where the executive said he told Trump of “evidence” he had gathered that the voting machines were rigged. Incredibly to most experts, Lindell postulated that he has evidence Trump won by almost 15m votes with about 82m for Trump to some 67m for Biden, figures nowhere near the official total. Biden won by sabout 7m votes, or 81.2m for Biden, versus 74.2m for Trump. Norden of the Brennan Center noted that 93% of the 2020 votes were cast on paper ballots, including all the votes in the main battleground states, and that post-election audits “confirmed the machine results. The idea that the machines could have been so wildly off and yet none of it got caught by any of the post-election reviews is beyond absurd.” On another legal front, some watchdog experts say that the lawyers Lindell has recruited to handle the anti-voting machine litigation could face ethics problems. “Lawyers must abide by the rules of professional conduct, which forbid lying to a court, bringing frivolous claims and misrepresenting facts,” said Michael Teter, the director of Project 65, a bipartisan legal ethics watchdog group focused on lawyers trying to undermine democracy. “Mr Lindell may be willing to pay hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to these lawyers to continue the effort that began in 2020 to discredit our elections through bogus lawsuits grounded in falsehoods, conjecture and distortions,” Teter added. “But the lawyers who take Mr Lindell’s money and allow the courts to be abused as part of political theater can, and we hope will, face professional consequences.” Lindell’s legal crusade seems aimed at weakening, rather than improving, the election process, concluded Norden of the Brennan Center. “Everything about this [lawsuit] effort wreaks of yet another attempt by the same cast of characters to undermine the election system.”",News/US news,‘I’d like to file lawsuits in all 50 states’: Mike Lindell still pushing Trump’s lie,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/mike-lindell-trump-election-big-lie
5/12/2022,"Aston Villa have reached an agreement with Barcelona to sign Philippe Coutinho for about €20m (£17.2m) after his successful loan spell. Coutinho has been with Villa since January and the opportunity to continue working under Steven Gerrard was key to the 29-year-old’s decision to accept the transfer. The Brazilian joined Barcelona from Liverpool, where he played alongside Gerrard, for an initial £106m in January 2018 but the move did not work out and he spent the 2019-20 season on loan at Bayern Munich. Payment terms were the final element to be settled in negotiations between Barcelona and Villa, who are preparing to confirm the deal. Coutinho has played 16 times for Villa, scoring four goals and providing three assists, although all of those came in his first eight appearances. “We want Phil Coutinho here for sure,” Gerrard said after using him as a late substitute at Burnley this month.",Sport/Football,Aston Villa agree €20m deal to sign Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/aston-villa-agree-sign-philippe-coutinho-from-barcelona-permanent-deal
