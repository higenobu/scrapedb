3/16/2022,"Russian shells and missiles pounded Kyiv, killing at least five people and prompting city hall to impose a 35-hour curfew amid signs the invading force was tightening its grip on the Ukrainian capital. In the east, the airport in Dnipro sustained massive damage overnight, while Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes on Kharkiv. A series of four heavy pre-dawn explosions rocked residential districts of the capital early on Tuesday. One strike hit a 16-storey housing block where fire raged and smoke billowed from the shattered skeleton of the building. The number of people leaving Ukraine as refugees passed three million, in what NGOs have called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UN said that nearly 1.4 million children – almost one every second – had left Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv, after several days of fierce bombardment. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4 March the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours. On Saturday 5 March a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. On Sunday 6 March civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. On Monday 7 March Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. On Tuesday 8 March civilians left Sumy and Irpin in the north, and Russia was accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling a proposed humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol. On Wednesday 9 March, a children’s hospital and maternity ward in Mariupol was destroyed by a Russian air strike. On Thursday 10 March a humanitarian convoy trying to reach Mariupol was forced to turn around due to fighting, and airstrikes struck the western city of Zhytomyr. Satellite images showed the extent of the destruction in Mariupol. Drone footage emerged of a Ukrainian ambush on a Russian armoured column just outside Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv. On Friday 11 March Russian airstrikes hit three cities, including two in the country’s west, as the scope of the military offensive widened. On Sunday 13 March Russia struck a military base close to the Polish border that has previously hosted foreign military trainers from the UK, US and other countries. On Monday 14 March a convoy of more than 160 cars left Mariupol in what appears to be the first successful use of a “humanitarian corridor” to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city. Moscow’s forces have stepped up their campaign to capture Kyiv, where one person was killed and several other wounded in a strike on a block of flats in Obolon district. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures
3/16/2022,"Starbucks’ former leader Howard Schultz will replace chief executive Kevin Johnson as the coffee chain deals with a wave of unionization drives among its baristas. The shake-up in leadership, announced Wednesday, comes as Starbucks’ workers across the country are pushing to form unions. Since a Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York became the first store to vote to unionize in December, workers at six other locations have unionized and workers at 130 other stores across 27 states have petitioned to hold votes. Johnson will leave his post on 4 April and will serve on the company’s board and in an advisory role through September. The company said that he had signaled to the board of directors around a year ago that he was thinking of retiring. “It’s been deliberate,” said Mellody Hobson, chair of Starbucks’ board, to the Wall Street Journal. “This is not hasty in any way.” In a separate statement, Hobson said that “as the company navigates the aftermath of the pandemic and socio-economic forces impacting the lives of all our stakeholders, [Schultz] will reinforce the company’s culture”. Schultz, who served as CEO of the company from 1987 to 2000, and then a second time from 2008 to 2017, has been running his family foundation and working on various philanthropic efforts since he last stepped down. In 2019, Schultz briefly teased a presidential run for the 2020 election. Schultz will take the job on an interim basis while the company seeks a permanent replacement. Though Schultz had formally stepped away from the company, he was still involved in company matters around unionization. Last fall, Schultz paid a visit to employees in Buffalo as they were undergoing unionization efforts. In a letter to employees, who the company refers to as “partners”, Schultz said, “No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks. And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now.” Workers reported that Schultz stuck to the message during a speech to employees. One worker involved in the union told Bloomberg that when she tried to ask Schultz if he would support union principles that would restrict union-busting, she was escorted away. Multiple workers who have been involved in union activities at different stores have accused the company of terminating pro-union workers. Workers who were trying to start union efforts in Nashville and Orlando were fired, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in August ruled that the company illegally retaliated against two baristas in Philadelphia who were trying to start a union. The company has repealed the ruling and has denied terminating employees for union-related activities. On Tuesday, a group of investors that hold a combined $1.2bn in Starbucks stock sent a letter to the company urging it to adopt “a global policy of neutrality for all future attempts of workers to organize” and reach a “fair and timely” bargain with those who have voted to unionize. The investors also criticized Starbucks’ previous response to unionization efforts. “Starbucks has responded to union organizing activities suggests a departure from international norms and standards as well as from its commitments to them,” the investors said. “Our concerns include Starbucks’ activities at stores that have organized after the Buffalo election such as alleged retaliatory termination of employees and continued captive audience meetings.”",News/Business,Starbucks to be led by Howard Schultz again as US workers push to unionize,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/starbucks-howard-schultz-ceo-again-us-workers-unions
3/16/2022,"Thousands of Ukrainians are expected to arrive in the UK next week following criticisms of the slow progress of government schemes. The Home Office minister Kevin Foster told MPs that 5,500 visas had been granted under the Ukraine family scheme and 20,000 applications had been submitted. The refugees minister, Richard Harrington, told a parliamentary committee that sponsors who have identified someone who wishes to come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme would be able to apply from 18 March. The two ministers appeared before the home affairs committee on Wednesday after concerns across parliament about the slow progress of the UK refuge schemes. The UNHCR expects as many as four million people will be forced to flee Ukraine. Lord Harrington, who has been parachuted in to government by Boris Johnson to run the sponsorship scheme, said the priority was to get people into the UK, speed up the visa application process, and match UK sponsors with Ukrainian families. Asked if councils would check accommodation under the scheme before Ukrainians were housed, Harrington told the Commons home affairs committee: “It may not be possible. “I mean, I’m talking next week … I’m expecting thousands of people to come but it will be their responsibility and, particularly where there’s a possibility of vulnerability with children, this sort of thing, that would take priority. “But if we started saying we’re going to preview it, it’s just not possible.” He added that he did not expect the £350 monthly payment for hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme to breach insurance or mortgage terms. Asked by the committee if he could give assurances that Ukrainian refugees would not be housed in hotels, Harrington said: “It’s not our intention. But if all else fails, it’s our duty to make sure they’ve got a roof over their head and they’re fed properly.” Local authorities will receive £10,500 for each refugee for the first year to support education, English language learning, safeguarding and social care, while there will be additional supplements for each child placed in a school. The government is not asking councils primarily to help with accommodation, as it intends to rely on the more than 120,000 people who have expressed an interest so far under the scheme. Clive Betts, the veteran Labour MP, asked: “Isn’t there a potential real problem there? That if there is a concentration of refugees coming to certain areas, where there may already be enormous pressure on things like child mental health, school places?” Harrington replied: “I’m not turning my mind to that yet … it’s a very valid point and please don’t think I’m fobbing you off, but for the moment we just have to get these people in.” Every Ukrainian coming to the UK will still have to fill in a visa, the ministers said, but the form was being simplified and cut from 49 pages to 30. Refugees entering EU countries do not have to fill in a visa before arrival. The Conservative MP Adam Holloway accused the government of making it “extraordinarily difficult” for Ukrainian women and children to reach the UK, calling the situation “utterly farcical”. “We’re making it incredibly difficult for women and children to come here with enormous reputational damage to a government [that] is doing really well overall,” he said. MPs were told that informal networks and charities were identifying people and helping match them to sponsors. The Conservative MP Tim Loughton called for regular updates for the public about progress, “otherwise people will get very frustrated, as they did in some of the volunteering schemes in the pandemic signed up, and then they never got called on to do anything”. Harrington replied: “I’m doing my best to make sure that does not happen … I want it to work. I believe when it works through, the real conduit for this will be those NGOs on the ground, and they’ll become expert at it.”",News/World news,Thousands of refugees expected in UK next week under Homes for Ukraine scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/thousands-of-refugees-expected-in-uk-next-week-under-homes-for-ukraine-scheme
3/16/2022,"Call a play a “modern classic” and you give it a veneer of respectability. But, although the term is widely applied to Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming, I suspect it has lost none of its power to provoke and disturb. The proof will come when Jamie Glover’s revival of Pinter’s 1965 play, now with a cast headed by Keith Allen, Mathew Horne and Shanaya Rafaat, opens at the Theatre Royal Bath before going on a national tour. So what is it about The Homecoming that upsets people? When I wrote a biography of Pinter in 1996, I discovered that the play was triggered by the experience of one of Pinter’s oldest Jewish friends who went to live in Canada and for 10 years never told his Hackney dad that he had married a Gentile girl and had a family of his own. But Pinter always denied that The Homecoming was either a specifically Jewish play or a transcription of reality. What the play shows is Teddy, now an academic in the US, returning to his north London roots to introduce his wife, Ruth, to his father, his uncle and his two brothers. The action hinges on the choice confronting Ruth: whether to go back to America with Teddy or to settle in London with her rumbustious in-laws. You might ask where the offence is in that: ever since Ibsen’s A Doll’s House wives have been turning their backs on husbands and children in a bid for independence. The difference in The Homecoming – as most spectators will know – is that Ruth will not only be expected to minister to her new family but will apparently be set up in business by Lenny, her pimping brother-in-law. In 1965 many people were shocked by Pinter’s refusal to offer any moral condemnation of this animalistic family. In today’s world – where the #MeToo movement has led to heightened awareness of female exploitation – I suspect The Homecoming will once again trigger fierce debate. Even those who accept that Ruth escapes a sterile marriage and acquires new agency at the play’s conclusion argue that she does so at humiliating cost. But reading the play again, I was struck by a blindingly obvious fact: that Ruth is the only realist in a house of male fantasists. Max, the foul-tongued patriarch, talks palpable nonsense about being a racetrack wizard and consultant to a group of continental butchers. Lenny, the seemingly sophisticated pimp, is reduced to a quivering wreck by his first encounter with Ruth where she achieves dominance through a glass of water. Joey, the would-be professional boxer, has, as his father admits with rare honesty, only one problem: “You don’t know how to defend yourself and you don’t know how to attack.” The one production I’ve seen that ruthlessly exposed this house of dreams was directed by the late Luc Bondy in Paris 10 years ago. Bruno Ganz’s Max was a vain Mittyesque bigmouth, Micha Lescot’s Lenny a self-abusing neurotic and even uncle Sam, the supposedly top-class chauffeur, a lumbering figure in a bad hairpiece. The idea that Emmanuelle Seigner’s poised and steely Ruth would ever become a slave to these inadequates was laughable. That is not, of course, the only way to play The Homecoming but I am struck by how often Pinter shows his male characters living in a world of illusion. It is certainly true of The Caretaker, where the itinerant Davies, the manipulative Mick and the ineffectual Aston are all sustained by pipe-dreams. And in his final play, Celebration, the vulgarly rich male diners inhabit a world of their own creation. Pinter had as sharp an ear as anyone – including David Mamet – for the language of male pretence and the way aggressive talk often conceals private insecurity. It’s worth recalling that when The Homecoming reopens the debate, as it surely will, about whether Ruth is a sexual victim or a vanquisher of toxic masculinity. The Homecoming is at Theatre Royal Bath, 30 March-9 April, and tours until 21 May.",Arts/Stage,The Homecoming: Pinter’s male fantasists return in the age of #MeToo,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/16/pinter-the-homecoming-revival-play
3/16/2022,"When Robert Fripp was considering who should direct a proposed documentary about King Crimson – the band he has devoted most of his life to – he knew right away what kind of person it shouldn’t be. “We had been approached by some very good, professional music documentary makers who would make a nice, conventional documentary from which I would learn nothing,” Fripp said by Zoom from his home in the West Midlands. Rather than go in that direction, he chose director Toby Amies, “who had no familiarity with King Crimson whatsoever. For me, this was ideal,” he said. “I thought, ‘here is an independent film-maker with his own attitude who will come in and show me aspects of King Crimson that I’m perhaps unaware of.’” More, he hoped Amies’s film would “tell me what King Crimson is”. That may seem like a strange goal for Fripp, who not only helped conceive this unique beast of a band back in 1969 but who has served as its only consistent member since. Yet, as the documentary, titled In the Court of the Crimson King, cleverly presents, this isn’t a band easily bound by description, even by those who are part of it. Throughout Crimson’s many splendored incarnations, they have always been more about a method than a sound. Or, as Fripp put it, “King Crimson is a way of doing things”. Unfortunately, the rigors of that way can become a nightmare for musicians who either don’t understand it, or fail to live up to it. A litany of rude and colorful descriptions from former and current members of the group attests to that in the film, which had its world premiere this week at SXSW before an official release later this year. Bassist Trey Gunn likens being in Crimson to “a low-grade infection. You’re not really sick, but you don’t feel well either.” Former member Adrian Belew said his time with the band caused his hair to fall out. “It was so intense to be under that microscope,” he said in the film, while multi-instrumentalist Mel Collins – who has done two tours of duty in Crimson, in the 70s and over the last decade – described his initial run as “a trauma. If you made a mistake, it was the end of the world.” Common perception would finger Fripp as the hard taskmaster cracking the whip on anyone who doesn’t meet his standards. And while, in certain instances, the guitarist admits he has been just that person, one of the first aims of the film was to “remove this preposterous notion that Robert Fripp is King Crimson”, the guitarist said. “King Crimson is an ensemble.” He likens it to a cooperative, citing as proof that the money generated by the band is split evenly, while noting “not everybody who has been in King Crimson has been happy that they are paid the same amount as other members of the band”. Amies (who previously directed the acclaimed documentary The Man Whose Mind Exploded) says that another source of anxiety for some members stems from their own, internal struggle to make the most of the wide creative berth Crimson affords them. “It’s not that you’ve got a tyrant telling you what to do,” he said. “It’s that you have somebody who is giving you the opportunity to be your own personal tyrant. I think that it would be possible to drive yourself mad in that space, especially when you’ve got someone like Robert, who is clearly willing to make great personal sacrifices in the service of their work.” Towards that end, a key part of the film documents Fripp’s unending desire to make the band what he dreams it can be. “What’s possible for this band remains in potential,” he says on camera. “And that’s an acute suffering.” Mel Collins says that only after decades of experience with Fripp did he realize that “whatever he put me through, Robert put himself through 10 times over”. In the film, Fripp describes the first 44 years of his time in Crimson as “wretched”, adding that, only beginning in 2013 did he settle on a lineup in which “not one member of the band actively resents my presence”. Part of his negative experience, he said, came from feeling the need to either school or scold certain members when they “felt themselves to be of greater value or importance than others”. That is, when they didn’t honor what he calls “the ethics of improvisation”, which dictates that each player listens deeply to the other rather than trying to pull them into their orbit. At other times – mainly during the eras of the Islands and Larks Tongues albums in the 70s – Fripp’s ire rose when various players ruined their performances through drug use. “When that happens,” he said, “it’s awful. It burns. And there’s a righteous anger involved.” Issues within the band date back to the very start, despite the excitement that surrounded them even before they issued a single recording. Four months before the appearance of their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, the group had already generated enough buzz for the Rolling Stones to invite them to open their historic show in Hyde Park. In a later piece about the event, the Guardian wrote that Crimson upstaged the headliners. When the band’s debut finally appeared that fall, a besotted Pete Townshend wrote copy for an ad in Rolling Stone in which he called it “an uncanny masterpiece”. Still, half the performing band members – multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald and drummer Michael Giles – ditched the group within a year. In the film, McDonald (who died in February) said one reason he left was because he could no longer bear “inflicting” the darkness of the music on the audience. But, for fans, the depth of that darkness has been a major draw. The first time I heard the see-sawing, gates-of-hell Mellotron riff in the 1970 track Cirkus, I leapt under the bed in terror. Fripp roars with approving laughter when I tell him. “That was the power of King Crimson being in your room,” he said. At the same time, Crimson made sure to balance the music’s apocalyptic shock with passages of ravishing beauty. “Life is rich,” Fripp said. “And if music is reflective of life, it’s going to have a broad dynamic.” Another draw for fans was the mystery the band created. Not a single picture of its members appeared on their first three albums and because they didn’t tour during most of that period, listeners were left to wonder what shape the creatures who created these otherworldly sounds could possibly take. Were they even human? According to Fripp, that was by design. “I wanted the people playing the music not to be seen,” he said, “because, ideally, the music has nothing to do with them”. In conversation, Fripp often emphasizes the mystical power of music, favoring abstract statements like: “You have the notes, you have the music, and then there’s something above that,” he said. “It’s silence itself, which moves into the music and then the music moves into the notes that the people are playing.” In a similar mode, the film finds Fripp saying that when Crimson perform, they “tune the air”. When asked to explain what he means by that, he shoots back, “would you ask a poet to explain his poem in prose?” At the same time, Fripp is fully aware that his less trenchant descriptions of music’s power can make some people’s eyes roll. “It’s easily filed under the heading of cosmic horseshite,” he said, with a laugh. Even so, he insists that everyone has a vivid understanding of the experience he describes in those moments when music transports them. Fripp likens it to “when you close your eyes and someone you love walks into the room. You can’t see them,” he said. “But you know they’re there.” In parts of the film, Fripp speaks with an almost religious awe the about sound. “There is definitely a spiritual element to it,” Amies said. To stress that angle, the director presents in the film someone he calls “the prog nun”, a middle-aged woman of the cloth who happens to be a Crimson devote. “She says that the process of making music is not dissimilar to a liturgy,” Amies said. In one of the most intense, and unusual, segments in the film, Fripp recalls an encounter with the late philosopher JG Bennett, with whom he studied in the early 70s. When recounting a key exchange with him, Fripp pauses and appears to go into a kind of trance, which Amies daringly preserves in a near three minutes stretch of film filled with nothing but silence. I asked Fripp what was going in his head at the time. “I went to a place,” he answered. “What is that place? That place is where Robert is. And where Robert is, so is everybody else.” Fripp admits that only a select group of people can relate to comments like that. Within the recent band, just one member could: Bill Rieflin, a drummer and keyboardist who had earlier worked with industrial acts like Ministry and the Revolting Cocks. One of the most moving and stark parts of the film covers Rieflin’s dire diagnosis of late stage colon cancer. He speaks at length about facing certain death with unflinching honesty, great articulation and even humor. “Bill embraced his cancer intentionally,” Fripp said. “It became his personal discipline to free himself from this life so that, when he left, he flew away clean.” The word “discipline” has great resonance for Fripp. He named his company after it and he lives it as a kind of mantra. While many view the word as harsh or condemning, Fripp sees it as vow of honor. “It means that when you say you’ll do something, you can rely on yourself to do it,” he said. In turn, Fripp expects the musicians he works with to figure out what to do in the band. Former Crimson drummer Bill Bruford describes Fripp’s strategy this way: “Find the most interesting people you can, put them in a recording studio, throw away the key and, sure enough, you’ll come out with something interesting after a while – if they haven’t killed each other.” Often, it seems, various members have wanted to do just that. Some of the most fractious exchanges have occurred between Belew and Fripp. The two can’t even agree on whether the former quit or was fired from the band. In structuring the film, Amies aligned quotes from musicians of different eras with those who play the same instrument now. “The older members have an acute understanding of what current members are going through,” said Amies. “The older members become a Greek chorus to comment on the current action.” Despite the presence of players from earlier eras, they are only seen in fresh interviews, keeping nearly all the film’s action in the present. Amies said he used this approach to avoid telling the age-old story of King Crimson so he could, instead, capture “the experience of King Crimson”. Part of that experience makes Fripp look strict, combative and, at times, horribly self-involved. In one indelible moment, he says “I don’t have the problem. The problems lie elsewhere.” In our interview, Fripp said that the quote was taken out of context. Likewise, he believes the film captures only a part of him. “My wife [the musician Toyah Willcox] was disappointed,” he said. She told him she wishes the film showed more of the fun side of him, as captured in the couple’s Covid lockdown series Toyah and Robert’s Sunday Lunch, in which they playfully performed unexpected covers of popular songs. Even so, Fripp says he thinks the film is superb. “What Toby has done is to show me a specific part of King Crimson and I find it moving and informative,” he said. “What he doesn’t do is tell me what King Crimson is.” For that, he said, you have to immerse yourself in the music. “Ultimately,” he said, “King Crimson is a force entirely of itself.” In the Court of the Crimson King is screening at SXSW and will be released later this year",Arts/Film,‘A force entirely of itself’: Robert Fripp on the difficult legacy of King Crimson,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/16/robert-fripp-difficult-legacy-of-king-crimson
3/16/2022,"An exhibition inspired by the vandalism of five paintings while they were being displayed has opened at the National Gallery, in an attempt to explore how trauma can manifest itself in people’s response to museum and gallery collections. If you prick us, do we not bleed? has been put together by the gallery’s artist in residence, Ali Cherri, appointed in 2021, who uncovered accounts of National Gallery paintings being vandalised while on display as he researched its archives. He said he had been struck by the public’s emotional response to the attacks, noting that the damage was referred to in newspaper articles in similar terms to wounds, while some of the reports compared the gallery’s conservators with surgeons. Overall, he sensed an urge to heal and felt that people tended to personify artworks by suggesting that they can experience trauma and distress. The research prompted him to take the title of the exhibition from Shakespeare’s The Merchant Of Venice, the gallery said. It described the exhibition as including mixed media, sculptural installations that “recall aspects of each painting and that imagine its life following the vandalism”. It added: “By translating each damaged work into a series of objects, Cherri reminds us that we are never truly the same after experiencing violence.” Cherri, who was born in Lebanon and is based in Beirut and Paris, uses sculpture, film and installation to pursue the meaning of the built environment and its histories. He often uses archaeological relics and sites as a starting point to explore the processes of excavation, relocation and the museum classification of objects, animal artefacts, images and their narratives. He said: “Giving a contemporary artist access to one of the world’s richest collections of paintings is a way of keeping the dialogue going and open for new kinds of engagement.” The exhibition has been assembled in the National Gallery’s Sainsbury Wing in the form of five vitrines reminiscent of early museum displays and cabinets of curiosity, surrounded by Renaissance paintings, many of which show wounds and suffering. Cherri is the National Gallery’s second artist in residence since the launch of its modern and contemporary programme, after the appointment of Rosalind Nashashibi in 2019.

3/16/2022,"Just when you thought you couldn’t take any more bad news, a sudden bright spot on the horizon: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, along with another detained British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori, are flying back to the UK from Tehran airport. Hopefully, they’ll soon be home. It is nearly six years since she was first detained. In that time, she has been imprisoned, separated from her daughter, she’s suffered unimaginable mental distress, and known the cruellest false dawn as her original sentence for spying ended, only for her to be rearrested for “propaganda activities”. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who has been through two hunger strikes, ended the second with the simple, devastating decision that their daughter “needs two parents”. In current affairs terms, this news is an island of joy in an otherwise tragic sea, but they are all part of the same ecosystem: the British government has to build bridges with Iran if it wants to end its reliance on Russia as an energy source. Hurdles that were previously insurmountable have suddenly evaporated. It was always well known, thanks in large part to Richard Ratcliffe’s determination, that the imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was no random act of violence from a hostile state (though both noun and adjective apply); rather, she was taken as part of a strategy of hostage-taking in the recovery of a debt owed by the British government. As detailed in the BBC’s excellent podcast, Nazanin, there is no debate over the legitimacy of this debt and hasn’t been since 2001, when Iran won a case at arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce. In 1971, the then Shah of Iran paid upfront for more than 1,500 Chieftain tanks, the order for which was cancelled when he was deposed in 1979. By the time judges found in Iran’s favour, 22 years later, the EU had imposed sanctions on the nation and the British argument has been that it couldn’t pay any money directly without breaching the sanctions. So £400m went into an escrow account, where it’s sat ever since. The Iranians, perceiving the legal route to be exhausted, went down the hostage route instead. This isn’t to say that hostage-taking is a moral or defensible act, only that it wasn’t random or irrational. The US was in a similar situation, owing $400m, with four of its nationals held; they managed to settle the debt despite the sanctions – in part with airlifted pallets full of actual cash – and their hostages were returned in 2016. There was a suggestion two years ago that our government wouldn’t follow suit because the Ministry of Defence worried about how Iran might spend the money. What if they used it to bankroll their military agenda in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon? Given that no such qualms have ever interrupted, say, arms sales to Saudi Arabia, this logic is questionable. There was an ongoing motif in that BBC investigation: most of us live our lives, if not oblivious to geopolitics, at least far enough from the action that we only read about it. But what if you suddenly find yourself a pawn on the chessboard? That would be a painful, unjust, Kafkaesque experience for anyone, at any time, but for Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the metaphor collapsed on 1 November 2017, when the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson gave what should have been some routine evidence to the House of Commons. “When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing,” he said, “she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it, at the very limit.” At the very centre of her defence was the fact that she was in Iran on holiday, visiting her parents, and had never taught anyone journalism or anything else. The Thomson Reuters Foundation, her employers, were very clear on this matter: she wasn’t even a journalist, let alone teaching journalism. With his casual failure to read his brief, delivered in this off-the-cuff, potentially deadly remark, Johnson dragged Nazanin into an altogether darker chess game, one in which she was still a pawn, but dependent on one of the players who didn’t understand the rules and might at any moment upturn the board. Her misfortune was to be reliant on the wisdom and good judgment of a man who has neither. The prime minister could argue that the issue was always the debt, and the question of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s guilt or innocence was a red herring. In which case, why was he happy for a British national to languish in prison, rather than settle it? What was the long game? Could she have remained there for ever? Conceivably, he could argue that the debt could never be paid, because the regime was simply too immoral; but nothing about that regime has changed, only our own strategic aims and material circumstances. What he will never be able to argue is that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was accorded, by him and by the state, the rights, protection and care that a British citizen is entitled to expect. Perhaps his incompetence as foreign secretary is just a sidebar to that fact, but it’s the detail we will remember whenever we think of his time in public office, and even as we rejoice in her return.

3/16/2022,"Four people arrested over the occupation of the mansion of the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska in Belgravia, London on Monday have been released under investigation. Four others arrested at the scene for trespassing on the nearby “premises of a foreign mission” and taken into custody have also been released under investigation. The releases come as concerns mount about the scale of the police operation against the four unarmed squatters. Dozens of police, including several vans of Territorial Support Group officers, uniformed officers, officers carrying riot shields and police negotiators, attended. A JCB cherrypicker was repeatedly raised to the balcony of Deripaska’s home where the four squatters were protesting and then lowered again after they refused the police negotiators’ requests for them to come down. Police wearing riot gear used a drill to break open the front door and enter the house. Officers cordoned off a large part of Belgrave Square during the incident, with traffic diverted from the area. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said he was “surprised” that police intervened when squatters occupied a mansion owned by a Russian oligarch subject to sanctions, suggesting it was “unclear” why officers had become involved. The Labour politician said he did not “condone” the actions taken by the squatters but questioned whether the police move against them had been “proportionate”. The squatters hung the Ukrainian flag from the balcony and banners that stated: “This property has been liberated,” and “Putin go fuck yourself.” They also issued a statement expressing their desire to use the mansion to accommodate Ukrainian and other refugees. “As always with wars, empires benefit and common people pay the price,” the statement said. The squatters used humour during the protest, asking the police to treat them the same way Boris Johnson was treated in the Partygate scandal and send them a questionnaire to fill in rather than arresting them. They also joked to residents in the square that they were their new neighbours and would bring round some brisket the following day. Deripaska is one of seven oligarchs, including the Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, added to the UK sanctions list last week in reaction to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Paul Ridge of Bindmans solicitors, the firm representing some of those involved in the incident, said: “While squatting a residential property is a criminal offence the ferocity of the police response on Monday was highly unusual. It’s very odd. It’s both resource-intensive and at odds with public opinion.” The City of Westminster police Twitter account issued a statement about the operation saying: “Officers faced difficult decisions as they had not independently verified what was taking place inside the property, who was present and whether there were other risks. Over the following hours we deployed the resources necessary to resolve the situation swiftly but safely, both for our officers and the protesters.” However, thousands of people posted replies questioning the police response, with one saying it was “a premium oligarch service from the British police” and another saying: “Congratulations on a wonderful job.”",News/UK news,Four released after occupation of oligarch Oleg Deripaska’s UK mansion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/16/four-released-occupying-russia-oligarch-oleg-deripaska-london-mansion
3/16/2022,"The owners of the Chicago Cubs, the Ricketts family, are preparing to launch a bid for Chelsea after joining forces with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin. Interested parties have until Friday to submit takeover proposals to the Raine Group, the bank handling the process, and the Ricketts have said they will make their offer to buy the club from Roman Abramovich before the deadline. Griffin is the founder and CEO of Citadel Asset Management and is valued by Forbes at $26.5m (£20.2m). A spokesperson for the family said: “The Ricketts family, owners of the Chicago Cubs, can confirm they will be leading an investment group that will make a formal bid for Chelsea Football Club this Friday (March 18). “As long-time operators of an iconic professional sports team, the Ricketts family and their partners understand the importance of investing for success on the pitch, while respecting the traditions of the club, the fans and the community. We look forward to sharing further details of our plans in due course.” The Ricketts family believe their work with the Cubs proves they are strong candidates to own Chelsea. The baseball side won the World Series in 2016 and the family have overseen a major redevelopment of the team’s iconic ground, Wrigley Field, which suggests they would not be overawed by the challenge of potentially renovating Stamford Bridge. Chelsea need a sale to go through quickly after the UK government imposed sanctions on Abramovich in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European champions are operating under a restrictive licence and risk falling into financial trouble if they are not bought soon. As many as 200 groups have notified Raine of their interest. The frontrunners until now have been a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly, Jonathan Goldstein and Hansjörg Wyss. The trio have submitted an offer of between £2bn and £2.5bn and are open to more investors joining their group. Reports that the British property tycoon Nick Candy is ready to team up with Boehly, Wyss and Goldstein, who is a Tottenham fan, are incorrect. A spokesperson for Candy said: “There are no talks under way with Nick Candy and the Todd Boehly and Jonathan Goldstein consortium, not least because Mr Candy does not want a lifelong Spurs fan as part of the future ownership of Chelsea Football Club.” Candy, who supports Chelsea, plans to bid. Sources have said he has been approached by a number of investors and has the funds in place to succeed with a takeover. There is also interest from the owner of the New York Jets, Woody Johnson. The Saudi Media Group is also set to make an offer. Raine remain hopeful a deal could go through by the end of this month and, with time of the essence, bidders have been given a chance to look at the club’s latest accounts and wage bill. Groups serious about buying Chelsea are doing due diligence. Chelsea are operating under a restrictive special licence and are desperate to avoid delays, particularly as any deal requires final approval from the UK government. With that in mind Raine is looking to make the process as smooth as possible. Bidders are being told they will need to offer legal guarantees that they have funds to complete a deal.",Sport/Football,Chicago Cubs owners and Ken Griffin join forces in bid to buy Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/chicago-cubs-owners-ricketts-family-ken-griffin-bid-to-buy-chelsea-roman-abramovich
3/16/2022,"More than 500 people who Ukrainian authorities have compared to hostages remain trapped in a Mariupol hospital seized by Russian forces, in a city where 400,000 are either without or with dwindling access to running water, food and medical supplies. The south-eastern port city has for days been facing a humanitarian catastrophe, besieged by Russian tanks advancing towards its centre amid near constant shelling. Ukraine’s ministry of defence on Wednesday described Mariupol as “the worst” of all the fronts in the war. “It is impossible to get out of the hospital,” one hospital employee said on the Telegram social media platform. “They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings are burning around … Russians rushed 400 people from neighbouring houses to our hospital. We can’t leave.” Mass graves have been dug on the outskirts of the city and the bodies of men, women and children have been left on the streets. Local officials said more than 2,500 have been killed. But the reality is that, due to the shelling, the dead cannot be counted. Officials have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets, as holding funerals is too dangerous. Witnesses tell of a city in chaos, under constant bombardment that becomes more and more difficult to escape. Thousands of people are trying to reach the city of Zaporizhzhia, where refugees are taking shelter, but according to the Ukrainian authorities, the Russians are trying to prevent citizens from fleeing. The regional governor, Alexander Starukh, wrote on Telegram that “Russian rockets have landed in the area of the Zaporozhye-2 railway station”. The right bank of Mariupol, which is divided by a river, is at the centre of a vicious battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The left bank is under Russian occupation and almost completely cut off. One of the two bridges from the left bank has been destroyed and those in contact with relatives inside the city say the second bridge is being heavily fought over. A senior Ukrainian official said it was an “open question” whether a “humanitarian corridor” would be opened on Wednesday to evacuate more civilians. So far, about 20,000 people have managed to leave the encircled port city, but only if they have cars. According to one woman whose parents are trapped in the town, 2,000 cars left on Tuesday and about 500 on Wednesday. She has not heard from her parents for four days. The Ukrainian authorities have told those with cars to leave Mariupol, however, but most of the citizens trapped either do not have their own cars or their cars have been destroyed by the shelling, three people with relatives inside the city told the Guardian. A number of witnesses trapped in the city say the Russians are bombing radio and telecommunications towers, meaning that talking to people there becomes more and more difficult. Relatives of those living inside the city desperately searching every day for news about their loved ones have been unable to find a phone signal. “From what I’ve heard from people I’ve managed to speak to they shot at telecommunications masts and that’s why there has been no signal, not because the electricity was cut off,” said Iryna Bakazheriva, who has family members stuck on the right bank of Mariupol. She was contacted by a neighbour who left the basement and climbed to the eighth floor of his building where you can get a signal.“They are waiting for official information about an evacuation butthere is none,” said Bakazheriva. Hundreds of people left homeless have gathered in a large public building and have been crammed, for days, in the basement. “Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,” Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city, at the start of the war, but was still in contact with friends there, told the BBC. “Things are very serious.” “People who managed to hide in underground shelters basically live there permanently,” she said. “They practically cannot leave, at all.” Maryna Hammershmidt, whose elderly parents, sister, nieces and nephews are on the left bank, said she had had no news from them for two weeks. On Tuesday, Hammershmidt’s sister put a sim card into an old, analogue mobile phone and managed to call her.Hammershmidt’s sister said that she and the rest of her family were living in a bomb shelter with 300 other people on the left bank. They have no access to transport. Her sister said a group had tried to leave and the car in front of them was shelled, so they returned.Hammershmidt has written to all the officials she can think of in Poland and Ukraine to increase pressure to evacuate those trapped inside the city.“They’ve abandoned a city of half a million people,” said Hammershmidt. “My mother is 78 and my father is 80, they are sitting in a basement. My sister is with a baby who is just one month old.”“The left bank is completely cut off, there’s about 80,000 peopleliving there,” said Hammershmidt. “It’s a living hell. When are they going to evacuate people?” In a Telegram chat where about 100,000 citizens of Mariupol are collecting testimonies from their relatives and friends still stuck in the city, users have reported the “the police academy is completely occupied by the Russians’’. Taking Mariupol, which is 34 miles from Russia’s border, would mark a strategic breakthrough for Vladimir Putin. The city lies between territory held by Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region and the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014 and from where it has launched its assault on key southern towns in Ukraine.",News/World news,"Trapped in Mariupol: ‘They shoot hard, we sit in the basement’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/mariupol-ukraine-russia-seized-hospital
3/16/2022,"The nationwide study, undertaken on behalf of the Guardian by independent research company Tapestry, looked at the effectiveness of podcast advertising and found that podcast advertising commands the highest levels of attention of any media channel. The study found 65% of listeners paid attention to podcast adverts - more than adverts on TV at 39% and adverts on the radio at 38%. These high levels of attention translate into greater likelihood to buy the product or service being advertised. For example, 51% of weekly users of each channel said podcast adverts made them want to buy something from the brand versus 38% for radio. Listeners turn to the Guardian for informative, memorable podcast experiencesGuardian branded podcasts are particularly impactful, improving listeners’ opinions of brands. When comparing the same adverts being played on the Guardian and other unbranded podcasts people are more likely to say the ad was “informative”, “memorable” and “appealing”. Positive and trusting perceptions of the Guardian are also rubbing off on listeners of these podcasts, 51% of respondents surveyed said hearing about a brand on a Guardian podcast improved their opinion about a brand and made them want to find out more about a brand. The research findings are in line with results seen by brands advertising with the Guardian including retailer Ocado. Ocado, who are the sponsors for hit podcast show Comfort Eating, after advertising with the Guardian saw an uplift in new customers, with 25% saying they’d listened to the podcast. They also saw a 62% increase in positive customer brand perception and 89% new unique visitors to their website. Podcasts have a multiplier effect on other advertising formatsOn its own, podcast advertising has clear benefits - they are strong at telling consumers something new about a brand, raising perceptions and ultimately, driving purchase. Interestingly, in combination with other media, the overall effectiveness of an advertising campaign is maximised by adding podcasts into the mix. For example, those saying “it tells me something new about the brand” increases by 34% when podcasts are added alongside a radio campaign. They also help dial-up the ‘brand’ part of branded content - 47% of those exposed to branded content said “it improves my opinion of the brand”. Add podcast adverts to the mix and the same metric jumps to 64%. Combined with the visual cues of digital display, podcasts make campaigns more memorable and trustworthy. Trust levels increase from 45% to 63% when podcasts are added into the media mix. Podcasts have grown in popularity and are reaching a younger, more diverse audiencePodcasts are now reaching younger and more diverse audiences, many of whom are parents - 26% of weekly podcast listeners are now coming from non-white backgrounds and the average listener age is younger at 37, compared to 40 in previous Guardian research in 2020. Podcasts have shown the most growth of any media, helping them to become more mainstream - 41% of podcast listeners are listening to podcasts more than they were 12 months ago, increasing to 53% for the Guardian audience. Imogen Fox, director of advertising, Guardian News & Media, said: “As the leaders in podcasting, the Guardian set out to produce advertising insights that would help our customers make better planning and buying decisions. This study gives us a deeper understanding of the relative effectiveness of podcast advertising versus other media formats - like radio. It’s really interesting to see the boost that podcasts provide when the various formats are working together.” “The fact that podcasts are commanding higher levels of attention and increase the effectiveness of other formats means they should be an essential addition to any media plan.” Claire Blunt, chief advertising officer and CEO, International, Guardian News & Media, said: “Guardian podcasts have been seeing massive growth, with global monthly listens to Guardian podcasts increasing by over 60% since the start of the pandemic*. The Guardian offers a unique combination of quality, trust and a devoted listening audience that we have built a real connection with. All of this means that we can deliver impressive results for brands.” The Guardian is a leading commercial podcast publisher with several hit shows including Comfort Eating with Grace Dent which has seen two successful series to date, as well as Today in Focus, Football Weekly and Audio Long Read - all of which dominate their categories and often sit in the top five of their respective Apple podcast charts.

3/16/2022,"Three Metropolitan police officers are under investigation after a black child was strip-searched at her school while on her period over unfounded suspicions she had cannabis. The incident has triggered outrage and disbelief, with Labour frontbencher Jess Phillips likening the treatment to child abuse. The case is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) which has issued notices to three officers saying they are under investigation for potential disciplinary offences over how the 15-year-old schoolgirl was treated in December 2020. The strip search happened at a school in Hackney, east London. A report by Hackney council said racism was likely to be a factor and described the episode as “humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking”. The Met has been buffeted under Cressida Dick’s commissionership by scandals over its treatment of ethnic minorities and women. This case threatens to become another scandal, and the Met has already apologised. In an unusually strong attack by a senior politician on police actions, Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, described the case as “awful,” adding: “I cannot for one second imagine why any one of these professionals thought this was in any way acceptable. Remember what it was like to be 15? This seems as if it was designed to humiliate and show power, the act of an abuser.” Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy said on Twitter: “The Met have apologised to a child they strip-searched after wrongly suspecting her of carrying cannabis. Whilst on her period. Without an adult present. “Without wholesale reform of the way the Met engages with the Black community, this apology is just reputation management.” In other reaction, a spokesperson for Black Lives Matter UK said: “Once again, we are reminded of the fact that the police are the perpetrators and there are no lengths they wouldn’t go to inflict harm on vulnerable people. “The horrific strip search of a black girl at school is a clear example of why police should not be in places of education. While politicians have recently called for more police officers to be stationed in schools across the capital, children are being traumatised in spaces that should be safe.” The Hackney council report said the child was made to bend over, spread her legs and use her hands to spread her buttocks while coughing. She is now in therapy and self-harming, according to family members’ statements to the inquiry. It said: “Having considered the context of the incident, the views of those engaged in the review and the impact felt by Child Q and her family, racism (whether deliberate or not) was likely to have been an influencing factor in the decision to undertake a strip search.” Police were called by teachers who told the review that they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs, but none were found during the subsequent search. The school was visited by four officers including two women who carried out the search of the girl – referred to in the report as Child Q – while teachers remained outside the room. Her mother was not contacted. The child’s maternal aunt said her niece had turned from “a happy-go-lucky girl” to a “timid recluse” who hardly spoke to her. In a letter, the aunt added: “The family do not believe that the officers would have treated a Caucasian girl child who was on her monthly periods in the same way.” The review said race was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the strip search, and that the child had been subjected to “adultification” bias – where black and global majority children are held to adult standards, but their white peers are less likely to be.

3/16/2022,"As Stormzy points out, the audience in Newcastle bought their tickets for this show two years ago. While he says he’s delighted that they showed up – “I thought, ‘fucking hell, we’re still here’” – there’s a sense in which the unexpectedly protracted lead-up to his arena gigs has worked in his favour. It’s certainly an odd position he finds himself in: touring his second album, 2019’s Heavy Is the Head, just as he’s about to release its follow-up. But the lengthy delay means he’s not performing less familiar, recently released material, but well-worn songs from a platinum album that have been streamed millions of times since its release. Album tracks are greeted like greatest hits, the audience word-perfect not just on the obvious smashes – Vossi Bop, Own It and Big for Your Boots (from his debut album) – but on Rachael’s Little Brother and Do Better. The entire show feels like a victory lap, amplified by recent events: six months after the live industry more or less resumed activity, there’s still a distinct sense of release – of something more than the usual excitement of a big arena show – about the crowd’s reaction, which starts at fever pitch and ramps up as the gig goes on. If it’s something of a risk packing the middle of the show with so many pensive, R&B-infused tracks – Crown, Cigarettes and Cush, Superheroes – you wouldn’t recognise it as such from the response. Stormzy’s fans react to the sound of Dave’s voice on Clash in a way that makes you wonder what they’d do if Dave was actually on stage, rather than on tape. They greet a video urging them to pre-order Stormzy’s forthcoming third album at the merch stand as if it’s the greatest news they’ve ever heard instead of an advert. Just before launching into Shut Up, he pulls on a Newcastle United shirt proffered from the crowd – with, it has to be said, some difficulty: whoever gave it to him was clearly acting on a spur-of-the-moment impulse rather than handing over a gift bought with Stormzy’s six-foot-five proportions in mind. The resulting noise suggests that their response to everything else that’s happened was just the sound of them warming up. The show itself is both big on arena-sized spectacle – there’s a vast amount of pyrotechnics and a giant set of scales on which Stormzy is hoisted above the crowd – and oddly simple. Save for a moment where they follow him down the ramp that extends into the crowd during Rainfall, his band are hidden behind a screen – for the majority of the show, Stormzy is on stage alone. You wonder whether he needs the special effects: bathed in sweat, jogging with his knees cartoonishly high as he raps, he’s a remarkably compelling presence in his own right. As the show reaches its climax, he performs Blinded by Your Grace Part 2 from Gang Signs & Prayer before a huge projection of a crucifix towering over the world. The audience join in, as indeed they have done with everything else, but the sight of a crowd of rowdy teens and twentysomethings happily singing along to what’s essentially a hymn – “Oh my God / What a God I serve” – acts as a reminder of what an idiosyncratic phenomenon Stormzy is: ordinarily, British pop really doesn’t do religion, and yet here we are. “I’m the big dog, I made the whole arena bark,” he’d snapped earlier, amid the torrent of immodesty that constitutes the lyrics of Rachael’s Little Brother. On tonight’s evidence, it isn’t a boast but a statement of fact.",Arts/Music,Stormzy review – victory lap for the big dog,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/16/stormzy-review-victory-lap-for-the-big-dog
