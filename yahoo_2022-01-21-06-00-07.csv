1/21/2022,"A man and woman in New York have been both fired and arrested for verbally assaulting a family on a train in an incident that police have determined to be a hate crime. The Daily Voice reported that Justin Likerman and Kristin Digesaro, of Long Island, turned themselves in on Wednesday. They have been charged with aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a child. New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority said the charges were brought in conjunction with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and the Hate Crimes Unit. Liz Edelkind said that she was taking the Long Island Rail Road with her husband, son, and two other adults to a Knicks basketball game at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10, according to NBC 4 New York. While looking for a group of seats, Likerman and Digesaro began to verbally attack them due to Edelkind’s darker complexion and accent, Edelkind said. The couple criticized the group for being immigrants and said they didn’t belong in the U.S. “They threw beer at us. My pastor…her husband and my husband got in the way to protect me,"" Edelkind told NBC 4. A witness captured the assault on video, and it went viral on social media. In the footage, Likerman and Digesaro, who appear to be also going to the game, can be seen hurling verbal jabs after Edelkind and her group boarded. Likerman is heard saying, “Look straight because I’m going to get arrested tonight,” before throwing some sort of liquid. “Don’t look at me, don’t fucking look at me,” Likerman said repeatedly. “These fucking foreigners ain’t taking over my country.” After alerting the conductor on duty, Edelkind said the couple left.

In a Facebook post on Jan. 13, Empire Toyota wrote that the company was “outraged by the event involving two of its employees.” “The two employees were suspended when we first heard about this incident,” the post read. “As our investigation just concluded, they have been terminated. The heart and soul of our labor force is extremely diverse and we value our employees beyond description. Further, our company’s deep support—financial and in-kind—of Long Island’s diverse communities is a matter of public record. We can say without hesitation that whatever occurred on that LIRR train is in no way reflective of our company, its ownership, its management team, nor its employees.” Edelmind said that going to the game was a Christmas present for her 10-year-old son, who she said was left scared and on edge. After hearing that the couple was arrested, she said that she felt vindicated. “Justice prevails,” she told NBC 4. Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/21/2022,"A waitress is sparking a debate on TikTok after sharing her frustrating run-in with a customer.   The viral saga comes courtesy of user @momitsyourbirthday. Earlier this week, the TikToker posted a photo of a text conversation in which she confronts a customer who left her his phone number — after neither he nor his friends gave her a tip.  It’s the latest TikTok to stir a wide-ranging conversation about tipping culture in America. In prior videos, users have discussed whether it’s OK to tip with a gift card, whether delivery customers should give bigger tips if they live in a large apartment complex and how Uber Eats customers can “tip bait” drivers to get better service.  In her initial video, @momitsyourbirthday claimed the customer and his friends spent around $200 on dinner but left no tip.  “Next time you leave your number, make sure you leave a tip,” she texted him.  In her clip, @momitsyourbirthday called out the “audacity” of her customers and said she was “proud” of herself for confronting them.  Meanwhile, her situation spurred an argument in the comments. As is often the case with videos highlighting service industry dilemmas, users debated whether tipping should even be an issue. Learn how to monetize your passion like a pro on this episode of Getting Rich, sponsored by Acura “Y’all do realize tipping is expected in North America because we literally get paid less than minimum wage?” one user asked. “People assume that you’re going to tip if you go out,” another argued. “If you don’t like the fact that you’re not being tipped, get a different job.” Thankfully, the story ended fairly well for @momitsyourbirthday. In a follow-up video, she showed what happened when the customer finally responded to her text. As it turns out, he was extremely apologetic.  Through a series of texts, the customer claimed that he believed his friend had left a tip for all of them. “We all gave the guy, who paid extra, $10 each,” he wrote. “No lie, I apologize. Let me talk to him. That ain’t right.” Eventually, @momitsyourbirthday shared her Venmo handle with the customer. In exchange, she got a generous tip — and an apology.  Up your Instagram game with these menswear fashion tips More from In The Know: Chipotle customer reveals impressive life hack for ‘maximizing’ your burrito bowl order Nordstrom is having a big sale on home goods, from cozy blankets to high-end candles This 2-in-1 robot vacuum is ‘miles ahead’ of the Roomba — and it’s $200 off on Amazon Kourtney Kardashian’s favorite cozy throw blanket is 25% off at Nordstrom right now The post Waitress calls out ‘audacious’ customer who left his phone number after giving a $0 tip appeared first on In The Know.",U.S./In The Know by Yahoo,Waitress calls out ‘audacious’ customer who left his phone number after giving a $0 tip: ‘That ain’t right’,https://news.yahoo.com/waitress-calls-audacious-customer-left-173112866.html
1/21/2022,"Atoms are so small that it's almost impossible to see them without microscopes. But now, an award-winning photo shows a single atom in an electric field—and you can see it with the naked eye if you really look hard. This is a strontium atom, which has 38 protons. The diameter of a strontium atom is a few millionths of a millimeter. Atoms are really small. So small, in fact, that it's impossible to see one with the naked eye, even with the most powerful of microscopes. At least, that used to be true. Now, we have a photograph that shows a single atom floating in an electric field, and it's large enough to see without any kind of microscope. The photo (at the top of this story), taken by David Nadlinger and titled ""Single Atom In An Ion Trap,"" is the winner of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council science photography competition. The photo depicts a single strontium atom, embedded inside a strong electric field, blasted by lasers which cause it to emit light. Even though the atom is visible, it's still not the easiest to see. If you look very closely at the center of the photo, you'll see a faint blue dot. That's the strontium atom, illuminated by a blue-violet laser. This particular apparatus uses strontium because of its size: strontium has 38 protons, and the diameter of one of these atoms is a few millionths of a millimeter. Normally this would still be much too small to see, but this setup employs a clever trick to make the atom much brighter. The strontium atom in the photo is hit by a high-powered laser, which causes the electrons orbiting the strontium atom to become more energized. Occasionally, these energized electrons will give off light. With enough energized electrons giving off enough light, it's possible for an ordinary camera to image the atom. Still, that doesn't mean you'll be able to see the atom with your own eyes. This image is a long-exposure shot, which means even with all that laser light, it's still too faint to pick up without equipment. But given how incredibly tiny atoms are, looking at this photo is probably the closest you're going to get.

1/21/2022,"Why is Russia's Putin so focused on Ukraine? Ukraine has become the main flashpoint in Russia's relations with the West after a series of tough statements from President Vladimir Putin and a build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops near its border. U.S. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE WENDY SHERMAN SAYING: ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, there will be significant costs and consequences.” U.S. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN , SAYING:""I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades."" NATO SECRETARY GENERAL, JENS STOLTENBERG, SAYING: ""The risk of a conflict is real."" WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JEN PSAKI SAYING: ""This is an extremely dangerous situation. We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine."" Here are three reasons why Putin feels so strongly about Ukraine and has chosen to bring the crisis to a head. 1. HISTORY With the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia lost control of 14 former republics it had previously dominated, but the loss of Ukraine was the bitterest pill. Many Russians feel a connection with Ukraine that they do not feel towards other former Soviet states The two had been linked since the 9th century and speak closely related languages Putin has said Russians and Ukrainians were one people who shared a ‘single historic and spiritual space’ 2. GEOPOLITICS Since the Cold War ended NATO has expanded eastwards by taking in 14 new countries, including states that were once in the Soviet Union. For Russia - this was a threatening encroachment towards its borders. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, VLADIMIR PUTIN, SAYING:""The build-up of the United States and NATO's forces next to the Russian borders is of great concern."" While Ukraine is not a NATO member it has a promise it will eventually get to join. Since toppling a pro-Russian president in 2014, it has moved closer to the West, and staged joint military exercises with NATO. Putin says Ukraine's growing ties with the alliance could make it a launchpad for NATO missiles targeted at Russia. He wants security guarantees from the West including the rescinding of NATO's membership promise to Kyiv. 3. PUTIN'S MINDSET AND MOTIVES As a leader who tolerates virtually no domestic opposition, Putin has a strong aversion to revolutions in neighbouring countries that could encourage protests in Russia. Ukraine is potentially threatening for Putin if it inspires Russians with a pro-Western vision. Keeping the West guessing about a possible invasion of Ukraine has put Russia high on the international agenda and forced U.S. President Joe Biden to re-engage with Putin in a video call in December. In a recent interview Putin mourned the collapse of the Soviet Union as the demise of ‘historical Russia.’ Some analysts argue such statements suggest Putin sees Ukraine as ‘unfinished business’ and wants to follow the seizure of Crimea - which boosted his popularity in Russia – to bring part or all of Ukraine back under Moscow's control.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Why is Russia's Putin so focused on Ukraine?,https://news.yahoo.com/why-russias-putin-focused-ukraine-152040774.html
1/21/2022,"Josh Duggar, who was convicted of downloading and possessing child pornography, has requested a new trial. His attorneys filed a motion on Wednesday requesting that their client be acquitted. They sought to pin blame on an ex-employee of Duggar's, and accused prosecutors of not providing ""exculpatory evidence"" on time. Josh Duggar, the former reality-TV star convicted last month on child pornography charges, has requested a new trial and sought to blame a former employee for the illicit videos and photos found on his work computer. Duggar's attorneys filed a motion Wednesday evening asking the court to acquit Duggar of downloading and possessing child pornography, and complaining that their client was unfairly prevented from calling a ""necessary witness"" during the seven-day trial. That witness was a person who had worked at Duggar's used car lot in Springdale, Arkansas, the location where federal authorities found a desktop computer that had been used to download numerous videos and photos of child sexual abuse. Duggar's attorneys said in their motion that the former employee — who was also a registered sex offender — had ""regularly used the desktop computer in the months and weeks leading up to May 2019."" The child sexual abuse imagery found on Duggar's computer had been downloaded on multiple occasions between May 14 and May 16, 2019. Duggar's attorneys said that former employee, who had previously been interviewed by federal authorities and prosecutors, sent an ""unsolicited email"" to a prosecutor shortly before the trial. The email stated that the former employee had been ""completely mistaken"" when he told investigators he had not been at Duggar's used car lot, according to the motion. The former employee said in his email that he had been in Arkansas between May 8 and May 11, 2019, days before Duggar's child pornography downloading activity, and that he did not recall whether he used Duggar's computer during his trip. The former employee also sent a number of text messages, travel information, and receipts showing his various travels that month, according to the motion. While Duggar's attorneys acknowledged that the former employee hoped his email would ""establish that he was not at the car lot on certain dates in question,"" they accused prosecutors of improperly concealing the email until three days before Duggar's trial started. They alleged that the former employee sent another follow-up email after the trial started, which included the social media passwords of several other Duggar siblings. Duggar's team said this information would have helped them show the jury that multiple people had password access to various Duggar-related accounts. ""In this case, Duggar was deprived of materially exculpatory evidence until the evening before the Government rested its case,"" his attorneys wrote. Duggar, 33, has been incarcerated in the Washington County Jail since his December 9 conviction. He faces up to 40 years in prison, though no sentencing date has been set. Much of Duggar's defense strategy revolved around the theory that Duggar was not the only person with access to the HP desktop inside his used car lot. During the trial, Duggar's attorneys emphasized that no child sexual abuse material was ever found on Duggar's personal devices, including his phone and laptop. They also called a forensic investigator as a witness, who suggested Duggar had been the victim of a ""hit and run"" hacking scheme. But the jury wasn't convinced. A number of law-enforcement officials and digital forensics experts testified about the various disturbing images and videos found on Duggar's computer and the measures they said he took to evade detection. For instance, witnesses testified that Duggar had taken complex steps like partitioning his work computer's hard drive so that he could dodge the anti-pornography ""accountability"" software that reported all of his internet activity to his wife.

1/21/2022,"The Senate Ethics Committee determined Thursday that state Sen. Katrina Robinson, D-Memphis, violated the Senate code of ethics and recommended her expulsion due to her conviction on federal fraud charges. Robinson will now face a full Senate vote based on the committee's recommendation. The senator is awaiting a March sentencing date for two federal fraud charges related to the mismanagement of federal funds in connection to her leadership of a nursing school. Robinson's criminal trial focused on events that occurred prior to her 2018 election to the state Senate. Following the committee vote, Robinson said she was ""taken aback"" by the process on Thursday. Robinson had requested a delay so her attorney could join her, and the senator continually argued her federal case has not yet concluded, despite her conviction. A federal judge winnowed charges against Robinson from 20 to five during trial, and earlier this month acquitted Robinson for two of the four charges the jury found her guilty of last fall. Her sentencing is scheduled for March. ""We haven't even finished the legal process yet, and we've seen how this case has gone,"" Robinson said. ""I think that in itself warrants this body being patient with the process. What is the hurry? One has to ask what is the hurry."" Related: Tennessee state Sen. Katrina Robinson found guilty in federal fraud trial Robinson said her attorneys are ""considering"" a motion for reconsideration in the federal case due to ""new developments,"" but no motion has been filed. Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, suggested Robinson should step down voluntarily following the committee's findings. ""The Senate Ethics Committee conducted a fair and deliberative hearing on the complaints against Senator Robinson,"" McNally said in a statement. ""They considered not only her explicit legal status but also the ethical and moral failings indicative in the charges against her. ""The committee found the charges against her violate the Code of Ethics of the Senate and require expulsion,"" McNally said. ""The removal of a Senator under these circumstances is a very serious and historically unprecedented step. This is not something we consider lightly. I continue to hope Senator Robinson will reflect on the findings of the committee and choose to step down voluntarily in the best interest of the Senate."" Robinson initially requested a delay of the hearing earlier this week, after she was informed Friday the committee had found probable cause to hold a public hearing. The Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, the NAACP Memphis Branch and the Shelby County Democratic Legislative Caucus submitted letters to the Ethics Committee on Wednesday asking for a hearing delay pending a ""final"" court ruling in Robinson's federal case. Related: Tennessee State Sen. Katrina Robinson acquitted of two counts of wire fraud; two remain The committee voted along party lines to deny Robinson's request Thursday, with Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, voting to delay the hearing. Sen. John Stevens, R-Huntingdon; Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin; Sen. Steve Southerland, R-Morristown; and Sen. Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin, voted to find Robinson in violation of Senate ethics. After a brief recess to consider committee procedure, the committee voted again along party lines to recommend Robinson for expulsion if the Senate finds Robinson committed an ethical violation. ""The trial is on the floor of the Senate. This body is only here to make a recommendation to the full body,""Stevens said. ""You will have the opportunity to have counsel on the floor, which is appropriate."" But Robinson questioned the impartiality of the ethics panel. ""How can someone expect to get a fair hearing in front of a committee that is made up of four Republicans and one Democrat? Four men and one woman. Four white men and one Black woman,"" Robinson told reporters. ""It used to be there was supposed to an equal or comparable amount of Democrats to Republicans on the ethics committee."" It's unclear when the Senate could take up consideration of the committee's recommendation. ""I would urge, given the seriousness of this, that we make sure our colleague has adequate time to prepare and make sure her attorneys are here,"" Akbari said, asking the committee to provide plenty of notice to Robinson before it goes to the full Senate. ""We really want this to be as fair a process as possible."" Robinson successfully fought for an acquittal of two charges following her conviction on four charges last fall, but a federal judge in January denied a motion for a new trial. A federal jury found Robinson guilty in September 2021 of four counts of wire fraud in connection to her leadership of a nursing school and the management of funds from a federal grant. Robinson was initially charged with mismanaging more than $600,000 of federal funds intended for scholarships and faced a 48-count indictment. When the case went to trial in September 2021, charges were reduced to 20 counts, 15 of which Judge Sheryl Lipman dismissed. Robinson was found guilty of four charges related to less than $3,500, which prosecutors said Robinson used for wedding expenses. Earlier this month, Lipman acquitted Robinson of two of those charges, finding prosecutors had insufficient evidence to prove she intentionally falsified records at The Healthcare Institute. Akbari said Thursday she felt the committee's action was premature before final sentencing, given how the prosecution's case of 48 counts has fallen to two remaining charges. Akbari said it also could be a ""slippery slope"" to judge a lawmaker's behavior prior to their election without a finalized criminal case. ""There are two more left — anything could happen before that final conviction notice is signed,"" Akbari said. ""Therefore, I don’t think it’s right yet for us to move forward."" In a second federal fraud cause, Robinson agreed to enter into a pre-trial diversion program. Robinson is not the only Shelby County senator facing legal woes. Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, continues to serve in the General Assembly as he prepares for a federal trial over alleged campaign finance violations in a conspiracy to enrich a failed 2016 bid for Congress. Kelsey, who has denied wrongdoing, was slated to face a jury in January but last month requested a delay of the trial, which is now set for January 2023.
