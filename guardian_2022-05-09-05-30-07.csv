5/9/2022,"Manchester City will be without Ruben Dias, Kyle Walker and John Stones as they seek to retain the title in the final three matches of the season. Pep Guardiola confirmed the defenders’ long‑term absences after the 5-0 rout of Newcastle on Sunday, with the City manager also claiming “people want Liverpool to win more than us” – the title rivals are now three points behind the champions with an inferior goal difference of four. While Stones and Walker were not in the matchday squad, Dias suffered a hamstring problem during the first half at the Etihad Stadium and had to be replaced at the break by Fernandinho. With Nathan Aké nursing an ankle injury that also makes him a serious doubt for the trip to Wolves on Wednesday, Guardiola may be without four frontline defenders for the trip to the Midlands. “Ruben, Kyle and John are out for the season,” Guardiola said. “In pre-season is the next time [we will see them]. We have 13.5 players because Nathan is not in perfect condition.” The 37-year-old Fernandinho will have a vital role in the championship run-in. “A lot [of importance],” Guardiola said. “Otherwise, it’s [the youngsters] CJ Egan-Riley or Luke Mbete[-Tabu]. In this situation it’s not a problem, Rodri can play there. We have the academy. Everyone has to do extra. We have problems and that’s all.” Of the chase between City and Liverpool, Guardiola said: “The people want Liverpool to win more than us – it’s not an issue. It’s normal. Maybe they have more supporters all around the world and in England maybe more support Liverpool than us. Liverpool, alongside [Manchester] United, are the most famous team, with what they have done in history – in terms of titles, legacy, history, dramas, for many, many things. But we are, for the last 10, 11, 12 years, coming there [too]. I know we are sometimes uncomfortable [for people who don’t want us to], but I don’t care.” Two goals from Raheem Sterling plus one each from Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Phil Foden pulled City further clear of Liverpool following their 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday. Each team has three games remaining. “What happened with Liverpool and today makes Wednesday an absolute final, final for us,” Guardiola said. “If we can win then maybe we come here on the final day against Aston Villa with our people looking to do back-to-back titles.” The win also represented the perfect response to the elimination from the Champions League semi-finals at the hands of Real Madrid last Wednesday. “It was a perfect afternoon,” Guardiola said. “With what this team has done, do you have any doubt?”",Sport/Football,"‘The people want Liverpool to win more than Manchester City,’ says Guardiola ",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/the-people-want-liverpool-to-win-more-than-us-says-guardiola-as-manchester-city-pull-ahead-in-the-title-race

5/9/2022,"Eleven months of Sundays have passed since a visibly uncomfortable Andrew Neil launched GB News, fighting sound and lighting issues at the new anti-woke network from which he soon resigned as lead presenter. Now, Neil has started another new Sunday show at Channel 4, where a professional studio set-up allowed us to see how much happier and healthier he looked than on that grim night last June. Although the type of viewer who would watch a political talk-show running opposite the Bafta awards would surely know who the presenter is, there were giant reminders as he sat between a sort of ego sandwich of the words The Andrew Neil Show in huge typeface both on the wall behind his desk and the facade in front. Many of us watching are likely to have been refugees from This Week, one of the most original and authoritative political series ever, which Neil presented on BBC One from 2003-19. There are echoes of that programme in the jokey opening – the host apparently caught unawares while eating curry and drinking champagne in his work place – and closing: Neil lifts up his script to reveal a copy of a hard-core tractor publication of the sort that apparently led the recently resigned Tory MP Neil Parish to be drawn into viewing porn. And, where This Week had Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo as Neil’s resident left-right sidekicks, he will be joined on Channel 4 each week by Pippa Crerar of the Mirror and Madeline Grant of the Telegraph. The network chose this start-date to follow last week’s local elections, but Neil and his team boldly ignored that event, with the presenter – who clearly seemed to have been given more editorial freedom than at the BBC – announcing that what really mattered was the cost of living crisis. This created an uncomfortable evening for the live studio interviewee, Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency, who was asked no questions at all on the first half of his brief and just one on the second, as Neil pressed him relentlessly on why the Johnson administration, in the inflation and prices crisis, seem to be doing least for those families who most need it. Rees-Mogg initially looked happy at the focus, always keen to play fantasy Chancellor of the Exchequer – but the true-blue politician looked increasingly true-red, seeming visibly angered by Neil’s combative approach: “The poorest need help now!” This was Neil back to his best, combining forensic knowledge of statistics and documents with intense listening during the interview, rather than, as some TV inquisitors do, sticking to a rigid pre-prepared question list. Caveats? Neil came close to Piers Morgan levels of narcissism when he scolded Rees-Mogg, “You don’t get away with cheap debating tricks! I grew up in a tougher debating school than you!” And he seemed so pumped up by the flaying of Jacob that he was too rude to Grant and Crerar in their segment at the end of the show. In future editions, he should treat these sharp journalists more as co-hosts. It also seemed strange that the weekend’s biggest political story – the convulsions in Northern Ireland caused by a Sinn Fein majority and a DUP ultimatum to London on post-Brexit border protocols – was touched on only in Neil’s outro. At some point in the run, a cheeky guest will ask Neil whether he thinks Channel 4 should be privatised – which could be interesting – but the network has done well in getting the premier political interviewer back at a first-class broadcaster.",Arts/Television & radio,"The Andrew Neil Show review – back to his best with curry, porn and Jacob Rees-Mogg",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/the-andrew-neil-show-review-back-to-his-best-with-curry-porn-and-jacob-rees-mogg
5/9/2022,"Dennis Waterman, who has died aged 74, was an actor whose rough-edged charm and gravelly tones were especially effective as criminals or crime-fighters who walked a tight line between danger and humour and could cross from one side to the other at unexpected moments. While some TV stars become indelibly associated with one famous role, Waterman achieved lead parts in three separate long-running peak-time features that rank among TV’s best-loved series. In The Sweeney (ITV, 1974-78), he was DS George Carter, a tough, sexist, corruptible detective, meeting violence with violence, in the Metropolitan police’s “Flying Squad”, junior to John Thaw’s DI Jack Regan. Almost as soon as that show came to an end, ITV cast him on (just) the other side of the law in Minder (ITV, 1979-89) as Terry McCann, an ex-con who, on release from jail, can find work only as a assistant-cum-bodyguard to George Cole’s Dickensian petty crook Arthur Daley. Those two roles secured Waterman’s place in TV history but his professional tenacity and rapport with audiences brought him another long-runner as Gerry Standing, one of a group of retired detectives brought back to run a cold case unit in New Tricks which ran on BBC One from 2003-15. In the working-class south London culture from which Waterman grew up, there was often a sense that it was a matter of narrow luck whether some men became a cop or a robber, and Waterman shrewdly used this ambiguity, to menacing effect in The Sweeney, comedy in Minder and somewhere between in New Tricks. Unlike actors who prefer clear top billing and the most lines in the script, Waterman was always best as a co-star, forming formidable double acts with Thaw and Cole, resulting in close friendships and deep mourning of their deaths. This loyalty and generosity also informed New Tricks, where he was part of a rotating star ensemble with Amanda Redman, Alun Armstrong, James Bolam, Denis Lawson and Nicholas Lyndhurst. Care is needed in reading an actor’s life into their performances but it seems reasonable to feel that Waterman’s portrayals of chancers and hustlers may have drawn on an edginess he personally possessed. He had four marriages, of which the one to actor Rula Lenska ended due to Waterman’s admitted violent behaviour. Those incidents – and subsequent attempts to minimise his actions in an interview with Piers Morgan – would probably have ended a career now but the actor benefited from a greater willingness at that time to forgive so-called “bad boy” behaviour in prominent men. A viewer who only watched The Sweeney, Minder and New Tricks might raise questions over his acting range: DCI Standing could have been the older, slightly mellowed DS Carter and Terry McCann the nephew of either. But, in fact, across his career, Waterman was versatile. A natural performer, he was an actor for almost all of his life, making his film debut aged 11, playing an insulin-dependent child held hostage (can the police find him before he needs his medicine?) in the 1960 British movie Night Train to Inverness. Stage school and the Children’s Film Foundation brought him multiple roles in his youth, including the likable delinquent William Brown in a BBC production of Just William (1962). Also adept as a singer and dancer, Waterman appeared in West End musicals – including My Fair Lady and Windy City – and, unusually, specialised in singing the theme tunes of his TV shows, crooning over the credits of Minder, New Tricks and two lesser successes, On the Up and Stay Lucky. This signature gift was lampooned in sketches for the comedy series Little Britain, in which David Walliams played a caricature of Waterman infuriating his agent by turning down roles unless he was allowed to sing the title number. Showing an ability to laugh at himself by no means universal in showbiz, Waterman subsequently made a cameo appearance in a stage version of Little Britain, with Walliams and Matt Lucas. He will, though, most be remembered and replayed in a 1970s and 80s sub-genre of London streetwise drama created by Thames Television, and its greatest achievements The Sweeney and Minder.",Arts/Television & radio,Dennis Waterman: a streetwise natural in three great British TV series,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/dennis-waterman-a-streetwise-natural-in-three-great-british-tv-series
