2/27/2022,"Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday. There are reports that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack, while an oil terminal in Vasylkiv, south-west of the capital, Kyiv, has also been targeted. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion in Kharkiv could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows. The 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed while defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment – reportedly telling a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender – may still be alive, according to Ukrainian officials. Britain is preparing a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. Truss said there would be “nowhere left to hide” for the super-rich allies of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. She told the Sunday Times that new names would be added to the list every few weeks as ministers seek to ratchet up the pressure on Putin. Liquor stores and bars in the US and Canada are targeting Russia’s national drink in a show of unity with the people of Ukraine. Shelves in both countries are being stripped of Russian vodka, with the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, announcing on Saturday the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice”. Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‘Mickey’ Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy”. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1bn yen ($8.7m) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence”, Agence France-Presse reported. A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook post: “The enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain. Let us help them get straight to hell.”",News/World news,Russian banks excluded from Swift: what we know so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/russian-banks-excluded-from-swift-what-we-know-so-far
2/27/2022,"The Kremlin-backed RT channel, which has reported that Russian troops are trying to liberate Ukraine, has been suspended by Foxtel in Australia. “In view of concern about the situation in Ukraine, the Russia Today channel is currently unavailable on Foxtel and Flash,” a spokesperson for the Foxtel Group said. Foxtel made the decision on Saturday evening after monitoring the broadcast and stopped streaming RT at 5.45 pm on Foxtel and Flash. The satellite transmission came off the air at 6.40pm. Russian state broadcaster RT just published Tucker Carlson’s rant to defend Putin with Russian subtitles pic.twitter.com/atmHt4TlmS For several days after the Russian invasion started, viewers of the channel formerly known as Russia Today were told troops were trying to “liberate” land from Ukraine on behalf of two Russian-backed breakaway states. Australian viewers saw coverage of the situation in Ukraine from a pro-Russian perspective, with on-the-ground reports that included interviews with jubilant residents, and Russian citizens who had “selflessly opened their doors” to refugees. Australians can still access RT on YouTube and via the broadcaster’s own website. The decision was a backflip for Foxtel which a day earlier said it was committed to keeping the English-language news channel on air. “Foxtel and Flash are committed to diversity in their news channels, including 14 Australian and international news channels on Foxtel and over 20 news sources on Flash,” a spokesperson said on Friday. “These include BBC World News, CNN and Sky News Australia, as well as Russia Today. Each of these channels have a different editorial approach and provide our subscribers with a choice of varied perspectives on world affairs. “While we are concerned at the gravity of the situation unfolding, the Foxtel Group does not endorse content from its news channel providers, including Russia Today. We will continue to monitor the situation.” Public broadcaster SBS was quicker to act, suspending the broadcast of news bulletins NTV Moscow and Russia Today last week in response to feedback from the Australian Russian-speaking community and a personal phone call from the federal communications minister, Paul Fletcher. “SBS is continuing to provide news and information in Russian for Australian audiences through its SBS Russian service (SBS.com.au/Russian) across radio, online and social media, including expanded coverage of current events as they unfold,” SBS said. Fletcher, who was not involved in the Foxtel decision, praised SBS: “Given the current actions of the Russian government, and the lack of genuinely independent Russian media, this is a responsible decision.” In the UK, the media regulator, Ofcom, is monitoring RT’s output for potential breaches of the broadcasting code. UK Labour has called for a ban on the Russian state-backed broadcaster, accusing the channel of pumping out pro-Vladimir Putin “propaganda”.",News/Australia news,Foxtel cuts broadcast of Kremlin-backed RT channel in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/foxtel-cuts-broadcast-of-kremlin-backed-rt-channel-in-australia
