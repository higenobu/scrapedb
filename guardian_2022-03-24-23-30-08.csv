3/24/2022,"Bruce Norris’s 2010 satire was written as a response to Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun and, like that American classic, examines interracial tensions though the prism of property ownership. It begins in 1959, the year Hansberry’s play premiered, and is also set in Chicago, but here we are taken inside a household in the eponymous upmarket white enclave, whose residents raise qualms when they discover a black family is about to move in. “The history of America is the history of private property,” says Karl, and his words foreshadow the second half, 50 years on, in which the scenario is inverted; Clybourne Park is now predominantly black, with a petition against a white couple moving into the neighbourhood. Much garlanded at its premiere, winning both a Tony and a Pulitzer, the drama still feels fresh for its connecting threads, which link race, land, upward mobility and the politics of gentrification. Sleekly directed by Oliver Kaderbhai, the cast – strong across the board– helps to construct and dismantle James Turner’s set in clever choreography that mirrors themes of homebuilding and historical change. But it is a play of two halves, both in structure and effect, as it sets up a deeply moving and complex drama in its first part that feels as if it is leading to an explosive second, yet does not quite deliver emotional or intellectual depth. Nevertheless, the satire stays sharp and there are many points of provocation. There is, in the first household, the sugary Bev (Imogen Stubbs) who speaks of her maid Francine (Aliyah Odoffin) as a “friend” but displays blind entitlement. Satirised deftly, she could easily be reborn as Reese Witherspoon’s guilty white wife in Little Fires Everywhere. Bev and her husband, Russ (Richard Lintern), are mourning the death of their son, who killed himself after committing atrocities in the Korean war, and their grief gives them humanity so that the satire never feels reductive. Tension builds slowly alongside spiky comedy as the outrightly racist Karl (Andrew Langtree, full of weasly zeal) enters the scene, along with Francine’s husband, Albert (Eric Underwood). This latter black couple emanate silent dignity, and disgust, as they watch this fulminating household fight over the prospect of black neighbours – and falling house prices. The second half is flatter, becoming a verbal battle in which a racist and homophobic joke is deconstructed for its offence; a white liberal character, Lindsay (Katie Matsell), insists half her friends are black, though she can only name one; and a black resident, Lena (Odoffin), tells her own anti-white joke. None of it penetrates very deeply and, plot-wise, it feels anticlimatic when a buried box is eventually unearthed and dragged on to the stage and gives us sentimentality rather than revelation or resolution. It is a missed opportunity, and not nearly as shocking or impactful as Branden Jacob-Jenkins’s gothic satire Appropriate, which also deals in white American history and its connection to property. The cast, however, is little short of magnificent, and the actors bring every last offensive joke, inanity and quieter moment alive.

3/24/2022,"The climate crisis is threatening food stocks in sub-Saharan Africa, but a comprehensive approach to food, farming and resources could increase crop production by more than 500% in some countries in the region, according to new research by more than 200 experts. There is no single technological fix to the threat posed by the barrage of natural disasters striking the region, they said, but significant improvements could be achieved with new approaches, based on modelling done by the network of researchers in Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa and Zambia. “The climate change crisis is accelerating. We are seeing more floods, droughts, pests and diseases, especially in the southern Africa region. We are seeing this become more frequent and more severe,” said Sithembile Mwamakamba, director of policy research and analysis at the Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Analysis Network, a pan-African organisation. “If urgent action is not taken to make agriculture in the region more resilient to climate impacts, our food systems will definitely fail us and push our rural communities to the edge.” Mwamakamba said “climate smart” policies need to cut across sectors to be effective, recognising that the climate crisis can affect agriculture, health, nutrition and security. The researchers produced a tool that quantified crop yields, land and water use as well as greenhouse gas emissions and nutrition to model the effects of the changing climate and how policies could have an impact. There had been successful trials of agricultural methods such as terracing, said researchers, as a way to improve soil health and water availability. The report added that developing new crop varieties was crucial to cope with extreme temperatures and rainfall. It also warned that policies developed in isolation could lead to conflicts. For example, the expansion of agricultural land to increase production could cause tensions over land and water usage. According to the research, Malawi’s crucial maize yields could fall by a fifth by 2050 without action, but with a coordinated approach to technology, agriculture, infrastructure and food security, its production could increase by more than 700%. Tanzania had the potential for a 17-fold increase in crop production. The four-year research project was produced by a partnership of organisations based in the countries studied and the UK. Prof Tim Benton, co-principal investigator of the research, said the findings could be crucial for governments. “This research gives governments some of the information and evidence they need to get ahead of climate impacts by implementing reforms that enhance resilience, boost nutritional outcomes, and enhance livelihoods.”",News/Global development,‘Climate smart’ policies could increase southern Africa’s crops by up to 500%,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/24/climate-smart-policies-could-increase-southern-africas-crops-by-up-to-500
3/24/2022,"Russia has blocked Google News, accusing it of promoting “inauthentic information” about the invasion of Ukraine. The ban came just hours after Google announced it would not allow users worldwide to monetise content that “exploits, dismisses, or condones” the war. Google’s new policy affects any website, app or YouTube channel that earns revenue from advertising managed by the search engine. It has long had a policy that bars adverts from appearing next to any content that “incites violence” and says the new policy clarifies and expands those rules. “We can confirm that we’re taking additional steps to clarify, and in some instances expand, our monetisation guidelines as they relate to the war in Ukraine,” a Google spokesperson said. The company had already taken action against Russian state-funded media in late February, and paused all adverts for Russian users earlier this month. The latest ban could cut off funding to western media outlets supportive of Russia, even if ithey have no clear financial tie to the state itself. Within hours of Google’s new policy, the Russian internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced its own ban, blocking Google News in its entirety from internet users. “Based on a request from the Russian prosecutor general’s office, Roskomnadzor has restricted access to the internet service news.google in the country,” the body said in a statement. “The mentioned US internet news resource provided access to numerous publications and materials containing unreliable, publicly significant information about the course of the special military operation in Ukraine.” Roskomnadzor has been steadily taking action against US internet giants as the war in Ukraine has progressed. A week after Russia first invaded, it blocked Facebook and Twitter in apparent retaliation to those two companies removing Russian state media including RT and Sputnik from their platforms. The official explanation listed 26 cases of “discrimination” against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. Initially, the ban focused only on Facebook itself, which has low penetration in Russia, sparing the popular apps Instagram and WhatsApp from a ban. But on 11 March, those were added to the block list, following a policy change from Facebook to allow Ukrainian users to make violent threats against Russian soldiers. “These are temporary measures designed to preserve voice and expression for people who are facing invasion,” Facebook said at the time.",News/World news,Russia blocks Google News for its ‘inauthentic information’ on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russia-blocks-google-news-for-its-inauthentic-information-on-ukraine
3/24/2022,"I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest something that would have seemed utter nonsense as late as a month ago: I’m seeing the stirrings in Washington of a new era of … I’m not sure what to call it. “Unity” is way too strong. “Bipartisanship” is premature. “De-partisanship” is too clunky. But something new seems to be happening, and Vladimir Putin is responsible. Don’t get me wrong. Democrats and Republicans won’t join hands and sing Kumbaya anytime soon. Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy will continue to ambush Democrats every chance they get. Expect bitter battles over background checks, immigration reform, civil rights protections and Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the supreme court. Trump won’t stop telling his big lie. Your Fox News-obsessed Uncle Bob will remain in his hermetically sealed alternative universe. Yet ever since the runup to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, I’ve noticed something in Washington that I haven’t seen in three decades – a quiet understanding that we’re on the brink of a new cold war, potentially even a hot one. Which requires that we join together in order to survive. It’s a subtle shift – more of tone than anything else. I saw it when Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed Congress from Ukraine. When he showed lawmakers a gut-wrenching video of the war’s consequences, many eyes filled with tears. The lawmakers shared, according to Maine’s independent senator Angus King, “a collective holding of breath”. That Republicans and Democrats shared anything – that they were even capable of a collective emotion – is itself remarkable. With bipartisan support, Ukraine is receiving unprecedented military and humanitarian aid to fight Putin’s war, including anti-aircraft systems that many experts say can defend against bombs and missiles from Russia’s land-based weaponry. Beyond Ukraine, you can also discern the shift in a series of recent across-the-aisle agreements. After literally 200 failed attempts, the Senate just passed an anti-lynching law. The Senate has also given sexual misconduct claims firmer legal footing with a new law ending forced arbitration in sexual assault and harassment cases. The Senate also just approved sweeping postal reform. And unanimously decided to keep daylight savings time year-round. And it has given the green light to long-awaited reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act as part of a giant spending bill. I’m hearing from Senate staffers that they’re close to bipartisan agreement to strengthen antitrust laws. Also on a measure to expand semiconductor manufacturing in America, as part of a new China competitiveness bill. And another measure to limit the cost of insulin. OK, none of this is as dramatic as protecting voting rights or controlling prescription drug costs. But compared with the last few years, it’s extraordinary. (You may not have heard much about these initiatives because the media only picks up on bitter conflict and name-calling.) Something new is happening in Washington, and I think I know why. You see, I came to Washington in 1974, in the Ford administration, and then worked in the Carter administration. The cold war was raging during those years, serving as a kind of silent backdrop for everything else. Democrats and Republicans had different views on a host of issues, but we worked together because it was assumed that we had to. We faced a common threat. The cold war had produced an array of bipartisan legislation involving huge investments in America – legislation that was justified by the Soviet threat but in reality had much more to do with the needs of the nation. The National Interstate and Defense Highway Act was designed to “permit quick evacuation of target areas” in case of nuclear attack and get munitions rapidly from city to city. Of course, in subsequent years it proved indispensable to America’s economic growth. America’s huge investment in higher education in the late 1950s was spurred by the Soviets’ Sputnik satellite. The official purpose of the National Defense Education Act, as it was named, was to “insure trained manpower of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the national defense needs of the United States”. But it trained an entire generation of math and science teachers, and expanded access to higher education. The defense department’s Advanced Research Projects Administration served as America’s de facto incubator for new technologies. It was critical to the creation of the internet as well as new materials technologies. John F Kennedy launched the race to the moon in 1962 so that space wouldn’t be “governed by a hostile flag of conquest” (ie, the Soviet Union). But it did much more than this for America. Then, in November 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. And in December 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed. Just three years later, Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House – and instigated the angriest and most divisive chapter in modern American political history. I was there. I remember the change in Washington, as if a storm had swept in. Weeks before, Republican members of Congress occasionally gave me a hard time, but they were generally civil. Suddenly, I was treated as if I were the enemy. Looking back, I can’t help wonder if the cold war had held America together – gave us common purpose, reminded us of our interdependence. With its end, perhaps we had nowhere to turn except on each other. If the cold war had not ended, I doubt Gingrich would have been able to launch a new internal war inside America. Had the Soviet menace remained, I doubt Donald Trump would have been able to take up Gingrich’s mantle of hate and conspiracy. Putin has brought a fractured Nato together. Maybe he’s bringing America back together too. It’s the thinnest of silver linings to the human disaster he’s creating, but perhaps he’ll have the same effect on the US as the old Soviet Union did on America’s sense of who we are.

3/24/2022,"The White House has asked two Trump-appointed members of the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition to resign from their posts or be terminated. On Wednesday, the White House sent letters to Dr Mehmet Oz and former football star Herschel Walker – two Republican Senate candidates in Georgia and Pennsylvania, respectively – asking them to submit their resignations or face termination. “On behalf of President Biden, I am writing to request your resignation as a Member of the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition,” wrote Gautam Raghavan, an assistant to Joe Biden. “Please submit your resignation to me by the close of business today. Should we not receive your resignation, your position with the Council will be terminated effective 6.00pm tonight.” Oz and Walker were appointed to the council in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump. In December 2020, before leaving office, Trump reappointed them for an additional two-year term. Under the Biden administration’s policies, federal candidates are not allowed to serve on presidential boards, a White House official told CNN. Oz pushed back against the White House’s call for his resignation, tweeting an image of the letter with the caption, “It’s sad that he would politicize such an important issue like health. The doctor he should ask to resign is Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, for a multitude of obvious reasons.” “Clearly Joe Biden can’t be around anyone who doesn’t completely fall in line with his fearmongering authoritarian one-size-fits-all Covid handling. I am proud of my service and will not resign,” Oz said in a video message on Twitter. Members who are part of the council are considered special government employees and according to the Hatch Act, “may not be candidates in partisan elections” while performing official government duties, CNN reported.

3/24/2022,"Moscow’s stock market rallied after share trading resumed for the first time since the Ukraine invasion began nearly a month ago, although the US dismissed Thursday’s limited reopening as a “charade”. The market initially rose by more than 11% when a limited, shortened trading session got under way on the Moscow Exchange. But the rally lost some momentum, with the Moex index of blue-chip shares ending the day 4.4% higher, on its first session since 25 February. Energy companies and commodity producers led the gainers, reflecting the rise in gas, oil and raw material prices since the war began, but some companies exposed to the extensive sanctions imposed on Russia fell. Just 33 of the 50 securities on the rouble-denominated Moex were trading, while the RTS index of Russian companies quoted in US dollars remained shut. Stocks which were trading were supported by new restrictions, including a bar on traders short-selling shares they do not own, while foreign investors cannot sell stocks until 1 April. Reports earlier this month that Russia planned to channel up to 1 trillion roubles (£7.7bn) from its national wealth fund to buy stocks could also have encouraged buying. The US was scathing about Moscow’s attempt to restart equities trading. “What we’re seeing is a charade, a Potemkin market opening,” said Daleep Singh, the US deputy national security advisor for international economics, referring to fake villages supposedly created for the Russian empress Catherine the Great to give the illusion of prosperity. “After keeping its markets closed for nearly a month, Russia announced it will only allow 15% of listed shares to trade, foreigners are prohibited from selling their shares, and short selling in general has been banned. Meanwhile, Russia has made clear they are going to pour government resources into artificially propping up the shares of companies that are trading,” he said. “This is not a real market and not a sustainable model – which only underscores Russia’s isolation from the global financial system.” Traders agreed that the heavy restrictions meant Moscow was not a properly functional market. “The Moex rallied in early trade, but that is what happens if lots of people can’t sell,” Neil Wilson of Markets.com pointed out. The chemical firm PhosAgro, which produces fertilisers and phosphates, surged by 26% while oil and gas group Tatneft jumped 20%, and energy giant Gazprom gained 13.4%. Nickel and palladium miner Nornickel rose 10%. The airline Aeroflot sank 16%, the top faller, with Russian planes banned from European Union and UK airspace. The state-owned bank VTB dropped 5.5%. having been hit by western sanctions. The oil pipeline operator Transneft fell 6%, and children’s toy retail chain Detsky Mir lost 5.5%. Despite Thursday’s recovery, the Moex is still down almost a third this year, having weakened in the run-up to the Ukraine invasion and plunged when it began. The rouble fell by nearly 10%, to around 98 roubles to the dollar, reversing Wednesday’s gains after President Vladimir Putin said “unfriendly” countries would be forced to pay for their gas purchases in roubles rather than dollars.",News/World news,Russia’s stock market rallies in first day of trading since Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russia-stock-market-rallies-in-first-day-of-trading-since-ukraine-war
3/24/2022,"It was in 2007, while working in Ibiza, that the drag queen Divina De Campo finally got to watch the 2001 film Hedwig and the Angry Inch, thanks to a colleague who had the DVD. Before then, she had unsuccessfully tried to persuade her then boyfriend to watch it with her on their weekend trips to Blockbuster. “I loved it, I just thought the whole thing was incredible,” she recalls. “And a real epiphany, like, how have I wasted these five years of not seeing this amazing film?” Ever since, she has wanted to play the role of Hedwig, a genderqueer rocker – even cheekily tweeting that she would be up for it after coming runner-up on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK in 2019. And now, it’s finally happening. Next month, she will take on the role of Hedwig – her first major lead in a musical – for a revival of the show that the film was based on, at Leeds Playhouse. “It’s like putting on a new coat, but one I’ve really wanted for a long time,” she says. Speaking after a day of rehearsals, she and director Jamie Fletcher – who have known each other for more than 18 years – look far from washed out. Instead, they are animated and bubbly, riffing off one another and frequently erupting into laughter. “We’re going for a curr-eh!” De Campo says excitedly exaggerating her Yorkshire accent, when I ask what they’re doing after our hour-long interview. Then she tilts back her shaved head, letting out a euphoric cackle, something she tends to do a lot. First staged as an off-Broadway musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch explores the life story of its titular, fictional rock singer. Born as Hansel Schmidt, a self-described “slip of a girlyboy”, in communist East Germany, she falls in love with an American GI in her 20s, and is coerced by him into having gender-reassignment surgery so that they can marry as husband and wife and emigrate to the US. Only, the operation goes wrong, leaving Hedwig with an “angry inch”. Worse still, the GI leaves her on their first wedding anniversary. Hedwig recounts her story while touring dive bars in 1990s America with her unsuccessful band, the Angry Inch, embittered after another former lover stole her songs to become a hugely successful rock star. Eventually, she finds peace within herself. While the film flopped at its box office opening – being released the day after the 11 September attacks probably didn’t help – it has since amassed a cult following, particularly in the LGBTQ+ community, where DVDs circulated among friends. Both the film and the musical are the work of scriptwriter John Cameron Mitchell and composer Stephen Trask. Fletcher’s revival sees the cast take on the original stage version but she has also looked to the film for inspiration. Ultimately, says Fletcher, this new production is “about being free to just be able to be your whole self without having to fit a mould. However you might identify, I think that we all experience these things about feeling like we’re having to behave or look a particular way in order to fit in.” What can audiences expect? “The show itself is like a rollercoaster: you’re going to, like, a rock concert and then suddenly, you’re at some cabaret in the middle of a Pizza Express,” promises De Campo. “You get real punk rocky stuff right the way through to more ballads.” She describes it as a “really, really gay Rocky Horror Show – if that’s possible”, with the “same sort of gritty, B-movie feeling to it, but also there’s a little bit more honesty there”. Local gems will be swapped in for the original’s US setting, with a northern working men’s club and Leeds’s vast Roundhay Park both featuring. While De Campo is known for her four-octave vocal range, Hedwig’s soundtrack channels David Bowie, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop in a production that is 100 minutes long. How are rehearsals going? “I am surprised at how well my voice is holding [up], if I’m fully honest, because I’m used to singing traditional musical theatre and pop and classical stuff, so things that aren’t so stressful on my voice. But there’s a lot of rasp, there’s a lot of growl, and we’re throwing some high stuff in there as well, where it makes sense,” she says, with a shrill cackle. Hedwig’s gender expression has connected with transgender, non-binary and cisgender people alike. Yet there has been controversy in the past over who should get to play its lead character: a 2020 Sydney production was cancelled after complaints over its casting of a cis male in the lead role. Mitchell and Trask, who are both non-binary, have argued that the role should be “open to anyone who can tackle it and, more importantly, anyone who needs it … Though we’ve always been so pleased to hear trans folks find resonance in the character’s journey to find his/herself, it’s really through drag and performance that Hedwig does so, creating a persona that is ‘more than a woman or a man’.” For this revival, Hedwig is seen as a genderqueer, feminine-presenting individual, rather than as a drag queen. “Hedwig is more of an identity,” says De Campo of her interpretation. “So, some of the iterations of the show have very much tried to be, like, ‘She’s a drag queen.’ But that doesn’t feel real … I think she’s in the kind of non-binary, genderqueer space, [but] she’s definitely more on the femme side.” Fletcher adds: “How many drag queens would go out in full regalia to just get a pint of milk from the shop [as Hedwig would]?” De Campo jokes back: “Yeah, I’m not going down the middle aisle of Aldi in full drag!” The cast is filled with transgender, non-binary and queer artists, including Elijah Ferreira as Hedwig’s second husband Yitzhak. “I’m a trans woman so I’ve always thought it’s important that queer and trans people get to tell our own stories,” says Fletcher. “By doing so, you bring that nuance and honesty and integrity to a show.” De Campo, whose alter ego Owen Farrow is non-binary, points to the success of Russell T Davies’s television drama It’s a Sin. “It’s a queer show, filled with queer people, and they bring that lifetime of experience with them,” she adds. Although first staged more than 20 years ago, Hedwig is more relevant than ever according to De Campo and Fletcher. The day before we speak, Florida’s senate passed a bill to ban discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in primary schools. “You just have to look at how quickly that has happened out there, to go: ‘Actually, maybe we’re not as secure as we thought we were,’” says De Campo. “That’s a big part of why it’s really important that we’re doing this show, in this way, at this point in history.” The casting of De Campo as Hedwig comes at a time when drag is more mainstream than ever. While De Campo describes drag’s success as being “cyclical” in nature, pointing to the success of Lily Savage and Dame Edna in the 1990s and early 2000s, she adds: “Drag Race has reignited interest in drag and in seeing it as an art form.” The series, she says, has helped to show how “multifaceted” drag artists are. “I think that’s been really, really interesting that suddenly people are going: ‘Oh, actually, these people are able to do this, and this, and this,’” she says. In the end, this show is about empowering people to be who they are, say Fletcher and De Campo. “As a queer kid, seeing something like this, it would have absolutely been the thing to really help me,” says Fletcher. De Campo adds: “It’s one of those seminal moments, isn’t it? When you are a queer kid or a trans kid, or wherever you fit, when you see yourself reflected by the art that’s either on stage or on the TV or on the radio or in a magazine. Suddenly, you go: ‘Oh, there is a place for me as well.’ I think that’s the kind of message of Hedwig – actually, that there is a place for all of us. And you don’t have to know exactly where that place is right at the beginning.” Hedwig and the Angry Inch is at Leeds Playhouse from 2-23 April.",Arts/Stage,"Divina De Campo: ‘For a queer or trans kid, it’s a seminal moment to see yourself reflected on stage’",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/24/divina-de-campo-for-a-queer-or-trans-kid-its-a-seminal-moment-to-see-yourself-reflected-on-stage
3/24/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, Since late last year, I have been intensely focused on the frantic efforts by both major parties to put themselves in the best position to win US House races this fall. State-by-state, lawmakers are undertaking the once-a-decade task of redrawing all 435 districts in the US House. In most states, legislatures are responsible for drawing the new lines, and to no one’s surprise, both parties have jostled to draw as many districts in their favor as possible. While many, including me, expected Republicans to dominate the process, because they have control of more legislatures, Democrats have been boosted as a result of anti-gerrymandering reforms and an aggressive legal strategy. Reading lots of analysis about what’s happening at the congressional level, I started thinking that there was a much more significant redistricting story that was being largely overlooked. As they’ve been drawing congressional districts, state lawmakers have also been redrawing districts for their state legislatures (yes, they are setting the boundaries for the districts they run in). This lack of attention is significant because state legislatures have become the engines of policymaking in the US. Take a second and think about the most controversial pieces of legislation you’ve heard about recently. Maybe it’s the sweeping new voting restrictions in Georgia. The “don’t say gay” bill in Florida. Anti-abortion bills in Texas and Oklahoma. All of these measures were passed in state legislatures, not Congress. With the federal government bogged down in gridlock, state legislatures, where one party often has control, have become the forums to pass legislation on issues such as school funding and public health that directly affect people’s lives. “The gerrymandering of the state legislative maps, it’s actually more important than even the congressional gerrymandering,” David Pepper, a former chairman of the Ohio Democratic party, told me. “We have this repeat cycle where every few weeks an outrage of some state law that passed somewhere and then we all cover the court case. But very rarely do people go back and look at: ‘What’s the cause of all this craziness in states?’” Republicans currently control 62 legislative chambers, while Democrats control 36. There are 23 states where Republicans have complete control over state government, and 14 where Democrats do. While things are slightly better for Democrats than they were a decade ago, control of state legislatures is unlikely to change over the next decade. Just 17.5% of districts are estimated to be competitive, a slight decrease from a decade ago, according to Chris Warshaw, a political science professor at George Washington University. “Most of the plans are pretty uncompetitive and most are biased in favor of one of the two parties. So I don’t think we’re likely to see many state legislatures flip control over the next decade,” he said. Perhaps no state better embodies the consequences of state legislative gerrymandering than Wisconsin. The Wisconsin state assembly, the legislature’s lower chamber, is widely understood to be one of the most gerrymandered bodies in the US. It’s so distorted that it’s virtually impossible for Republicans to lose a majority in it – even if they got a minority of the vote, they would still be able to hold a majority of the seats. Republicans have used that advantage recently to press a slew of anti-democratic policies, including a partisan review of the 2020 election that made the impossible case for how the lawmakers could “decertify” the results of the 2020 race. Earlier this month, Democrats had hoped they would get a slight boost in the legislative maps. After looking at a range of proposals, the state supreme court picked a new legislative map submitted by Tony Evers, Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, saying it best complied with an earlier court order to make as little change as possible to the current maps. But on Wednesday, the US supreme court stepped in and threw out those maps, taking issue with the creation of additional Black-majority district in the Milwaukee area. It sent the case back to the state court for further consideration. “The will of the people is traditionally the law of the land. That is not the case at this point in time,” Tony Evers, Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, told me last week. Also worth watching… I spoke with Evers about the stakes for his re-election bid and democracy. Listen to Pamela Moses, the Black Memphis woman sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote, speak about her case. This redistricting cycle has blunted the political power of voters of color. Arizona Republicans are advancing a measure that would do away with no-excuse mail-in and early voting, which is widely used in the state. Ohio Republicans remain engaged in a high-stakes standoff with the state supreme court, which has refused to let GOP lawmakers enact gerrymandered electoral districts.",News/US news,US state legislatures threaten citizens’ rights.

3/24/2022,"Usually in the springtime, Millham Lane in the Cornish town of Lostwithiel is flanked by thick, unbroken banks of strongly scented wild garlic. But this year ugly gaps have appeared in the bright green swathe after they were stripped by foragers – apparently professionals – intent on sourcing a fresh, free ingredient for fashionable dishes such as wild garlic pesto. The situation has become so acute that the local councillor has suggested that people take down car registration numbers and contact the police if they spot foragers, and some townsfolk have mooted organising wild garlic patrols. Rachel Fisher, who often walks on the lane, said: “It is awash with wild garlic every year. Local people, myself included, forage a bit but it never looks hacked to bits. When it’s a few local people it’s fine. “I was walking down the lane and saw a young man with a knife and very large bag and he was filling it up with garlic.” She assumed he was a restaurateur and asked him where he was based. “He said up near Bodmin, which is about seven miles away. I asked, wouldn’t it be easier to get your garlic from closer to home? Why are you here? He laughed and said: ‘We’ve destroyed it all.’ I gave him a look and told him: ‘Try not to destroy our garlic.’” Fisher had what she calls a “rant” on a community Facebook page calling for people to “share and share alike”. But she said: “The feed went a little bit bonkers. It touched a nerve. It’s very trendy to have wild garlic pesto and things like that, but foraging on that scale is not right. “There are big holes, gashes in this lane of garlic, which is usually very beautiful. It hasn’t even come into flower yet so it’s not had a chance to reproduce. It’s not coming back this year, who knows if it will next.” The laws around foraging are complex but, in general, it is legal to forage for personal consumption but not for commercial gain. After the post appeared on Facebook, people from Bodmin got in touch to say their garlic – which is good in soups and salads as well as to make pesto – had been vanishing, too. Another Lostwithiel resident, Joannie Muskett, said she had come across two people, one in his 20s, one in his 50s, gathering garlic. “The younger guy had a knife 6-8ins long that he was using and they had two full clear bin bags with the garlic squashed into it. We may need to start patrols to stop them.” Colin Martin, the Cornwall councillor for Lostwithiel, said he was worried that the foragers might be being exploited by the people they were harvesting the garlic for. “They might be making a pittance and not know what they are doing is illegal. They might be the victim of someone pulling the strings. “The feeling here is that if anyone sees it happening they should either consider speaking to the individual or take a vehicle registration number and contact the police.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘It’s trendy’: wild garlic foragers leave bad taste in mouth of Cornish residents,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/24/its-trendy-wild-garlic-foragers-leave-bad-taste-in-mouth-of-cornish-residents
