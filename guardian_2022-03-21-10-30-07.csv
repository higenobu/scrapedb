3/21/2022,"The Melbourne Storm dynasty has been unparalleled in modern Australian sport, particularly those which prioritise competition parity. Success has come and gone for plenty of powerhouses but none have enjoyed the longevity of the Storm, who have been contending for titles for the past 16 years and counting. It will go down as one of the most remarkable periods any club has put together in Australian rugby league, second only to St George of the 1950s and 1960s. The club has survived salary-cap scandals and rule changes designed to eradicate their strengths, ownership changes and player retirements, and it has done so without missing a beat. Premiership windows seemingly open and close for every club in every salary-capped sport – with the exception of the Melbourne Storm and the New England Patriots. Not many would compete for a title straight after the departure of all-time greats such as Cooper Cronk, Billy Slater and Cameron Smith. The Storm reached a decider the year after Cronk left, won the minor premiership the year after Slater retired before winning the title 12 months later, and then went on to break all kinds of records en route to the minor premiership in the season following Smith’s retirement. Premature forecasts of Melbourne’s demise have been commonplace over the last decade and longer. So far all the prognostications have been proven wrong. The Storm have been in the top four every year since 2006 bar two and have won a multitude of premierships and minor premierships. Finally, though, the cracks might finally be appearing. Are we in the last days of Rome? The Storm have certainly shown a capacity to put controversy to the side, but that controversy has rarely involved off-field issues like that of late last year, when Cameron Munster and Brandon Smith were sanctioned for ‘bringing the game into disrepute’. The sanctions came after undated videos emerged on social media appearing to show the players and several other men in a room with what appeared to be a white substance on a table. Storm said at the time that pair had not made any admissions about the substance and could not remember much of the incident. While it was hardly an incident unique to rugby league, this was relatively new terrain for the Storm. Another unwanted issue is the inclusion of the Dolphins in 2023. One of Melbourne’s strengths has been their ability to replenish, allowing very good non-playmakers to walk and getting plenty out of their no-frill replacements. Dale Finucane, Josh Addo-Carr and Nicho Hynes all left in the off-season and Melbourne still started the campaign as the premiership favourites. The Dolphins, however, have highlighted – rightly – the Storm as the template to build off and look to be trying to buy a slice of that famed Storm culture. Felise Kaufusi, Jesse Bromwich and Kenny Bromwich – three starters – have all signed with the Dolphins while the new franchise has gone hard in targeting Storm halves pairing Munster and Jahrome Hughes. With star hooker Brandon Smith confirmed to be heading to the Roosters, the Storm are now at risk of being gutted by a new club with $9m to spend and a desire to prioritise culture. Compounding the uncertainty is the future of Craig Bellamy. As arguably the greatest coach of all time and unquestionably the most important figure at the Storm, he has built the culture. He attracts players. He keeps players. He is the Storm. He has many times said he planned to retire and on every occasion could not pull the trigger. The club have been through this saga before. They hope to be going through it again in 10 years time. Watching him celebrate his 500th game on Friday, a surprising golden-point nail-biter that lacked much of the typical Storm ruthlessness, there seemed to be a genuine possibility that Bellamy will walk away from the top job. Surrounded by family, including his sister who he said had been to only “two or three NRL games”, there seemed to be more than an inkling that Bellamy may be prepared to move on from the rigours of head coaching. Melbourne have won both their games this season – both while missing key personnel – but have hardly looked anything like the Storm of last year. Teams do not peak in the opening two rounds. Harry Grant and Munster missed the opener while Brandon Smith went down in the first minute. Smith, Christian Welch, George Jennings and Tui Kamikamica headed the list of outs this week. Combinations take time, players need experience. There is no reason to be firing on all cylinders. This week, though, they were squaring off against last year’s grand finalists. They had an astonishing record to protect and were celebrating the 500th game of the man that essentially built the club. Melbourne cruised to a 14-0 lead and looked like they could have been up 30 before completely switching off. Most concerning were the small things. Justin Olam failing to ground a ball he really should have. They missed 39 tackles. Made 18 errors. The Storm, of course, won on the back of a Ryan Papenhuyzen field goal. They are unbeaten. The empire is not crumbling yet but signs over the past six months have not been good for Melbourne, and their on-field play will hardly ease those concerns.",Sport/Sport,"Melbourne are the great NRL dynasty, but are these the last days of Rome? | Nick Tedeschi",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/melbourne-storm-are-the-great-nrl-dynasty-but-are-these-the-last-days-of-rome
3/21/2022,"Ukraine has rejected a Russian demand for Mariupol to surrender by 5am Moscow time (2am GMT / 10pm ET) on Monday. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there could be “no talk of any surrenders” and that Russia had been informed of the response. Russian Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev has earlier on Sunday told the defenders of the city in a briefing to “Lay down your arms”. He added that if they surrendered, humanitarian corridors would then be opened in both the eastern and western directions from Mariupol from 10am Moscow time on Monday. Mariupol’s city council said Russia bombed an art school where 400 civilians including children were sheltering. Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the city’s mayor, said there was no exact number of casualties. “The city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,” Andrushenko said on Telegram. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called Vladimir Putin’s strategy a “final solution” for Ukraine in an uncompromising address to the Israeli parliament. Using the link to Nazi genocide of the Jews, Ukraine’s president challenged Israel over its failure to impose sanctions on Russia. He warned that indifference cost lives and that there could be no mediating between good and evi. Ukraine’s human rights spokesperson, Lyudmyla Denisova, said Russian troops had “kidnapped” residents and taken them to Russia. “Several thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,” she said on Telegram. After processing at “filtration camps”, some had been transported to the Russian city of Taganrog, about 60 miles (100km) from Mariupol, and from there sent by rail “to various economically depressed cities in Russia”, she said. Ten million people – more than a quarter of the population – have now fled their homes in Ukraine due to Russia’s “devastating” war, the head of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said on Sunday. And at least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 injured in Ukraine as of midnight local time on Saturday, the UN human rights office said. The Ukrainian parliament says 115 Ukrainian children have been killed and at least 140 more have been injured. One person has been killed following shelling of homes and a shopping district in Kyiv, according to the city’s mayor. “According to the information we have at the moment, several homes and one of the shopping centres [were hit],” Vitali Klitschko said in a Telegram post. China’s ambassador to the US has said his country is not sending weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. He said China was sending food, sleeping bags and other aid, “not weapons and ammunition to any party”. But pressed on US television on Sunday, he did not definitively rule out the possibility Beijing might do so in the future. Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy. It could take several years for the deal to come into full effect because Germany has no terminals for selivery of LNG. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia said it was increasing oil production to meet global demand. David Beckham has handed over control of his Instagram account to a Ukrainian doctor working in Kharkiv. Throughout Sunday, the former footballer’s Instagram Stories were inundated with videos and photographs following Iryna, a child anaesthesiologist, as she worked in the midst of the conflict. Pope Francis has described what is happening in Ukraine as “inhumane and sacrilegious”. Addressing tens of thousands of people in St Peter’s Square in Rome for his weekly Sunday address and blessing, he called on leaders to stop “this repugnant war”. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has claimed a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is “close”, despite the scepticism of western governments. But the US ambassador to the United Nations warned on Sunday there was little immediate hope of a negotiated end to the war as US president Joe Biden prepares for a crunch Nato summit this week. Eleven Ukrainian political parties have been suspended because of their links with Russia, according to Zelenskiy. The country’s national security and defence council took the decision to ban the parties from any political activity. Most of the parties affected were small, but one of them, the Opposition Platform for Life, has 44 seats in the 450-seat Ukrainian parliament.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 26 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-26-of-the-invasion
