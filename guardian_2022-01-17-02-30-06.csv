1/17/2022,"At least it was quick. The final ignominy over in less than two hours, from Rory Burns to Ollie Robinson with barely time for a scratch and a sniff: 10 wickets for 56 runs in 22 overs. Out of a paper bag into the ashes.  It was Mark Wood’s face that said it all. He’d just produced the best bowling of his Test career, six for 37, a high-class bounce-fest to haul England back into the match by their gammy toe-nails, short-pitched menace with a smile, hurling that woodchip body into the unwilling Tasmanian ground. Reward at last for seven weeks of whole-hearted toil. Yet there he was, less than four hours later, plodding off the Bellerive Oval, the ninth wicket to fall in an innings of sorrows, dragging on after slapping Pat Cummins for a couple of fours over extra-cover – just for the lols. Helmet off, mouth set, eyes empty, head down, homeward he trod. This tour has sapped even Wood’s joie de vivre – an achievement, of sorts. England have for some time been collapse specialists – pack detonator, will travel – but even by their standards this was a spectacular explosion of fortune. With just an over to go before tea, Zac Crawley and Rory Burns had put together 68, England’s first opening stand of more than 50 in the entire series. There had been a few lucky breaks, a review survived here and there, but Crawley was creaming the ball with a golden spoon and Burns wore an air of busy purpose alongside his indie-band hair. WinViz was absurdly confident, like the cocky young pup it is. Next-in Dawid Malan was spotted on the balcony wearing a cap with an almost jaunty air. Deep in the dressing room, perhaps Chris Silverwood was searching the internet for the ingredients needed for a sundowner. Wouldn’t it, you found yourself thinking to yourself, against all odds and the evidence of the last four Tests, be something for Joe Root to win the game and salvage something from the series with that longed-for Australian Ashes hundred? Fool! From his two-metre vantage point, Cameron Green – Australia’s brightest of bright young things – produced a telling ball from around the wicket and Burns, conflicted, contrived to play on. His bemused shrug was a catalyst for the carnage to come. After the break Malan was cracked on the helmet, before he too knocked Green on to his own stumps, also leaving with a shuffledown of despair. His tour has slipped from promise to purgatory, and was thrown into perspective overnight by the news that his wife had given birth to their baby six weeks early. Root ran out to bat, legs somehow kicking onwards, one last push, one last weary hurrah. He soon lost Crawley, tempted into another drive by the magnificent Green and snaffled behind the stumps. Ben Stokes holed out before Root himself was done by a dirty grubber from Scott Boland that spat through under the bat. He permitted himself a deep breath, and a wry smile. It was over. A drawn man now, with watery blue eyes, carrying every one of England’s mistakes strapped to his own back, he could at least retreat in the knowledge that he’d got a screamer. And then Cummins and Boland finished things off, the final five wickets disappearing for 23 runs. The Australians didn’t even have to claim the final half hour. Sam Billings pushed with hard hands to mid-on; Ollie Pope pottered into the wasteland on the off side, with thoughts of who-knows-what, but was left staring down at his dismantled stumps as if they were the remains of yesterday’s dinner. The padded-up bowlers looked as if they’d had enough. They went out swinging, with anger, frustration, disappointment – probably all three. After Cummins bowled the retreating Robinson with a full toss, the debonair new baggy green captain with the perfect teeth and the Midas touch, smiled. He exchanged a big bowlers’ handshake with Mitchell Starc: the series’ two leading wicket takers content with their work. And England? Many threads make up a story, but, yikes, the stats: England put together only eight partnerships of over 50. And their batting average in this series is 20.21, the lowest in an Ashes series since 1890. And then the faces. At the presentation, there was not a smile to be seen from the batsmen, who’d had time to change into their leisurewear, or the bowlers, who had not. Root seemed on the edge of tears as Adam Gilchrist threw down the gentlest of questions – you know you’re in trouble when even the Australians feel sorry for you. It’s hard to summon up triumphalism when the opposition fold so quickly. And like a breath of wind on a house of cards, England were gone.",Sport/Sport,England are collapse specialists but Hobart ignominy sets new low | Tanya Aldred,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/16/england-are-collapse-specialists-but-hobart-ignominy-sets-new-low
1/17/2022,"With typical bravado, GlaxoSmithKline has, we learned on Saturday, dismissed three takeover bids from Unilever for its consumer healthcare venture with Pfizer, including one worth £50bn received just before Christmas. The drugmaker, run by Dame Emma Walmsley, has decided to push on with plan A, namely the demerger and stock market flotation this summer of the consumer health business, known for brands such as Aquafresh and Sensodyne toothpaste, along with Panadol and Voltaren for pain relief.  GSK’s confidence that the bids from consumer goods company Unilever, which makes Dove soap and Sunsilk shampoo, “fundamentally undervalued” the venture and its future prospects is based on three pillars. First, the drugmaker has released new forecasts showing it is now projecting annual sales growth of 4%-6% for the consumer venture, which made sales of £9.6bn last year – higher than the 3%-3.5% analysts have factored in, it says. It believes Unilever’s offer, which is made up of £41.7bn in cash and £8.3bn in Unilever shares, fails to capture this sales potential. It will explain the potential for the consumer brands more fully at an investor day on 28 February, with fourth-quarter results on 9 February also providing an opportunity to justify the strategy. Second, GSK reckons the Unilever offer does not fully take into account the synergies the deal would create. And third, it argues that any takeover bid needs to come with a higher premium. Many analysts have estimated the value of consumer healthcare at £45bn, with some estimates as high as £48bn. The New York hedge fund Elliott Management, the activist shareholder that has been pushing for a sale of the consumer health business and a change of leadership, declined to comment, but the much smaller London-based investor Bluebell Capital Partners, which has echoed Elliott’s demands, said Unilever’s bid was “proof that such a high-quality business has the potential to attract interest by strategic and financial buyers”. GSK has argued that there is no need to hold a formal auction as it has been clear since 2018, when plans for a split were announced, that consumer healthcare was up for grabs. It would be one of the largest ever deals in London. There are a small number of potential acquirers – only the likes of Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble and Nestlé would be big enough to stomach such a purchase. Private equity groups are thought to have looked at it too, but it would require a large consortium to pull off a bid. The consumer business’s chairman-designate is the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis, who is also a Unilever veteran and has worked with Unilever’s chief executive, Alan Jope, in the past. Unilever, for its part, is coming under pressure from previously loyal shareholders as it has missed sales and profit margin targets, and its shares have lagged behind those of its global peers. Terry Smith, founder of the investment manager Fundsmithand a top-10 Unilever shareholder, last week used his annual letter to investors to hit out at Unilever management, saying they had “lost the plot”. Russ Mould, investment research director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Jope seems to think he needs to do something and while he may have felt he was pushing on an open door, given GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer’s spin-off plan, they perhaps believe his need to act is greater than theirs. It’s an interesting dynamic.” In a brief statement on Saturday, Unilever said the consumer business would be “a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio”. Its statement did not suggest that it was abandoning its pursuit. “The statements suggest price is the issue, not the lack of desire to sell or lack of desire to buy. A further attempt at a higher price is therefore possible,” said Mould.",News/Business,GSK banks on stronger offer for its consumer healthcare business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/gsk-consumer-healthcare-business-unilever-analysis
1/17/2022,"Nadine Dorries’ announcement of major changes to the BBC’s funding model is just the latest attack on the broadcaster by Conservative ministers over the past 12 years. There have been repeated attempts to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, enormous real-terms funding cuts and the decision to make the BBC take the blame for abolishing free licences for over-75s. In the short term, the more damaging news for the BBC is the government’s intention to freeze the cost of the licence fee for two years. This dooms the broadcaster to another round of deep cuts to its output that will weaken its offering to the UK and the world.  In the long term, the bigger issue is the government wants to abolish the BBC’s existing funding model when the broadcaster’s royal charter expires in 2027. Households with a television used to receive live broadcasts (or watch iPlayer) are charged £159 for a licence, raising £3.2bn a year for the BBC and and the Welsh channel S4C. Yet there are hundreds of thousands of prosecutions a year for non-payment of the licence fee – disproportionately affecting women who are at home when inspectors call. Also the number of households that pay the fee is declining. Yet with countries around the world phasing out their television licence fees, the writing has been on the wall for the British version for some time – even if the exact timing and format of its replacement is unclear. Here are some of the alternative funding models: The existing television licence is levied on the device traditionally used to receive most BBC content. A more modern equivalent would be a levy on every broadband connection in the UK used to fund public service media. This could be relatively easy to enforce, with the money collecting through existing broadband providers and has the benefit of being a near-universal. But adding £13 a month to the cost of a broadband connection could make internet access prohibitively expensive for some households. Rather than have an entire bureaucracy dedicated to collecting the licence fee, why not simply have the government fund the BBC directly? This model has been used to fund Australia’s ABC for most of its existence, although it also leaves the broadcast at the mercy of the government of the day. There would also be questions about how to enshrine the BBC’s editorial independence if the broadcaster’s funding was decided alongside other spending commitments in the chancellor’s budget. The BBC already takes advertising on its services outside the UK, so why not in Britain? Other national broadcasters around the world carry adverts, as do British public service broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 4. Yet it is unlikely advertising revenue would be enough to sustain the BBC’s current range of services and it would inevitably lead to a focus on programmes that bring in viewers as well as the curtailment of some bits of output that are highly valued by niche audiences. This model has gained popularity in Scandinavian countries that have abolished their licence fees. Sweden chose this approach in 2019, abolishing the 2,400 krona (£194) licence fee and replacing it with a tax on all working adults, charged at 1% of income up to a maximum of 1,300 krona a person. This money is then paid into a dedicated funding pot for public service media, which helps reduce the risk of government interference. A British equivalent would mean a new tax appearing on payslips next to income tax and national insurance contributions – something that could be politically challenging. This is the rallying cry of many Conservative MPs who see the enormous popularity of Netflix and wonder why the BBC could not adopt the same model. The biggest challenge is technical. While Netflix offers a single product – an app and website that are easily password-protected – the vast majority of BBC content is still consumed through free-to-air television and radio broadcasts that are impossible to put behind a paywall. A subscription model would inevitably kill the universal free-to-access BBC as we know it. Privatise BBC iPlayer, stick it behind a paywall and charge a subscription fee for high-end dramas and David Attenborough programmes. Sell off the corporation’s radio stations and allow them to chase audiences to please advertisers. And then provide a much-reduced package of central government funding to cover the BBC’s unprofitable news output on a free-to-air basis. With news increasingly distributed through Facebook-owned social media platforms, Piers Morgan about to launch television channel talkTV on behalf of Rupert Murdoch and the growing popularity of private sector radio stations such as LBC, do we really need the BBC? The government could simply follow the US model, let the free market take control and allow private companies to shape the nation’s media consumption.",News/Media,What could replace the BBC licence fee?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/what-could-replace-the-bbc-licence-fee
1/17/2022,"Boris Johnson broke the law and lied about it, Keir Starmer said on Sunday. In an interview for the BBC’s Sunday Morning show, the Labour leader said it was not necessary to wait for the “partygate” report to learn whether Johnson broke the rules because it was already obvious that he did.  Starmer also restated his call for Johnson to resign, saying he had “degraded the office of prime minister”. Starmer told the BBC: “I think [Johnson] broke the law. I think he’s as good as admitted that he broke the law. And, after all, Downing Street has now apologised to the Queen for some of the parties that have gone on.” Starmer seemed to be referring to Johnson’s statement to MPs last week in which he all but admitted that the 20 May party he attended was against the rules. He said he thought at the time it was a work event, but now realised he should have stopped it. Arguing that “the facts speak for themselves”, Starmer said that as well as breaking the law Johnson “then lied about what happened and this compounds the situation”. To justify this claim, Starmer said Johnson originally told MPs he had been assured no parties took place at No 10. Then, after the private video of staff discussing a Christmas party in 2020 was broadcast, the PM told MPs he was angry to learn about this. Then he admitted he had been at the 20 May event, and he told MPs last week that in retrospect he realised he should have stopped the gathering that evening. Starmer said that showed his initial claim to have no knowledge of partying was false. Many Tory MPs have said they want to reserve judgment about whether Johnson should be allowed to stay in office until the publication of the report by Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating the scandal, is published. It is due within a fortnight. But Starmer said there was no need to wait because it was “blindingly obvious” what had happened. There had been “industrial-scale partying” at No 10, he said. In his column in the Sunday Times, Dominic Lawson claimed that Johnson was clearly warned in advance, twice, that the 20 May event was party taking place against the rules. “Last week I spoke to a former Downing Street official who said at least two people had told the PM, after seeing the emailed invitation from his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, that this was ‘a party’ and should be immediately cancelled,” wrote Lawson, a former editor of the Spectator and the Sunday Telegraph. “I was told that Johnson’s dismissive response was to say they were ‘overreacting’ and to praise Reynolds as ‘my loyal Labrador’.” Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, said this showed that Johnson was lying when he told MPs last week that when he attended the 20 May gathering, he thought it was a work event. But Downing Street said: “It is untrue that the prime minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.” Starmer has said a photograph of him drinking with a number of party staff in a constituency office last year was “no breach of the rules” and there was “no comparison” with the prime minister. Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, Sir Keir was asked about the picture published in the Daily Mail, which first emerged in spring last year. The image, which was taken several days before the Hartlepool byelection, was captured through the window of a building in Durham and shows Sir Keir drinking a bottle of beer and standing close to two people while another pair can be seen in the background. The country was at that time in step two of the road map out of the third lockdown, and indoor mixing between different households was not allowed except for work. Sir Keir said: “I was in a constituency office just days before the election. We were very busy. We were working in the office. “We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the prime minister.” He added: “It was perfectly lawful to meet for work, which is what we were doing. The party that was put to the prime minister on Wednesday happened because an invitation was sent to 100 people saying: ‘Let’s have some socially distant drinks in the garden and bring your own booze.’ There is simply no comparison.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson broke the law and lied, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/boris-johnson-has-broken-law-and-lied-says-keir-starmer
1/17/2022,"Paul Myners, Lord Myners, who has died aged 73, was fond of declaring: “I have worked in the city but never been of the City.” It was that apparent detachment that caused Myners, a successful financier who built a multibillion-pound pensions business and chaired a slew of companies, including Marks and Spencer and the Guardian Media Group, to become the go-to man for sorting out financial crises. He helped to address the scandal at the Co-op bank, Premiership Rugby’s salary cap controversy, and problems at Nissan after Carlos Ghosn, but he was most famously brought in as financial services secretary to the Treasury by Gordon Brown to help address the 2008 banking crisis. The tough conditions he imposed for rescuing the banks were generally regarded as successful although one insider described them as “less a negotiation, more a drive-by shooting”.  However his perceived failure to demand a cut in the pension entitlement of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s Fred Goodwin was attacked as evidence of double standards and targeted at an appearance before a Commons select committee. Myners’ profile as a liberal outsider in the City was enhanced by his advocacy of social change. This included chairing the Low Pay Commission from 2006 until 2008 and his presidency of the Howard League for Penal Reform. He was scathing about prison conditions and would take guests to lunch in prisons to make his point. Myners was adopted as a young child from an orphanage in Bath, by a Cornish couple, Thomas and Caroline Myners. While he bonded with his mother, a hairdresser, from whom he absorbed his liberal outlook, he felt he was never accepted by his father, who worked as a butcher and fisherman. He did not want to find his biological parents but said that the sense of rejection he felt and his father’s lack of interest “led to me being more driven and perhaps not good at handling rejection”. He was known as a tough businessman, with a short fuse, which could lead to trouble in board meetings. He went to Truro school with a scholarship but at 15 there was a family confrontation when his father wanted him apprenticed at Falmouth dockyard. Instead Paul followed a friend into teacher training at the Institute of Education in London. After two years on staff at a girls’ school in Wandsworth, in 1972 he decided teaching was not for him. Instead he wrote 20 letters to City institutions asking for a job, delivering them on his bicycle because of a postal strike. A whiff of the prevailing attitude, which he would spend a lifetime opposing, came from Hill Samuel’s reply stating that they only employed people already known to the directors. Myners accepted the only offer, from the stockjobber Wedd Durlacher. There he came to the notice of the editor of the Daily Telegraph’s stock-tipping Questor column, who proposed him as his successor two years later. In 1974 he joined Rothschild’s as a junior portfolio manager. He was posted to Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, where at 27 he was managing an office of 40 people and was appointed to the main board. But returning to Rothschild’s London headquarters, he missed management and in 1985 chose to become chief executive of a small pension fund manager, the Gartmore Group, where he swiftly became chair and made his name. In his 16 years the company was bought and sold five times and funds managed rose from £1.2bn to £75bn. He was estimated to have earned £30m. He left in 2001 to focus on a series of positions in major companies, including the chairmanship of Land Securities (2006-08) and the Guardian Media Group (2000-08). He was a surprise but effective choice at the Guardian where he set in train the sale of its highly profitable motor trade publications and declining regional newspapers to build up a specific endowment fund to support the Guardian and Observer. The decision was vindicated by the progressive collapse of remunerative classified advertising in the face of the internet. Looking back Myners said: “I thought the key thing was to build up an endowment. It meant we could lose about £30m a year and still maintain the papers.” Alan Rusbridger, editor from 1995 until 2015, said that “the Guardian was very fortunate to have Paul as its chair as it negotiated the digital revolution, which was a traumatic period of transition for virtually all news organisations. He steered the company with astute judgement and an understanding of what the Guardian should be. He was a reliable friend to both commercial and editorial sides of the operation. We were lucky to have him.” In 2004 he became interim chair of an embattled Marks and Spencer, just two days after Philip Green had made a bid for the company. The board resisted and Myners chaired the famous meeting at which shareholders voted to reject Green’s offer. Myners was known as one of the busiest men in the City, and it was joked that he worked out of his car. He conceded: “I do like a challenge. It energises.” High level appointments included the Court of the Bank of England, the Financial Reporting Council, and the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. He chaired the Tate Gallery and was chancellor of the University of Exeter. But his chairmanship of the London School of Economics council was cut short after a boardroom row. His trenchant views on the financial industry were sought-after and he advised a string of finance companies. His report on institutional investment for Brown in 2001 set out the Myners’ principles of best practice for pension companies although critics complained that they had not always been observed by Gartmore. He attacked “ownerless corporations”, arguing that companies had such diversified shareholders that no one behaved like an owner. In later life he criticised activist investing by funds, arguing that passive investing produced comparable results, and revealing that he had transferred much of his wealth to them. Active in the Lords from 2008, he was a passionate remainer and scathing about the Conservative leadership. Later, in 2014, he transferred from the Labour benches to the crossbenches. Myners was married twice: first, from 1972 to 1993 , to Tessa Stanford-Smith, a teacher, with whom he had three daughters; and second, from 1995 to 2020, to Alison Macleod, former chair of the Contemporary Art Society, with whom he had a daughter and a son. Both marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his children and five grandchildren.

1/17/2022,"Serbia’s president has said Novak Djokovic had been “harassed … but not humiliated” and the prime minister called his treatment “scandalous” as the world tennis No 1’s home country reacted furiously to his deportation from Australia. After an 11-day saga, three judges unanimously upheld a decision by the immigration minister to cancel Djokovic’s visa because he was not vaccinated against Covid-19, removing any chance of him winning a 21st grand slam at the Australian Open.  “I think the court decision is scandalous … I find it unbelievable that we have two completely contradictory court decisions within the span of just a few days,” the Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabić, told reporters in Belgrade. “I am disappointed … I think it demonstrated how the rule of law is functioning – or better to say not functioning – in some other countries. In any case, I can hardly wait to see Novak Djokovic in our own country, in Serbia.” Djokovic, who was photographed wearing a mask in a Melbourne airport lounge with two government officials in black uniforms, left on an Emirates flight to Dubai after releasing a statement saying he was disappointed but accepted the decision. The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, called the court ruling “a farce”. He said he had spoken to the player and had told him he should “return to his country, come home to Serbia, to where he will always be welcome”. Vučić said Australian authorities may “think they humiliated Djokovic, the best player in the world, with this 10-day harassment, [but] they humiliated themselves. He can return to his country with his head held high and look everyone in the eye.” If it was “up to principle, they should have said unvaccinated players cannot enter – but they did not say that,” Vučić said. “They gave him an exemption. Why did it take them so long, why did they treat him like that, why create this kind of theatre?” He said he was sure Djokovic “would have been treated differently if he hadn’t come from Serbia … If he was from another country, the approach would be completely different. Of course people here are frustrated, 90% are on Novak’s side.” The player’s father, Srđan, said the episode amounted to “an attempted assassination with 50 bullets to the chest”, while the sports minister, Vanja Udovičić, described it as “nonsense and shame, absurdity and hypocrisy”. The Serbian tennis association said the “farce was over” and expressed its “huge disappointment”, describing the decision to deport Djokovic, who has won nine Australian Open titles, as political. “Political pressure has led to the revocation of his visa to satisfy public interest,” it said. “It begs the question whether athletes will from now on be incarcerated like criminals and deported when it suits the political interests of powerful individuals.” Boško Obradović, the leader of the far-right opposition party Dveri (the Doors), said Belgrade should introduce countermeasures and “chase the Australian ambassador” out of the country. On the streets of the player’s home town, Belgrade, many people agreed. Milan Nikolić said the dispute “could have been sorted out differently. It is not like the Australian government did not know who Djokovic is, what the procedures are.” Marko Djurickovic, who said people should be able to decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated, thought the decision was “clearly political”. The world No 1’s choice not to get vaccinated would not influence vaccine take-up in Serbia, he added. “He is a public figure but he is not the government,” he said. “I blame them. They did not explain properly the necessity of a jab and frankly, no one trusts them; when they tell you to do something, it is part of civil disobedience to do the opposite.” Divna Vukadin said the Australian move was clearly politically motivated. “Why did they call him, then revoke the visa? He produced all the right papers. So why now? This is really unfair. I would expect more from a country claiming to respect the rule of law.” Both Vučić and Brnabić said Serbia had administered two doses to 58% of its population, not less than 50% as Australian authorities said. Data shows Serbia has double-jabbed 47% of its whole population, well below the EU27 average of 70.25%, although the percentage of the adult population is higher.

A man in his 40s was being held on suspicion of manslaughter on Sunday after the accident in the resort of Flaine, Haute-Savoie, at about 11am on Saturday, Le Dauphine reported. The girl was said to have been taking part in a group ski lesson run by ESF (Ecole du Ski Français) with four other children on a blue (intermediate) piste.  The public prosecutor for Bonneville told France Bleu: “The child was in single file behind the group and was about to make a right turn when she was very violently hit by the skier arriving at high speed who tried in vain to avoid her.” The accident was said to have taken place at the edge of the piste during clear weather. The girl’s family live in Geneva but have a second home in Les Carroz, which is one of five linked resorts in the Grand Massif area in the French Alps. She died as she was being airlifted to hospital by helicopter. The skier who collided with her, reportedly a volunteer firefighter, was said to be “devastated” and in shock. A postmortem will be carried out on the girl. The manslaughter investigation, which will be conducted by Bonneville police, will look at whether the man in custody was skiing too quickly and paying due attention to safety. Jean-Paul Constant, the mayor of local municipality Arâches, said: “Everyone was very shocked.” He said staff at the resort would be provided with counselling and he was also looking for a psychologist who speaks English to assist the girl’s family, who have returned to Geneva.

I am hoping that Sue Gray’s inquiry will be sufficiently damning to finally topple this prime minister, because even if he was not in attendance at these parties, they were carried out on his watch. Surely now Conservative ministers and MPs will not allow this to just move on, even after hearing grovelling apologies.

What is gut-wrenching is that it has taken so long for the Tories to realise the dead weight they have been promoting to the highest office. As a socialist, of course I had concerns about the Camerons and Mays of this world, but everything was up for discussion/debate, at the very least, when they were in power.  Thatcher might have been a poisonous bulldozer in a china shop bent on destroying what so many hold dear, but at least you knew what you were dealing with. It gave us a fighting edge. For Johnson, at last, it seems his former supporters are seeing the writing on the wall. And perhaps they are realising how many of us have been traumatised beyond belief by the No 10 culture that saw all of us following Covid rules to keep each other safe while they flouted them with total disdain. The message that No 10 believed in protection and isolation rather than the devastation of herd immunity can no longer be upheld.Cathy ElderCardiff  With daily calls for Johnson to resign, I am looking forward to the day when we can refer to him as “the disgraced former prime minister”, a title which could not be better deserved. But surely culpability for getting us into this internationally embarrassing position also lies squarely with the parliamentary Tory party, whose members knew – probably better than most – the flaws in this man, yet for short-term electoral advantage were prepared to foist him on the British people.

As a gay, civilly partnered cleric, I would also like to thank you for drawing attention to the fact that I am prohibited by law from marrying my partner of 22 years – even in a civil ceremony – if I wish to continue ministering in the church I love, and had to give assurances that our relationship was wholly celibate before I was first ordained, three short years ago. Most people I have spoken to about this had no idea that anyone could be subject to such arcane rules in this day and age which, as you point out, provides ample grist to those with a prurient or malevolent interest in the lives of others to intimidate or threaten those placed in this unacceptable and extremely vulnerable position. The current practice of the church could not be further removed from the glorious liberty of the Christian gospel, which is that God is love, and those who love live in God.  May I commend Equal: The Campaign for Equal Marriage in the Church of England to your readers, and any who share such values and yearn for the church to remove this great injustice against the LGBTQI+ community, uniquely now within this island in England. No matter the outcome of the Living in Love and Faith process this year, we will not rest until there is full and total equality for all in the provision of the church’s sacramental ministry, which is God’s gift to all and should be extended to any couples wishing to solemnise their relationship in the sight of God and God’s church.Rev Dr Stephen J O’ConnorDeal, Kent  Current confusions and conflicts over the “real” meanings of, and differences between, words such as sex, gender, male and female, make debates about so-called same-sex marriage ever more problematic. Perhaps the simplest solution would be for the Church of England to adopt a definition of marriage as a union between two persons, regardless of any other supposedly innate – or unchanging – characteristics.Fr Alec MitchellHolyhead, Anglesey  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The intensive care consultant couldn’t have been clearer that, in her opinion, if he had been vaccinated he would not have developed Covid pneumonia to the severity that he did. He died very frightened and asking his family to come and be with him, and we couldn’t. The experience traumatised my sister so badly that she was hospitalised with psychosis three days after his passing. The reason he wasn’t vaccinated is because his mind was poisoned with conspiracy theories and misinformation exacerbated by two years of lockdown and reduced social contact. While I am angry that he would not get vaccinated, I don’t think any good would ever come from criminalising his choice.  Is it not anti-vaxxers who should be demonised and prosecuted.

1/17/2022,"Security costs are a controversial issue for the royal family, with neither Buckingham Palace nor the government willing to discuss arrangements publicly. As security is paid for from the public purse, the issue is often weaponised by critics who argue police protection should not automatically be conferred on non-working royals and extended family members.  There are calls for the Duke of York to pay for his own security after being stripped of his royal patronages and the use of the HRH style in any official capacity in the fallout from the US civil sex assault lawsuit he faces. In this case, Prince Harry has offered to personally pay for Scotland Yard protection for him and his family while they are in the UK. A Home Office decision prevents him from doing this. His concerns are that his private security team does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information required to keep him and his family safe. He also warns of damage to the UK’s reputation should a member of the royal family be harmed on its soil. Security provision for the Sussexes was one of the key issues when they announced they were stepping down as working royals. Their website at the time suggested they believed the Home Office, through the Metropolitan police, should continue to provide protection for the family. Speaking to the chatshow host Oprah Winfrey in 2021, Harry said he was told that “due to our change of status – we would no longer be ‘official’ members of the royal family”. He said he had been shocked by this and “pushed back” on the issue, arguing that there had been no change of threat or risk to the couple. Meghan, during the same interview, told how she had written to her husband’s family urging them not to pull his security, but had been told “it’s just not possible”. They disclosed they had put in place “privately funded security” for their move to the US after then president Donald Trump said America would not meet the bills for the couple’s protection. Harry later told Winfrey they were paying for private security through deals they secured with Netflix and Spotify. Harry has said he “inherited” a risk on being born into the royal family. His legal team said that risk was “for life”. In a statement, the prince’s legal representative said: “He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.” A judicial review is a court proceedings that challenges the lawfulness of a decision by a public body. Judicial review claims must pass a “threshold test” before they can proceed. Harry has filed his claims, and the Home Office must file an “acknowledgment of service” and their grounds for resisting the application. The high court will now consider whether there is an arguable case for judicial review. Where permission is granted, the claim proceeds to a substantive hearing.",News/UK news,Why Harry is taking UK government to court over protection costs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/16/why-harry-is-taking-uk-government-to-court-over-protection-costs
1/17/2022,"Maggie Brown’s obituary of Anthony Smith refers to his brilliance as a fundraiser. As deputy curator of the British Film Institute’s National Film Archive under Tony’s directorship in the 1980s, I witnessed at first-hand his determined, but respectful, wooing of the cinephile J Paul Getty Jr on behalf of the BFI. The results of this included the construction of the archive’s JPGJ Conservation Centre in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the refurbishment of the National Film theatre and the purchase of a new BFI HQ. He also recognised the value of cultural celebrity, and oversaw the creation of the BFI fellowships, the first of which were awarded to Orson Welles, David Lean, Marcel Carné, Satyajit Ray, and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger as part of its golden jubilee celebrations in 1983.  Tony was shrewd, pragmatic and fun to work with. He never pretended to be busy when he wasn’t and would readily ring down to one of us and suggest lunch because he didn’t “have anything else to do that day” – a disarming way of indicating that he had had a successful morning.",Arts/Film,Letter: Anthony Smith obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/16/letter-anthony-smith-obituary
1/17/2022,"Imagine if three witches in a forest glade had offered England this deal on a dark November night. Steve Smith, scorer of 11 Ashes hundreds in 20 outings, with an average of over 100 in his previous two Ashes series, would not add to those centuries and would average 30. David Warner, with an Ashes average in Australia of 60, would not make a hundred and would average 34. Marnus Labuschagne, on a streak of 13 Tests averaging 73, would make one small and lucky hundred and average 42. Fast-bowling leader Josh Hazlewood would miss four Tests, Pat Cummins would miss one, and Australia would call on three replacement quicks with two Tests between them. The thing about witches in a forest glade, as Macbeth could attest, is that beneath the promises lies a catch. Not that England took many of those, but still. Despite all of the above going the touring team’s way, they experienced a series thrashing with few statistical peers. Those top-line players were the focus of supposed years of planning, yet it was Australia’s second rank that dominated whenever called upon.  Travis Head, player of the series for bookending it with two fast centuries at crucial times. Usman Khawaja, his Covid replacement in Sydney, making twin hundreds in the match to join a storied club. Marcus Harris with the decisive hand in Melbourne. Just like previous tours, when the likes of Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh and Brad Haddin reached an ascendancy with the bat that their broader careers would not have suggested possible. With the ball, there was Scott Boland with the frankly 1800s numbers of 18 wickets at 9.55. Jhye Richardson played once for a match-winning five for 42 – and as a bonus, has the highest batting strike rate ever in an Ashes series for his 17 from seven balls. Mitchell Starc’s history suggested that he would flag but he finished with 19 wickets at 24.35. Michael Neser, with one Test, was the only one of Australia’s nine bowlers to finish with an average higher than Starc. James Anderson was the only one of England nine bowlers to finish with an average lower than Starc. This pattern of the supporting cast taking the spotlight was demonstrated no more dramatically than by Cameron Green on the final night of the series. He had already made scores of 74 and 23, striking the ball crisply to form partnerships of 121 with Head in the first innings and 49 with Alex Carey in the third. The only dual contributor with the bat, he was the main reason Australia had a lead of 270 going into the fourth. Then he showed up with the ball. With England batting under darkening skies, descending into evening with floodlights glaring and the pink Kookaburra showing life, you can guess who would be perceived as the main threats. Starc, the day-night king, with 55 wickets in the format. And Cummins, with his diabolical seam movement, third on that list with 30. Zak Crawley and Rory Burns scored quickly against both of them, first with edges, then with increasing fluency. On-drives, square flicks, proper stuff. Nathan Lyon, with 34 pink-ball wickets? He wasn’t called upon. Boland, with his knack for carnage? Leg-glanced repeatedly. England tallied the best opening stand in the series for either side with 68. Then came Green. Where other bowlers had been survived, the big names seen off, the new arrival brought pace, extreme bounce, and an around-the-wicket line to the left-handers. Burns needed a long DRS review to survive a possible outside edge in Green’s first over. He didn’t survive the inside edge on to his stumps, the ball leaping at his attempted leave. Dawid Malan was bounced and hit on the helmet before being bowled in the same way, left with nowhere to go. It was a different piece of work to Crawley, a right-hander who likes driving. Green came over the wicket, accepted one lovely boundary as the cost of doing business, then pitched up again with enough outswing to take the outside edge. That meant a burst of three for 17 within five overs, the first three wickets to fall, the two set players gone, and England’s innings soon to fall into disarray. That same old story, from useful contributor to match-defining threat. Green finished the series with 13 wickets at 15.76, of which only two were tailenders, and of which nine were well-set players on scores of 25 or more. Nothing was more impressive than his final burst, knocking the top off an innings when others could not. Green, Head, Boland: these were not the players who England had planned for, but they had plans of their own.

1/17/2022,"In its inaugural 2017 season, the AFLW burst onto the national sporting stage on a warm Friday night in early February. In its sixth chapter it is squarely a summer offering from the AFL, an eventuality which has gathered mixed responses and equally varied outcomes. From a player perspective, it is hard to know when the best time of year for the season would be. For such a physically taxing game, the hot weather alone is enough reason to question the December-March window. When the AFL explored India as a potential international venue for AFLM matches, one of the considerations was whether they could convince teams that the hot Indian weather was suitable for the game. Yet a similarly sweltering Australian summer is considered appropriate for AFLW players who, due to the part-time nature of their contracts, have far less time dedicated to conditioning, fitness and pre-season than their male counterparts.  This year’s season start was delayed due to Covid-19. Its initial schedule, commencing at the beginning of December 2021, would have allowed the players a mid-season break over Christmas and the new year before returning in January. While not the fault of the AFL, the postponed start has meant athletes were expected to train throughout the holiday period in preparation for a 7 January start. While this may make sense for full-time athletes from summer codes such as tennis or cricket, AFLW players are pausing day jobs to train and play at elite levels and then trying to resume their careers post-season. It is possible we are seeing the effects of the huge physical demand on the playing group already. In two rounds season-ending injuries have sidelined star players. Some of this can be attributed to the lack of game time provided by the pre-season, with clubs playing only one practice match or none at all. A further delay to allow for extra practice matches, and a buffer time between the season proper and finals, could make for a safer competition. Again, however, this would rely on players being able to take even more time off work and study. Many players would not begrudge a summer season as it allows them to play in pathway competitions for the remainder of the year. The current shortened season played in winter would see many athletes play less football overall, similarly under-serving their bodies, their talent, and the competition. We often hear of the need for ‘clear air’ – a magical time in the sporting calendar where AFLW could be given its due attention by broadcasters and audiences alike. However, this has never actually happened. Initially squashed between the Australian Open and the beginning of the AFLM season, the W has never had a free go at audiences or broadcast. Even the clubs push out content daily on their AFLM teams’ pre-season happenings throughout the AFLW season. If the AFL wanted to prioritise ‘clear air’ for the AFLW, they would recognise it as a winter sport and make time to stage it alongside the already lengthy AFLM season. The AFLW’s placement at the start of summer, combined with extra draft ceremonies after the AFLM season, all point to the AFL’s desire to ‘own’ the entire year. The AFL’s participation marketing push this year squarely exploits this idea with the tagline ‘taste summer footy’ paired with the image of an ice-cream cone in the shape of a football. The downside of this approach for the AFL, is the possibility of fan fatigue. Right now, the AFLW is competing with the Ashes, the Big Bash League and the Australian Open, to name a few. As part of our discussion about the AFLW in summer, The Outer Sanctum polled listeners on the ideal time for the season to run. The response by fans was a clear preference for a winter season, with many assuming it would ultimately find its place there. No doubt, devoted fans will sweat it out in summer until then. What we cannot shake, however, is that the shorter season and part-time status of the players create the impression that the AFLW is still the summer sideshow to the main event in winter. That is, the men’s game. Were it to be played in winter, there is a risk the AFLM media coverage would drown out the AFLW. However given the way the AFL has built an ever-growing audience around the AFLW, perhaps a concerted marketing campaign by the AFL could circumvent this. The ultimate solution for all would be a full 18-round season played in the winter and, one day, equal pay and full-time status. Time (and some major sponsors) will determine how long before we reach that horizon.",Sport/Sport,AFLW should be recognised as a winter sport staged alongside the men | Rana Hussain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/aflw-should-be-recognised-as-a-winter-sport-staged-alongside-the-men
1/17/2022,"One hundred doctors, including specialists, consultants and locums for remote areas, are locked out of Western Australia, with Mark McGowan’s government refusing G2G passes despite the entry of Covid-19 being mere weeks away. Since the spread of the Omicron variant in late 2021, the WA government has progressively shuttered entry from anyone entering from the eastern states, making it now close to impossible for anyone to enter WA, diplomats and state officials aside.  As the reopening deadline of 5 February approaches, shutout doctors – who already have jobs and work contracts in the state but can’t get a G2G pass to enter – are warning the health system needs adequate time to prepare for the influx of Covid-19, and the state government should now grant all doctors a G2G pass as a matter of urgency. Heather* is a senior doctor who is in training to be a specialist and has had her application to enter WA refused three times in recent weeks. Her hospital job is expecting her to begin work in late January. “I am a specialist-trainee – but there are also anaesthetists and consultants that are getting rejected and that’s extremely concerning,” said Heather, speaking to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity. “What I think is upsetting is these rejections are happening to the really essential doctors – people who are due at community clinics or in remote regions where their skills are absolutely critical.” With mortgage repayments to make and no clear outline for when entry will be granted, Heather is now looking at applying for locum roles in other states. “The state needs to decide should all doctors be allowed in as a group, or should we cherry-pick the specialists we need most – ICU, anaesthetists – and give them priority, with the rest having to wait,” Heather said. “The reality is every state is under a lot of health pressure, so it’s not a realistic excuse from WA to say the vulnerable communities need special protection. I am sorry but there are vulnerable communities in many other parts of Australia. The main difference with WA’s vulnerable communities is there is a much greater distance between Perth and the Kimberley, say.” According to a group chat viewed by the Guardian, around 100 doctors are in a similar position to Heather. All of them have jobs lined up, or are returning to senior roles they have held in critical and specialist areas for years. “In a [health] system that’s already understaffed makes perfect sense that we’re all having such trouble getting in …” wrote one doctor. “Especially with the border opening only a month away, the mind boggles.” “Yes, staffing at a crisis point without Covid,” wrote another. “I fear total collapse of the system when Covid arrives.” In a statement, McGowan’s office said the Office of the Chief Health Officer had received, processed and approved more than 130 applications for entry from health officials in January 2022. Mark Duncan-Smith, the WA president of the Australian Medical Association, said many doctors were gaining entry but the process was complex. “It’s a problem of process, not exclusions,” said Duncan-Smith, who said the AMA had assisted several doctors who had difficulties obtaining G2G passes, despite having employment contracts and letters of support. “They’re not being excluded, the problem is not in the approvals, these excluded people are having problems navigating the system. Should the system be simpler? Yes.” Western Australia’s opposition leader, Mia Davies, said it was “extremely concerning” that doctors who want to come home to WA “to work in our understaffed health system are not being granted exemptions”. “Immediate attention should be given to allowing these vital health workers to come into WA safely, as they will be key in bolstering WA’s hospital and medical workforce ahead of February 5,” she said. “I’m sure a majority of West Australians would like to see common sense applied to safely bring these essential medical workers into the state to support us through this next stage of Covid.” Libby Mettam, an MP and deputy leader of the WA Liberal party, said any doctors facing difficulties entering at a time of critical health need for WA was “completely unacceptable”. “It is completely unacceptable that health workers, including doctors, are being locked out of WA when they could be assisting our under-resourced health system ahead of the border opening in less than a month’s time,” Mettam said. “Given WA’s health worker shortage and the inevitable influx of Covid in the community in less than a month’s time, the McGowan government should be doing everything to ensure these health workers can work here, which includes health worker exemptions.” WA is scheduled to open to Australia – and the world – at midnight on 5 February. The McGowan government announced the reopening date in December when the state’s double-dose vaccination rate hit 80%. However, in parts of the Kimberley and Pilbara the vaccination rate remains much lower, with some remote Indigenous communities not yet hitting 50%.",News/Australia news,One hundred doctors locked out of Western Australia weeks before state reopens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/one-hundred-doctors-locked-out-of-western-australia-weeks-before-state-reopens
1/17/2022,"Australia’s commercial free-to-air TV channels have called on the federal government to introduce legislation guaranteeing them prominence on smart TV home screens, claiming they are becoming “increasingly hard to find” among global streaming rivals such as Netflix. Televisions increasingly include apps for the various streaming services available, including Netflix, Stan, Disney+ and ABC iview, as well as the commercial channels own apps.  However, Free TV Australia, which represents free-to-air stations including Seven, Nine and Ten, has flagged growing concern that the commercial stations are becoming increasingly hard to find on smart TVs. “TV manufacturers and operating system developers increasingly exert control over which options are displayed to consumers, directing viewers to those services that can pay the highest price for preferred placement on the home screen,” Free TV Australia said in a submission to the parliamentary inquiry on social media and online harms this month. There was also concern that streaming-specific buttons on remote controls as well as favourable placement on smart TV home screens for other streaming services were diverting viewers away from free-to-air TV. “This means that decisions about whether free, licensed terrestrial services, together with broadcast video on demand (BVOD) apps will be readily available to Australian viewers, and if so on what terms, are increasingly being made in boardrooms in Japan, South Korea, and the US,” Free TV Australia said. “This risk becomes even greater as manufacturers seek to monetise prominent spots on user interfaces and to reach lucrative deals with global streaming services over and above local, Australian FTA broadcast services. Manufacturers see themselves as distributors and expect a ‘clip of the ticket’ or some form of payment for access to their screen real estate.” The organisation argued streaming companies could never replace the value of free-to-air TV. “Global entertainment platforms such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime cannot cut to breaking news to cover health advice updates from government or provide critical bushfire updates,” Free TV Australia said. “Prominence and accessibility of free TV services are therefore essential to ensuring the government’s policy goals are achieved, including those relating to accurate, impartial, and trustworthy news; iconic sporting events; and provision of emergency information.” The organisation said legislation was needed to ensure TV manufacturers made it easy for Australians to find free-to-air channels and apps, proposing a “prominence framework” requiring “free, easy and universal access” to free-to-air services, and for Australians to be made aware of free-to-air services. “Action is needed now to secure the long-term availability and prominence of Australian commercial FTA content services for Australian viewers,” Free TV Australia said. Guardian Australia sought comment from the two biggest TV companies in Australia – Samsung and Sony. Samsung declined to comment. Free TV Australia also welcomed the government’s social media exposure draft legislation, released for comment late last year, as a means to reduce the defamation risk media companies currently face for comments on social media following the high court’s Dylan Voller defamation ruling late last year. The ruling found owners of pages and groups on social media are considered publishers for third-party comments on posts, and therefore may be liable for defamatory comments made. The legislation would make the social media platforms the publisher of the content, but would provide a defence for the companies if they facilitate identification of the user who made the comment. Free TV said since the judgment media companies had significantly limited comments on their stories on social media. “News media organisations have limited the number and range of articles that they share on social media, and are more often closing the comments section entirely, which prevents any discussion of the news and current affairs they are reporting. “While the Anti-Trolling Bill is still under consideration, media companies continue to be legally responsible for this material. It will be important, in final drafting of the Anti-Trolling Bill, to ensure that social media services cannot contract-out of legal liability.” The inquiry has closed submissions and will report back to parliament in February.",Arts/Television & radio,Australia’s free-to-air channels demand guaranteed prime position on smart TVs,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/17/australias-free-to-air-channels-demand-guaranteed-prime-position-on-smart-tvs
1/17/2022,"In a small town in South Australia, the exterior walls of a public restroom are wrapped in vivid landscapes hand-painted on to tile. In the centre, a windmill stands tall above a river that spills into rolling, rust-coloured paddocks. Beside it, a bird nests atop a sign reading “Carrieton”. “It is a mural depicting the history of the town,” travel blogger Marion Halliday says. “You look at it and go, oh my God, that’s amazing.  “Then you realise it is the wall of a toilet.” Halliday, who is known online as Red Nomad, has spent almost 30 years travelling around Australia; her book Aussie Loos with Views documents the rest-stops. “Sometimes you just need the loo. You stumble across these quirky places in the outback where you think, there shouldn’t be a loo here, but there is. And it looks bizarre!” The federal health department’s National Public Toilet Map displays the location of more than 19,000 public bathroom facilities across the country – a true gift in this pandemic, as Australians make plans to spend more time outdoors. Approved in 2000, the map came about “at a time when getting information on where there are toilets was almost impossible,” says Michael Radford, who worked on the map. “The longevity of the project is an indicator of how valuable it is.” With each bathroom location, information is included on accessibility features including baby care, sharps disposal and showers. As “standards for accessibility change,” so does the map, Radford explains. “Some toilets become too antiquated. Toilets might have a ramp, but doorways to the toilet are too narrow for motorised access.” So what makes a great public loo? A toilet so pretty you took photos? A room with a view? One you stumbled upon just in time? “No one has ever identified the most scenic toilet ever,” Halliday says. “But there’s certainly a few contenders.” One might be at Kata Tjuta, a group of rock formations in the Northern Territory. “There was an area where you can park, picnic, walk around and visit the toilet,” Halliday recalls. “I came out of the loo, and suddenly there are these beautiful red rock domes, a blue sky and outback greenery. I thought, this has got to be one of the most scenic views from a toilet ever.” In Point Quobba, Western Australia, a narrow structure “you can only describe as a dunny” sits alone on a vast, sandy plane near the ocean. “It is a raised up toilet in this little wooden structure that faces out over some of the wildest seas I’ve ever seen,” Halliday says. “If you left the door open, which you’re probably not going to, you would be able to see a spectacularly wild part of the Australian coast from the toilet.” For Halliday, all a toilet needs to be memorable are the basics. “It has got to be clean,” she says. “And there has got to be toilet paper.” But she says “it doesn’t necessarily have to be a flushing toilet”, explaining that water conservation efforts in rural Australia sometimes rely on composting toilets that “do the job”. Others might be in it for the architecture and design. In 2019, a public bathroom in western Sydney took out the Total Facilities annual Australia’s best bathroom competition. The luxe bathroom at the Westpoint shopping centre in Blacktown boasts warm wood and clean marble finishes, suspended greenery, unintrusive hand dryers and mosaic art that pays homage to the area’s history. Beyond the aesthetics, it has been heralded for its inviting parents’ room and dedicated space for people with carers. Another beloved restroom in New South Wales sits on Rawson Pass near the peak of Mount Kosciuszko – the highest public toilet in Australia. Halliday describes the bathroom facility as “dug into the side of a mountain like a bunker”. On a Sydney beach, North Bondi Amenities is a popular modern outdoor toilet block bathed in natural light from skylights, with cascading greenery from succulents growing on the roof. Designed by Sam Crawford Architects in 2016, the concrete and terrazzo-tiled space elegantly suits the needs of a barefoot beachgoer needing to change into swimmers, take a toilet break or wait for the next bus in the shade. And in Wycliffe Well, a “quirky little roadhouse” between the NT’s Darwin and Alice Springs “claims to be the place with the most UFO sightings in Australia,” Halliday says. Each building at the roadhouse caravan park and campground is painted with murals of extraterrestrial activity. Halliday calls this “the alien pit stop”. With celestial splashes of purple and blue paint, humanoid silhouettes and “Maliens / Femalians” bathroom signage, Halliday says “the toilets are specifically built for them”.

1/17/2022,"There are few food items across the world as divisive as Spam, the small can of processed pork that inspires either love or revulsion. I’m part of the Asian diaspora and for me, this very American product tastes like home. The story of Spam in Asian communities is a shared story of resourcefulness and resilience. It’s often difficult to articulate to people as they recoil in disgust, that Spam is not only delicious but is also viewed very differently in our parents’ home countries.  I share my love for the small, rectangular slab of canned pork with millions of Asians and Pacific Islanders across the globe. The use of Spam is ingrained in the regional cuisines of the Philippines, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, which may seem inconsistent with local cooking styles, ingredients and techniques. So, how did this American tinned meat become embraced by so many cuisines? Spam and noodles, Spam and rice, Spam and eggs. Spam has a long history as a convenience product, a food ration, a luxury item and a leftover from US colonialism. It was created in 1937 by Hormel Foods as a way of turning surplus pork shoulder into profit, and to fill a gap in the market for small portions of high quality deli meat with a long shelf life. At the time, other companies were using waste products and offcuts like pork noses to make their deli meat, so Spam’s comparative high quality and affordability made it a hit with families struggling through the Great Depression. Its long shelf life and high protein content also made it an ideal military ration. That’s how Spam began its journey around the globe – as a wartime necessity. By the end of the second world war, the US government had bought about 68,000 metric tonnes of it, to feed its army and as aid for its allies. After the second world war, Spam’s popularity waned in Europe, but remained hugely popular in the Asia-Pacific. In the Philippines, Spam was an expensive commodity sold in retail stores at US army bases, with one tin often costing almost an average daily wage. Its price and its overt “American-ness” was a large part of its appeal – having Spam or other imported canned goods in your pantry became a symbol of affluence. In Hong Kong, where agricultural land (and therefore meat) was scarce and manufacturing was booming, cafes or cha chaan tengs cleverly combined Chinese cooking styles with luxurious, imported foods like Spam, butter and cheese, creating Cantonese interpretations of western fare for factory workers. In Hawaii, the US military introduced Spam as an alternative source of protein when local people lost access to a major part of their diet with restrictions on Japanese-American off-shore fishing during the war. It now forms an intrinsic element of Hawaii cuisine. The Korean war took Spam farther east. US soldiers bartered with Spam for information from local people left hungry by wartime shortages. It was also smuggled out from army bases along with sausages, baked beans and other canned goods. This period of scarcity gave rise to the now quintessential budae jjigae or “army base stew”, the perfect amalgamation of Korean cooking and American ingredients. I grew up in Singapore, eating Spam as part of an “economy/curry rice” offering, with noodles or in fried rice, and at home, where my mum cooked it for us as a treat. Spam is most delicious when simply fried in a pan – salty, soft in the middle, with crispy golden edges. It’s the perfect textural contrast. When diced and stir-fried into rice or eggs, it gives glorious bursts of porky flavour. Simmered, it becomes exceedingly tender and absorbs the flavour of the broth, making it an ideal ingredient in a decadent, spicy stew. Sure, Spam is a relic of American colonialism, but it’s also undeniably Asian. It’s a shining beacon of culinary innovation through hardship, and represents a complex history across many cultures. It’s also absolutely delicious. A plant-based alternative: I know encouraging the consumption of a mass-produced meat product comes with huge ethical and environmental issues, but Asia’s love for Spam has also given rise to a brilliant plant-based luncheon meat product called OmniPork. It features as a plant-based “Spam” in McDonald’s in Hong Kong and Macau, and is even available in Australia. It looks and cooks just like Spam does – so feel free to substitute it in to my favourite Spam recipes below. A rich, spicy relic from the Korean war, budae jjigae is the perfect fusion of traditional Korean flavours with western ingredients. Korean stews or jjigae are generally served sharing-style at the table over a portable stove, but can also be cooked on the stovetop and brought to the table. This is a wonderful dish to enjoy with a group. For this recipe, you’ll need gochujang and gochugaru, which are Korean red pepper paste and flakes. Both can be found in well stocked supermarkets and Asian grocers.

Assemble the ingredients in a wide, shallow saucepan in layers, starting with the sliced brown onion, mushrooms, kimchi and sauce. Arrange the spam, sausages, baked beans and tofu over the top, pour the stock over the dish and bring to a boil, covered on medium heat. Allow to boil for four to five minutes. Turn the heat down to a simmer, and add the rice cakes and instant noodles without the flavour sachet. Remove the lid and continue cooking. Top with cheese and serve in individual bowls. Add more stock to thin the stew as it continues to cook down.

Add the chicken stock, soy sauce and oyster sauce and bring to the boil. Add the macaroni and cook for seven to eight minutes, following the packet instructions. While the macaroni is cooking, heat the remaining one tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and pan-fry the Spam until golden brown on both sides. Remove the Spam and set aside, then fry the eggs in the same pan. To assemble, divide the macaroni and soup into two bowls, top with slices of Spam, the bok choy, an egg each and sliced spring onions. Ladle more soup over the top, sprinkle with a little sesame oil, and serve. These potato fritters are enormously addictive. I can eat five or six in one sitting before the guilt kicks in.

Sisig is a Philippine dish of crispy grilled and chopped pork (usually pig’s head and belly) with chicken livers, in a bright and acidic marinade. Classic sisig features papaya, green mango, fish and other meats, but the modern variety came about from Filipinos cleverly repurposing excess pork from US Clark airbase in Pampanga. Traditional sisig requires several stages of cooking, but this recipe only needs one. The flavourful dressing is the perfect match for the fatty, crispy meat.

1/17/2022,"Ashleigh Cooper has spent the new year indoors. Around her, in the suburbs of Melbourne, Covid cases are soaring. It’s a story repeated in every Australian state, except Western Australia.  Australia recorded more cases in the first two weeks of 2022 than in the previous two years combined. For most, the threat posed by Covid has eased – 92.4% of Australians over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated, and 18% have also had a booster shot. And the Omicron variant, which has ripped through the country since December, appears to result in a less severe illness, in most cases, than previous variants of Covid-19. Public health orders enforced by strict and punitive laws have been replaced by a mantra of personal responsibility. It is up to individuals to determine and manage their own risk. For the most vulnerable people, the only way to manage this risk is to retreat. Cooper is disabled and immunocompromised. She went into self-isolation two weeks ago. “For me the risk is too high,” she says. “It is very strange to watch the rest of the world say ‘we will go out and it will be fine and we will get sick and it will be fine’. I would not be fine – I had my booster shot last week and was severely unwell for five days. I do not want to get Covid.” Guardian Australia spoke to more than 40 people about how they were feeling at the start of the third year of the pandemic. Many like Cooper have gone into self-isolation to protect themselves or a vulnerable loved one. Many others say they have chosen to go back into something resembling lockdown until their children can be vaccinated or until the outbreak peaks. Cooper says she felt significantly safer when Melbourne was in lockdown and finds the argument that people should “get over” their concern about a global pandemic “incredibly invalidating”. “We should absolutely acknowledge that [lockdown] was bad and a lot of people suffered, but a lot of people are also alive now because of it,” she says. “I know that I was safer.” Also invalidating is the implication, from some public health messaging and public responses to death announcements, that a disease is less devastating if most of its victims are people who have pre-existing conditions. “Almost everyone has a pre-existing condition,” Cooper says. “What’s the price that we are willing to pay in order for people to be able to go and have brunch? “Are you willing to justify risking the health of vulnerable people for that privilege?” Most people who spoke to Guardian Australia are still recovering from the impact of long lockdowns and do not want a return to restrictions. They just want an indication from governments both state and federal that they will be supported and able to easily access tests and healthcare as the outbreak, and any new variants to come, rolls on. Martin Radzaj says he has found the start of 2022 to be the most difficult time in the pandemic because of the “utter confusion about what we should be doing”. He also feels the loss of the sense of collective action which, for some, underscored the long lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. “The thought of lockdown again is what is giving me a lot of anxiety and a lot of dread … it scares me,” says Melbourne man James Burke. Two years of mostly home schooling has given his youngest child, who started kindergarten in 2020, social anxiety, and his older child had a panic attack at the prospect of returning to face-to-face learning. “We paid the price [of lockdown], we bought the government time to build capacity in our health services. And they lost control in just two weeks.” The anxiety of past outbreaks has been replaced with anger at state and federal governments, and a growing sense of despair that the pandemic will not end, at least not any time soon. Hannah*, a vision-impaired support worker in Melbourne, says the 2021 lockdowns left her feeling “emptied out”. “I felt like half a person,” she says. Like many who spoke to Guardian Australia, she focused on the vaccine rollout – when everyone who was eligible was double-vaccinated it would be OK. Then Omicron happened, the inevitable consequence of a lack of global vaccine equity, and the promise of a return to normal life has been pushed back once more. “It now feels as though it is going to define parts of my life trajectory where I was hoping it wouldn’t,” she says. “Two years [living in a pandemic] is very different to five years when you only get three good months every year.” Northcote woman Phoebe* is also feeling a sense of arrested development. The public servant, 25, contracted Covid along with 16 others at a house party late last month. She still can’t smell or taste anything and several of her friends remain unwell. “Some people are going to get chronic illness from that, and we are in our 20s,” she says. “Every single one of us was double-vaccinated as soon as we were eligible but we are not eligible yet for a booster. It just feels like there’s no plan and younger people are bearing the brunt of it.” Phoebe says her social circle has split in two: those who have had Covid and are now feeling invulnerable for 30 days – despite warnings that earlier reinfection is possible – and those who are curbing social activities to try to avoid it. Thomas Barbera says his friend groups have done the same, and it has caused some uncomfortable conversations. “People do not want to feel that you are judging them or saying that what they are doing is unsafe – and it is not inherently unsafe, they just have different risk tolerance and different priorities than you,” he says. Barbera says he is still struggling to come to terms with a health policy that expects and accepts that hundreds of thousands of Australians will get Covid, after two years where a handful of cases would send the city into lockdown. “Two years of having ‘get a test’ drummed into you and then suddenly people are told not to get a test unless they fit certain criteria … I found that really hard,” he says. “It felt like, have we given up?” His store of rapid antigen tests, bought in early December, has been slowly dwindling as he hands them out to friends who have been identified as close contacts. Almost everyone who spoke to Guardian Australia said they would feel more comfortable moving around if they had access to free, readily available rapid antigen tests. Australian government frontbencher Simon Birmingham told the ABC on Friday that demand for testing, from both PCR and rapid tests, had been “far in excess of what has been modelled in Australia and all around the world”. The Australian government has since ordered $62m worth of rapid antigen tests. Kylie*, a midwife working in Melbourne hospitals, says despite difficulties with testing and high case numbers there is cause to be optimistic. “There are more women with the virus who are having babies, but unlike 2021 they are not gasping for breath,” she says. “In the past fortnight none of my patients have gone to ICU. So for me, right now, I am seeing the light.” Milly*, a young woman from Melbourne, says that two years of going in and out of lockdown has caused a downshift in her lifestyle that feels akin to being retired. “I have adjusted to living a more sheltered life and enjoy being in my house, running the same route, cycling the same loop, doing the Wordle, going to bed on time,” she says. “‘[The] big difference is I have no energy for or interest in working, just want to read books and chill. Took a while for the anxiety to die down to get to this point but now I don’t want to do anything else.” Richard Chigwin is experiencing his third summer without customers. He owns a series of ecotourism huts in the New South Wales Blue Mountains and lost the 2020 summer holidays to bushfires and 2021 to coronavirus. 2022 was supposed to be different, but “It feels exactly like there is a lockdown. You are not even fielding inquiries – it’s school holidays in January, that’s not right.” As a sole trader, Chigwin wasn’t eligible for government support in earlier rounds. Other business owners say they are finding this summer more difficult than previous seasons because there was no financial aid available. A Victorian-based consultant told Guardian Australia they were still receiving commercial rent relief until this week. Now that has ended too. “Like everyone else, we just have to muddle through on our own.” Lydia Napoli also works in hospitality in NSW. “It’s a nightmare,” she says. “My husband is working overtime, heaps of chefs and [front-of-house staff are] unwell or close contacts, and there is no support. I’m double vaxxed and feeling like, what was the point? There’s still high chances of new variants. It’s all just exhausting.” Karen McVean, a Melbourne-based remedial massage therapist, has chosen a different approach. “As the Covid years continue we are losing our magical thinking it will go away and not be a changing burden to our life,” she says. “Personally, I feel better with accepting that Covid is an ongoing issue. How can I best get on with living my best life?”",News/Australia news,"‘Like a lockdown’: in 2022, Australians are still feeling the fear and anxiety of Covid",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/like-a-lockdown-in-2022-australians-are-still-feeling-the-fear-and-anxiety-of-covid
1/17/2022,"Some may presume that catharsis can be found in memoir writing, but for Joe Simpson, putting Touching the Void down on paper was “horrible”. He retreated to a friend’s attic to write the book over seven weeks, purely because the facts of his stricken ascent up Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes as a 25-year-old had been greatly misrepresented through rumours in the climbing world. Now, decades on, he’s flummoxed to see his story as a play, making its Australian premiere in Melbourne on 17 January after receiving five-star reviews in the UK. “There was obviously something in that story that fascinated everybody,” Simpson says from an attic in the UK, where he’s tearing himself away from the cricket. “It’s not simply rubbernecking. A degree of it is that returning-from-the-dead stuff that’s very much part of the northern hemisphere mythology, from Norse sagas to Jesus Christ. People think, I’m going to get into deep shit someday. I’m going to get cancer, I’m going to lose my job – whatever. What would I do in that situation?”  In 1985, Simpson and fellow climber Simon Yates decided to tackle the previously unclimbed West Face. After a series of calamities, Simpson fell from an ice cliff, breaking his leg. Yates laboriously tried to lower him to safety, successfully clearing 3,000 feet, but as storm conditions worsened, the pair became stuck, with Yates in danger of being pulled from the cliff. He made the call to cut the rope, which meant Simpson, who Yates was unable to see or communicate with, would fall. “Left for dead” is the way the scenario is often described. “Eventually there was nothing in the story that you could recognise except the cutting of the rope,” Simpson says of those distortions. “My peers – people who should know better – were making judgment calls on what Simon had done without actually knowing any of the facts.” Back in 1988, Simpson expected to sell around 500 copies of Touching the Void within the climbing world, but he’s shifted more than 1m. In 2003, a Bafta-winning docudrama of the same name reconstructed the action and became the most successful documentary in British cinema history. Then in 2018, the book was adapted for the stage by Scottish playwright David Greig. Now the Melbourne Theatre Company has taken on that script, with Petra Kalive as associate director. “David was able to balance the story, so we get Joe’s epic hero’s journey, but also Simon’s journey. They were both in an impossible position and they’re both heroes in their own right, but their trajectories are very different,” says Kalive. Yates approves of play. “It’s a feelgood story,” he told PA Media after seeing the UK production. “It all works out in the end. I think we were very lucky. We got away with it.” The titular void becomes a character in its own right, as well as a metaphor for death. “That feels right for this production, especially doing it at this time,” Kalive says. “I thought a play about endurance and hope would be good when we programmed it, but had no idea that it would have so many resonances now.” Set designer Andrew Bailey created a mountain-like structure that’s “abstract” but requires the actors to work at height. There were five weeks of rehearsal, which included rock-wall climbing in the CBD. Kevin Hofbauer, who plays Simpson, used to be an athlete, which helps; Joe Klocek, equally athletic, plays Yates. And Karl Richmond plays Richard Hawking, a non-climbing backpacker who looked after base camp, for comic relief. And then there’s Sarah, played by Lucy Durack. She’s Simpson’s sister, used as a device to provoke her brother in his darkest hour and explore the many moral challenges of mountaineering. There’s a moment at Simpson’s fictional funeral when Sarah delivers a line that taps into the perception that mountaineering is a selfish pursuit, chief among the reasons being that some mountaineers put reaching the summit above human life: “I lost my moral compass. Do you happen to have one? Oh no, you’re a climber.” Simpson has now written five non-fiction books and two novels that all explore the ethics of climbing; none more so than 1997’s Dark Shadows Falling, triggered by an incident a year earlier in which two Japanese climbers allegedly failed to help an Indian climber whose body remains on Everest to this day. “One of the climbers said there is no morality above 1,000 metres and I got absolutely bloody livid at that,” Simpson says. “There’s no way a summit is more important. The very least you do is you sit with that man and you hold his hand and you give him water.” He’s also disturbed by the environmental impact of hundreds of people at a time at base camp, putting their bucket-list dreams of conquering Everest above exploring the area in a sustainable way. “I don’t regard what’s going on at Everest as mountaineering, frankly,” he says. “You know – 600 people climbing up a rope that somebody else put in, breathing oxygen that somebody else carried up … There are climbers today like we were in 1982, trying to do the hardest things you possibly can in the best style, trying to climb to the aestheticism of the line.” In his book This Game of Ghosts, Simpson touches on childhood and what might have set him on his course. Now, he says, “I think being sent away to school at eight has a fairly major effect on your personality. Suddenly torn away from your parents. Maybe it enables you to be more independent.” When he was 15 he rejected Roman Catholic indoctrination, but although he lost his faith, he found a sense of spirituality in mountaineering that gave the pursuit great meaning. “You can put your head down to sleep and see fossils in the stone that you’re lying on,” he says. “And you can look up – the starlight is just extraordinary, especially at high altitude. You’re looking at light coming from stars that stopped existing 100,000 years ago. That kind of spirituality is your part of being Gaia.” Simpson continued climbing until 2009, at which point he was in so much pain descending from a summit in Nepal that he realised all the “cheques I cashed in my 20s had come through”. As he says, there are old climbers and bold climbers, but no old, bold climbers. These days he is a keen fly-fisher (“not quite the same”) but the grief of losing climbing took five years to get over. “It’s how you define yourself,” he says. “Every year you’re going away on a trip and it was that sort of steamboat whistle – the aircraft is going down the runway and you’re going off on a great adventure, thinking, ‘What’s going to happen this time?’” Touching the Void is on 17 January to 19 February at Southbank Theatre, The Sumner.",Arts/Stage,Touching the Void: climber Joe Simpson on the ‘feelgood’ show inspired by his survival,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/17/touching-the-void-climber-joe-simpson-on-the-feelgood-show-inspired-by-his-survival
1/17/2022,"A woman with chronic illnesses and an immunocompromised partner and the single mother of a toddler are among those being told they’ll have their benefits cut if they don’t attend face-to-face job agency appointments, despite an unprecedented surge of Covid cases. Welfare mutual obligations, which have been suspended in Covid-affected areas for much of the pandemic, were reintroduced nationally in late October. Last week the government rebuffed calls to pause them, despite soaring infection numbers.  Guardian Australia has confirmed that while some job agencies are allowing people subject to mutual obligations to meet their requirements from home – by conducting meetings by phone or online, for example – others are insisting participants attend in person. A participant in the disability employment services program, who did not wish to be named, said her provider warned her that she must attend a group job coaching meeting scheduled for next week. The 23-year-old, who lives in Adelaide, said she lived with chronic illnesses but was most worried about infecting her loved ones. “My partner has an autoimmune disorder and is on immunosuppressant medication,” she said. “I’m not really comfortable going out and potentially exposing myself and him. “He works at the airport but he has decided to take unpaid leave because of the risk.” Jobseekers face having their payments suspended if they fail or refuse to attend a scheduled appointment with their employment services provider. For much of the pandemic, the government paused mutual obligations – which meant jobseekers could either continue receiving services online, or stop taking part in meetings. During the period, welfare payment suspensions for “non-compliance” were not applied. This time, the government has rebuffed calls to return to those measures, instead setting lockdowns – which have been all but ruled out by state leaders – as the marker to dictate when mutual obligations might be stopped again. Lauren Colvin, 38, is another welfare recipient who is being required to attend face-to-face appointments. The single mother, who has a 17-month-old son, learned last week she was being forced on to the ParentsNext program, a controversial pre-employment program for those on parenting payments that has been decried as sexist. “I have to take my toddler [to the face-to-face meeting],” Colvin said. “We’ve been basically isolated. It’s really scary.” Colvin, who lives near Newcastle, said she was told by Centrelink she would need to attend a face-to-face appointment on Monday with a ParentsNext provider. The program is supposed to be aimed at getting those on parenting payments on to a path towards employment. But Colvin, who is a qualified primary school teacher, is already in the middle of a career shift, having completed a bachelor’s degree last year. She starts a master’s of psychology this year. Colvin believes she is not eligible for ParentsNext because she is already studying, a claim backed by guidelines published online, but Centrelink has insisted she must go to the meeting. “He just kept repeating the same line, ‘We are not currently under lockdown, therefore you must fulfil your obligations,’” Colvin said. “That was what he just kept reverting back to. “I tried to contact the complaints line, but just haven’t been able to get through.” Another participant in the jobactive employment program, who is based in Melbourne, asked for his next meeting to be over the phone rather than in person but was refused. He said he was told “it’s the government’s rules and I have to do it or my payment will be cut”. “Given this is an office with a bunch of random people going in and out all day, it’s scaring me a lot,” he said. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said mutual obligations should be suspended. “We should not be forcing people to attend unnecessary, risky face-to-face activities, like group job-searching or appointments with jobservice providers, under threat of being cut off from their life-sustaining income support,” she said. Kristin O’Connell, of the Antipoverty Centre, said the government should suspend mutual obligations in a “return to the strategies that kept us safe in 2020”. “Moving activities online doesn’t go far enough – payment suspensions must be removed immediately,” O’Connell said. “We are desperately searching for Covid tests, trying to meet our basic needs in the face of shortages, and do all this on poverty payments. People need the time and space to focus on keeping themselves safe, and caring for loved ones, and recovering if they fall sick.” A Department of Employment spokesperson said providers were required to “ensure face-to-face service delivery is safe, permitted by the relevant jurisdiction’s health orders, appropriate to the participant and staff, is reasonable in the circumstances and beneficial to the participant”. “If a participant feels that they have a valid reason for not attending face-to-face services, such as a health or Covid-19 related issue, they should advise their provider before their appointment or activity,” the spokesperson said. “Providers are required to find the participant an alternative and suitable service if the participant has a valid reason. “Additionally, anyone who is sick, whether that be related to Covid or any other illness, is directed to isolate or is caring for someone who is isolating, can seek an exemption to their mutual obligation requirements.” A spokesperson for the Department of Social Services, which runs the Disability Employment Services program, said participants were “only required to attend face-to-face appointments where it is safe to do so”. “Participants concerned about face-to-face appointments affecting their health or that of an immediate family or household member, are offered alternative servicing arrangements,” the spokesperson said. However the spokesperson confirmed it was DES providers that “determine whether appointments and other mutual obligations activities can take place over the phone or digitally”.",News/Australia news,‘It’s really scary’: welfare recipients forced to attend in-person appointments despite Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/16/its-really-scary-welfare-recipients-forced-to-attend-in-person-appointments-despite-omicron-surge
1/17/2022,"Economic management is a perennial battleground in Australian elections. In reality, the debate is meaningless as no side has much control over key factors. On the economy, politicians enjoy what Yes Minister’s Sir Humphrey Appleby termed responsibility without power, the prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages.  Firstly, Australia’s economy is dependent on external events, particularly commodity prices and the performance of our trading partners, especially China. Over the last half a century, successive commodity booms and the emergence of Japan, China and India have underpinned Australian living standards and shielded the nation from major downturns. In 2021, Chinese demand combined with interruptions in Brazilian supply led to higher iron-ore prices temporarily increasing export revenues from this source alone to around 10% of the Australian economy, roughly double pre-pandemic levels. These additional revenues more than covered the pandemic-driven losses from international students, inbound tourists and immigration. Government revenue is highly sensitive to the iron ore price: a US$10 per tonne rise increases Western Australia’s royalties by around $800m per year. Other critical factors largely outside government control are Covid-19 and geopolitics. The virus affects expenditure on health and income and industry support. Activity is influenced by mobility disruptions, which impact demand (tourism, foreign students, hospitality and personal services) as well as supply (quarantined staff, worker and skills shortages and supply chain breakdowns). Sino-US tensions bedevil relations with Australia’s largest trade counterparty. Extreme weather events increasingly affect agricultural production. Global action to reduce emissions, such as the European Union’s planned levy on carbon-intensive imports, may affect Australian fossil fuel exports. Miners already face financing difficulties as investors seek to reduce exposure to the sector. Secondly, even in areas of policy supposedly within their control, governments have limited ability to shape outcomes. Budget-day grandstanding aside, many elements are difficult to control, as the persistent inaccuracy of forecasts highlight. When economic activity slows, taxes fall and spending rises, increasing deficits and debt (known as the “automatic stabilisers”). Improving performance has the opposite effect. Budget measures rely on uncertain multiplier effects – the increase in economic activity resulting from additional government spending. Targeting stimulus is challenging. Overzealous and/or misdirected government spending to boost the economy during the pandemic may have exacerbated inflationary pressures. Interest rate and monetary conditions are the preserve of a theoretically independent central bank. In any case, the Reserve Bank’s actions are frequently negated by those of larger counterparts, such as the US, the EU, Japan and China. Australian interest rates must track overseas equivalents to avoid destabilising capital inflows or outflows. Australia’s size limits the ability to intervene in financial markets to influence the value of the Australian dollar in a world where all countries want a weak currency to improve export competitiveness. Besides, lower rates and pumping money may not boost the economy as business and individual borrowing is based on needs and repayment ability. In the absence of demand for their products, lower cost of debt may not increase investment. Lower interest income may perversely encourage greater saving, including for retirement, reducing consumption, which normally constitutes around 60% of economic activity. Governments could undertake microeconomic or structural reform to increase competitiveness and flexibility by improving workforce practices, education, cost structures, infrastructure, productivity and social policy. This too presents complications. Couples refuse to cooperate with government diktats to increase the birth rate. Higher immigration faces opposition from many groups. While everybody agrees on the need for change, there is little agreement on the “what”, the “how” and the “who pays”. Besides, structural reform requires slow and painstaking effort not glib marketing slogans. It has uncertain outcomes and may take decades to yield results, during which time the underlying conditions may shift. Australia’s federated model makes it difficult to coordinate policies between different levels of government. Required legislative power is also restricted by internal party factional wars, as well as the frequent absence of a secure majority or control of both houses of parliament. Thirdly, governments are trapped by unintended consequences. Instead of boosting activity, lower rates create asset (housing) price bubbles, which exacerbate housing unaffordability and inequality, as well as creating high levels of mortgage debt and inflation. This leads to surreal policy cocktails: cutting interest rates, subsidising home purchases and jaw-boning banks to limit lending (known as macro-prudential policy). It resembles trying to drive a car with a foot simultaneously on the accelerator and the brake. It is understandable that modern superhero politicians prefer more nebulous issues: national security, culture, identity, character, probity and affinity with cute babies and cuddly animals. The mystery is why voters believe promises on the economy that even competent governments have limited ability to deliver on. Perhaps like Napoleon’s preference for “lucky” generals, Australians should vote for “lucky” leaders.

1/17/2022,"The Parent Trap is a charming 1998 family film that will appeal to adults and kids alike, but please don’t use it as an instructional manual on how to raise children. An American winery owner and a British dressmaker enjoy a whirlwind romance and a quickfire wedding, only to get divorced shortly after the birth of their twin daughters. Rather than work out a shared custody deal, they instead decide it is in the best interests of their baby girls to split the twins up, take them to different sides of the world, and then never inform either of the existence of the other. And if that wasn’t traumatising enough, neither daughter is given any information about their absent parent, being raised in a world of repression and whispers.  Being a Disney film, any parental deceit is swept under the rug, as are the logistics that see both children coincidentally sent to the same remote summer camp a few months shy of their 12th birthdays. Much like the 1961 original on which this version is based, the two sisters are played by one young actor – Lindsay Lohan in her stunning film debut – and the girls take an instant dislike to each other. A series of escalating and unlikely pranks ensue – including one in which a tween is somehow able to hoist an entire cabin’s worth of furniture, bunk beds and all, on to the roof and glue it all in place – and the two are punished by being kept alone in an isolated cabin on the edge of camp for the remainder of their time away (some eight weeks), without adult supervision. (Then again, a previous scene allowed them to sword-fight, so this was never the most well managed camp.) It is here in isolation that they start to like each other, discovering they are twins (Disney magic precluded them from realising this beforehand, despite being identical). A plan is hatched to swap identities, each going home in the other’s place to surreptitiously get to know the parent they were denied – with bouts of intense displacement, feelings of betrayal, and anger seemingly not a concern for these two li’l cuties. Eventually the parents discover the ruse, and short of being even mildly apologetic for the lifetime of deception, both are simply put out by this cross-continental annoyance. The twins conspire again, this time to get their parents together in the same place at the same time, while also ridding their father of his gold-digging, child-hating, Cruella-style girlfriend – who is really blocking their happily ever after. The rest of the film is a series of mishaps, hijinks, mislaid plans and disasters. And, obviously, a happy ending. It’s such an enjoyable movie that the Disney of it all actually adds to the appeal. This is also, by far, the best performance Lindsay Lohan has ever committed to celluloid: remarkable considering it’s not only her debut but that she’s performing two roles – one with a believable British accent, the other as a knock-about tomboy – and doing so largely to a green screen. It’s quite amusing, too, that Lohan was cast in this double role, given that the biggest young stars at the time were literally a set of 12-year-old twins. But while the Olsens were lovably wooden, I cannot stress how lovably brilliant Lohan is here. Turn a blind eye to the series of parental flaws that would have both parents on speed-dial at Docs and you are left with an off-kilter comedy that is impossible not to be charmed by. A lovely side romance between the parents’ respective butlers is the real beating heart of this film, along with the stunning chemistry Lohan is able to manage with herself.

1/17/2022,"Migraines are the most common form of headache that can cause severe throbbing pain – usually on one side of the head – and severely affect quality of life. A migraine attack can last hours or days and often comes with nausea, vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. According to a 2018 Deloitte Access Economics Report, almost 5 million people in Australia live with migraine, with 7.6% of them – around 400,000 people – experiencing chronic migraine, which means more than 15 migraine days per month.  Migraines are much more common in women than men and more prevalent in working-age people. “During a flare, all people want to do is lie in a cold dark room and not do anything,” says Adnan Asger Ali, a physiotherapist and the deputy national chair at Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy Australia. But research shows regular exercise may have a preventive effect in reducing the number and intensity of migraines. One of the main reasons physical activity may help relieve migraines, says Ali, is that the body releases endorphins (natural painkillers) during exercise. “Physical therapy can complement the pharmacological management of migraines,” he says. “It might mean that they take two Panadol instead of two codeine, and that’s still going to be a win because they’re not taking the hard stuff.” A proper physical assessment is necessary to tailor a treatment plan to the individual, and individuals should consult with a health professional before embarking on a new exercise regime, but here are some suggestions on physical exercise that might help manage migraine. Ali says slow movements, meditation and relaxation have significant beneficial effects on people who suffer from migraines. That includes activities such as yoga and tai chi. In a recent randomised clinical trial that involved 114 patients aged 18 to 50 years with a diagnosis of episodic migraine, researchers found that people who practised yoga as an add-on therapy had less frequent and less intense migraines than those who received medical treatment alone. Tai chi can also serve as a preventive measure for migraines. In a 2018 randomised controlled trial of 82 Chinese women with episodic migraines, researchers found that after 12 weeks of tai chi training, the women experienced significantly fewer migraine attacks. Neck stiffness and postural issues can be a driver for migraines, says Ali. He suggests the chin tuck, or cervical retraction, exercise to strengthen neck muscles and improve mobility. The chin tuck exercise can be performed standing or sitting. Begin by sitting upright and looking straight ahead, keeping your neck and shoulders relaxed. Place a finger on your chin and gently glide your chin down – tuck your chin to your neck. Don’t hold your breath, move your head up or down or bend your neck forward. You might feel a gentle pull at the base of the head and top of the neck. Hold the position for about five seconds and repeat the exercise 10 times – as long as it doesn’t cause any pain. Aerobic exercises such as walking, jogging, running and cycling might help mitigate migraine. A systematic review of studies on exercise and migraine published in The Journal of Headache and Pain in 2019 found that moderate-intensity exercise – physical activities that elevate your heart rate and cause you to breathe harder but still allow you to carry on a conversation – can decrease the number of migraine days. “Any activity that people will do consistently and that they enjoy will be good for them,” says Ali. Ali warns against HIIT workouts, which alternate short bursts of intense cardio exercise with rest or lower-intensity exercise. “Very high-intensity exercise is discouraged if it triggers your migraine,” he says. In some people, high-intensity exercise can trigger a migraine attack. But research has shown that regular HIIT workouts might be more beneficial than moderate exercise for others, highlighting the importance of a personalised exercise plan.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with migraines,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/17/how-to-move-with-migraines
1/17/2022,"Australia’s giant offshore gasfields are paying almost no royalties, create few jobs and are a large and rising source of greenhouse gases, according to a new report from the Australia Institute. The “Gas-fired robbery” report, released Monday, finds Western Australia receives only a tiny fraction of its revenue from an industry that generated $27bn in WA exports last year.  The report comes just days after a WA heatwave matched Australia’s hottest ever reliably recorded temperature of 50.7C and reportedly caused an outage at a nearby gas plant. The $430m that ended up in the state’s coffers was a mere 1% of budget revenue, or half as much as it collected from motor vehicle registrations. By contrast, the iron-ore industry tipped $7.8bn into the 2019/20 budget, more than 18 times as much as gas. “Oil and gas companies like Woodside and Chevron are being given this valuable and finite resource virtually for free, making huge profits from its sale, creating few jobs and returning almost nothing to everyday West Australians,” said Mark Ogge, principal adviser at the Australia Institute’s Climate & Energy Program, and author of the report. The North West Shelf gas operations provide the bulk of the liquefied natural gas royalties paid at $425m, with no tax or LNG royalties from Woodside’s Pluto, Chevron’s Wheatstone or Shell’s Prelude projects, the analysis found. Chevron’s Gorgon contributed $7m in 2019-20 to the WA budget but was potentially generating revenue of more than four times that tally per day. Although “paltry”, if the North West Shelf payments were extended at the same rate to the rest of the LNG industry in WA, more than $1bn would be generated for the state and $500m for the commonwealth, the report found. At its peak in 2013/14, the Woodside-run operation provided about triple the current level, or about $1.2bn, making up more than 4% of the budget revenue that year. The tax and royalty arrangements “see large amounts of gas effectively given away for free to multinational oil and gas companies”, the report said. “[T]he obvious question is how much money could be raised if WA’s gas was subject to an effective royalty regime.” With its reliance on expensive equipment rather than labour, the industry is also a relatively small employer in the state, accounting for less than 1% of the workforce, the report found. LNG also managed to extract $94m in subsidies from the state government in 2020/21. “This kind of legislative blank cheque from government to an industry that offers so few jobs and revenue in return is symptomatic of the disproportionate influence of the LNG industry,” it said. LNG’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is “immense” and growing as more projects line up for approval. Current and proposed LNG projects - including Browse, Scarborough and the Pluto expansion – will alone emit 41.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent in production and processing. That tally – which excludes the contribution when the gas is burnt by customers – amounts to almost half WA’s total emissions each year. A spokesperson for the WA government did not dispute the revenue figures but said the contribution of the LNG industry – which reserves 15% of its output for WA customers – went beyond the extraction and processing of the fuel. “Given energy is an essential input into most economic activity, we should not consider the employment effects of energy projects by simply looking at their operational workforce,” the official said. “Domestic gas has underpinned the Western Australian economy – for domestic and industrial uses – for decades, and due to our strong domestic gas policy LNG projects continue to make a significant contribution to the state.” Gas provides as much as 60% of the state’s electricity, and the Western Australian Gas and Downstream Industry Opportunities Study in August 2021 estimated downstream gas processing projects may contribute between $3bn-$10bn to the state economy over 20 years. Chevron, too, defended its economic contribution. The US-based company has paid about $7bn in Australian state and federal taxes and royalties since 2009, a spokesperson said. “Forecasts show by the early to mid-2020s, we will pay $1bn to $2.5bn a year in federal and state taxes and royalties,” she said. “Our contribution in Australia goes far beyond tax,” with more than $60bn in local content generated by the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects with contracts reaching almost 1,000 in number for Australian businesses, and 19,000 construction jobs. Claire Wilkinson, director of the WA division of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said: “Western Australians know that natural gas creates local jobs and is essential to our community, no matter what this east coast outfit [the Australia Institute] suggests. “Critically, mining and minerals processing, a key generator of royalties for WA, is a big user of natural gas to power their activities,” Wilkinson said. “In the last 10 years alone, Western Australian natural gas has supported at least 57,000 full-time jobs and paid more than $53bn in taxes.” Guardian Australia also approached the Morrison government, Woodside and Shell for comment.",News/Environment,"WA’s offshore gasfields pay almost no royalties and stoke carbon emissions, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/was-offshore-gasfields-pay-almost-no-royalties-and-stoke-carbon-emissions-report-finds
1/17/2022,"How do you shop at the supermarket? Do you take equal parts of impulse and vibe, fashion a list of stuff you fancy and load up the trolley until you think you’ve got enough food for the week?  An old and horribly inefficient version of my family of four did this for years. And for years, we’d get near the end of the week and have a pantry that was simultaneously full of food but without the constituent parts to make a decent meal. But then came a revelation. The most important piece of family admin is now the table we draw up that includes all the lunches and dinners we want that week. Our meal list comes in the form of a grid, with columns for each day of the week and rows for lunches and dinners. Once that’s done, we check that all the ingredients we need are either in the kitchen already or are on the shopping list. Then we add a few extras for snacks and breakfasts. Some days, we’ll eat leftovers in the freezer. But this goes on the meal planner too. This meal plan – stuck on the fridge – includes extra details like page numbers for recipe books or who will be that evening’s designated masterchef. We saved hundreds of dollars a month with this method, and we throw away much less food than we criminally used to. We also spend a lot less time in the supermarket because we don’t just wander down every aisle. This is good because supermarkets are not generally where you want to spend your time. But also the less minutes you have in there, the less opportunity the sneaky store designers have to tempt you with two-for-one offers, freshly-baked bread smells and those shiny product placements right in your eyeline (but yes, I will take those salt and balsamic vinegar chips, thanks very much).
