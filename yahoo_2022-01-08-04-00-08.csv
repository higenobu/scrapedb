1/8/2022,"A woman can’t believe her father-in-law hijacked her anniversary getaway. She asked Reddit’s “Am I the A******?” forum to weigh in. She and her husband planned their 25th-anniversary vacation as the honeymoon they initially missed. But then her father-in-law invited himself and a few other family members on the trip. “So my husband and I started planning for a nice trip for our 25th wedding anniversary,” she explained. “We decided on a destination, booked flights, entertainment and restaurants. I think my husband was excited, and when he spoke to his mom, he gave her all the details of our trip. “Not even an hour later, his father calls back and proceeds to invite himself and my mother-in-law to our trip. I took a deep breath, decided it wouldn’t be so awful and chose to just roll with the idea they will be going with us. “ But this wasn’t the last problem the father-in-law would cause for the couple. “Skip ahead to this month. Our trip is less than a few weeks away, and my brother-in-law calls to say he and his wife are really looking forward to the trip. WTF. I am losing my mind now asking who invited them. Do they even know it’s our anniversary?!” she said. “Turns out, my father-in-law invited them because he forgot it was our anniversary. He was sorry, but what could he do? I am no longer excited. This has turned into a family trip, and all the romantic times I was looking forward to no longer seem possible. Would I be the a****** if I just opted out of the trip completely? I am feeling really bitter and resentful towards my husband and his family.” Redditors thought the poster had a right to be upset. “Your husband needs to grow a spine,” a user said. “Your husband should have been the one to say no from the start,” another said. “Your romantic vacation should not include the whole family,” someone wrote.

1/8/2022,"An attack captured on surveillance video shows a man strangling a woman with a shoelace at a Miami International Airport bus stop as she fights for her life and another man comes to the rescue. Miami-Dade police say the man behind Sunday’s attack is Aaron Quiñones. The 27-year-old, charged with attempted murder, is in a Miami-Dade County jail on a $250,000 bond after being arrested later that day. Police didn’t release the name of the 26-year-old woman nor her condition. The video, widely shared on popular Instagram page Only in Dade, shows a dramatic 46 seconds of violence and heroism in the midst of an attack on Sunday morning at a bus stop at 3814 NW 25th St. — near where airport riders pick up their rental cars. Miami-Dade County refused to release the video to the Miami Herald. The video starts with Quiñones messing with his shoe on a bench while a woman sits nearby with her back toward him. Quiñones looks around before putting down and grabbing the shoelace, the video shows. He goes behind the woman and puts the shoelace around her neck, pulling her toward him. She tries to free herself, but Quiñones overpowers her and moves off the bench. As the struggle continues, Quiñones punches the woman while she is on the ground. He threw about 12 blows to her face and chest, the video shows. Another man suddenly comes into frame, wearing a a blue shirt, peacefully positioning himself between Quiñones and the woman. As Quiñones continued to beat her, the good Samaritan moved to grabbing him and trying to pull him off her. Quiñones refused to let her go. Then the video ends. Quiñones does not have a permanent address listed, but police noted that he lives in Miami. In January 2020, he was charged with “assault on a female” in North Carolina, according to Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office records. “We will vigorously defend Mr. Quiñones in court.” Richard De Maria, executive chief assistant with the public defender’s office, said Wednesday via email. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava’s office refused to release the video, citing a state law that allows public entities to withhold records that reveal information about security systems.",U.S./Miami Herald,Watch: Video shows man strangling woman with a shoelace at Miami airport bus stop,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-video-shows-man-strangling-171306232.html
1/8/2022,"Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor professed not to be able to understand the distinction between federal authority and state police powers during oral arguments in a consolidated case before the court on Friday morning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) rule states that employers of 100 or more workers must either require employees to be vaccinated, or force unvaccinated employees to submit to weekly testing and masking in the workplace. Both the National Federation of Independent Business and the state of Ohio are suing to end the OSHA vaccine or test mandate. Critics, including the plaintiffs, submit that the rule represents federal and bureaucratic overreach. On Friday morning, Sotomayor expressed her dissatisfaction and puzzlement at that critique. “I’m not sure I understand the distinction why the states would have the power [to institute a mandate such as OSHA’s], but the federal government wouldn’t,” stated the associate justice. When Ohio solicitor general Ben Flowers began to explain that the federal government lacks police powers, Sotomayor cut him off, exclaiming that that it has “power with respect to protecting the health and safety of workers. ” “We have accept[ed] the constitutionality of OSHA,” continued Sotomayor, who eventually insisted that the federal government has “a police power to protect workers,” over Flowers’s objections. Those objections are rooted in the Tenth Amendment, which states that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” In constitutional law, these are frequently referred to as “police powers,” and refer to efforts to regulate the health, safety, and morals of the populace. Later in the oral arguments, Justice Clarence Thomas asked Flowers if he believed the state of Ohio could impose a mandate like OSHA’s in an effort to clarify the meaning and role of police powers. Flowers answered in the affirmative, even going so far as to argue that Ohio could mandate vaccination for all of its residents. Thomas finished the exchange by noting that “there seems to be a suggestion that this is all-or-nothing, that the other governmental bodies do not have police powers to regulate certain activities.” Justice Neil Gorsuch later waded into the debate as well, asserting that “we have all kind of come to the point where we all agree that states have a wide police power under our constitutional system. Congress has to regulate consistent with the commerce clause,” before going on to note that Congress is required to legislate on major questions, rather than delegating that decision-making authority to federal agencies.

1/8/2022,"On Friday, Virginia Spencer became the first North Carolina defendant in the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol to be sentenced. Now the Pilot Mountain mother of five will be the first to spend time in prison. A year and a day after the unprecedented attack on the country’s democracy, a federal judge in Washington sentenced Spencer to three months in custody, three years’ probation and $500 in restitution. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly credited Spencer with not being violent during her family’s 30-minute stay inside the Capitol. But she said Spencer’s mere presence gave support to hundreds of protesters who fought police, marauded through the building and left parts of the Capitol in ruins. Kollar-Kotelly also questioned Spencer’s parenting decision to bring her 14-year-old son to the violence, which the judge called “a complete lack of judgment on your part.” “This must have been a traumatic experience to witness,” Kollar-Kotelly said. “I sincerely hope he is alright.” The hearing was held remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic enveloping the country. On the phone lines, participants could hear someone sobbing as the hearing came to an end.
