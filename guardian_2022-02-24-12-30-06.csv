2/24/2022,"The rising rate at which Australian children are being admitted to hospital for serious food allergies has flattened since infant feeding guidelines were changed, new research shows. The rate of hospitalisation for food anaphylaxis has increased in Australia in recent decades – but data suggests that changes to allergy prevention and infant feeding guidelines in 2008 and 2016 have helped to stem the rise in young children and teenagers.  In 2008, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy guidelines were changed to recommend that allergenic solid foods should no longer be delayed, and in 2016 they were again updated to suggest such foods should be introduced in the first year of life. Study co-author Prof Mimi Tang, an immunologist at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, said the greatest benefit of the updated guidelines was in children aged one to four. In this age group, the researchers found that the yearly rate of increase in anaphylaxis admissions dropped from 17.6% between 1999 and 2007 to 6.2% between 2008 and 2015, and to 3.9% after 2016. In the first two periods, the annual rate of increase in children aged five to nine dropped from 22% to 13.9%, and after 2016 the rate of increase was -2.4%. For 10- to 14-year-olds, the annual rate of increase dropped from 18.0% between 2008 and 2015 to 10.8% after 2016. Tang said there had been important changes to allergy prevention advice in the last 15 years. “Prior to 2008, all of the food allergy … prevention guidelines around the world were advising to delay the introduction of allergenic foods such as egg, milk and peanut until the ages of somewhere between two and four, depending on the food,” she said. “The reason these recommendations were in place was based on theoretical concerns that the gut barrier was perhaps not as strong in young babies.” But a growing body of evidence showed that delaying allergenic foods was associated with an increased risk of developing food allergies. In 2015, a randomised controlled trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that introducing peanuts into the diet between the age of four and 11 months drastically reduced the chances of developing a peanut allergy by age five. That research “provided for the first time the highest-level evidence that earlier introduction could prevent food allergy”, Tang said. “Subsequent to that there were other studies showing similar findings for egg and milk allergies.” In the new study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Tang and her colleagues noted an ongoing increase in anaphylaxis hospitalisation rates in teenagers aged 15 and older at the time the research was completed. People in this age group were born before the 2008 changes to the Australian guidelines. “We actually only saw flattening of rates in the children that could have benefited from the timing of these updates,” Tang said. There was, however, an acceleration in the year-on-year rate of increase for children aged one year and younger. “Children with food allergy typically react when they have eaten the food for the first time,” Tang said. The finding in infants suggests “that first exposure is happening in the first year of life rather than beyond”, she said. “But if you look at zero- to four-year-olds, in that cohort overall the rates are flattening. So whatever flattening is occurring with the one- to four-year-olds, it’s greater than the increase in the under ones,” she said. Overall, annual food anaphylaxis admission rates in children and teenagers increased ninefold in Australia between 1999 and 2019. “There are many things in the environment that may be contributing to the rise in food allergies,” Tang said. Such factors potentially include changing diet and exposure to a narrower range of microbes.",News/Society,"New guidelines helping stem the tide of serious allergies in Australian children, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/24/new-guidelines-helping-stem-the-tide-of-serious-allergies-in-australian-children-study-finds
2/24/2022,"Advice that most members of state executive of the New South Wales Liberal party would cease to hold office next Monday would do “significant violence” to the principles of the party, the state’s supreme court has heard. On Thursday, the chief justice of the supreme court in equity, Julie Ward, reserved her decision in an urgent case which will determine the future of the NSW branch of the Liberal party.  However Ward noted Monday’s crucial deadline, when the state executive of the party – the equivalent of the board of a company – arguably ceases to exist. A bitter factional war over preselections has paralysed the NSW party’s state executive, resulting in the Liberals not having endorsed candidates in nine important seats just weeks before an expected federal election in May. It has also prompted a constitutional crisis that has cast doubt on the division’s future, and prompted the federal party to consider a takeover. The urgent hearing, brought by one elected member of the state executive, Matthew Camenzuli, is seeking a declaration that members of the state executive can continue in office beyond Monday 28 February despite the annual general meeting of the party having been postponed to March. If Ward decides the state executive members cease to hold office, the federal division will step in and take control, giving the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a much greater say over who becomes candidates. If Camenzuli wins his case the state division continues to operate with its state executive in place, but there is no certainty that the gridlock over preselections will be resolved easily. Camenzuli and his supporters in the party want to see the local branches given the right to hold preselection ballots, where branch members choose the candidates, as the constitution of the party now requires. But time is running out. Factional organisers have been attempting to negotiate a deal that would see candidates appointed administratively, but have struggled to get 90% of the 28-member executive to agree to the carve-up of seats, as is required. The centre-right faction – that of Morrison and his representative on the state executive, Alex Hawke – appear to be supporting a federal intervention. Hawke, who has been named as first defendant in the case, had a lawyer present at proceedings on Thursday but did not make submissions. Ward heard detailed argument about the Liberal party of NSW’s constitution and what should happen if it fails to hold its annual general meeting. Last Thursday the NSW director, Chris Stone, presented legal advice to state executive stating that if it did not hold an annual meeting by the end of February they would soon be in breach of their constitution. Counsel for Camenzuli, Scott Robertson SC, said the interpretation advanced in Thursday’s legal advice would result in the ex-officio (appointed) members of the state executive remaining, while those elected by the 500-member state council were terminated. This, Robertson argued, “did significant violence” to the principles of the party. Nicholas Bender, who appeared in the capacity of “friend of the court” to argue the alternate view in the earlier legal advice, said the ex-officio members would continue, but it was clear the constitution did not allow for the elected members to continue. He said it was possible under his construction that a much smaller state executive could continue to meet and still have a valid quorum for an AGM of state council. Ward has reserved her decision.",News/Australia news,Supreme court to rule on future of NSW Liberal party branch by Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-to-rule-on-future-of-nsw-liberal-party-branch-by-monday
2/24/2022,"When Jin from the superstar boyband BTS released Super Tuna – an upbeat song about his favourite pastime, fishing – it instantly went viral. The track, written to commemorate the star’s birthday, has logged more than 53m YouTube views since December, and on TikTok the #SuperTuna hashtag has inspired a viral dance challenge.  With the popularity of groups such as BTS and the girl group Blackpink, which have international fanbases that number in the tens of millions, K-pop dominates pop culture far beyond its South Korean homeland. As the significance of the industry intensifies, so too does the importance of the teams that power K-pop – the creators behind every act responsible for music, fashion, choreography and more. Bumzu is among them. The 30-year-old solo artist turned songwriter-producer, who co-produced Super Tuna, has emerged as one of the industry’s most influential people in K-pop. Seventeen, his biggest act, has sold more than 10m albums in South Korea and had four No 1 hits on Billboard’s World Albums chart. Bumzu has also worked on tracks for other big names including Nu’est, Shinee, Rain and 2PM. “Frankly, I feel a lot of pressure. There are many times when that pressure gnaws away at me. But it’s also true that this feeling drives me to become stronger again,” said Bumzu, whose real name is Kye Beom-joo. K-pop forms part of a multibillion-dollar industry that has become one of South Korea’s most valuable cultural products, with the country’s content industry exporting a record $11.92bn in 2020. The popularity of K-pop continues to grow amid the rise of the Korean Wave, which also includes film, TV, food and beauty. On top of being a cultural phenomenon, it has also emerged as an important source of political soft power for South Korea – and one of fanbased activism in support of causes ranging from climate action to human rights. Yet even Bumzu struggles to pinpoint the reasons for K-pop’s global appeal. “It’s like asking why barbecue is so delicious and being told it’s because there’s meat,” Bumzu jokes. “I don’t think we can define K-pop by just a few factors. We just make music that moves the heart.” Bumzu grew up in Seoul, surrounded by music. A talented child violinist, he was already thinking up tunes and lyrics in his head at the age of five. His older brother was passionate about music and filled the house with equipment, which left a lasting impression on Bumzu. He wasn’t allowed to touch anything for fear he would break it, so he began working part-time jobs and saving money to buy his own equipment. He explored music production using computer software, not too far removed from the techniques he uses today. Bumzu was fascinated with visual kei – a mixture of glam rock, metal and punk popular in Japan since the 80s. Later he fell in love with hip-hop, making beats and singing over them, and also R&B, listening to Boyz II Men and Brian McKnight on a loop. By high school, he was determined to become a musician. In Seoul’s hip university district of Hongdae, he became active in the underground music scene. “At the time, we called it underground. Most of the people who made music there are now creating what the public calls K-hip-hop. It’s no longer underground,” he says. Bumzu’s career as a singer took off after competing in the television talent show Superstar K in 2012. Despite not making it to the end, he gained popularity and released his first EP a year later. He joined Pledis Entertainment – an agency recently acquired by the parent company of Big Hit Music, which is behind BTS – and began working as a vocal coach for a group of young trainees who later became Seventeen. Bumzu was responsible for Seventeen’s first hit, Adore U, about a teenage boy’s innocent love confession. “As I composed the song, I thought that this would be the perfect debut single for a group,” Bumzu says. “It helped me develop and refine my style.” Most of Bumzu’s day is spent writing songs for artists, working in the studio and attending meetings. There are few breaks. He is constantly interacting with other producers, artists and label representatives. “We live in an era of collaboration and open communication, and nobody can accomplish everything or shine alone. I have a team to strengthen my expertise, and I always consult professionals in other areas,” he says. One of the most important parts of Bumzu’s job is to give each act a unique sound. “Every band, every artist, has their own style, direction or goal,” he says. “The most important topic we worry about every day is the unique flair, the colour of this artist, this team.” With Seventeen, Bumzu works closest with band member, close friend and gym buddy Woozi, who co-writes and co-produces many of the group’s discography. “He’s a very talented artist and songwriter,” Bumzu says. “We share ideas, discuss a lot and complement each other’s techniques. “I once asked Seventeen member Hoshi to think of the choreography first. We then worked on the rhythm from it and then the melody after that. I don’t have a fixed order.” Bumzu says the composition of a song starts and ends with inspiration, which can come from anything. “There are times when I make track ideas and melodies in my head while holding dumbbells at the gym,” he says. “I feel like I’m in the same boat with the singers I produce for. We know that teamwork is important and everyone tries to go in one direction. If I row the opposite way, we can’t sail where we want to go. Even a small paddle can have a big impact.”",News/World news,From tuna fishing to teen love: the producer behind K-pop’s biggest stars ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/bumzu-producer-behind-k-pops-biggest-stars-south-korea
