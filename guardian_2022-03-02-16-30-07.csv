3/2/2022,"What’s more poignant than an unopened letter, with all its needs unanswered and its expressions unseen? It’s a missive made for intrigue, as well as an invitation to voyeurism few could resist. Small wonder director Keith Maitland and veteran film producer Ed Pressman centered their new documentary, Dear Mr Brody, on a trove of unread letters that came into Pressman’s possession and that he found so compelling, he has preserved them for more than five decades now. “Each letter is a life,” the producer said. “Opening them is like peeking behind a curtain into somebody’s private story,” Maitland added. In this case, there are tens of thousands of them – all inspired by the same event. The epistolary explosion occurred at the start of 1970 during a media frenzy that quickly fizzled into forgotten history. Fifty-two years ago, a shaggy-haired 21-year-old from suburban New York named Michael Brody Jr organized a press conference to announce his intent to give away his entire inheritance (a purported $25m) by distributing it among all those souls in need. The only thing potential beneficiaries had to do to qualify for part of the money was to send a letter to Brody explaining why they were worthy. Reporters at the time could easily verify that Brody did indeed come from significant wealth, as heir to a margarine fortune. But just how much money he had coming to him, and his true motivation for giving it all away, was far from clear. Regardless, the outlandishness of his promise, and the tsunami of entreaties that followed, inspired massive coverage, including a front-page article in the New York Times and a profile on Walter Cronkite’s powerful TV news show. It helped that Brody fit the ideal image of the earnest hippie of the day, especially when paired with his doe-eyed young wife, Renee. “Together, they looked camera ready for an album cover,” said Maitland. In fact, RCA Records signed them to a deal that resulted in a single (a cover of Dylan’s You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere, backed by a Brody original, titled The War is Over). The couple even got to perform a song on the top entertainment program of the day, The Ed Sullivan Show. The more garish elements of Brody’s story, which became increasingly crazy and disturbing as they unfolded, lend the documentary intrigue. But the emotional content of the letters, and the stories behind them, wind up turning Dear Mr Brody into a surprisingly nuanced and moving peek into the human soul. It’s those elements that both inspired Pressman to preserve the notes and Maitland to create a film around them. “Normally, cartons of unopened letters are just rubbish,” Pressman said. “My wife would constantly say, ‘get rid of these boxes!’ And some of the letters were pretty superficial. But others were very deep and thought-provoking.” How a large number of those letters came into Pressman’s possession speaks to the theatrical nature of the story. A pioneer of independent movie production starting with some of the early films of Brian De Palma, Pressman was always on the hunt for material suitable for the big screen. Intrigued by the improbability of Brody’s tale, he acquired the letters in the 70s as research material for a possible dramatization. A screenplay was commissioned and actor Richard Dreyfuss was attached to play the title role. But the project never got off the ground. Neither did another proposed work based on Brody’s life written by one of his childhood friends. More than 40 years passed before the story attracted new interest. Pressman’s associate, Melissa Robyn Glassman, became fascinated by the letters and decided to inaugurate a new Brody biopic. For pitch materials, she hired an old friend, photographer Sarah Wilson, to shoot a collage of the missives. Things changed direction, however, once Wilson’s husband (director Maitland) saw the letters and became obsessed. “My first instinct was to ask what happened to the people who wrote them?” he said. “Did they survive their travails and achieve their dreams? Did those aspiring entrepreneurs start that business? Did the children wind up taking care of their grandparents?” Maitland felt the scope of the letters could best be captured in a documentary. “The range of them would be difficult to portray in fictionalized form,” he said. “But a documentary could lean into that by tracking down some of the people who’d written them.” Finding them, 50 years on, turned out to be no mean feat. The documentarians began their search by looking through old school records and land and vehicle ownership certificates. But, Maitland said, “a lot of these people were writing from abject poverty so they didn’t leave much of a paper trail”. More, many of the writers had died over the past five decades. Others specifically wrote at the end of their letters, “Please don’t tell anyone about this.” Maitland said he honored all those written requests, except in one case where a woman’s daughter said it was OK to have her late mother’s letter read on camera. Once the documentarians hit pay dirt and started to locate lots of writers, many shunned them, assuming they were being targeted for a scam. Others simply didn’t want to look back at a time in their lives of deep need. Luckily, many were eager to make the trip back. When some of them read their old words aloud on film, they’re moved to tears. In looking through hundreds of letters, Maitland estimated that about 70% of the writers expressed a genuine need. Some of the writers didn’t even ask for money for themselves but instead simply encouraged Brody to keep going with his mission. As for Brody’s intent with the giveaway, Maitland believes it was largely sincere. He also believes it was profoundly naïve in a way that echoed common hippie ideals of the day. Likewise, the messianic aspect of his mission offered a benign corollary to the preposterous promises cult leaders tended to make in that era. It also mirrored the many dramatic depictions of freely distributed wealth, from the 1950s American TV series The Millionaire to the 1969 film The Magic Christian. On a personal level, Brody’s act reflected psychological issues that dated back to his childhood. His mother died when he was very young and his father, whom Maitland describes as “kind of a playboy”, was largely absent from his life. Friends said that Brody was profoundly lonely as a teenager and wealth did little to ease that. “Even with money, he knew that you could have a hole in your heart,” said Maitland. “That’s what he was trying to fill (with this event).” Almost as soon as he made his announcement, things started to go off the rails, exacerbated by the recreational drugs Brody was using at the time, a profound lack of sleep and the orgy of media attention that both inflated and mocked him. The film reveals far more upsetting things about Brody’s life from that time and afterwards. But, Maitland noted, he did wind up giving away hundreds of thousands of dollars to deserving people. The director believes Brody’s act gave many people an important vehicle for expression they otherwise wouldn’t have had. “When we opened the letters, we kept seeing people writing ‘thank you for what you’re doing,’” Maitland said. “They’d write ‘even if you don’t send me money, I feel better just because I wrote all this down.’ Michael held up a mirror to people and gave them the opportunity to look in it.” While that look may not have lasted long, it did spread wide. Maitland estimates that up to half a million letters were sent, though many were lost or destroyed over time. More than 30,000 of them are in Pressman’s trove, while another 150,000 remain in a storage unit owned by Brody’s son. Among Pressman’s letters, the film-makers opened and read over 12,000 for consideration in the film. Maitland believes the missives have historical value since they capture a specific time and mindset in the culture. Columbia University clearly agrees because it has accepted Pressman’s donation of his letters for their public archive. Maitland said that his team dismissed other archives that had expressed interest in the letters because they insisted that they remain pristinely unopened. By contrast, Columbia will allow any member of the public to “sign in as a researcher, put on a pair of white gloves and continue opening letters,” Maitland said. “I really look forward to hearing what people find. We’ve always said that the best letter, the one that’s going to change everything, is still waiting to be opened.” Dear Mr Brody is released at the Quad in NYC and the Laemmle Monica in LA on 4 March and on Discovery+ later this year with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,Dear Mr Brody: how a 21-year-old millionaire started a media frenzy,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/02/dear-mr-brody-millionaire-media-frenzy
3/2/2022,"People in Tigray are dying due to a lack of oxygen and medicines, a doctor at the region’s largest hospital has said, as medics struggle to care for the sick amid frequent electricity blackouts and fuel shortages. As the 16-month conflict between Tigrayan forces and Ethiopian government forces drags on, the isolated northern region of 5.5 million people continues to suffer under what the UN has called a de facto blockade. Staff at the Ayder referral hospital in Mekelle, the regional capital, said they were losing patients who would have otherwise lived. “Patients die. Every day we hear about patients dying because of a lack of oxygen, a lack of this drug, that drug,” the doctor, who could not be named for security reasons, told the Guardian. Speaking during a rare moment of internet connectivity, he said the wider region was suffering similar problems. That morning, he said, doctors from the northern town of Adwa had told him their hospital, which had “survived looting and destruction” during the early months of the war, was now struggling to keep infants alive. “They said: patients are dying because of a lack of oxygen, a lack of electricity and they cannot keep the babies breathing. The machines are failing. So they were asking for help but we told them we cannot do anything,” he said. The World Health Organization has said that, from July until last month, it had been unable to get medical supplies into Tigray, and although some have trickled in, doctors and aid workers said they were nowhere near enough to meet the needs of a population deprived of essentials for months. The Ethiopian government has rejected the UN’s assertion that it has in effect blockaded Tigray. It said military offensives by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), most recently in northern Afar, had blocked delivery routes. The government of Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, has also accused TPLF fighters of looting equipment and medicines from health facilities in parts of the Amhara and Afar regions that they controlled during the fighting last year. According to Amnesty International, TPLF fighters looted a hospital in the Amhara town of Nifas Mewcha last summer, as well as medical clinics in the town of Kobo and village of Chenna. The TPLF has previously denied looting health facilities. Amid the claims and counterclaims of their leaders, however, it is civilians who are suffering. At Ayder, a 500-bed hospital, staff are desperate for many of the most basic medical supplies, including gauze, intravenous fluids and linen-cleaning agents. Despite deliveries by the International Committee of the Red Cross in January and February – the organisation’s first since September – doctors are still reusing gloves for everything except surgery and childbirth, the source said. The region’s chronic lack of fuel – no humanitarian agency has been allowed to bring in any since August, apart from two fuel trucks in November – is taking its toll on the hospital. One major headache has been that the diesel generator used during power cuts requires about 2,000 litres of fuel to run for 24 hours. “That has become impossible,” said the doctor. “So we’re trying to use very small generators that can use a small amount of fuel and even that is becoming a real problem. So again, downsizing the service, day by day, that’s what we’ve been doing.” The WHO said the lack of fuel had hampered its efforts to distribute supplies – the first it had been permitted to deliver to Tigray since July. About 33.5 tonnes of medical stocks have been airlifted into Mekelle in recent days, but most remain in storage because there is no fuel to transport them. Staff at Ayder said they had sent their own lorry to pick up their share of the supplies on Monday. The doctor and his colleagues have many worries, but chief among them is the fate of their cancer patients, as the hospital has worked its way through even the last stocks of expired chemotherapy drugs and there are none left. “Cancer patients are really suffering,” the doctor said. “We ask them to wait and wait and they keep on coming back, especially now [some] drugs are coming to Mekelle and almost everyone ran to the hospital asking if their drugs arrived. But again, to their disappointment, we told them we have no change at all.” With no more diagnostic tests in the hospital, the doctor said he was also concerned for people with HIV/Aids, particularly children. “We cannot make a diagnosis of HIV in children. So care is significantly compromised,” he said. Without treatment, up to half of infants infected with HIV die within their first two years. The Ayder is believed to be the only place in Tigray that still has antiretroviral drugs, but its stock would only last a month, possibly less, the doctor said. The hospital has seen a big increase in children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, with admissions in the past seven months tripling compared with pre-war levels, according to hospital data. Of 208 children admitted since July, 21 had died, a second doctor at Ayder said. Staff fear that the situation in rural Tigray is even worse. In January, the UN World Food Programme warned that at least 2 million people in Tigray were suffering from “an extreme lack of food”. “What’s peculiar about the malnutrition that we’re seeing nowadays is that previously this was from poor families,” the doctor said. “But now even those living in bigger cities like ours, and who used to have reliable monthly income, are now having problems with banking because people cannot withdraw the money that they have deposited in both government and private banks.” He realised how widespread the problem had become, he said, when several of Ayder’s doctors brought their own children in to be treated. “That really broke our heart,” he said. “We never thought we would see this.” Aside from the struggles of their patients, the hospital’s 2,000-strong staff have their own problems: they have not been paid, they said, since May. Ayder’s staff hope that, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the international community will not forget about Tigray. “There are lots of issues for the world, of course, but we are members of the human community,” the doctor said. “We hope some people somewhere will care about our story.”",News/Global development,Patients dying as conflict prevents supplies reaching Tigray hospitals,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/02/patients-dying-as-conflict-prevents-supplies-reaching-tigray-hospitals
3/2/2022,"Each of the breaks listed had availability on the given dates at the time of posting This is one of the quieter high-altitude villages of the Tyrolean Paznaun region, home to Ischgl, See and Kappl. Children under-eight ski free (as do under-10s in Ischgl), the small ski area has fun features in the Bambiland kids’ zone, a kindergarten, snowparks, and night skiing, and Ischgl’s much larger ski area is a bus ride away. Good skiers can join a unique ski safari (£18 per adult, £11 child), which involves being pulled uphill by snowcat, a taxi through a mountain tunnel and a stop at the Piz Buin hotel for lunch. Don’t miss the zany sessions of skiing on wooden barrel staves which take place behind the Berghotel Rasis (£1,000 for apartment sleeping four, B&B, week from 2 April) with cafe and sauna, whose guests can freely use an adjoining sports centre with pool and waterslides. Easily reached by rail from Zurich, with a big cable car to take visitors directly up from the Betten Valley train station to the village base at 1,970 metres, beautiful Bettmeralp is a little-known gem that’s absolutely brilliant for families. Pristine and car-free, it’s part of the Aletsch Arena ski area which connects six other ski villages in the Bernese Alps. Scenic runs overlook Europe’s longest glacier – the spectacular Great Aletsch Glacier, there are toboggan runs many kilometres long, excellent resort childcare and ski schools. The tourist board website lists good value accommodation including Harmony EG, (£647 for week from 2 April, sleeping four) a small one-bedroom apartment in a chalet building. The Grand Massif has everything going for it for families: a fun ski area linking five markedly different resorts home to tree runs, wide pistes high above the tree-line with views of Mont Blanc, plus unique rocky scenery and unusual après activities. Lovely villages Morillon and Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval, and the purpose-built, high mountain resort of Flaine are options, but in bustling Samoëns Ski Solutions offers seven nights in an apartment sleeping eight at Les Chalets de Layssia (from £415 per person, self-drive including Eurotunnel, week from 2 April), which has a pool, saunas and hammam. If you fancy hitting one of the bigger ski areas, Tignes is great – not too swanky, with amazing terrain for all levels, snowparks, links to Val d’Isere and reliable snow even at Easter due to its high altitude (3,456 metres at the top of the Grand Motte lift) and glacier skiing. In Tignes 1800, a quieter enclave beside Lac du Chevril and below the main resort village, Peak Retreats offers the new Altaviva apartments (£1,800 based on five sharing, including Eurotunnel crossing, week from 2 April), which have a shared indoor pool, hot tub, hammam and sauna, and a pastry and bread delivery service. Few kids will snub the chance to gorge on pizza, pasta, cake and gelato, as is the norm in Champoluc, Aosta Valley, part of the sublime Monte Rosa area north of Turin. A fantastic family resort with a friendly ski school, excellent restaurants and steep powder-filled valleys, most of Champoluc’s pistes lie above 2,000 metres, helping snow retention, with the Matterhorn towering above. You can ski to Gressoney, and visit beautiful Alagna, renowned for its off-piste. The luxurious and traditional Breithorn Hotel (£1,013 B&B, sleeping four, week from 9 April) has a family suite, or try Ski Champoluc which tailor-makes trips to family hotels such as the Hotel Petit Tournalin (£1,281 adult, £692 child half-board in a family room for weeks between 26 March and 17 April), where the price includes a six-day lift pass, snack lunch in choice of mountain restaurants, free ski equipment for under-12s, and use of the resort minibus. The Family Ski Company’s model is the same across several French destinations – mixed-group chalets in tiny villages that connect to large resorts, such as in Ardent in Portes du Soleil, where the lift whisks you into the best part of Avoriaz. The set-up makes things easy for parents who want some kid-free time, with the kids’ club taking them from the chalet to their ski lessons, and providing fun activities in a club house afterwards. Packages run Sunday to Sunday, so guests get to ski Saturday’s quieter slopes. At the 200-year old Chalet Plagnat (£828 per adult, £679 child half-board, week from 10 April) there’s an outdoor hot tub and wine, canapes and afternoon tea are included, plus one night of babysitting on the chalet chef’s night off and transfers from Geneva. Childcare is available from £599 per week (ski lessons extra). The story of one of the most famous Alpine crossings in history by Hannibal in 218BC is brought to life with an open-air, on-slope theatrical production in Sölden on 22 April. Reminiscent of the Oberammergau Passion Play or Northumberland’s Kynren, but set on snow, the show features base-jumpers, helicopters, piste bashers and extreme athletes among its 500-strong cast, who perform next to the glacier ski area (tickets €50 per adult, €27 per child). Stay above this lively resort in the Otztzal region at Appartement Fenderhof (£930 for a self-catering apartment sleeping four, week from 16 April), which is 300 metres from a ski run and is one of dozens of good-value apartment hotels on the tourist board website Soelden.com. Another secret satellite resort where a quiet village links to a mega ski area, La Tzoumaz is a less bougie backdoor to Verbier and the rest of the Four Valleys, with their 410km of runs and superb off-piste. Fun here includes a 7km toboggan route returning from Verbier’s Savoleyres cable car back to the village, an ice rink and snowshoe raclette evenings for over-14s. The new all-wood T Resort apartments (from £611 week, sleeping four, or £950 sleeping six) are opposite the La Tzoumaz-Savoleyres cable car station. It will feel sunny and spring-like in April in the gorgeous Dolomites, where Val di Fassa, a ski area of seven resorts in the Trentino region home to 200km of slopes is the place for fab food and local wines. Staying in family-friendly Moena, a magical village below the Pale Mountains, you will be well placed for enjoying a holiday on the cusp of two seasons, driving up to ski the highest runs in the resorts in the mornings, then chilling, feasting or hiking in the afternoons. The modern SportHotel San Vigilio (£1,334 for two adults and two children half-board sharing a family room, week from 11 April) has a games room, playground and spa. A few times a year during school holidays, ski specialist UCPA runs special family ski weeks suitable for kids over seven. Everything’s included, from equipment, accommodation, all meals and six-day lift-passes to four half-days of lessons. You just have to get there. Easter options include seven nights starting 16 April at the large, chalet-style UCPA centre in Les Deux Alpes (£574pp in family room sleeping 4-6, week from 16 April) a high-altitude resort with 220km of pistes and glacier skiing to 3,421 metres, on the edge of the Ecrins national park.",Lifestyle/Travel,Family fun on the slopes: 10 of the best ski breaks for Easter 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/02/family-fun-on-the-slopes-10-of-the-best-ski-breaks-for-easter-2022
3/2/2022,"Forecasting the future is a fool’s game. Nevertheless, I would put money on the fact that, even when the apocalypse is nigh, the conservative press will never lose sight of what is really important. The ice caps are melting? Rightwingers will remind us that it is snowflakes on the left we should be worried about. The threat of nuclear war? They will explain that it is not the nukes that should keep us up at night, but the woke brigade and their pesky trigger warnings. If you think I am exaggerating, I suggest taking a look at the Daily Mail. You would think that the very real war in Ukraine might have temporarily distracted the keyboard combatants at the Mail from their obsession with the culture wars. Alas, no: the Mail seems immune to outrage fatigue. It certainly hasn’t allowed the geopolitical situation to stop it from summoning up righteous indignation at a university’s use of content warnings. The paper of regressive record is very upset about the fact that the University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland has apparently put a content warning on Ernest Hemingway’s novel The Old Man and the Sea stating that it contains “graphic fishing scenes”. Is warning students about literary violence against fish ridiculous? Yes, of course it is. I am not even going to try to argue that it isn’t. But let’s be clear: an overzealous attempt to inform students about content they may find upsetting is not something to be outraged by. Nobody has tried to ban students from reading Hemingway. Nobody is burning the book because they don’t like its message. Nobody is dropping bombs on civilians because they read a book with “graphic fishing scenes”. Someone was just a little bit too worried about their students’ feelings. I don’t know about you, but the idea of living in a world where the biggest cause of outrage is people being overly sensitive sounds like a dream to me.

3/2/2022,"A lobbyist who has worked with Conservative MPs to argue that the development of as yet unproven fuel additives means it is unnecessary to phase out petrol and diesel engines is the director of a firm developing such products, it has emerged. Howard Cox, who runs the FairFuelUK campaign, is heavily involved with the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair fuel, which recommended last year that ministers urgently look at fuel additives, saying these reduced emissions by more than 50%. An investigation by the environmental research group DeSmog has found that Cox is one of two directors of a company called Ultimum, which markets an additive that it describes as “the 21st-century vehicle emissions solution”. Cox was heavily involved in the all-party group report, which argued that the government should drop its proposed ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030, citing a series of reasons. His commercial interest was not listed. The other Ultimum director is the former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, who works with a motorcycling campaign group and was quoted in the report. Cox told the Guardian he rejected any conflict of interest, saying he supported fuel additives, known as catalysts, anyway and was unlikely to make any money from the venture. However, the revelation raises more questions about the connections of some Conservative MPs who are vocally querying the government’s net zero and wider green policies, including the phasing out of petrol and diesel vehicles. Craig Mackinlay, the Conservative MP who chairs the all-party group on fair fuel, also heads the new Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), which climate scientists have accused of seeking to derail green policies by arguing they are too damaging to the cost of living. A series of other NZSG members are either also members of the all-party fair fuel group or gave supportive quotes for the report, including the Tory MPs Robert Halfon, Steve Baker, Philip Davies, Karl McCartney and Andrew Bridgen, and the peer Peter Lilley. The all-party group, which is funded by the logistics and freight industry, has worked closely with Cox in successfully pushing for fuel duties to remain frozen since 2010. There is also controversy about claims Cox has made for additives in general and for the one his company is marketing. The Ultimum5 website says it reduces nitrogen oxides emissions by between 22% and 94%, and particulate matter by 25% to 100%. The results are based on what the company called “real-life field tests” in countries including the UK, US and South Africa, although it is not clear who carried out the tests. Alastair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York and an expert on air quality, said additives could help improve engine performance and had been used for decades. “However, they come at a cost, from the extraction of the raw materials through to the synthesis of chemicals, their packaging, sales costs and so on,” he said. “What is often lacking, however, is quantitative data that shows just how much of an improvement they bring. Small marginal gains in environmental performance in the engine could be wiped out by the full lifecycle cost of making the additive. The marketing of additives often includes lengthy descriptions of plausible-sounding chemistry, but virtually never includes independent test data that shows improvements in performance in the real world.” Macklinlay said he was aware of Cox’s involvement in the company, adding: “His activism with FairFuelUK is completely unrelated in my view and not linked to potential profit elsewhere.” In a statement, Cox said: “There is no conflict of interest whatsoever. I asked the APPG to include in the fossil-fuelled car 2030 ban report, to put into the public domain as a logical recommendation from thousands of FairFuelUK supporters, the need to look at alternative solutions to lowering emissions and to reduce fuel consumption. “I personally felt so strongly that the government are ignoring practical, effective, available ways to improve air quality, I chose to put my effort into one of the more promising fuel catalysts. No money has been invested or any money taken out or likely to be.” Cox said he was being targeted for unfair personal attacks “by ignorant DeSmogites”.",News/Environment,Lobbyist opposed to UK petrol cars ban is director of fuel additive firm,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/lobbyist-opposed-to-uk-petrol-cars-ban-is-director-of-fuel-additive-firm
3/2/2022,"For most of my life, I have been a terrible cook. Some people say they are terrible cooks then whip up a perfectly palatable meal for four. I have given myself food poisoning, twice. My regular diet used to include microwaved scrambled eggs, children’s lunchbox cheeses, tinned lentils mixed with tinned tomatoes, bowls of garden peas, and the “complete food” powder Huel. I alternated between the same two dinners for nearly a year, and the same sad desk lunch for two years. In short, I scavenged like a raccoon. I wrote cooking off as “not my thing” alongside, say, basketball. And I am not alone. According to a 2014 YouGov survey of 10,000 Britons, one of the largest ever conducted about food, 10% of us cannot cook a thing – equating to 5 million people. A smaller survey in 2018 found that 25% of respondents could only make three dishes (including boiled egg and soldiers, and porridge). I had accepted my limitations in the kitchen – then, last year, something changed. Now, after just a few mental shifts, I would go so far as to say that I am pretty good at cooking. No one is more surprised than me, except maybe friends who I have cooked for. For most people, the below will be obvious. For the raccoons: read on. James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, writes that behaviour change starts with identity change. To create new habits, “you need to start believing new things about yourself”. See if you can identify the source of your belief that you are someone who can’t cook. You might uncover a false assumption – for example, that you don’t deserve to enjoy food, that any time not spent working is wasted, or that cooking is anti-intellectual or even women’s work. With attitudes to food shaped in childhood, these retrograde ideas can be insidious. The novelist Hanya Yanagihara recently said that she “deliberately never learned” to cook as a teenager for fear of being trapped in the domestic sphere; I suspect my own historical resistance was similar. But it is exhilarating to realise that your identity is not fixed. Start by deciding that you can cook, “then prove it to yourself with small wins”, writes Clear. “I think we always underestimate our capacity for change,” says Signe Johansen, author of Solo: The Joy of Cooking for One. “But it is life-affirming to think: ‘I’m capable of adapting and evolving.’” Part of the reason I have been able to go so long without knowing how to cook is that for several years I lived with a friend who enjoyed taking charge in the kitchen. He made dinner; I did the dishes – everyone was happy. But it also made me complacent. When my flatmate went away, I lived on leftovers, knowing he would soon be back. And when I did cook, once every week or two, I did not dare deviate from the basics for fear of presenting him with an inedible dinner. (This happened anyway – “only three or four times”, he says.) Practising my cooking felt a bit like practising my French with a native speaker who is also fluent in English: insisting on imposing my incompetence on others, at the expense of everyone’s enjoyment. But muddling through one meal every couple of weeks is simply not enough to build momentum. So if someone else handles the cooking in your household, ask them to take a week or two off, for the sake of your self-development. If the worst comes to the worst, you can buy them a takeaway. Unsurprisingly, my breakthrough with cooking came when I moved out to live by myself. In setting up my own pantry, I quickly discovered that my flatmate’s essentials – pickled things, salty fish, hard cheeses, hot sauces – were completely different from mine. After four months of living alone, I have learned that I cannot be without Greek yoghurt, kale, cannellini beans, peanut butter, sour cream, chilli flakes, spinach and frozen chapati breads. Seeing my staples, when I look in the fridge or cupboard, means I feel more capable and inspired – and I would not have known what they were had I not been forced to find out. It is the same for tools and equipment: I can’t be without a blender; I don’t think my flatmate ever used one. Self-help guru and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss surveyed more than 100,000 of his (mostly male) Facebook fans to discover what turned them off cooking and found an array of reasons: too many ingredients or tools, intimidating skills, different dishes finishing at different times, standing at the stove, food waste. By addressing the one that is most off-putting to you, your wins will come easier. For me, it’s my tendency to get distracted, especially if I am reading a recipe on my phone. I will flick to another browser tab and forget to stir, or put a pan on a high heat then wander off. The result is a dish that tastes like burnt pan bottom. Then I got a smart speaker. The ease with which I can set timers, convert units and add to my shopping list has been a gamechanger for keeping me on track. Combined with a few cookbooks, I can now put my phone in another room as I cook, and meals hardly ever get burned. Whenever I tried to motivate myself to cook, I’d find a recipe that excited me, then mess it up and be discouraged from trying again. Starting out, small wins are vital. Ferriss writes in The 4-Hour Chef, on his own transformation from human raccoon, of the importance of working within a “margin of safety” by picking recipes with plenty of room for error. The test, he says, should be: “How badly can you mangle the recipe and still get something incredible?” “Once you start to see results, that’s when the magic happens, even if it’s something really simple like scrambling eggs,” says Johansen. Not every recipe is reliable. Cookbooks have at least gone through a process of recipe-testing and copy-editing; a top Google search result can just reflect good SEO. “Frankly, there are a lot of bad recipes out there,” Johansen says. Either way, it is important to find a source that resonates with you. Cooks who wrote lyrically of textures and smells, or who saw every meal as a social celebration, actually reaffirmed my view that I wasn’t refined or gregarious enough to enjoy cooking. The first cookbook I connected with was Rukmini Iyer’s The Roasting Tin: a deserving bestseller for its ratio of preparation to payoff. Iyer tells me that she developed the traybake concept when her own enthusiasm for cooking was at an all-time low, after a bad breakup. “The effort bar was supposed to be: if you can tear the film off a ready meal, you can probably chop some sweet potato and put it in a tin.” Even that can be a step towards believing you can cook. “As long as you haven’t got a really dodgy oven, there’s very little you can mess up here,” says Iyer. “You’re not relying on standing at the stove, or your sight or [sense of] smell – all you have to do is take it out of the oven.” Once I had nailed Iyer’s broccoli and lemon orzo, I tentatively started experimenting: swapping in whatever greens I had in the fridge, or trying different stocks. Each variation taught me something about improvisation and bolstered my confidence. With a few judicious changes, you can extend your mileage from one recipe. Having learned Alison Roman’s internet-famous stew, I swapped chickpeas for butter beans, coconut milk for tinned tomatoes and turmeric for oregano, then followed roughly the same process. The result was highly edible – and a completely different meal. It is through this freestyling that you start to develop your own instincts, says Guardian writer Felicity Cloake. “My advice is to concentrate on a handful of dishes you know you like until you can make them well, and gradually adapt them to make them your own.” If the recipe calls for 45 minutes in the oven, but it looks done to you after 30 minutes, try it. If you really like garlic, double the suggested cloves and see. “It’s only through trial and error that you’ll work out how to make a dish perfect for your taste.” Indeed, for the beginner, even the easiest recipes are full of subjective or unclear language, such as “desired consistency”. It was by paying attention that I learned what corners I could and couldn’t cut. For example: it’s important that aubergines are “very finely” sliced, but you can usually fudge onions – and always save the pasta water. Relying on leftovers is often a practical necessity if you’re cooking for yourself, but if you didn’t quite pull off the recipe, leftovers taste of failure – and if you did, you may not want to repeat it once you’ve eaten it three nights in a row. More important is maintaining a rhythm. Where I used to cook once and eat it night after night, I now freeze the other portions or add an element I’ve made from scratch, so as not to break my cooking streak. Iyer, who describes herself as “not really a leftovers gal”, looks for ways to make them into a different meal – for instance, by turning odds and ends into a rissole. Even the simplest meals can be elevated above a survival mindset: in Solo, Johansen dedicates a chapter to things on toast. “That is certainly my fallback when I don’t feel like cooking, but it doesn’t mean that it can’t be delicious and nutritious,” she says. On the odd occasion that my flatmate and I threw dinner parties, the stress of preparation, timing and the implicit expectation to impress prevented me from fully enjoying the evening. And that was with my flatmate doing nearly all the cooking. Since my kitchen awakening, however, I have had friends for dinner once or twice a week. I rarely make anything fancy – just a bowl of stew or pasta, or daal eaten on our laps on the sofa; delicious and nourishing – but this is something I would not have thought I’d ever be comfortable doing. Part of scaling up in the kitchen, Johansen suggests, is finding “like-minded” people to cook for, who are less concerned about what’s on the menu than enjoying each other’s company. “People are generally very grateful to be fed,” she says. I can say with confidence, thinking of the microwaved egg and lentil tomatoes, that this would not have always been true of my food. But it feels good, having lived so long as a racoon: hand to mouth, to be able to give back now. ",Lifestyle/Food,"Can’t cook, won’t cook?

3/2/2022,"NSW authorities have warned communities at risk of major flooding in the Sydney region to prepare to evacuate as the Hawkesbury-Nepean river continues to rise. Warragamba Dam, Sydney’s main reservoir, was already spilling at a rate in excess of 70 gigalitres a day on Wednesday after torrential rainfall over its catchment exceeded earlier predictions, according to a NSW government official. The spill, which began at about 3am on Wednesday, was expected to peak on Thursday. The previous expectation of an upper range of the spill at 35oGl a day has now been lifted to match or exceed the 440Gl/ day rate experienced during the March 2021 floods. That event caused widespread damage to areas to Sydney’s north and west. Sydney Harbour holds roughly 500GL. More floodwater, too, is entering the Hawkesbury-Nepean from other tributaries than enter the floodplain below the dam. There are also concerns Redbank dam near Mudgee could burst, prompting the SES to direct people in some parts of North Richmond, in Sydney’s north-west, to evacuate. “We just recently issued an evacuation order for the area in North Richmond downstream of the Redbank dam because it may fail,” NSW SES commissioner Carlene York said. “I want all those residents to make sure they do evacuate from that area.” Authorities have also told thousands more residents who were affected by Sydney’s 2021 floods to be on standby to leave. The Bureau of Meteorology shifted its forecast to when Sydney’s heaviest falls may land, predicting 120mm to 150mm on Thursday, up from 50-70mm earlier today. Since 9am on Wednesday, the city had only collected about 10mm although inland sites were much wetter, with about 84mm up to 5pm at Richmond. The bureau has also issued a major flood warning for the Nepean and Hawkesbury Rivers. “Significant river level rises have been observed along the Nepean River where major flooding is possible from early Wednesday evening,” the bureau said. “Along the Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean Rivers major flooding is also possible from overnight Wednesday into Thursday at Penrith, North Richmond, Windsor and downstream based on forecast rainfall.” Flooding could match March 2021 flood heights, the bureau said, if rainfall overnight and into Thursday reached predicted amounts. “We are going to getting massive, like torrential rainfall,” Stephanie Heard, a spokesperson for the NSW State Emergency Service said. “We want the community to start preparing for the potential for evacuation.” “We really need to make sure that the community listens and will follow our advice,” she said. “Basically, it’s really quite a dangerous weather system that we’re seeing.” There have already been 18 flood rescues in the Sydney region by Wednesday afternoon. Rainfall totals could reach 150mm to 200mm over the Hawkesbury region, Heard said. While Sydney itself has so far been spared most of the heavy rain from the developing east coast low, inland areas including the Warragamba catchment have been receiving big falls. Ben Domensino, a senior Weatherzone meteorologist, said the rain gauge at Warragamba had collected almost 100mm from 9am to 3pm alone. By comparison, Sydney’s Observatory Hill near the CBD had only about 30mm in the 30 hours to 3pm Wednesday. The rain gauge at #Warragamba Dam has received over 120mm in the last 28 hours, with similar totals in other parts of the dam's catchment area. This includes 48mm in the last 2 hours. pic.twitter.com/y3du5u14hG “This system has continued to surprise as to the extent of the rainfall,” Domensino said, noting its evolution from a so-called “rain bomb” over south-east Queensland and northern NSW into a low pressure system near the NSW central coast. “This system at the moment is causing much heavier rain on the ranges than it is near the coast,” he said. “There’s likely to be some heavy rain near the coast especially as the low pressure system comes in overnight into Thursday morning. People who may need to be evacuated should prepare an emergency pack and gather pets, which evacuation centres will be able to accommodate, the SES’s Heard said. The kit should include key valuables but also medicare and other ID. More details can be found here.Not surprisingly given the spill from Warragamba, the dam is 100% full, WaterNSW said. The entire dam network is sitting at 99.2% and it’s likely they will all be spilling by the end of this rain event. Along with the warnings about floods and heavy rain, there are strong wind gusts and dangerous surf forecast, the latter up and down the NSW coast, the bureau said.

3/2/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray bringing you up to speed quickly but comprehensively. Ukraine’s besieged cities have come under more heavy attack as Russian commanders, facing fierce resistance, intensified their bombardment of urban areas. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has given a state of the union address in which he announced Russian flights were banned from US airspace, and vowed Vladimir Putin would pay for what he is doing. The watching Ukrainian ambassador to the US received a standing ovation from the assembled members of Congress. More on that further down. Facing emboldened Ukrainian troops bolstered by citizen soldiers, Russia has failed to capture and hold a single city since its full-scale invasion began nearly a week ago. Now, western analysts say, Russia is resorting to bombing built-up areas to try to crush fighters’ resolve. Independent analysts say they are collecting evidence of Putin’s military committing war crimes with its killing of civilians and use of cluster bombs. Here we list just some of the civilian victims. Russian paratroops landed in Kharkiv overnight and were meeting with Ukrainian resistance as they attacked a military hospital, according to reports attributed to the Security Service of Ukraine. A Russian military strike tore through two apartment blocks in the small town of Borodjanka, north-west of Kyiv. West of the capital, in the city of Zhytomyr, four people including a child were killed on Tuesday by a Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian official said. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the fighting as a miles-long Russian military convoy advances on Kyiv from the north. The Russian drive to force a Ukrainian capitulation coincides with a second round of negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials, scheduled for today. The first round, held on the Belarus border, yielded no positive results. Please keep our live blog open for further updates. ‘Putin thought world would roll over’ – Joe Biden has delivered his first state of the union address, in which he announced the US would ban Russian aircraft from its airspace and pledged to go after Russian oligarchs in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. “Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson: when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,” Biden said. “[Vladimir Putin] thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. “Instead, he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.” On domestic themes, the president said America should fight rising prices and high inflation by strengthening its supply chains – investing in American manufacturing, which would lower prices and create good-paying jobs. “Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.” Biden said the US was “moving forward safely back to more normal routines” after two years fighting Covid.

Rush to private health – Declining access to and quality of NHS care has begun to “supercharge” a drive towards Britons paying for private medical treatment, the IPPR thinktank has warned. One in six people had been prepared to go private instead of waiting, its report says, in a shift that could create a “two-tier” health system. Polling found 17% of people would go private if they faced a wait of longer than 18 weeks – the maximum time the NHS says anyone should have to wait for planned hospital treatment. Another 59% would wait for NHS care because they could not afford private, but only 10% would do so because they were opposed to private healthcare. Pay rise for MPs – Amid the cost-of-living crisis and impending national insurance increase, MPs will still get a £2,200 pay rise from next month, the parliamentary spending watchdog has ruled. The 2.7% increase in MPs’ salaries is nearly half the current rate of inflation, effectively meaning a real-terms pay cut, but comes against a backdrop of significant economic hardship for many. The Bank of England has been urging workers not to ask for big pay rises to try to stop prices spiralling out of control. Naturally there is a certain amount of outcry, including from some MPs themselves. Say hello to Southend city – “I’m bursting with pride,” said Sharon Wuyts, 45, on the day her home town, Southend-on-Sea, was granted city status. She waited four hours in drizzle on the seafront for Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, to mark the occasion by greeting the crowd. Southend was given city status after the murder of its MP, David Amess, last October. It was an issue he had campaigned on for years – he ended what turned out to be his last speech in the Commons with the words: “And of course, we must make Southend a city.” On Tuesday, Amess posthumously became the first freeman of the city of Southend at a ceremony in the civic centre attended by his widow and children and the royal couple.

Sergiy Stakhovsky says he will use a gun if necessary after the tennis player joined Ukraine’s reserve army following Russia’s invasion of the country last week. The International Paralympic Committee has admitted it will have to be “very careful” in deciding on Wednesday whether to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Winter Games. Formula One’s governing body, the FIA, has defied the prevailing opinion across sport in allowing Russian and Belarusian drivers to continue to compete, though under a neutral flag. Tyson Fury has backed Ukrainian boxers, including the Klitschko brothers, who have joined their army to defend the country against Russia.

The front page of the Guardian today goes to Shaun Walker’s report: “Desperate rush for the last train from Kyiv”. “Look at these faces around us, they are exactly the same as in the photographs from the second world war, and it’s just five days. Can you imagine what will happen in a month?” asked Tanya Novgorodskaya, 48, on the platform with her 15-year-old daughter. She had bought tickets for six different trains, but soon realised they counted for nothing. Instead, it was mothers with children first, then women, then old people. Others were kept away by the police and soldiers standing guard. Most people would not be able to board. “The siege of Kiev” says the i over a full-page photo of a tree-lined avenue strewn with wrecked armoured vehicles. The Daily Mail says “Pray for Kyiv” while the Times has “Leave now, Putin warns, as he prepares to bombard Kyiv”. The Sun calls it “Barbaric” after “Putin’s butchers blitz Nazi victims’ memorial” – that was the strike on Kyiv’s central TV tower near a Holocaust monument. “Zelensky pleads with west to prevent genocide” says the Telegraph. “Nobody will break us” – the Mirror displays a defiant Volodymyr Zelenskiy with his fist in the air. “Blitzed – but never beaten” – the Express has the same picture as well as smoke rising over Kyiv. “Shunned by the world”, says the Metro, and its front page depicts the moment nearly everyone walked out as the Russian foreign minister made a falsehood-laden big screen address to United Nations delegates. “China offers role as peacemaker” says the Financial Times, and you can read about that here.

3/2/2022,"A soldier who fought alongside Ben Roberts-Smith at the battle of Tizak where Roberts-Smith won his Victoria Cross has told the federal court he killed one of the Taliban machine gunners credited to Roberts-Smith on his official VC citation. During a dramatic and at times emotional three days in the witness box, the decorated former SAS sergeant, known before the court as Person 4, said he still believed Roberts-Smith was a deserving recipient of the Australian military’s highest honour. He said that he had “loved him like a brother”, and that he was “reluctant” to give evidence in the trial brought by his former comrade. Compelled by a subpoena to give evidence for newspapers defending Roberts-Smith’s defamation claim this week, Person 4 has told the court he saw Roberts-Smith kick an unarmed, handcuffed Afghan civilian off a cliff before ordering the badly injured man be dragged underneath a tree where he was shot dead. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for “most conspicuous gallantry” during a battle at Tizak, in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, on 11 June 2006. The court heard, in extraordinary detail, Person 4’s account of fighting side-by-side with Roberts-Smith at Tizak, pinned down by relentless machine-gun fire. “I remember a large sustained machine-gun burst tearing up the ground between myself and Ben Roberts-Smith,” he said. “I had an absolute feeling of dread and fear due to the amount of fire we were receiving. Not only accurate fire, but sustained, effective fire.” The court heard that after a first grenade thrown by Roberts-Smith failed to detonate, a second grenade thrown by a third soldier gave Roberts-Smith, supported by Person 4, a chance to storm machine-gun posts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith’s official VC citation says: “Roberts-Smith, with a total disregard for his own safety, stormed the enemy position killing the two remaining machine gunners.” Person 4 told the court he and Roberts-Smith, in subsequent discussions back in Australia, agreed that Person 4 had killed the first machine-gunner with his fire. “I 100% believe I had shot one of the machine gunners when I was providing cover for RS [Roberts-Smith].” Person 4 said the awarding of medals was “for others to determine”, and not his motivation for fighting. “That action, for me, was the highlight of my professional career purely because … I didn’t let them down. We both supported each other. We overcame overwhelming odds together.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Within days of the battle of Tizak, Person 4 said he was told he would be awarded the Victoria Cross. In days subsequent, the story from comrades in Australia changed to Roberts-Smith would be awarded the medal instead. Roberts-Smith was invested with the Victoria Cross in January 2011. It was not until 2013 – two years later – that Person 4 was ultimately awarded the Medal for Gallantry, a lesser decoration, for the same action. In court, Person 4 agreed he had been “hurt” at not receiving the same level of recognition, not for himself but for his family. “I had two children at the time of that action … it was for them. “I was upset that something as outstanding as what both Ben Roberts-Smith and myself did was politicised,” he told the court. “They could have accepted the fact both of us did as much as each other that day.” Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 4 he was resentful of Roberts-Smith’s Victoria Cross and subsequent success. “I loved him as a brother. There’s no resentment there,” Person 4 replied. “Now you hate him don’t you?” “Of course I don’t hate him. Believe me, I’m not jealous of him,” Person 4 replied. Person 4, who was medically discharged from the SAS last year after more than two decades in the military, told the court Roberts-Smith was a polarising figure within the tightknit SAS community. “There are two camps: for and against. And then there’s me in the middle. I didn’t want anything to do with the ‘against’ camp, I didn’t want anything to do with the ‘for’ camp.” On Tuesday, Person 4 said he was “reluctant” to give evidence, and had only come to court compelled by the force of a subpoena issued by the newspapers. Person 4 has given evidence this week that he saw Roberts-Smith kick a handcuffed, unarmed civilian off a cliff during an SAS raid on the village of Darwan in 2012. Person 4 told the court he had seen Roberts-Smith kick the man in the chest, “catapulting him” off the cliff: “I saw the individual smash his face on a rock, and I saw the teeth explode out of his face.” Person 4 said that after the Australian soldiers walked down a foot track to the bottom of the cliff, Roberts-Smith ordered him and another subordinate soldier to drag the man under a tree, where he was shot by the other soldier after discussion with Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court this version of events could not have happened because there was no cliff and the man killed was an enemy spotter, lawfully killed after he was encountered hiding in a field. During his three days in the witness box, Person 4 has repeatedly refused to answer questions about a 2009 SAS mission – raiding a compound called Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak – on grounds of potential self-incrimination. The court has heard evidence from another Australian soldier that during that mission Person 4 shot a captive and unarmed elderly Afghan man, found hiding in a tunnel inside the compound, on the orders of Roberts-Smith. Justice Anthony Besanko did not compel Person 4 to give evidence about Whiskey 108. Roberts-Smith has denied this killing ever took place and told the court “there were no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108”.

3/2/2022,"Detainees seen in videos allegedly showing torture in a Cairo police station inflicted their injuries on themselves, according to Egyptian authorities, who have charged the prisoners with spreading “fake news”. Up to 13 people detained in El-Salam First police station for unknown petty crimes made multiple videos that they say show the abuse they suffered at the hands of police officers and security forces. The videos recorded last November, and obtained by the Guardian, appeared to show detainees hung in a stress position, with their hands fastened behind their backs. A second video appeared to show multiple detainees talking to the camera as they pointed to their injuries, including large bruises and head wounds. After the footage was released online, Egypt’s public prosecution claimed that the detainees had “inflicted injuries on themselves”, using a coin. It added that authorities confiscated the mobile phones used to make the videos. Amr Magdi, of Human Rights Watch, who reviewed the videos for the Guardian, said: “Based on what I saw in the videos, they seemed authentic. Yet the prosecutor describes the injuries they sustained as being inflicted by the detainees themselves using a coin, which is completely illogical and doesn’t really match the kind of beating marks and wounds seen in the videos.” He said: “I find the prosecutors’ statement – disappointing doesn’t even cover it – I think the right word is a laughable attempt to cover up police abuses.” Magdi also pointed to the prosecutor’s lack of any mention of a video that showed two detainees suspended in a stress position with their arms behind their backs, something that would be nearly impossible for any detainee to do to themselves. According to a trial witness, the detainees appeared before Egypt’s supreme state security prosecution after the prosecutor’s statement, charged with belonging to a terrorist group, misusing the internet, spreading false information with the intent to undermine national security, and illegally receiving foreign funds.They have since been held in pre-trial detention. Since the Covid pandemic, hearings can be held remotely through secure TV networks that connect the court and defendants. It has made it easier to hold detainees indefinitely. President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi lauded the government’s national strategy for human rights as “a milestone in Egypt’s history” when it was launched last year. The strategy declared that “human rights are being enhanced in police institutions” and that “all forms of torture constitute a crime”, with no statute of limitations.Mohamed Lotfy, of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, a Cairo-based human rights group, said he believed the authorities cracked down hard on the detainees at El-Salam First police station to prevent other detainees from filming or broadcasting similar videos. “I think the videos made so much noise and were distributed so widely … the idea was to really hit them hard in order to set an example,” he said. “Now if a video is leaked, even if detainees send it to their family members, those family members will be worried about publishing them, as they don’t want to make the situation worse.” Aly Hussin Mahdy, an activist who broadcast the videos on his popular YouTube channel, said the Egyptian authorities’ reaction had a chilling effect in El-Salam, the area where the police station is located. “Their families can’t discuss or inquire about their sons or where they’re being held, because asking means they risk being detained or ‘disappeared’ by the Egyptian security services too,” he said.",News/Global development,Egyptians seen in jail ‘torture’ videos charged with spreading fake news,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/02/egyptians-seen-in-jail-torture-videos-charged-with-spreading-fake-news
