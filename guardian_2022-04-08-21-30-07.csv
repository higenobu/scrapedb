4/8/2022,"Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, had US green cards and were declared “permanent US residents” for tax purposes while Sunak served as chancellor. Sunak and Murty, who own a £5.5m Californian penthouse holiday home, held green cards while they lived in the US and continued to keep the status when they moved to the UK before Sunak was elected as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire in 2015. Sky News first reported that Sunak continued to hold a green card for at least a year of his chancellorship, which began in 2020. The Treasury and Murty’s personal spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. A source close to the couple said “they do not currently have green cards”, but would not say exactly when they gave up the status which requires holders to “make the US your permanent home”. The disclosure raises further awkward questions for the chancellor – who has said his multimillionaire wife had claimed non-dom status, which allows her to avoid UK tax on her foreign earnings, because she one day intended to return to live in India. Under non-dom rules, Murty does not legally have to pay tax in the UK on the estimated £11.5m in annual dividends she collects from her stake in her billionaire father’s IT business. The non-dom status may have allowed her to avoid up to £20m in UK tax. Murty has said she pays tax on the dividends overseas, but has refused to state how much she pays or in which country. She has previously collected other shareholder income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. Holders of green cards are required to pay US tax on their worldwide income – and also to make a legal commitment to “make the US your permanent home”. They are required to file annual US tax returns, and are “responsible for reporting your income and paying taxes on any foreign earned income”. Sunak earlier told the Sun that Murty “loves her country like I love mine”, and said she had always been domiciled in India. He said she was entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she was an Indian citizen and planned to move back to her home country to care for her parents. Under non-dom rules, Murty pays £30,000 a year for the right not to pay UK tax on her overseas income. The status will automatically cease once she has resided in Britain for 15 years, a milestone it is understood she will reach in 2028. Sunak insisted that Murty pays all taxes due in the UK, “and every penny that she earns internationally, for example in India, she would pay the full taxes on that”. Critics pointed out that he said Murty “would pay” full taxes on overseas income, not that she had paid it or stated how much. They also said Sunak gave India only as an example, leaving open the possibility that Murty may have paid the tax in a tax haven where no taxes would have been due. Labour’s shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the end, we have somebody who’s been living here for eight years, raising her children here, living at … Downing Street in accommodation provided by the taxpayer and aspiring to be the wife of the next prime minister, and yet she says that she isn’t a permanent resident of this country.” She pointed to the ministerial code mentioning that the financial status of ministers’ spouses is relevant because “there can be a conflict of interest”.",News/Politics,Sunak and Murty held US green cards while he was chancellor – reports,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/rishi-sunak-akshata-murty-us-green-cards

It reassembles the legacy of a Renaissance genius who lived fast and died young – from grand frescoes and tapestries to delicate drawings and intimate portraits of lovers. By the end Raphael is laid bare: his personality hovers in the gallery. Even if you don’t think you like his classical perfection, this will change your mind.

Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London, until March 2023 The National Gallery has altered the title of Edgar Degas’ drawing Russian Dancers to Ukrainian Dancers. After calls by Ukrainians on social media, the gallery said it had changed the name of the French impressionist’s turn-of-the-20th-century work, which is currently not on display. It is a pastel depicting troupes of dancers, who the artist was fascinated to see performing in Paris late in his life. The yellow and blue of Ukraine’s national colours are noticeable in what appear to be hair ribbons worn by the dancers and in garlands they are carrying. Read the full story here.

Madame Moitessier, 1856, by Jean-Auguste-Dominique IngresRaphael dominated western art for centuries after his death, his lucid classical style de rigueur in academies. In the 19th century, many artists rebelled, from the pre-Raphaelites in England to the French avant garde who broke Raphael’s rules to invent modernism. But Ingres, as this painting shows, made Raphael’s style itself “modern”. This portrait has a gravity and grace deeply indebted to the Renaissance master. Madame Moitessier seems to be a reincarnation of a Raphael, but dressed in the latest fashions of her day. The balanced, still dignity of this brilliant portrait, which took 12 years to finish, makes her monumental in her poise. Ingres was not the last artist to channel Raphael. Picasso said he could draw like Raphael when he was a child, and had to learn to draw like a kid: he proved this affinity when he had a “classical” period after the first world war, and, most movingly, in quotes from Raphael’s paintings Massacre of the Innocents and Fire in the Borgo that give Guernica its structure.

4/8/2022,"After four years of jokes, memes, acclaim, and debate about whether Protestants really do keep toasters in cupboards, the imminent final season of Derry Girls is prompting bittersweet valediction in Derry. The Channel 4 TV sitcom that became an unexpected global hit after airing in 2018 cast a warm haze over Northern Ireland’s second city that inhabitants hope will linger beyond the third season, which starts next week. The show’s wry depiction of working-class teenage girls coming of age in the 1990s reshaped perceptions of a city previously associated with the turmoil of the Troubles. It was not just outsiders who saw a different Derry – inhabitants viewed themselves differently. They hope the afterglow endures. “It’s the light that it brings. It’s Derry in colour, not in black and white,” said Greta McTague, a drama teacher at St Cecilia’s college who taught two of the show’s stars, Saoirse-Monica Jackson, who plays Erin, and Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, who plays Michelle. A city previously best known for Bloody Sunday, and often overshadowed by Belfast, was able to show a vibrant, joyous side, said McTague. “Derry Girls has put us right up there on the map. It has made this massive impact. It will leave a lasting legacy.” The sitcom found a global audience after Netflix acquired the rights. It was referenced on The Simpsons, which featured an ice-cream parlour named Dairy Girls. Some fans this week half-jokingly urged the Stormont executive to buy Channel 4, which faces being privatised, for its services to Northern Ireland. The show’s gentle mockery of sectarianism included a blackboard that characters used to list differences between Catholics and Protestants, with the former deemed to love statues and store coal in the bath and the latter deemed to love flutes and keep toasters in cupboards. The Ulster Museum in Belfast included the prop in an exhibition on cultural stereotypes. Tourists visit Derry to walk the same streets as the characters, devour Derry Girls-themed afternoon teas and take selfies at a mural on the side of Badgers Bar on Orchard Street. “Netflix has given us a global platform. It has given us a new market and a new audience,” said Odhran Dunne, the chief executive of the tourism agency Visit Derry. “The new series will open another opportunity for sites and locations.” Gleann Doherty, a guide who does a Derry Girls tour, said in 2018 he had initially expected the show to be a bleak take on the Troubles. “I thought here we go, another one. Then I sat down and watched it and it was hilarious. It shows you that there was a sense of normality. It wasn’t a normal society that we lived in but it felt normal to us.” Karl Porter, one of the artists who painted the mural, said the show captured inhabitants’ resilience and humour. “When you laugh about something it takes on a whole different context. Bad stuff happened … but we built these very strong communities.” Porter lamented the end of Derry Girls but said it was going out on a high. “They’re not dragging it out. We’ve all seen certain shows that went on and on and became repetitive.” The mural was tweaked this week so that Michelle, who originally held up two fingers in the peace sign, held up three to signify the third series. The show’s writer and creator, Lisa McGee, and cast and crew returned to Derry on Thursday night for a red carpet premiere of the new season’s first two episodes followed by a reception at the Guildhall. Derry Girls had demystified her home town to outsiders, McGee told the Guardian. “Something about comedy makes things accessible to people. It’s shown a side of the place that has not been shown an awful lot, for instance the more ridiculous elements of day to day life. It’s maybe changed the city a wee bit. It’s incredible really because it’s just a comedy.” McGee wants fresh stories to emerge. “I hope that will be the legacy of Derry Girls, that other people will write about here.” Juliette Barber, a teacher at St Cecilia’s college, said seeing two former pupils find fame and success as actors on the show had galvanised her students. “It puts their aspirations within reach. It’s no longer something that happens to ‘other people’, it has happened to someone who wore their uniform, walked their streets, and talks the way they do.”",News/UK news,‘Derry Girls put us on the map’: pride in home city as end of series nears,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/derry-girls-put-us-on-map-pride-home-city-end-series-nears
