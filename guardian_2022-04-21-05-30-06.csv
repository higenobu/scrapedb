4/21/2022,"Boris Johnson has been forced to abandon efforts to block an inquiry into whether he misled MPs over Partygate lockdown breaches, instead urging rebellious MPs to delay any investigation. Government whips scrambled on Wednesday night to derail a Labour motion designed to trigger a Commons inquiry into whether Johnson lied about rule-breaking in Downing Street – including the potential release of hundreds of damaging messages and photographs. Amid a growing backlash from Tory MPs, the government privately conceded it could not whip them to block an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee. It instead tabled a motion to delay the inquiry until after the publication of the final Partygate report by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant. Johnson’s MPs were put on a three-line whip to back the new amendment. The prime minister, who flew to India for a trade visit on Wednesday, will swerve the debate and vote on the motion on Thursday. His allies had earlier briefed that they were prepared to force Tory MPs to vote down the motion from Labour and other opposition parties. But even among frontbenchers there was palpable disquiet that MPs should be forced to block an investigation into the prime minister, who received a police fixed-penalty notice last week. One minister admitted it would be hard to justify Johnson avoiding an investigation for potentially misleading parliament, saying: “If it’s the same process every MP faces, then why should it be different for the PM?” A government spokesperson said: “The government has tabled an amendment to Labour’s motion which says that consideration of this matter should take place after the conclusion of the police investigation and the publication of the Cabinet Office [Sue Gray] report, allowing MPs to have all the facts at their disposal.” A privileges committee inquiry could be highly damaging even if Johnson is ultimately not formally censured. It would include the right to demand more than 300 photographs believed to have been collated by the original inquiry into rule-breaking by Gray, which have been passed to the Metropolitan police. Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, told the BBC he would “probably” abstain at Thursday’s vote but said he would not vote with Labour. “As much as I am deeply annoyed at what went on in No 10, I am also not in a position where I have much goodwill towards a Labour party who, in my view, failed to advance any form of arguments or raise any of its own concerns about the consequences of a 20-month lockdown.” Thursday’s motion gives four examples of Johnson assuring MPs, including him being “repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken”. The motion also says the inquiry should begin after the conclusion of the Met investigation, with Johnson expected to receive at least three more fines for breaches in the coming weeks. Labour sources said they had drafted the motion to allow the least possible wriggle room for Tory MPs. “This is not our first rodeo,” a senior aide said. “They’re looking for a life raft to try and desperately hold on to.” A former Tory minister insisted they would refuse to vote against the motion unamended, saying: “How can I say he’s completely innocent but there’s no need for an investigation to prove it?” Another MP said he had warned whips there would be at least 30 abstentions unless they devised an off-ramp. A number of Conservative MPs said they had privately urged whips to come up with a solution. “It’s untenable for me to vote to block an investigation if I’m to defend the PM with my constituents,” a backbencher said. Some had urged Johnson to get ahead of Starmer’s ploy by referring himself to the privileges committee to dispel suggestions of another cover up. “If you can’t escape it, you might as well get on the front foot,” said one. Government sources said that option had been rejected. But throughout Wednesday MPs continued to make the argument that Johnson should allow the investigation to take place. A former cabinet minister asked: “How on earth could anyone oppose it?” They said the government should wave the motion through and then “kill it off” in the committee. Labour also moved to blunt arguments from the Tory whips that a Partygate inquiry would be prejudiced because it would be chaired by Labour’s Chris Bryant, a fierce critic of the prime minister. One MP said Johnson had dubbed it “the Bryant committee”. On Wednesday Bryant recused himself from any future inquiry because of his past comments criticising Johnson. The Guardian understands Bryant went to see Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 group, on Wednesday and told him he would recuse himself, prompting relief among backbench Tories that they could vote for the motion. In an open letter to colleagues, Bryant said he believed he would have been able to chair the inquiry fairly but that it was important for the committee to be seen to proceed “without any imputation of unfairness”. Labour sources said Bryant’s recusal had damaged Johnson’s argument that the proposed investigation was entirely politically motivated. The Tory MP Bernard Jenkin is expected to chair any inquiry in Bryant’s absence. But the Partygate inquiry row inflamed memories of the Owen Paterson sleaze scandal, where furious MPs told Johnson they had been humiliated by attempts to change the parliamentary disciplinary system last year for MPs in order to protect the former cabinet minister from censure. A Labour source said: “It’s clear Tory MPs are done defending the widespread criminality we’ve seen in No 10 … That’s why Tory whips obviously knew that they couldn’t vote this down. They clearly haven’t learnt a thing from the mess they got into over Owen Paterson. Boris Johnson is trying to rig the rules to deflect from his own law-breaking. Any Tory MP who votes for this is voting for a cover-up.”",News/Politics,PM abandons efforts to block inquiry on misleading Commons over Partygate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/boris-johnson-abandons-efforts-block-inquiry-on-misleading-commons-over-partygate

4/21/2022,"Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen went head-to-head in a live televised debate on Wednesday evening that could change the course of the presidential election this weekend. The much-anticipated two-and-a-half hour exchange, screened on television, radio and online from 9pm local time, began civilly with a smiling Le Pen saying she would be the president of “respect and common sense”. Le Pen had drawn lots to speak first and opened by addressing the cost of living crisis that polls show is the number one concern for French voters. She spoke of reducing taxes permanently to give French families between €150-200 extra each month per household. “An absolute priority for the next year will be giving back the French their money,” she said promising to reduce VAT on fuel and energy. Macron, looking more serious, said his approach to “people’s anger about struggling to make ends meet” was to freeze prices during the cost of living crisis as an emergency measure. “This is more efficient than a drop in VAT,” he added. “And you voted against it.” “I want something lasting, like leaving the European electricity market, not something temporary,” Le Pen said in response. The French television station TF1, which is hosting the debate, had hoped to begin with an exchange between the candidates over the international situation, namely Ukraine, but Le Pen had vetoed this as an opening subject. The first clash came over salaries, when Macron dismissed Le Pen’s suggestion she would increase salaries by 10%. “The president doesn’t decide salaries, that’s down to employers,” Macron said. “You are trying to make people believe you will increase salaries by 10% and it’s not true.” “And you are trying to make people believe you will increase bonuses,” Le Pen hit back. With everything to win or lose, Macron, 44, had to avoid sounding arrogant and headmasterly and Le Pen, 53, had to appear calm, credible and above all moderate to win over the 40% of floating voters who did not support either in the first round 10 days ago, especially the 7.7 million who voted for the radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The face-off was moderated by two journalists well known to French audiences, and each candidate had equal time to answer questions on a range of subjects and their policies. The debate is a big event in French presidential elections since it was introduced in 1974. Only Jacques Chirac refused to debate his second-round rival, the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, in 2002, saying to do so would legitimise Le Pen’s extreme views. After a disastrous performance in the 2017 presidential debate, Le Pen was far better prepared this time. She had been advised to play the mother of the nation – advice she failed to take in 2017. Back then, her team suggested she attempt to destabilise Macron, treat him as a “spoilt child”. In the event, Macron destabilised her from the start, telling her that despite her efforts to detoxify her and her party’s image she was the “true heiress” of Le Pen Sr and the “French far right”. She stumbled, confused the euro with the ecu, and became aggressive. He told her to “stop being ridiculous”. More than 16 million people were watching. At one point, Le Monde claimed she was losing 30,000 votes a minute and polls afterwards showed she had lost four percentage points. Five years on, Macron is no longer the political arriviste and was able to carry his arguments with the weight of presidential experience, albeit with mixed results. Le Pen is weak on technical details and is open to criticism for her previous support of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Apart from the programme differences, viewers will be watching the behaviour of the two candidates. Before the debate, Jordan Bardella, the acting head of Le Pen’s National Rally party, said the candidate was “concentrating and ready”. He added: “Our state of mind is that today we are ready … and that’s the message we will deliver this evening to the French.” The government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said: “The president of the Republic is approaching this debate calmly and with great interest because it is an important democratic moment, because it is an important moment of clarification that will allow us to go into the details of the projects.” Among the thorny issues are Le Pen’s plans to ban the Islamic headscarf in public places, exempt the under-30s from income tax and hold a referendum to bypass the constitution to clamp down on immigration and introduce nationalist French-first policies for jobs, benefits and healthcare. Le Pen is expected to pull Macron up on some of his more unfortunate public comments, including that he wanted to “piss off the non-vaccinated”, or that he “could cross the road” and find an unemployed person a job. Much of the debate is expected to be technical. The question of pensions and the official retirement age is an extremely complicated issue that will be difficult to clarify in a television clash. Europe is also expected to be a hot topic, with Macron wanting a stronger, more powerful union and Le Pen wishing to ignore the EU and create an alliance of nations within the bloc. The latest opinion poll from Ipsos suggests Macron has a 12 point lead over Le Pen for the second-round vote, with him winning with 56% and her on 44%, with a 1.1% margin of error. However, 13% of those voters did not say for whom they would vote. Of those who said they would abstain or vote blank, 43% said they may change their mind on the day.",News/World news,Macron and Le Pen go head-to-head in French presidential debate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-go-head-to-head-in-french-presidential-debate
4/21/2022,"The double Olympic champion Katie Archibald has sharply criticised the transgender policies of the International Olympic Committee and other sports bodies – saying they have not only let down female cyclists by underplaying biology but left trans women, such as Emily Bridges, facing intense scrutiny. Archibald, who won the second of her cycling gold medals in Tokyo last year alongside Dame Laura Kenny in the Madison, said it was wrong for governing bodies to ignore the science that shows trans women who have gone through male puberty have a retained advantage in strength, stamina and physique. However she also expressed deep sympathy for Bridges, who broke the junior men’s 25-mile record before transitioning in 2020, saying she was only following the rules of cycling’s governing body, the UCI, before it decided to block her racing as a woman last month. “It is my opinion that the international governing bodies of several sports have let down transgender athletes, in particular transgender women, with their inclusion policies,” Archibald said in a statement. “These policies have put the athletes, their involvement in sport, and their personal lives under intense scrutiny when all the athletes have done is follow the rules and enter a category they were encouraged to enter.” However, Archibald made it clear that she and other females were also being let down by the unwillingness of sports to accept the importance of biology. “I feel let down by the International Olympic Committee who tell me there should be no assumed advantage for an athlete with a gender identity different to their sex,” she said. “I read this and hear that my world titles, my Olympic medals, and the champions jerseys I have at home, were all won in a category of people who simply don’t try as hard as the men. That losing to male androgenisation is not about biology, but mindset. They are wrong. She added: “The retained advantage of people who have gone through male puberty in strength, stamina and physique, with or without testosterone suppression, has been well documented. “Cycling’s global governing body, by its president’s own admission, knows this. But they chose to delay action until it became sadly personal for one rider. That wasn’t fair.” Bridges, who came out as a transgender woman in October 2020, continued to compete as a male during her transition, and in February won the men’s points race at the British Universities’ championships. She had met British Cycling’s previous requirement – that riders in the female category have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition – in time to register for the championships in Derby, but the UCI did not grant a switch in licence. In her statement Archibald also called on governing bodies of sports such as cycling, triathlon and rowing to come together to develop policies based on science, while also making their sport more welcoming for trans athletes. “But I’d like us to do all this without sacrificing one of the foundational pillars of sport: fairness.”",Sport/Sport,Katie Archibald claims IOC unfair to female cyclists and trans women,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/katie-archibald-claims-ioc-unfair-to-female-cyclists-and-trans-women
