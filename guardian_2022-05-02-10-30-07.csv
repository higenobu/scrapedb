5/2/2022,"Qantas has unveiled details of the ultra-long-haul aircraft it plans to run on non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourne to London and New York by the end of 2025, as the airline’s battered financial situation shows signs of improving. Confirming reports that have swirled in recent days, Qantas announced its mega order with French plane manufacturer Airbus for 12 of its A350-1000 aircraft. These will be run on the so-called “Project Sunrise” flights, with the first to be delivered in 2025. The airline says the planes will be “capable of flying direct from Australia to any other city” in the world, while being 25% more fuel efficient than previous aircraft. The wide-body planes will be able to carry 238 passengers, and will feature “wellbeing zones” for passengers to move about in the cabin as a way to break up the ultra-long-haul flights that will reach up to 20 hours. Does the thought of a 20 hour flight make your knees shudder? Fear not. Renders of the ""wellbeing zones"" @Qantas plans for its A350s that will fly the ultra long haul routes from Sydney and Melbourne to London and New York by the end of 2025 @GuardianAus https://t.co/Iy3LbxQNnN pic.twitter.com/RGvS1YxHmj Chief executive Alan Joyce said Project Sunrise is “the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance” and that the cabin of the A350s “is being specially designed for maximum comfort in all classes for long-haul flying”. The airline has planned the project for years, with the pandemic delaying its launch. The flights will run up to 20 hours without stopping and become among the world’s longest. Qantas has also ordered an additional 40 Airbus aircraft – A321XLRs and A220-300s – for domestic operations, with the first of these aircraft to be delivered next year. The deal is understood to be valued in the billions of dollars. While the airline says the exact cost of the new planes is commercial-in-confidence, it said “a significant discount from the standard price should be assumed”. On the orders to refresh its domestic fleet, Joyce said the range and economics of the new planes Qantas had ordered “will make new direct routes possible, including serving regional cities better” and that “these newer aircraft and engines will reduce emissions by at least 15% if running on fossil fuels, and significantly better when run on sustainable aviation fuel”. Qantas Group – which includes budget carrier Jetstar – also released its third quarter financial update on Monday. While the resurgence of domestic and some international travel markets has boosted revenue, the airline still expects to post “a significant” full-year loss. Net debt has reduced from $5.5bn at the end of December to $4.5bn by the end of April. On the cost of the mammoth aircraft order, Joyce said the phasing of delivery means “it can be funded within our debt range and through earnings”, and that “the business case for Project Sunrise has an internal rate of return in the mid-teens”. “The board’s decision to approve what is the largest aircraft order in Australian aviation is a clear vote of confidence in the future of the Qantas Group. Our strategy for these aircraft will see us generate significant benefits for those who make it possible – our people, our customers and our shareholders,” Joyce said.",News/Business,Qantas announces plans for non-stop flights from Sydney to New York and London,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/qantas-non-stop-flights-australia-to-new-york-london-from-sydney-melbourne-airbus-a350-1000
5/2/2022,"Māori songs, tearful embraces and a beloved New Zealand chocolate bar awaited international visitors arriving in New Zealand on Monday – the first foreign guests, other than Australians, to set foot in Aotearoa in more than two years. Since March 2020, the arrival terminals at New Zealand’s international airports have been desolate as the country swiftly closed the border to prevent the arrival of Covid-19. On Monday morning, the border reopened to vaccinated visitors from about 60 visa-waiver countries as part of the government’s phased reopening plan. The first travellers and returning New Zealanders touched down just after 6am at Auckland international airport from Los Angeles, with another flight from San Francisco arriving shortly after. Garth and Chris Halliday cried as their son Stephen arrived with his wife and son, who they hadn’t seen in over a year, the news website Stuff reported. Garth said the tearful airport scenes were reminiscent of those in the film Love Actually, while Stephen said it was “emotional” to be home. An American tourist told RNZ through tears they had wanted to visit New Zealand for many years. “I’m finally here. It’s amazing,” they said. Vaccinated international visitors can enter New Zealand if they have had a negative pre-departure Covid test. On arrival, they must self-test for coronavirus, and unless it comes back positive there is no requirement quarantine or self-isolate. All other international visitors will be allowed to enter New Zealand from October, unless the government decides it is safe to do so earlier. The tourism minister, Stuart Nash, who greeted arrivals at the gate with a Whittaker’s Peanut Slab chocolate bar, told 1News the reunions “almost bring a tear to the eye”. “People haven’t seen each other for a long, long time – family and friends,” he said. “We have also, of course, got international business people [who] are able to reconnect and they are coming back.” Nash said that while the country is not yet quite back to normal, the reopening was another step towards it. “This has been a long time [coming] – this sends a signal we are now open for business … it is fantastic to see,” Nash said. “Today marks a milestone for visitors from our key northern hemisphere markets in the USA, UK, Germany, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and others, who can now jump on a plane to come here.” More than 30,000 people are arriving into the country each week – an increase on numbers throughout the pandemic, but well below pre-Covid levels, which were close to 25,000 people each day. Nash said international flight searches to New Zealand were running 19% higher than in pre-Covid times. Auckland airport’s chief executive Carrie Hurihanganui said 9,000 passengers would be arriving and departing on 43 international flights on Monday – three times the number in March. The airport has boosted its staff by 40 people, and will continue to do so in the coming months, she said. Hurihanganui said the reunions were giving her “goosebump moments”. “It’s been a pleasure to be here today, and the fact we can play a role in welcoming people back to Aotearoa is fantastic,” she told 1News outside the arrivals gate.",News/World news,"Songs, tears and reunions: New Zealand welcomes back tourists as border reopens after two years",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/songs-tears-and-reunions-new-zealand-welcomes-back-tourists-as-border-reopens-after-two-years
