2/13/2022,"Joe Biden on Saturday night warned Vladimir Putin that the US would “impose swift and severe costs on Russia” if his forces invaded Ukraine. In a phone call that lasted more than an hour, the US president said an invasion would “produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia’s standing”. The call was the culmination of a frantic day of diplomatic activity aimed at averting a war in Ukraine, which the US has warned could start as soon as Wednesday.  It brought “no fundamental change” to the worsening crisis, according to a senior US official briefing reporters afterwards. The official said the two leaders agreed to stay engaged in the coming days “but Russia may decide to proceed with military action anyway”, adding there was no evidence of “meaningful” de-escalation on the Ukrainian border. In Moscow, Yuri Ushakov, a senior foreign policy adviser, called the conversation between the leaders “balanced and businesslike” and confirmed “the presidents have agreed to continue contacts at all levels”. But he rejected US claims that a Russian attack was imminent. “Hysteria has reached its peak,” Ushakov said. Earlier, Emmanuel Macron held a separate conversation with the Russian president, which was reported to last one hour and 40 minutes, while the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Blinken called for “a diplomatic resolution to Russia’s unprovoked military buildup around Ukraine”. Lavrov accused the US of ignoring its security proposals, which include a guarantee that Ukraine would not join Nato and a withdrawal of Nato forces from eastern Europe. The US has said there is a high risk of a Russian attack on Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in China on 20 February, and the CIA is reported to have briefed allies that Russian troops have been ordered to be ready by Wednesday. But Ukraine’s president yesterday hit out at the US for causing “panic”. “I think there’s too much out there about a full-scale war from Russia, and people are even naming dates. The best friend for our enemies is panic in our country, and all this information only creates panic, it doesn’t help us,” said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has been saying for weeks that the tone of the US messaging is helping to cause panic and economic pain in Ukraine and is thus playing into Putin’s hands. Zelenskiy was speaking in the Kherson region, where he was observing drills by interior ministry troops. Ukrainian forces began 10 days of training on Thursday, to coincide with Russian exercises in Belarus that have been seen as a key part of Russia’s threatening buildup. “No one can look into the heads of Kremlin leaders and say for sure what exactly their actions may be. But we are ready for absolutely all scenarios,” said Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov. In Moscow, Lavrov denied there were any plans for an attack, saying US warnings were part of a propaganda campaign. “After Russian troops finish drills and return to barracks, the west will declare ‘diplomatic victory’ by having ‘secured’ Russian ‘de-escalation’,” the Russian foreign ministry quoted him as saying, describing it as a “predictable scenario and cheap domestic political points”. The US and Russia have begun rapid evacuations of their embassies. The US state department said a small number of diplomats would remain in Kyiv to keep channels of communication open with the Ukrainian government, some will pull back to Lviv in the west to provide emergency consular services, while most will be posted in neighbouring countries. “I think prudence requires us to assume to plan for, and prepare for, a worst-case scenario and the worst-case scenario would obviously involve substantial Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital,” a senior state department official said. “These developments mean for private American citizens that it isn’t just time to leave Ukraine – it is past time for private citizens to leave Ukraine,” the official added, stressing that the consular staff were no longer in a position to help private citizens leave. Western intelligence agencies have predicted that a Russian attack would be immediately preceded by a fabricated pretext, such a “false-flag” attack on Russia or the Donetsk and Luhansk regions run by Moscow-backed separatists. Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, said Russia could move to formally recognise the Moscow-controlled so-called “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine. He said this could “offer a basis for Russia to extend security guarantees, and militarily protect those considered to be Russian citizens living in the separatist regions. This may be interpreted as a clause which formally authorises the Russian state to use force in Ukraine.” The Russian Duma is due to consider an appeal to Putin to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics on Monday, although there have been suggestions the hearing may be postponed in a sign Russia is still weighing up various options. Several governments yesterday urged their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible. In the UK, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, called on the government to learn “the right lessons” from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, which saw frantic efforts to escort British nationals and vulnerable Afghans out of the country. Lammy wrote to Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, on Saturday night calling for a substantial increase in staff with relevant language skills to deal with the crisis, a cross-government crisis centre and a contact line for MPs with urgent constituency cases in Ukraine. “The opposition stands united with the government in the face of Russian aggression and in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty,” wrote Lammy. “However, following the chaos of the evacuation from Afghanistan, we ask the government for reassurance that the right lessons have been learned. The first duty of any government is to keep its people safe. The government must act now to ensure it is prepared to provide safety for British citizens in case of any incursion.” Melinda Simmons, Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, said on Saturday that she was staying in the country to “continue to work there with a core team”. She added that the embassy remained open and operational. Dutch airline KLM said it had suspended flights to Ukraine until further notice after a security analysis and in light of Dutch government warnings against travel to Ukraine. A debate around the extent of Britain’s potential involvement broke out this weekend. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, described the tensions as “our Cuban missile crisis moment” and called for British-led Nato divisions to be deployed to the country. However, Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said that providing training assistance was more useful to Ukraine than the deployment of British troops. He said the country’s own troops were “increasingly capable to defend themselves”. “We’re enabling them to have the ability to fight themselves, and having served in combat in countries around the world I can tell you that training local forces to fight for themselves is a significantly better defensive technique than putting troops in,” he said. “The reality is that the Ukrainians already have some 145,000 in their army, they have another – depending on how you count – 100-odd thousand border guard reserves and people like that so they have a significantly larger army even than we do.” The former foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said the deployment of a Nato division inside Ukraine would be “very unwise”. Rifkind and Ellwood said that the current instability caused by Boris Johnson’s alleged involvement in Downing Street lockdown parties was undermining Britain’s standing on the world stage. Dominic Cummings, the PM’s former chief adviser and now his fiercest critic, condemned Tory MPs for allowing Johnson to continue in office “while another major global crisis unfolds”.",News/World news,Biden warns Putin: you’ll pay a heavy cost if you attack Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/biden-warns-putin-youll-pay-a-heavy-cost-if-you-attack-ukraine
2/13/2022,"The temptation was to think that Jürgen Klopp had committed £50m to secure a successor to Sadio Mané. Luis Díaz might be Liverpool’s speedy, goalscoring left winger for much of the 2020s, the replacement in waiting for Klopp’s first great signing at Anfield. But the Liverpool manager’s forward thinking is altogether different. Mané turns 30 in April but Klopp feels his peak could lie in the future. Mané may have had a mixed 18 months, admitting last season was his worst before a burst of form in the autumn of 2021 gave way to his longest Liverpool goal drought, but rather than seeing it as a sign of decline, the German cites Senegal’s maiden Africa Cup of Nations triumph as a career-defining achievement as proof he can improve again.  “He was a great player, a world-class player, when he left here but he comes back as a leader on a different level,” Klopp said. “It was a big tournament, the biggest of his life. Or life so far; I don’t want to finish that line. For him, as a person, 100% he made a massive step.” Mané missed an early penalty in Sunday’s final against Egypt before scoring the decisive spot-kick in the subsequent shootout. Fifty-six years after Senegal’s first Africa Cup of Nations, four after Mané’s inability to convert from 12 yards resulted in their elimination, two after a final defeat, he ended a long wait. Klopp often seems to relish stressful situations. Not this one. “I couldn’t have more respect for what Sadio did. He is for sure now one of the biggest Senegal legends of all time and rightly so,” he said. “The pressure on his shoulders was absolutely incredible. I usually have no problem with facing pressure but, when he walked to the penalty, I thought that was a really difficult moment in life. He faced it, he mastered it, I was really impressed.” Mané missed Liverpool’s win over Leicester on Thursday, with Klopp semi-jokingly suggesting he was sleeping after Senegal’s celebrations. His comeback could instead occur on Sunday at Burnley, but Klopp has no qualms about his professionalism and no doubt he was right to enjoy his success. “He was the best player of the tournament,” he added. “An incredible achievement for him. We all know Sadio doesn’t drink a sip of alcohol so it’s not that he was running around through the city and doesn’t know where he wakes up. I saw the pictures with the president of Senegal, the people in the streets: it was a massive thing.” Yet Mané’s exploits came amid a backdrop of uncertainty and seeming transition. The January signing of Díaz and the prowess of Diogo Jota suggested Klopp was shaping a new-look attack. Roberto Firmino is six months Mané’s senior, Mohamed Salah nine weeks his junior and all three are out of contract next year. If the question of the succession forms the context at Anfield and the challenge for Klopp’s definitive forward line is to sustain their potency into their thirties, the manager takes heart from trends among the best. While the duopoly of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo long seemed to defy time and the ageing process, they have company. Klopp’s former Borussia Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski has become more prolific since his twenties ended and all of the top six finishers in the 2021 Ballon d’Or are now over 30, while Salah was placed seventh. Mané came fourth in 2019 and Klopp believes his excellence in Africa can propel him to greater heights. “He can use that and become an even better player that he was two or three years before. That’s the plan with all of them,” he said. “There is no age roof. Clubs think differently. They look at a player aged 32 or 33 and think: ‘We cannot sell him any more.’ But if they are already inside the club then that’s outstanding because they already have experience and desire and quality.” If a player’s downward slope is not dictated by his birth certificate, Klopp referenced his latest signing, who was bought at 25, to support his case that footballing trajectories can vary. “They are all different. There is no longer a peak in mid-20s. Luis Díaz is not a kid any more; his career started pretty late. He’s a late bloomer, he isn’t the biggest player, so maybe he can go for a long time.” If that potential longevity bodes well for Liverpool, the prospect of an enhanced Mané flourishing could present a roadblock to Díaz’s path to a place in Klopp’s strongest side.",Sport/Football,"Sadio Mané’s best is yet to come at Liverpool, says Jürgen Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/sadio-manes-best-is-yet-to-come-at-liverpool-says-jurgen-klopp
2/13/2022,"Finally some good news for Italian rugby. On Friday, the under-20 side claimed a first win against England in Treviso. England were kept scoreless for good measure for the first time in the competition and though the senior side are on a run of 33 defeats, here is something for Italy to point to. To keep the reformists at bay, and to demonstrate signs of a promising future. On Sunday, in Rome, against the most inexperienced England side Eddie Jones has selected in the Six Nations, and buoyed up by the youngsters’ exploits, the senior side couldn’t follow suit, could they? No, is the simple answer. Progress at senior level is still to be gauged by margins of defeat and Jones’s face turned to stone this week when discussing one ex-international’s suggestion that England could be the scalp Italy have been seeking since 2015. As a former coach of a developing nation, Jones is well versed in preparing his side for matches like these and in Rome they have had few problems during his tenure.  They have been largely forgettable affairs, memorable only for Maro Itoje’s debut in 2016 and the long-term injury suffered two years later by Ben Youngs, for whom it should be a cathartic return if he comes off the bench and equals England’s all-time caps record. That is mainly because Jones has cared little for aesthetics. He hammers home to his players that while the expectation is to win well, the aim first and foremost must simply be to win. Just like 12 months ago, they have a disappointing defeat by Scotland to get out of their system. Yet there is something in the air. Jones normally makes changes against Italy – five a year ago, seven the year before that and six on Sunday – but with Alex Dombrandt, Harry Randall and Marcus Smith lining up at 8-9-10, with Joe Marchant returning to the centres and Jack Nowell coming on to the wing to give the backline a more balanced feel, he has taken off the shackles. It is no surprise he has stacked his replacements bench with more caps than the starting XV and if all goes to plan it is easy to envisage Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds filling their boots in the last 20 minutes. The preceding hour, however, promises to be more significant. These days Italy tend to be able to live with more heralded opponents, just not for long enough. They were defensively robust for spells against New Zealand in the autumn and France last week but there is a familiar pattern that the superior fitness and greater depth of their opponents pays off in the closing stages. It was the same when England were last in Rome, seeking the 2020 title in the postponed October fixture. At half-time England, seeking a bonus point, led only 10-5 but the dam subsequently burst.What piques the interest is how the rookies perform from the word go. Try to force things and, as we have seen against lesser sides, some of them may not be seen in an England shirt again for a while. But marry patience with poise and show the cutting edge that was missing at Murrayfield and Jones will feel he has found the blueprint for matches at the 2023 World Cup that will require a high tempo. A plan B, as it were. “It is about developing a new England side we want to equip for the next World Cup,” he said. “The World Cup in France is reasonably unique because you are going to be playing the majority of the pool games and up to the quarter-final on fast open pitches so to progress to the last four you are going to need to have a very good attacking game. We need to be able to play the old England way and the new England way.” Which brings us back to the balance he is trying to strike between challenging for the Six Nations title with memories of last year’s fifth-place finish still lingering and preparing his side for the World Cup. It is a fine line to tread and it got a little finer after the defeat by Scotland but before sterner tests after the first rest week, Italy’s inferiority affords them wriggle room. The key will be how they put it to use.",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones’ young England side look to curtail Italian feelgood factor,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/eddie-jones-young-england-side-look-to-curtail-italian-feelgood-factor
2/13/2022,"Claire Denis’s new film is a seductively indirect love triangle, a drama of the mind as much as the heart. It’s intriguing if contrived and anticlimactic, though acted at the highest pitch of sensual conviction. Denis has co-written the screenplay with the author Christine Angot, with whom she wrote her previous movie Let the Sunshine In, and this has the same novelistic feel. The original French title is Feu, ou Avec Amour et Acharnement (which translates as Fire, or With Love And Fury); the English subtitle comes from a Tindersticks’ track composed especially for this film about the lacerating agony of an impossible choice: (“I’m sliding down both sides of the blade”). The three combatants are heavyweights of French cinema. Juliette Binoche is Sara, a presenter on a highbrow Paris radio talk show, who for 10 years has lived with Jean (played by the smoulderingly rumpled Vincent Lindon); he is a former sports star, retired through injury, who has served time in prison for an unspecified offence and now is apparently denied a credit card and so deals in cash. Jean has a teen son, Marcus (Issa Perica) whose mother now lives abroad and who is being raised by Jean’s mother Nelly (Bulle Ogier). The third corner of the triangle is François (Grégoire Colin), Sara’s ex-lover whom she left for Jean on a passionate impulse a decade ago. Jean and Sara haven’t seen François since then, but one morning outside the studio, Sara glimpses François in the street and all her old feelings are devastatingly reignited. Did he see her, too? It’s not clear, but maybe it’s not a coincidence that he contacts Jean trying to get his help with a sports agency he is setting up.  The movie interestingly shows that when a person is having an affair, they are capable of the most profound emotional doublethink. On the one hand (or perhaps on one side of the blade) this person is able to be happy in the marriage and yet also passionately infatuated with the other person. We see Sara intensely engaged with François, her old flame (he even appears to have a key to her flat). But in the next scene, we see her indignantly deny Jean’s accusations with all the integrity and tearful, injured innocence that Binoche can project so convincingly. Watching her in these moments, it takes almost an effort of will to remember what we have just seen of her with François. Did it really happen? Was it a dream? An alternative reality that Sara was wistfully picturing? No. It was real. But, in the strangest way, Sara’s denials are real as well: entirely sincere, if self-deluding, in the moment. Because her love for Jean is real: it is not to be wished away as easily as all that. The weakness of the film is how lightly François’s personality and background is sketched in: he is a mystery, a perhaps not entirely intentional mystery, compared to how intensely we are presented with Jean and Sara. Marcus and Nelly are engagingly and very humanely drawn and Jean’s other life as a troubled dad is also sympathetically imagined. But perhaps their lives crowd out the space that should have been made for François – and incidentally we could have been told more about Jean’s jail time and what led up to it. This is a film with plenty of ideas, some less than fully formed.
