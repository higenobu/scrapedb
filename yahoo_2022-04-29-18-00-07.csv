4/29/2022,"A new book reveals the extent to which the White House was essentially an arm of Donald Trump’s political campaign, even at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the upcoming book This Will Not Pass by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, Trump kept a room next to the Oval Office filled with MAGA merch. “They literally hand you a shopping bag, and you took anything you’d like,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) was quoted as saying, according to an excerpt reviewed by The Hill. Murphy was visiting the White House in 2020 ― early in the pandemic ― when Trump showed him the MAGA gift shop adjoining the Oval Office. The book also details the extent to which Trump expected governors who wanted help with the pandemic to give him something in return, or what he called “the reciprocity.” “Trump was most interested in helping people he got along with, and regions of the country he saw as Trump country,” the book notes, per an excerpt reviewed by SF Gate. This Will Not Pass hits stores May 3.

4/29/2022,"Former AG William Barr said it would be a ""big mistake"" for Trump to be the GOP's nominee in 2024. ""I don't think he should be our nominee — the Republican Party nominee,"" Barr said on Newsmax. Barr and Trump have hit out at each other since Barr's memoir was released in March. Former Attorney General William Barr said this week that he thought the Republican Party would be making a ""big mistake"" if it picked Donald Trump as its 2024 presidential nominee. Barr made the statement during a Thursday appearance on the Newsmax show ""Spicer & Co."" He told host Sean Spicer, a fellow Trump administration alum, that he thought Trump should not be on the GOP's 2024 ticket. ""I don't think he should be our nominee — the Republican Party nominee,"" Barr said. ""And I think Republicans have a big opportunity — it would be a big mistake to put him forward."" While Trump has not formally declared that he will be running for president in 2024, he has dropped major hints about doing so. For instance, in January, he called himself the ""45th and 47th"" president in a video filmed by a golfing buddy. Senior Republican lawmakers like Lindsey Graham have also backed Trump's potential candidacy in 2024. Graham said in February that Trump has a ""great chance"" of becoming president in 2024 and that the spot on the GOP ticket was ""his nomination for the taking."" Barr and Trump have had a tense relationship, particularly after a rocky stretch during the last months of the Trump administration. In March, Barr released a book called ""One Damn Thing After Another,"" in which he refuted Trump's claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, writing: ""The election was not 'stolen.' Trump lost it."" During an interview with NBC in March, Barr said that Trump never had a ""good idea"" of what the roles of the president or the Justice Department were. Responding to Barr's claims, Trump released a letter calling him ""slow"" and ""lethargic"" and a ""big disappointment.""  The letter kicked off a feud between the two, with Barr calling Trump ""childish"" and accusing the former president of throwing a ""tantrum."" In March, Barr also prodded Trump repeatedly, saying Trump was not his ""idea of a president."" On a separate NBC appearance, Barr said working with Trump was like ""wrestling an alligator"" and that the former president loved being ""surrounded by yes men.""

4/29/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan located on Friday the hull of a tour boat off its northern coast, the coast guard said, six days after the vessel disappeared in an accident that killed at least 14 people on a sightseeing trip. The hull of the ""Kazu I"" was found on the seabed at a depth of about 120 metres (390 ft) off the northern island of Hokkaido in pitch-dark waters shown in footage from an underwater camera of the Maritime Self Defence Force, the coast guard said. The boat went missing on Saturday several hours after departing for a tour of the peninsula, famed for its rugged coastal scenery and wildlife. The 26 aboard included two children and two crew. Fourteen were found dead, a coast guard official told Reuters, with the rest unaccounted for. The coast guard said a Russian guard ship lost sight of someone wearing a life jacket who was adrift at sea in waters west of an island Japan refers to as Kunashiri on Wednesday afternoon. Kunashiri, known in Russian as Kunashir, is one of four islands north of Hokkaido that are at the centre of a territorial row between Tokyo and Moscow, after the Soviet Union seized them at the end of World War Two.
