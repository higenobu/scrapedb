5/13/2022,"A delegation of influential US congressmen will fly to London within days amid growing concern at the White House about spiralling tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol, the Guardian can reveal. With the UK government poised to lay legislation next week which could override parts of the protocol, arrangements are being made for at least half a dozen representatives from the US congress to fly to Europe for a series of meetings in Brussels, Dublin, London and Belfast. The delegation will be headed by the influential chair of the ways and means committee Richie Neal, which has significant power over future trade deals. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has previously said the US intends to appoint its own envoy to Northern Ireland. Neal, whose interest in Northern Ireland stretches over 30 years, said earlier this year that a trade deal was “desirable” but that it would not progress if there was “any jeopardy” to the Good Friday agreement. The delegation will likely underline President Biden’s commitment to defending the Good Friday agreement and the US’s role as a guarantor. He has repeatedly emphasised how integral the protocol is to maintaining peace and stability. “The best path forward is a pragmatic one that requires courage, co-operation and leadership,” a White House spokesman said of the UK’s dispute with the EU. Boris Johnson is expected to give a speech as soon as Monday on the future of the protocol after exchanges between the foreign secretary Liz Truss and the EU’s Maroš Šefčovič – which a UK source described as “tetchy.” In a phone call Truss said that unless the EU showed the “requisite flexibility” in talks over the trading arrangements she would have “no choice but to act”. Johnson, who negotiated the protocol as part of the Brexit agreement, gave firm backing to Truss on Thursday, saying “institutions set up under the Good Friday agreement aren’t functioning” and that political governance in Northern Ireland has collapsed. “The people of Northern Ireland need leadership, they need a regional, a provincial government… they haven’t got that,” Johnson said, after a discussion of the strategy with cabinet ministers. “That’s a real problem. And the reason they don’t have that is because there’s one community in Northern Ireland that won’t accept the way the protocol works at present – we’ve got to fix that.” Within the UK’s Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU, the Northern Ireland protocol lays out arrangements that effectively keep Northern Ireland in the single market, drawing a customs border between it and the rest of the UK, with checks on goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That means there is no requirement for checks across the UK's land border with Ireland. The 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal requires keeping the land border open and that there be no new infrastructure such as cameras and border posts. However. both the British government and the European Union recognise that the implementation of this deal has triggered the disruption of supply chains, increased costs and reduced choice for consumers in Northern Ireland.  The rules means that goods such as milk and eggs have to be inspected when they arrive in Northern Ireland from mainland Britain, while some produce, such as chilled meats, cannot be imported at all. This is because the EU does not want to risk them entering the single market over the land border and then being transported on. What is article 16? Article 16 is an emergency brake in the Irish protocol, that allows either side to take unilateral action if the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist”, or diversion of trade. Serious difficulties are not defined, giving both sides leeway for interpretation.  This would launch a process defined in the treaty as “consultations … with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution”. Article 16 is meant to be a temporary timeout, not an escape hatch. The UK has sent Johnson’s close ally Conor Burns as an envoy on the protocol to speak to senior figures in Washington over the course of the week, including meeting a special Northern Ireland committee of congressmen on Friday. Both Truss and Burns have argued that negotiations have reached a crunch point because of the impasse at Stormont, where the DUP has said it will not re-enter the Northern Ireland executive while the issues with the protocol remain. On Thursday Truss and Šefčovič spoke for the first time since it was revealed the UK was considering tabling draft legislation on Tuesday to unilaterally override part of the trading arrangements. The standoff between the two is testing wider relations with the EU at a time when “bigger things” such as Finland joining Nato are happening, Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said on Thursday. But a UK government source said Truss has argued that the situation in Northern Ireland without a functioning executive was a key security concern that merited the response. “Liz’s primary concern in all this is upholding the Belfast Good Friday agreement,” they said. “The protocol is the major cause of political instability – disrupting trade and creating a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland are treated differently to the rest of the UK – so it’s clear and obvious that we need to change the parts that aren’t working. “If the EU won’t help us do that and show more pragmatism, then we’ll have to take action that solves those problems. That would very much be in disappointment rather than anger.” David McAllister, a German centre-right MEP who chairs the European parliament’s UK coordination group, said the EU was united against renegotiating the protocol. “The protocol was signed and ratified by both sides. Nobody here in Brussels is interested in starting these new complicated discussions and political fights,” he said. Truss said she had told Šefčovič the protocol was “the greatest obstacle” to forming a new Northern Ireland executive following last week’s elections. There are no further plans for the pair to speak. Šefčovič told her there was “no room to expand the negotiating mandate or introduce new proposals to reduce the overall level of trade fiction”, according to a Foreign Office statement. The government called it a matter of “regret” that the EU “would not show the requisite flexibility to help solve those issues… then as a responsible government we would have no choice but to act.” Sefčovič said it remained of “serious concern that the UK government intends to embark on the path of unilateral action”. He also said the EU was still waiting for the UK’s response to proposals it made in February. “We have made clear that there is still potential to be explored in our proposals,” he said. “Unilateral action, effectively disapplying an international agreement such as the protocol, is simply not acceptable.”",News/Politics,US congressmen to fly to London amid growing concern over future of Northern Ireland protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/us-congressmen-to-fly-to-london-amid-growing-concern-over-future-of-northern-ireland-protocol
5/13/2022,"Universities in England have been for rebuked for awarding “excessive” numbers of first-class degrees during the pandemic, with ministers and regulators accusing the sector of undermining its own reputation. The Office for Students (OfS) regulator published analysis claiming that more than half of first-class degrees awarded in 2021 could not be explained by “observable factors” such as prior results or social background of students. Susan Lapworth, the OfS’s interim chief executive, said: “Unmerited grade inflation is bad for students, graduates and employers, and damages the reputation of English higher education.” Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said universities should respond in the same way as A-level and GCSE exams and restore pre-pandemic award levels by next year. “Unjustifiable increases in the proportion of top degrees being awarded threaten to undermine the value of UK degrees,” Donelan said. “We expect the OfS to challenge registered providers with an excessive proportion of top degrees being awarded.” The OfS said nearly 38% of undergraduates in England were awarded a first in 2020-21, more than double the 16% awarded firsts a decade earlier, and above the 29% awarded before the pandemic. But the OfS’s analysis also looked at “unexplained” firsts, defined as awards that “cannot be statistically accounted for by changes in the characteristics of the graduating cohort” for each university. The Royal Academy of Music was accused of awarding the highest proportion of “unexplained” firsts among the 80% of students awarded firsts last year. At mainstream universities, Bradford had 41% of its firsts classed as unexplained by the OfS’s statisticians, while Queen Mary University London (QMUL) had 37% unexplained. A spokesperson for QMUL said it was ranked by the Sutton Trust as top in the country for social mobility. “We are proud to open the doors of opportunity to anyone with the potential to succeed at a Russell Group university,” they said. “We are equally proud of our successful world-leading work in reducing the attainment gap between white and BAME students, which has resulted in our degree outcomes becoming a true reflection of our students’ abilities.” Steve West, vice-chancellor of UWE Bristol and president of the Universities UK group, said the OfS also “rightly” wanted students not to be limited in what grades they can achieve. “We believe the OfS must be careful not to assume that students with lower entry grades, typically from more disadvantaged backgrounds, cannot achieve first-class degrees,” West said. Ofqual, England’s exam regulator, has also announced that students taking A-levels and GCSEs in the future will benefit from questions that are simpler and avoid references that could confuse and disadvantage candidates. The regulator has been concerned that pupils may be unfairly hampered by a middle-class bias in the language used in questions, such as a 2017 GCSE maths paper that described a theatre where “each person had a seat in the circle or had a seat in the stalls”. Candidates were asked to calculate how many of the 2,600 seats were occupied but pupils would need to understand that circle and stalls are in different sections to answer correctly. In 2019, examiners for a GCSE German modern languages paper said some students struggled when asked to describe the advantages and disadvantages of a skiing holiday. Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said: “This isn’t about making exams and assessments easier but about breaking down the barriers that stop young people achieving their true potential and making sure that exams actually test the things they are designed to test.” The new regulations include a commitment to clear and consistent layout, to aid candidates with special needs or disabilities. A spokesperson for the Autism Education Trust said: “This is a positive step towards creating a more inclusive education system that recognises that adjustments must be made to support the needs of all autistic children and young people to reach their potential and receive a fair chance to demonstrate their skills and abilities.”",News/Education,"Too many first-class degrees awarded in England, regulator says",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/12/first-class-degrees-england-regulator
5/13/2022,"These are frightening times. It is shocking to learn that just a few months after the show of international common purpose at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, countries including the US, Canada and Australia are among those with the most destructive oil and gas projects, threatening to shatter the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C. A Guardian investigation has revealed that the world’s biggest fossil fuel firms have 195 “carbon bomb” projects that would each emit at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 – and that 60% are already under way. Only last month, the International Committee on Climate Change warned that the world is on course to overshoot the 1.5C target, prompting António Guterres, the UN secretary general, to describe governments investing in new fossil fuels as “dangerous radicals”. On Monday, a new forecast warned that the probability of one of the next five years exceeding the 1.5C limit was 50%. In the face of these stakes, and this evidence, the actions of the world’s biggest energy companies are perplexing as well as enraging. Why are energy giants continuing to invest in fossil fuel projects capable of causing such colossal harm? One expert suggests “a form of cognitive dissonance” is behind the refusal or inability of governments, as well as businesses, to change course in spite of the risks. Another says the scale of planned production suggests oil companies are still in denial about global heating, whatever they publicly claim – or have “complete disregard for the more climate vulnerable communities, typically poor, people of colour and far away from their lives”. One climate activist attributed such recklessness to a “colonial mindset”, which could equally be described as genocidal given the severity of the expected consequences of unchecked heating. The victory of President Joe Biden over Donald Trump in 2020’s US election led to hopes of a new dawn for global climate cooperation. But West Virginia’s Democrat senator Joe Manchin sank the president’s Build Back Better bill, which included climate measures. Our research, based on industry data, shows that far from reducing its emissions, the US has 22 mega-projects in the pipeline. American drivers, along with Australians, Canadians and Saudis, are also the world’s biggest beneficiaries of subsidies for road fuels. Leaders including Trump, Vladimir Putin and Jair Bolsonaro have worked with Middle Eastern petrostates to derail emissions reduction efforts. Leading the table for near-term expansion of oil and gas are Qatar Energy, Russia’s Gazprom, and Saudi Aramco. But many of the carbon bombs are under the jurisdiction of western governments that are theoretically signed up to solving the climate problem. A 2009 pledge by the G20 to phase out subsidies has been ignored. Chinese companies have also invested heavily in oil and gas exploration. It is long past time to admit that our global energy system is itself a bomb. Unchecked greed is driving us ever closer to the abyss. Both separately and together, governments must find ways to promote the long-term health of the planet over short-term profit. There is no alternative but to force companies to write off the most dangerous investments. Of course, this will cause an economic shock, but advances in renewables mean there are options other than carbon addiction. Total emissions must fall by half by 2030, if the worst scenarios are to be avoided. To continue on our current course would be nihilistic. The carbon bomb-makers must be stopped.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on carbon bombs: governments must say no | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-carbon-bombs-governments-must-say-no
5/13/2022,"When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks. The unit, stationed in Russia’s far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started at the end of February and saw bitter combat with Ukrainian forces. “It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,” said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. “I want to return to my family – and not in a casket.” Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. “They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn’t much they could do,” he said. He was soon transferred to Belgorod, a Russian city close to the border with Ukraine, where he has been stationed since. “I have served for five years in the army. My contract ends in June. I will serve my remaining time and then I am out of here,” he said. “I have nothing to be ashamed of. We aren’t officially in a state of war, so they could not force me to go.” Dmitri’s refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin’s political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine – preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a “special military operation”. Under Russian military rules, troops who refuse to fight in Ukraine can face dismissal but cannot be prosecuted, said Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer who has been advising soldiers who choose that option. Benyash said “hundreds and hundreds” of soldiers had been in touch with his team for advice on how they could avoid being sent to fight. Among them were 12 national guardsmen from Russia’s southern city of Krasnodar who were fired after refusing to go to Ukraine. “Commanders try to threaten their soldiers with prison time if they dissent, but we tell the soldiers that they can simply say no,” Benyash said, adding that he was not aware of any criminal cases against soldiers who refused to fight. “There are no legal grounds to start a criminal case if a soldier refuses to fight while on Russian territory.” Many soldiers, therefore, have chosen to be fired or transferred rather than going into “the meat grinder”, he said. A similar account to Dmitri’s was given to the BBC’s Russian service by Sergey Bokov, a 23-year-old soldier who at the end of April decided to leave the army after fighting in Ukraine. “Our commanders didn’t even argue with us because we were not the first ones to leave,” Bokov said. Pointing to Russia’s military laws, Benyash said it would be more difficult for soldiers to refuse to fight if Russia were to declare a full-scale war. “During wartime, rules are totally different. Refusal then would mean much harsher penalties. They would be looking at time in prison.” While the exact number of soldiers refusing to fight remains unclear, such stories illustrate what military experts and western governments say is one of Russia’s biggest obstacles in Ukraine: a severe shortage of infantry soldiers. Moscow initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces – 150,000 men – into the war in February, according to western officials. But significant damage has been done to that army, which has confronted logistical problems, poor morale and an underestimated Ukrainian resistance. “Putin needs to make a decision regarding mobilisation in the coming weeks,” said Rob Lee, a military analyst. “Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted – they won’t be able to keep this up for a long period.” Lee said one option for the Kremlin would be to authorise the deployment of conscript units to Ukraine, despite Putin’s earlier pledges that Russia would not use any conscripts in the war. “Conscripts could fill some of the gaps, but they will be poorly trained. Many of the units that are supposed to train conscripts are fighting themselves,” Lee said. But without conscript battalions, Russia could soon “struggle to hold the territory it currently controls in Ukraine, especially as Ukraine receives better equipment from Nato,” he said. Russian authorities quietly stepped up their efforts to recruit new soldiers as it became clear that a quick victory in Ukraine was unattainable. An investigation by the BBC’s Russian service showed that Russia’s defence ministry filled employment websites with vacancies, offering people with no combat experience opportunities to join the army on lucrative short-term contracts. Some large government-run companies have received letters urging them to sign up their staff for the army. Russia has also turned to mercenaries to bolster its war efforts, deploying fighters from the shadowy Kremlin-linked Wagner group. But analysts say voluntary recruits and mercenary groups are unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in the number of new soldiers, compared with the numbers that a partial or a full-scale mobilisation would bring. Despite speculation beforehand, Putin did not formally declare war on Ukraine during his Victory Day speech on 9 May. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said the authorities may be worried that a general mobilisation would antagonise large sections of the population that support the “special operation”. Russians “might be in favour of the conflict, but they don’t actually want to fight,” he said, adding that a general mobilisation would entail “colossal losses of untrained soldiers”. And while the current status of the conflict gives Russian soldiers a legal path to refuse participation, some soldiers have complained that it has also led to them not being adequately cared for. A junior sergeant said he was injured during one of the recent Ukrainian attacks on the Russian border territory where he was stationed. His superiors argued that he should not be given the monetary compensation of up to £2,500 that wounded Russians are entitled to by law because his injury took place on Russian soil – meaning it did not fall under the rules of Russia’s “special military operation”. “It is unfair, I am fighting in this war just as the others in Ukraine, risking my life,” the soldier said. “If I don’t get the compensation that I am entitled to soon, I will go public and make a major issue of it.”",News/World news,‘They were furious’: the Russian soldiers refusing to fight in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/they-were-furious-the-russian-soldiers-refusing-to-fight-in-ukraine
5/13/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol has issued unprecedented subpoenas to five Republican members of Congress, seeking to compel their cooperation. The select committee empowered the chairman, Bennie Thompson, to move ahead with subpoenas to the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama. The five congressmen flatly refused to accept invitations to provide voluntary assistance to the investigation, sources said. A spokesperson for the panel declined to comment late on Wednesday night, and did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday morning. The committee is seeking to compel the Republican members of Congress to share some of the most sensitive information about Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, sources said. The Guardian reported earlier this week that the panel was moving closer to issuing subpoenas to Republicans in Congress, appalled at their refusal to assist in any way despite prima facie connections to the events of 6 January. What changed for members of the committee, according to sources familiar with internal deliberations, was that they could no longer ignore what appeared to be deep involvement in Trump’s unlawful schemes to overturn the 2020 election results. The scope and targets of the subpoenas are not final until the orders are made public. But the subpoenas were expected to encompass the contents of the letters seeking voluntary cooperation, they said. That would indicate the committee intends to ask McCarthy about what he knew of the former president’s involvement in, and response to, the Capitol riots, as well as why Trump believed McCarthy was at fault for the riot. It also suggests House investigators are interested in seeking more detail about meetings between Trump and Republican members of Congress at the White House before the Capitol attack, at which they strategised about how to stop certification of Joe Biden’s win on 6 January. The letters to Jordan and Biggs made explicit reference to at least one December 2020 meeting that involved the former president and Republicans in Congress, which is understood to have been attended by the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right group. The panel made a particularly expansive request to Biggs, also seeking details about what he knew of plans by pro-Trump activists to march from the “Save America” rally at the Ellipse on 6 January to the Capitol, through his contacts with the activist Ali Alexander and others. Biggs’s potential contacts with Alexander are of special interest to the investigation, sources said. The committee is trying to untangle claims by Alexander that he “schemed up putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting” with Brooks, Biggs and Paul Gosar, another Arizona Republican, and his testimony that he spoke to Biggs’s staff and the congressman himself. Alexander obtained a permit to hold a rally at the Capitol on 6 January but that event never took place. Alexander was instead filmed going up the Capitol steps in a “stack” formation with members of the Oath Keepers militia. Thompson said the panel wanted to ask Biggs about his efforts to pressure legislators to create “alternate” slates of electors for Trump in states he lost, as well as an alleged request he made to Trump for a pardon in the days after the Capitol attack.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel subpoenas five Republicans in unprecedented step,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/capitol-attack-panel-subpoenas-five-republicans-mccarthy
5/13/2022,"A leading Turkish opposition figure has been banned from politics and sentenced to almost five years in prison, drawing widespread concern about a crackdown on leftwing organisers and politicians before elections expected within the year. An Istanbul appeals court on Thursday confirmed three charges against Canan Kaftancıoğlu, the head of the Istanbul branch of the main opposition Republican People’s party (CHP), upholding her convictions for insulting a public official, publicly insulting the republic of Turkey, and insulting the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in tweets accusing him of theft. She faces a ban on political activity and a prison sentence of four years, 11 months and 20 days. While she could receive a suspended sentence, observers fear that banning the key opposition leader from politics is intended to sideline her before presidential and parliamentary elections. Polls indicate that Erdoğan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) are likely to face stiff opposition after a year in which Turkey’s currency has halved in value and inflation has reached close to 70%. In response, Kaftancıoğlu tweeted a video telling her supporters: “Never stop, do not give up, do not get tired.” She added: “We will breathe together when we establish the rule of law.” Speaking in Istanbul the same evening, the CHP leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, addressed Erdoğan directly. “All this cruelty stems from your weakness,” he said. Kaftancıoğlu, an outspoken, motorbike-riding leftist, is thought to have played a central role in helping the CHP win the Istanbul mayoral race in 2019, granting it control of Turkey’s largest city. The CHP candidate, Ekrem İmamoğlu, won the seat twice after the AKP demanded a re-run of the vote when its candidate first lost. “For Erdoğan this is about the risk of the opposition continuing to organise effectively with figures like Kaftancıoğlu, who put together a masterful campaign to protect the vote and denied the AKP a repeat victory in 2019,” said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “It was the 100,000 volunteers assembled by Kaftancıoğlu who observed the tally, compiled documents, took pictures and slept on top of ballot boxes so nothing could be rigged and İmamoğlu won. It shows pretty significant organisational skills on her part,” he said. Kaftancıoğlu had already begun a campaign to train observers before the general election. The CHP was defiant after the ruling. “If Canan Kaftancıoğlu is banned, there are tens of thousands of Canans who will be on duty during the elections at the poll stations,” said Ünal Çeviköz, a CHP member and retired diplomat. Kaftancıoğlu’s conviction comes after a recent ruling sentencing the leftwing philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison over accusations he supported anti-government protests in 2013, as well a demand by prosecutors to silence a leading feminist group. “I feel like Erdoğan is tightening the noose on the opposition’s neck,” said Cagaptay. “It shows that for him, the risk of letting the opposition flourish and organise outweighs the benefits of the investments he might get as a result of his charm offensive towards the west.” A court in Istanbul is expected to rule on charges against İmamoğlu in early June. He also faces a ban on political activity and could be jailed over claims he insulted the election officials who cancelled his initial win in 2019. If convicted, the ruling would sideline one of the CHP’s potential presidential candidates.",News/World news,Key Turkish opposition figure banned from politics after anti-Erdoğan tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/key-opposition-leader-banned-from-politics-after-anti-erdogan-tweet
5/13/2022,"On days like these it’s hard to know if the government is criminally insane or just criminal. Perhaps it’s both. After telling parliament several times that the very idea of illegality in Downing Street was unthinkable, Boris Johnson was forced to admit that a further 50 fines had been handed out to members of his staff. That takes the total amount of fixed-penalty notices well into three figures, with the police barely having begun their investigation into the 12 parties. Other than the prestige of being the main resident of the most law-breaking venue in the entire country during lockdown, the only comfort for the Convict was that this time he wasn’t among those who got collared by the Old Bill. Though his time will surely come again. Instead it was just his underlings – who had only gone to the parties because they had been assured they were perfectly legal by the prime minister – who got the criminal record. Yet again, Johnson was the go-to man for laying down his friends for his life. The news of the latest police fines arrived just in time for the arrival of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Oliver Dowden at the cabinet play-date in Stoke. Rees-Mogg greeted the news with a sense of rapture. The FPNs proved that the Convict was a man of utmost probity and his only regret was that the police hadn’t issued more of them. The Mogg is completely abject in his needy devotion. Dowden took one look at the waiting press mob and dived into a doorway. Of a bunker. It was some time before he guiltily did the walk of shame. It was fortunate, however, that the fines had come too late for Johnson’s LBC interview with Nick Ferrari, which had been recorded on his trip to Scandinavia the day before. Still there was just time for him to say he didn’t approve of a windfall tax but if everyone else wanted one he’d probably do it anyway as he’d never given much of a toss about anything anyway. Though it would break his heart to knowingly do the right thing. He’s a man whose convictions are strictly criminal. Come the cabinet meeting, the best he could say was that he was delighted with the growth figures. An economy that is only flatlining is now apparently a Tory aspiration. By the end of the day, Johnson was blocking publication of the Security Service advice he had received on Evgeny Lebedev. Advice he was obliged to hand over after a binding Commons vote. The Convict never did think any of the rules applied to him. Least of all these ones. His amoral sociopathy is his strongest asset. Having a conscience can drag you down. Elsewhere in government, Northern Ireland seems to bring out the stupidest and the worst. First off we had the attorney general, Suella Braverman, declare that she was perfectly OK with the UK breaking international law. Just as long as we didn’t make a habit of it. Or even if we did, come to think of it. Braverman is just another apparatchik whose job depends on her willingness to do whatever Johnson wants. She likes to boast of how well qualified she is, but her actions only make you think it can’t be too hard to become a top lawyer. No one has yet seen her approximate any cognitive ability. Still, she keeps good company. Step forward Liz Truss, who declared she was feeling tetchy with the EU after Maroš Šefčovič hinted there would be a trade war if the UK decided to trigger article 16. Our quarter-witted foreign secretary has yet to realise that the Northern Ireland protocol was negotiated and agreed by her own government just a few years ago in order to get a Brexit deal through the UK parliament. Somehow, in her barely functioning synapses, she has reconfigured events to an altered reality in which the EU duped the Brits into signing something against our will. Then there was Conor Burns, a junior minister for Northern Ireland, who had gone to the US merely to post photos of himself on Twitter with a huge wad of paper, while observing that these formed the documentation now required to facilitate trade between the UK and the EU. Er, yes, Conor dearest. That’s precisely what so many people were warning your government back in 2016 as they suggested that Brexit wasn’t a particularly good idea. Give it a year or so and Conor might come to realise that leaving the EU has caused a 4% hit to the UK economy. One member of the wankocracy not on view was Michael Gove. Though he should have been in the Commons to open the second day of the Queen’s speech debate on “fairness at work and power in communities”. But after his cocaine binge the day before – any minister can fuck up one media interview, but it takes a certain genius to fuck up all five – the Govester was lying down in a darkened room, nursing his nose and on the phone to his sponsor. “Thing is Mikey, you still haven’t quite got the hang of Step One.” So it was the perfectly nice but wholly unremarkable junior business minister, Paul Scully, who was left to pick up the pieces of what passed for a levelling up agenda. He was looking forward to the economy growing a bit, he said hopefully. Weren’t we all, though there is little sign of it. Nor could Scully offer any clue when it might happen. He also looked forward to the UK benefiting from a flexible workforce, though not quite so flexible as P&O’s. And we’d be levelling up somehow or other at some unspecified time in the future. Thank you. I’m here. Labour’s Angela Rayner wasn’t sure whether to take pity on Scully – it wasn’t his fault he was so useless – or to go for the jugular. So she pitched her response somewhere in between. A semi-detached contempt. Was that really it? Where was the employment bill? The Tories were making no effort to disguise they had no interest in working people. A miserable vision whose highlight was bus passes for elderly people so they had somewhere to keep warm. An old people’s creche. Next they would be having gala dinners to open food banks. Tinned beans as finger food. Scrub that. They were already doing that: if they could get there in time before Lee Anderson closed them. Just another day in the life of a necrotic government. Viva the Twatterati.

5/13/2022,"A police officer dismissed relatives of the Dorset teenager Gaia Pope as “taking the piss” when they made a series of desperate calls for help on the day she vanished, an inquest jury has heard. Pope’s mother and aunt spoke to Dorset police in an attempt to confirm an appointment for the young woman to make a complaint over indecent images she had been sent. They explained that the images had triggered a severe mental health episode in Pope, 19, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after reporting being raped at the age of 16. In one call played to the jury, a police constable can be heard telling a call handler: “This is the fifth call I’ve had. The last call ended with them talking absolute rubbish … I think they are taking the piss, to be honest.” Pope, who had severe epilepsy, went missing from Swanage on 7 December 2017. Her body was found 11 days later near a local beauty spot called Dancing Ledge. On Thursday Pope’s aunt Talia told the court that Gaia was “groomed” via Facebook before being drugged and raped. Talia said her niece had flashbacks, and she recalled an occasion when Gaia was pacing up and down saying: “I’ve been raped. Why won’t someone listen to me?” Gaia’s anxiety soared after another man sent her indecent images shortly before she vanished, her aunt said. Recordings of two calls that Gaia made to police to report the indecent images were played in court. A call handler told her: “We will come and see you at some point. We can’t say when.” On 7 November, Talia made six calls to try to confirm when police would speak to her niece, telling them the young woman was a rape survivor and was having a relapse. On one occasion, a call handler could be heard laughing as she spoke to an officer when Talia was on hold. There was also confusion at one point because the police thought Talia was calling about a Gaia “Hope”. In another call, Gaia could be heard wailing in the background and her mother explained she was having a “relapse”. Later, Talia said, her niece became “as still as a stone, completely locked in herself”. The teenager ran away from her aunt’s house at about 3.30pm and Talia made a string of calls to the police, reporting that her niece had mental health issues and had epilepsy for which she needed medication. She said she felt the police did not take her concerns seriously enough.

5/13/2022,"Chloe Hooper sets up her memoir in quick strokes: two young sons, an older partner and something, suddenly, happening, rendering domestic life precious and strange. The father of her children is Don Watson (writer, historian and, famously, Keating speechwriter). The something: a common cancer and a rare mutation. Hooper, two novels and two critically acclaimed works of investigative nonfiction under her belt, turns her humane, forensic eye on her own family’s grief and private undoing. It feels like a novel, its characters engrossing, moving and funny – that these are real people seems a secondary, extraordinary feat. Bedtime Story is dedicated to both boys but addressed mainly to the elder. Hooper pores through centuries of children’s books, hunting for stories that will help her speak to him “about the real dark”. She is not just looking for language to broach the subject of Watson’s illness, but to teach herself, somehow, to be less afraid. Which isn’t the same project as seeking comfort, exactly. Traditional children’s stories, she writes, came from folktales “soaked in death”, and take little interest in soothing anyone. Life’s weird horror and joy is very much the point, and there’s a tangible, conspiratorial sense of relief from Hooper (her own fiction described generally as “gothic”) as she notes that even later, watered-down versions of these tales can rarely be entirely sanitised. The “fairytale model” takes on growing relevance in her own life: heroes, in “an enchanted forest or an oncology ward”, suddenly forced to play by arbitrary, perverse new rules. Cancer treatment is expensive, even for those, like Watson and Hooper, with private health insurance. Access to potentially lifesaving medical trials is a gauntlet of timing, luck and money – the staunchly progressive Watson finds them “obscene”, “healthcare for rich people”; Hooper just wants him to get better; they can’t afford it anyway. As they negotiate hospital and the brutal waiting game of chemo, her voice glints with disquiet, humour and uncertain rage – she is conscious of how illness lays bare the systems our societies have in place to look after each other, and the gaps in those systems. She is just as conscious of the hypocrisies revealed as we each duck and weave around them, clutching at any advantage to guard those we hold dear. Bargain with the witch. Take the gold. If children’s stories contain our myths, Hooper sees also that they hold our blind spots. Western children’s literature in particular is pitted with them: racist stereotypes, dispossession and loss whitewashed into a “deathless history” of terra nullius and pioneer bravery; anthropomorphised animals whose charming adventures erase the present threat of their own disappearance. Hooper, reaching for ways to talk to her children about “all that is being lost”, inevitably widens her lens to the climate crisis. There is something to be tied together here, about history and death and global heating – irreversible events, the narcotic dangers of nostalgia, the need to face facts. But there is no “teachable moment”, and Hooper’s attempt to cobble one up feels didactic and artificial. Because ultimately, she is wrestling with how we might master ourselves in the face of things we can’t control. There is no answer. And Bedtime Story, like the best moments of her other writing, is more notable for its capacity to hold conflicting truths: children crave and deserve frankness; too much truth before bed and “no one can sleep”. Escape is critical, sometimes. A story can be a garden between worlds, where for every vanished fairytale mother or beheaded brother is a miracle elixir, a Fisher King who – with the right words – might be saved. In The Year of Magical Thinking, Joan Didion questions the delusions of happy endings: our vulnerability “to the persistent message that we can avert death”. But in children’s stories, Hooper says, “being a fantasist holds no shame”. She notices how many of her favourites are by writers themselves torn apart by grief, and suggests they hold more than just wishful thinking: in the worlds of CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Roald Dahl, even Eric Carle, she sees “a philosophical framework to deal with the dark”. Despite its broader themes, this book is an intensely intimate portrait of one household “cracked open”. For Watson’s family his diagnosis is a fairytale in reverse, in which “all the world’s riches will be rescinded at an unspecified but imminent moment”. Hooper’s observations are inlaid with fierce, personal poetry that calls to mind Sharon Olds (look up Rite of Passage, or Size and Sheer Will) – her child’s face is “a fine-boned instrument”, his soccer game “a ballet of chaos and will”. She aches at his “peculiar vigilance” and “polite caution”, and as Watson (“all five feet nine inches of his stiff-necked, sun-reddened, impatient, funny, tender self”) sends the boys off to bed each night, delighting them with his own stories off the cuff. And she watches him watch them, “unable to turn away … allowing himself only briefly to show the gods what he best loves”. Humming under every line is the Scheherazade plea: time, more time. Across the pages, illustrator Anna Walker’s quiet watercolours bloom and fade – ghostly trees, a dark river, a solitary gull – sometimes taking over altogether as words fail. At a certain point, death “defies language”, Hooper writes. And yet still we cling to sentences. One way to throw off a nightmare – the “annihilating shame” of the terrors we have not processed by daylight – is to describe it. Doctors are now trained in “narrative competence”. The right words might not save anyone, but they do help. And over and over, Hooper – like Didion, or Lewis, or Yiyun Li, or Helen McDonald or Claire-Louise Bennett – finds them in books. Bedtime Story is a song of “the bedazzlement, the secret drench” of reading. “The right story,” as she writes, “can also break a fever.” Bedtime Story by Chloe Hooper is out now in Australia ($34.99, Simon & Schuster).

5/13/2022,"The Coalition’s muscular position toward China is not going down well with Chinese-speaking voters, while Labor is facing criticism over its more generous approach to humanitarian immigration, an analysis of WeChat audience comments reveals. The study of more than 3,000 political news stories and associated comments appearing on the Chinese social media platform, WeChat, has been undertaken by researchers at Monash and Deakin Universities over the past 11 months, including during the election campaign. It provides an insight into the Australian political news reaching Chinese speakers and how they are reacting to it. It reveals that Scott Morrison dominated WeChat news coverage up until the election campaign, but Anthony Albanese has been catching up. The study found that Chinese-Australians on WeChat were engaged in complex conversations about issues including the Australia-China relationship, the economy, interest rates and property, immigration and health. “The key findings of the researchers are that the Liberal party has been criticised for its militaristic position towards China and its alignment with the US. Labor is not liked due to its loose humanitarian immigration scheme, but the party is more preferable compared to the LNP due to its friendlier approach to China,” the study found. “The Greens have recently gained visible popularity among WeChat users with their friendlier approach towards China and a ‘hands-off’ approach towards Taiwan issues,” they said. “While we have not seen technical forms of censorship of Australian media reporting as translated in [WeChat Official Accounts] (WOAs) coverage of the election, we do note Chinese Communist Party (CCP) interference is commented on by certain WOA editors. Examples include an article linking Chisholm MP Gladys Liu to the CCP and an article about a fake political campaign that tries to connect the Labor Party to the CCP,” the researchers said. WeChat has been described as a Swiss army knife application, combining the functionality of Facebook, Twitter, direct messaging and online payments. Because it is a way of keeping in touch with family in China, it is wildly popular in the Chinese-Australian community, both as a means of communicating and for getting news. Some 86% of Chinese-Australians use WeChat “often” or “sometimes” for their Chinese-language news, according to the Lowy Institute’s 2022 Being Chinese In Australia survey. And 63% of Chinese-Australians use WeChat “often” or “sometimes” to access English-language news. But WeChat is also subject to opaque censorship rules agreed with the Chinese government and the Lowy survey found a high degree of scepticism among Chinese Australians about the type of news they were receiving on WeChat. Most Chinese-language news publications use WeChat official accounts as well as their own websites to push out their news to audiences, particularly those on mobile devices. Robbie Fordyce, lecturer in communications and media studies at Monash University, said the study showed that Morrison had dominated the coverage but that in recent months Albanese was catching up, though was still behind Morrison. Most of the articles were compilations drawn from the Australian media and translated into Chinese, he said. They did not find evidence of articles about Australian politics emanating from sources linked to the Chinese government. “A common feature of WOAs is organic polling of WOA audiences, which is used by WOAs to measure audience sentiment and tailor future coverage accordingly,” the researchers said. “Polling continues to show an increasing anti-Morrison sentiment due to the Morrison government’s approach to China since 2020 whilst Albanese remains mostly an ‘unknown’ due to a lack of exposure in major media (this trend might be reversing),” the researchers said. Fan Yang, a researcher and PhD student at Deakin University, said that for the most part politicians were not using WeChat to have a conversation with the Australian Chinese community but for attack ads and to push out campaign materials. ‘‘This is not engagement but a form of political communication. They are being given a frownie Albanese, not a conversation,” said Luke Heemsbergen, a lecturer in communication at Deakin. Politicians such as Gladys Liu, the MP for Chisholm who used WeChat in 2019, have retreated from the platform after Morrison lost control of his official account. Official accounts must be owned by Chinese entities, and Morrison and others had used agents based in China to obtain WOAs. After Morrison’s experience, there appears to have been a change of heart about using such arrangements, the researchers said. However some candidates have personal WeChat accounts which they use. These include Labor’s Carina Garland who is running in Chisholm against Liu, and Labor’s Clare O’Neil, who has received online criticism for her use of Google Translate to produce Chinese-language posts. But the Coalition has not abandoned WeChat altogether. WeChat has been peppered with political ads from both Liberal and Labor or their proxies. “We note both positive ads for parties (i.e. banner ads on WOAs) have been filled by LNP and ALP members in key seats, as well as individual accounts that run advocacy campaigns.” The researchers found that unlike 2019 when Chisholm was the focus on WeChat, this time it is Kooyong. A number of soft editorial articles have been appearing, particularly for treasurer Josh Frydenberg, which were often surrounded by banner ads. Yang said the extent of the investment by the Liberals was unclear but her research in 2019 with editors of Chinese language sites had revealed that banner ads on WeChat could cost about $8,000.",News/Australia news,"Chinese-speaking voters critical of Coalition’s ‘militaristic’ stance on China in lead-up to 2022 election, WeChat study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/chinese-speaking-voters-critical-of-coalitions-militaristic-stance-on-china-in-lead-up-to-2022-election-wechat-study-shows
5/13/2022,"“Ilove finals. I live for this. It’s something special I don’t take for granted; you don’t know when you are going to play again.” Those were the emotions of Melbourne Victory striker Besart Berisha, still on a cloud following his spectacular 88th-minute bicycle kick that eliminated Adelaide United from the 2017-18 A-League finals. Not only was it a goal to remember, but it was also a perfect encapsulation of what finals football is about. The premiership that is awarded to the top-placed side at the end of the regular season rewards consistency and sustained excellence, but the fight for the championship is all about being the best side on the day. A ubiquitous part of the Australian sporting calendar in any code, finals provide scope for twists and drama that cannot be matched outside of the framework of knockout competition. This is manna from heaven for league administrators - especially those who have had to face down a season disrupted by Covid, weather, a lack of tension, and own goals. And much like this year’s women’s equivalent, the coming ALM finals – the first that will feature two-legged semi-finals – have a number of storylines capable of etching out their own place in folklore. Seeking to forge a dynasty, Melbourne City will look to become the first team in A-Leagues history to do the premiership and championship double two years in a row. Melbourne Victory will seek to complete their “Popalution” under coach Tony Popovic with a remarkable worst to first turnaround. The Central Coast Mariners will do their best Al Michaels impression and ask Australian football if it believes in miracles. Here’s how the six contenders shape up heading into the first week of finals. Regular season: Premiers Coach: Patrick Kisnorbo Key player: Florin Berenguer First match: Two-legged semi-final against the lowest-ranked elimination final winner Why they’ll win it: On paper, City have the best team, especially if mercurial Frenchman and Johnny Warren medal contender Berenguer can return from the injury that ruled him out of the Asian Champions League. It hasn’t been as evident as it was in 2020-21, but they remain a side capable of killing games off in merciless 10-minute stretches. After doing the double last season, they also know what it takes to win and this time around, they won’t be losing the likes of three-time Golden Boot winner Jamie Maclaren to international duty. Why they won’t win it: Kisnorbo’s side has failed to beat any other top four teams – Victory, Western or Adelaide – in nine attempts this season and will need to prove they’re not flat-track bullies. Despite the embarrassment of riches they have in attack, they have at times struggled to capitalise on the sum of their parts and create high-quality chances from open play against teams content to sit back and give them the ball. Tom Glover has at times looked shaky after the departure of goalkeeping coach Neil Young last offseason. What they say: “Away from the cameras, day in and day out, the want to get better is so high in our football club. We want and need to get better and we’ve shown that we’re capable of doing the pretty things and the dirty and tough things.” City captain Scott Jamieson. Prediction: Grand finalist Regular season: Second Coach: Tony Popovic Key player: Marco Rojas First match: Two-legged semifinal against the highest-ranked elimination final winner Why they’ll win it: Unbeaten in their last 15 games, a club record, Victory enter the playoffs in red-hot form and, in a further boost, Victoria’s most well-supported club likely won’t have to leave the state during the finals. Possessing the league’s best defence, the four-time champions have improved every week in Popovic’s first year and are already resembling the best of his sides: hard-working, detail-focused and lethal in transition. Why they won’t win it: Popovic has somewhat lost the benefit of the doubt when it comes to grand finals; he has reached four and lost four across his ALM coaching career. As is the case with their cross-town rivals, Victory are also questionable when required to be the active side in possession and in the crucible of finals football could face issues with overturning deficits. What they say: “It’s a massive advantage if we don’t have to travel anywhere. We can play on the stadium that we’ve always played on and it feels like a home game for us. We’ll have all our fans here.” Victory captain Josh Brillante. Prediction: Champions Regular season: Third Coach: John Aloisi Key player: Leo Lacroix First match: Elimination final at home against Wellington Phoenix Why they’ll win it: If they’re able to score first, Western are perhaps the most difficult side in the league to break down, equalling the national league record for 1-0 wins this season. They may have cracked at times as the season went on, but on their day Western’s defence is capable of keeping anyone out and goalkeeper Jamie Young has the capability to turn into a brick wall. Under Aloisi, the dressing room appears to be happy, which can get a team over the line in close games. Why they won’t win it: The league’s oldest team, Western have been ravaged by injuries as the season progressed. Nikolai Topor-Stanley was the latest casualty and the team faded down the stretch to go from holding their premiership destiny in their own hands to winless in their last three and missing out on a week off. Now, they play a Phoenix team they haven’t beaten since their first ever game back in 2019-20 and lost 4-1 to last time out. As with others at this stage, they’re also far better as the reactive, rather than active, team: all but one of their seven losses this season featured them winning the possession battle. What they say: “After we’ve won a grand final, we celebrate and I bring the trophy to Italy, to share it with my friends!” Injured Western captain Alessandro Diamanti. Prediction: Semi-finalists Regular season: Fourth Coach: Carl Veart Key player: Craig Goodwin First match: Elimination final at home against Central Coast Mariners Why they’ll win it: Quite simply, Adelaide don’t know when they’re beaten. Or at least, they don’t care. Time and time again, Veart’s side has stormed back to turn defeats into draws and draws into wins in the final minutes – to the point now where it’s a pattern and not a coincidence. This, perhaps, is down to one of the strongest cultures and healthiest dressing room dynamics in the league. Further, Goodwin is widely tipped to challenge for the Johnny Warren medal and is in match-winning form for a side riding a five-game winning streak. Why they won’t win it: For all the excitement that comes from late comebacks, a less-heralded aspect is that a team have to be losing to even make them possible. Comebacks don’t come as easily in finals. Beyond that, the Reds are capable of playing, to put it charitably, some uninspiring football and, despite the hype that accompanies them, the Spanish midfield duo of Isaías and Juande aren’t the type to dictate the ebb and flow of a game to their side’s advantage. What they say: “Adelaide’s a bit of the underdog, and we like that. We’re very close as a group, we’ve got that good fighting mentality, we won a lot of games late and we really believe in ourselves.” Adelaide defender Ryan Kitto. Prediction: Elimination final Regular season: Fifth Coach: Nick Montgomery Key player: Jason Cummings First match: Elimination final away to Adelaide United Why they’ll win it: A few sides are entering the finals with momentum, but none feel they are doing so with quite the same amount of verve and good vibes as the Mariners. Montgomery’s side is the team nobody wants to play in these finals. They work hard, for each other, and won’t be easily beaten by anyone. Like Young, keeper Mark Birighitti is also capable of flicking a switch and refusing to be beaten. Since signing in January, Cummings has been the most dangerous attacker in the competition and transformed this team into an even better unit than the squad of 2020-21. Why they won’t win it: The Mariners have a young core of players, primarily academy grown, that have earned plaudits but that may come back to bite them as the air becomes thick in finals football. Historical data shows that in the ALM, experience brings silverware and as their last defeat – a 5-0 loss at the hands of Sydney – demonstrated, they’re not immune to going to pieces. Further, due to the challenges of recruitment and resourcing in Gosford, the Mariners are also a step below the haves of the league when it comes to depth of top-line talent. What they say: “Everyone can look at each other in the charge room and know everyone is going to work hard for each other. That’s what we’ve set up to do this year and enjoy it along the way.” Injured Mariners captain Matt Simon, who isn’t ruling out a possible finals return from a long-term neck injury. Prediction: Semi-finalists Regular season: Sixth Coach: Ufuk Talay Key player: Oli Sail First match: Elimination final away to Western United Why they’ll win it: Brisbane Roar coach Warren Moon has described the Phoenix as the best team in the league in transition and, with a number of players coming back from injury, they’re bolstered at the right time. Should they progress through to the semis – and they’ll be playing a Western side they have the wood over – they’ll also earn the right to host a game in Wellington. Good luck beating them in that environment, after they’ve effectively spent two years in exile due to Covid. Why they won’t win it: Phoenix’s goal difference is -15. No other team in the finals are close to having a negative goal difference and the New Zealand side’s tally is the worst of any to play finals. Especially when forced to chase a game, this is a team that is capable of getting blown out of the water when things go wrong. Like the Mariners, depth of top-line talent is an issue and questions can also be asked about the ability of their returning players to contribute at 100%. What they say: “Honestly, we deserve it. Not just because of what we’ve been through but because of how we’ve done this year.” Injured Phoenix skipper Alex Rufer.

5/13/2022,"During federal elections, much of the accompanying campaign coverage focuses on the dynamics in marginal seats because those results determine whether the Coalition or the Labor party forms government. But the difficulty political strategists confront is voters in marginal seats are not homogenous. Obviously, some national campaign messages resonate in all marginal seats, and, in fact, the prevailing public sentiment in the determinative marginals often drives and defines what a political national campaign is about. But a message crafted for a seat like Bass in north-west Tasmania doesn’t necessarily resonate in a seat like Parramatta in Sydney’s west. This is a central campaign conundrum – how do political parties speak successfully to all relevant audiences? In Australia, major-party campaigns are drawing more extensively on data to help with election narrowcasting and micro-targeting, especially in targeted seats. One of the fundamentals in successful political engagement and communication is knowing who you are speaking to, what has shaped them and what matters to them. Guardian Australia’s election Seat Explorer allows us to explore the incredible diversity of languages, religions and countries of birth across the 151 House of Representatives electorates. Unfortunately, the data from the 2021 census has not yet been released, so Guardian Australia partnered with academics from Griffith University to adjust the 2016 census data for the latest electoral boundaries. Some of these populations may have changed significantly in the intervening years. A recent release from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for instance, shows that the number of Sri Lankan-born Australians increased 50% between 2011 and 2021. But the number of overseas-born Australians declined from 2020 to 2021. With culture wars now an established part of political campaigning, understanding the markers of personal identity is important. For issues like whether there should be a law protecting Australians against discrimination on the grounds of their religion, or even the debate about transgender participation in sport that has surfaced during the 2022 campaign, understanding faith groups adds another dimension. We can explore the range of cultural diversity in Australia by looking more closely at two hotly contested marginal seats – Bass in northern Tasmania and Parramatta in western Sydney. Western Sydney is multicultural. 37.33% of the population in Labor-held Parramatta were born in Australia; this is significantly lower than the state and national levels of 65.5% and 66.7%, respectively. By contrast, 74.9% of Liberal-held Bass were born in Australia, slightly less than the state level of 80.7%. On other cultural metrics, too, the seats diverge greatly. In Parramatta, 60.4% of the population speak a language other than English in the home, significantly higher than the state level (26.5%). Only 5.85% of the residents of Bass speak a language other than English in the home; slightly below the state level (6.5%). When it comes to faith, in Parramatta, the most commonly listed religion was Catholicism, which 19.64% of residents listed. The rest of the top five were “no religion” at 16.87%, Hinduism at 13.79%, Islam at 8.26% and Anglicanism at 5.91%. The most commonly listed religion in Bass was “no religion” at 34.49%. The rest of the top five are denominations or forms of Christianity – Anglicanism (18.78%), Catholicism (12.95%), Uniting Church (3.61%) and Presbyterian and Reformed (2.94%). “No religion” was the most common answer in every state and nationally. You can explore the data at a more granular level in the following tables. While 66.7% of Australians were born in Australia as of the 2016 census, the equivalent figure for the states ranges from 60% up to over 80% in Tasmania. The percentage born in Australia varies much more at the electorate level – from over 83% in Maranoa and Parkes in regional Queensland and New South Wales respectively, to under 40% in several metropolitan electorates including Sydney, Parramatta and Melbourne. England is the most common country of birth apart from Australia nationally. At the state and electorate level it is very diverse. England, China, New Zealand and the Philippines are all the top countries of birth for at least one state. New Zealand is the top country of birth in 13 electorates, including several in Queensland. India is the top country of birth in 10 electorates – including 12% of the population of Parramatta. China is the top country of birth for 23 electorates, including many metropolitan electorates such as Sydney, Melbourne, Kooyong and Canberra. Of the 13 different religions or belief systems that make it into the top five somewhere, eight are a form or denomination of Christianity. The others are Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and no religion. The largest group in the 2016 census nationally, in every state and almost every electorate, are those responding “no religion”. There are just 36 electorates where no religion isn’t number one. Islam is the largest religious group in Blaxland in western Sydney. Anglicans are the biggest group in Lyne and New England in regional NSW. The largest stated religion for the other 33 electorates dotted around Australia is Catholic. Across Australia, 22.2% of the public speak a language other than English at home. In more than half of the electorates, English is the main language at home for over 80% of people. But there is a lot of variance here. English is the main language at home for more than 97% of the population in the Tasmanian electorates of Braddon and Lyons. But English is the main language for 30% or less of Watson, Blaxland and Fowler in Sydney’s west. Parramatta and Barton, also in Sydney’s west, have less than 40% of their populations speaking English as the main language at home. Twenty-three different languages are the top non-English language in at least one electorate. Mandarin is the most common non-English language in more than 50 electorates around Australia, including many electorates in metropolitan Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. In Lingiari in the Northern Territory, Indigenous languages including Djambarrpuyngu and Warlpiri, are the most spoken other than English. German is the most common non-English language in 10 electorates, all of which have over 90% speaking English as a first language at home. These include Lyons, Braddon and Lyne.",News/Australia news,"Election 2022 seat explorer: how Australian electorates diverge on religion, country of birth and language ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2022/may/13/election-2022-seat-explorer-how-australian-electorates-diverge-on-religion-country-of-birth-and-language
5/13/2022,"One of my main fears before submitting a book is that I will die in the hours before the deadline, and all the work I will have done will be for nothing because the publisher will only have an outline and the completed book itself will remain on a password-protected hard drive and ultimately buried in landfill. I have long associated handing in a book and dying because the two seemed connected on some subterranean, unconscious level. Finishing a major project is a form of death – something has ended. But finishing is not something you hear much about in all the short courses, podcasts, MFAs, online articles and books on the creative process. It’s all about starting, developing characters, a writing routine, pitching to agents and marketing. But you never get told about the end, about the toll on body and brain cells of the work, and those strange weeks that follow the handing in of a manuscript where you gradually try and re-enter the world, often with the awkward gait of a newborn foal, but the aching back, neck, shoulders and arms of a pit labourer. After I handed in my manuscript, the following 24 hours were fraught. I left my phone at Southern Cross Station and my laptop in a restaurant, and then once my phone had been retrieved, I lost it again. Two weeks on and I still feel like I’m in some sort of twilight zone, not quite reintegrated with the world. So what happens when you finish a book? Novelists are the ones most likely to suffer from a form of melancholia – grief even. They have finished a book, yes, but a world they have carried inside their heads, growing and taking shape like a sourdough starter, becomes set, and in doing so, it dies for them because it can no longer evolve. As the novel moves to the editing stage, and into the hands of others, a strange fretfulness can surprise the writer. They don’t want to let go. Read an interview with many great novelists and they describe their book as their child. “The novelist has to not only love his characters – which you do, without even thinking about it, just as you love your children,” said Martin Amis. Truman Capote took it further: “Finishing a book is just like you took a child out in the backyard and shot it.” For the memoirist, finishing has a different flavour. It is fraught with self-consciousness. This is my life – how will it be received? Have I made a terrible error? Will my family ever talk to me again? Have I revealed secrets that will ruin my reputation – OR even worse – bore the reader? Who cares about my dumb life anyway? I know one memoirist so anxious about the content of her book that as soon as she pressed send on the manuscript, she projectile-vomited all over her desk. And for someone writing nonfiction – probably in a similar vein to finishing their PhD – they have interrogated their subject from every angle and if they ever see or hear of the topic again, they will scream. They dream of bonfires, fed by their reference books. With completion, there is the dissolution of creation’s dream state – common to all writers, who exit the creative fugue only to feel the toll on their body and must face up to all the things they’ve neglected in the dream (a spouse who has been carrying the load and children who have aged, a pet that hasn’t been walked, an overgrown garden, a neglected workplace and resentful friends, and their own body – broken and unexercised, hunched and aching). And with all writers, there is also the squaring of the dream book with the reality book. There’s a part in the writing where you think you are building a kind of utopia – no one has done this before, what you are creating is magnificent. And so you keep going, whipping your body like a jockey entering the final straight at the Melbourne Cup. And then it’s in. What was your sole focus – the thing you sacrificed it all for – suddenly becomes an object of disgust or, as Zadie Smith put it, “like taking a tour of a cell in which you were once incarcerated”. All thoughts of the book now get flicked aside like a tissue soiled after a four year wank. You can’t bear to look at it again. Friends who’ve been given the manuscript and have feedback but turn up at this late stage – well, you don’t want to know.

5/13/2022,"Ruth and Peter say they are up to their eyeballs in paperwork. They have a folder for everything. “We’re keeping Big W in business,” says Ruth, 76, who did not want her surname published. The paperwork relates to the bureaucratic battles they have waged on behalf of their son Jon, 43, who has a severe intellectual disability among multiple other disabilities and has spent more than a decade living in a group home. Jon gets around in a wheelchair, is a keen Essendon supporter and lives with the rare condition Rasmussen’s Encephalitis, as well as uncontrolled epilepsy, arthritis and a visual impairment. The years before the NDIS were a struggle, but even when Jon moved on to the scheme in 2019, he didn’t get a plan considered sufficient by his parents until March 2020, after taking their complaints all the way to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Yet a year later, in April 2021, much of that same support was cut. “They have cut his core funding back by the order of $70,000,” says Ruth, affecting access to his day programs and hydrotherapy, in addition to reducing the support in his group home by about $50,000 she says (about 23.3% reduction overall). “Now we go back again.” They lodged a new AAT appeal in October. “We don’t want bells and whistles, we want fundamental services for him.” Since last year, the NDIS has seen an enormous increase in the number of families appealing cuts to their plans at the AAT. Advocates have labelled the situation a crisis, while Labor, which wants to make the NDIS an election issue, is calling for reform. Despite this, only on Monday, the NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, played down the increased number of cases, saying those appealing were a “minuscule” fraction of those on the scheme. Her comments came as a new report found there were 1,583 new AAT appeals lodged in the March quarter, a 244% increase on the same period in 2021. “It’s important that people have an avenue to appeal to the AAT,” Reynolds said in a podcast on Monday. For Ruth and Peter, the AAT process was tough enough the first time around. To battle through it for a second time in less than two years is almost unbearable. It means more work and more uncertainty. They have filed freedom of information requests (one garnered 600 pages of documents) and waded through bureaucratically worded review letters. They need to seek new responses from Jon’s specialists, working with a disability advocate from Villamanta Disability Rights Legal Service, which represented him successfully in their first AAT case. On the other side, the couple are dealing with solicitors from the top law firm Minter Ellison, one of the many paid by the agency to deal with appeals. The agency has spent about $30m on legal fees to private firms so far this financial year. Some have described supporting a person on the NDIS through the bureaucratic wrangling of the appeals process as like a second job and for Ruth and Peter, who are retired, such work is sure not how they hoped to spend their retirement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I‘m 76 and Peter’s 80 in three weeks,” says Ruth. “So we’re sort of at the point of wondering if we’ll live long enough to keep this fight going.” An NDIA spokesperson said Jon’s plan had actually increased in October 2021, noting it included some further Assistive Technology. The spokesperson said Jon received “significant funding” and said his recent plan budget exceeded “the plan budget that was set by the 2020 AAT Order”. “The Agency has today spoken to Johan’s parents, and will ensure that Johan continues to receive the reasonable and necessary supports that he requires,” the spokesperson said. Ruth disputed the agency’s figures and says there was no question the new funding levels meant Jon’s access to his community day programs, hydrotherapy and his level of care at the group home were cut back. The couple were told in review letters that some funding was “not value for money”, a section of the NDIS Act advocates say they are commonly seeing employed in funding denials. During the lockdowns in Melbourne, Jon became increasingly isolated and withdrawn. “The lockdowns in Melbourne were extremely severe, and particularly in [disability accommodation] and disability day programs,” says Ruth. “The hydrotherapy, the pool was closed, therapists weren’t able to go into his home, and so nothing was being used, or very little [of his funding] was being used. “And it seemed to be from the comments that the planner made, ‘You don’t need the funding, because it’s still sitting there’. “He won’t have enough funding to even go to his day programs, go to hydrotherapy, epilepsy training of staff, continence supplies or monthly socialisation which had previously been included. Now that has been cut back, it will not last the year by any means.” Ruth says that all the family is hoping for is some certainty. “He’s not going to suddenly go out and take on a job working at the local supermarket loading shelves,” she says. “We went to the AAT last time to actually obtain adequate services for him. Then 12 months later, at the review, the services then deemed “reasonable and necessary” by the tribunal were slashed. “We’re now looking ahead and saying does this have to happen every year?”",News/Australia news,Just a year after a tribunal ruled in Jon’s favour his parents are again fighting NDIS cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/just-a-year-after-a-tribunal-ruled-in-jons-favour-his-parents-are-again-fighting-ndis-cuts
5/13/2022,"Labor says it will establish a national threatened species program and provide a full response to the independent review of national environmental laws if it forms government.In a policy announced Thursday evening the party promised $224.5m over the forward estimates for a national threatened species program that will include addressing the backlog of almost 200 overdue and outdated species recovery plans.The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and Labor’s environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, said they would also work with state and territory governments to develop a national conservation strategy. They did not say what the conservation strategy would entail. The threatened species funding includes an extra $24.5m for koala conservation, $24.8m to address invasive yellow crazy ants in Cairns and Townsville and $75m for the equivalent of 1,000 full-time Landcare rangers to work on environmental restoration. Labor is also promising an additional $194.5m for protection programs for the Great Barrier Reef, which has suffered its sixth mass bleaching and the first in a La Niña year. The money will be used for programs including working with farmers on land management practices, $85m for reef restoration projects, and research into thermal-tolerant corals in partnership with the Australian Institute of Marine Science. “Seeing the wonder of the Great Barrier Reef is a highlight for so many Australians,” Albanese said. “But parents and grandparents are worried their children will not be able to see this incredible natural wonder for themselves. “That’s why it’s so important we act on climate change and species protection – to protect the reef and the tens of thousands of jobs that rely on it.” The 2020 independent review of Australia’s national environmental laws, led by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, found Australian governments had failed to protect the country’s unique environment. He recommended an overhaul of Australia’s system of protections, underpinned by new national environmental standards and independent oversight. Butler said Labor, if elected, “will provide a full government response to the Samuel review”. “The Saving Native Species program will go towards protecting Australia’s threatened species, including by addressing the backlog of recovery plans amassed during a near-decade of Liberal-National government neglect,” she said. Basha Stasak, of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said whoever formed government needed to deliver a comprehensive response to Samuel’s recommendations. “If we want to see koalas, gang-gang cockatoos and bogong moths survive, we need strong environment laws and an independent regulator implemented in this next term of government,” she said. “The once-in-a-decade review of our environment laws by Prof Graeme Samuel sets out a clear roadmap to achieve this.” Scientists have estimated Australia needs a tenfold increase in nature spending to recover endangered wildlife. The Invasive Species Council, backed this estimate in a recent report, saying it would require expenditure of about $1.5bn to $2bn annually. Tim Beshara, of the Wilderness Society, said Australia’s environment was in disrepair partly because successive governments “had let their environmental protection and management frameworks fall into disrepair themselves”. “The backlog of actions and the backlog of reforms for a future environment minister will not be solved with a couple of hundred of million dollars,” he said, “But it’s encouraging to hear Labor acknowledge the problem in nature itself and that there is some intent to undo the damage that has happened to environmental administration over the last decade.”",News/Australia news,Labor pledges millions in funding to protect threatened species and Great Barrier Reef ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/labor-pledges-millions-in-funding-to-protect-threatened-species-and-great-barrier-reef
5/13/2022,"Outgoing Liberal National party politician Andrew Laming says the expenses watchdog has done “nothing” since he publicly refused to pay back more than $8,000 in travel expenses he was found by it to have wrongly claimed. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea) audited a single month of Laming’s travel in 2020 after a Guardian Australia series on MPs’ expense claims. It found he had wrongly claimed 21 expenses worth $8,288.04 relating to his or his family’s travel between Hobart, Melbourne and Brisbane in June 2019. Ipea issued an invoice for Laming to pay back $10,360, which covers the travel expenses and an extra 25% loading, to the commonwealth. But Laming outright refused to pay. He described Ipea’s investigation as a “witch-hunt” that was “baseless and subjective”, saying he rejected “every syllable” of its report. Ipea typically gives MPs 30 days before escalating its payment recovery. Those 30 days have elapsed, but Laming said he has not been contacted by anyone, including debt collectors, chasing him for the payment. “Nothing heard and nothing expected,” he said. “Having zero confidence in the outcome, I intend to expose by appeal both the process and conclusions as utterly flawed.” Ipea told the Guardian that questions about the status of payments were best directed to the MP in question. But its chief executive, Annwyn Godwin, told Senate estimates last month that the invoice was still with Laming. “There is an invoice that is currently with Mr Laming,” Godwin said. “Mr Laming may choose to pay within those 30 days; he may not choose to pay within those 30 days.” “We then have a policy which says we escalate these arrangements at 30, 60 and 90 days. Ultimately, we have the option of pursuing the debt further through our debt collection arrangements.” Ipea’s audit of Laming’s travel focussed mainly on two trips: one from Brisbane to Melbourne, where Laming attended an Australian horticulture industry conference, and the other from Brisbane to Hobart, where Laming attended a meeting of ophthalmologists. The Hobart trip was taken with his partner and two children, beginning 21 June 2019, and Laming said the main purpose was to attend the combined meeting of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) and the Australia and New Zealand Society of Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeons (ANZSOPS). He claimed thousands of dollars worth of flights, travel allowance, hire car costs and Cabcharges. But the Ipea investigation said organisers were “unaware of his intention to attend until shortly before the conference commenced”. Laming, the investigation said, had no formal invitation and only spoke with organisers at the last minute, prompting them to find a slot for him to speak. “We came to know about Mr Laming’s plan to attend the conference quite close to the actual meeting and we made a slot for him to speak on Sunday the 23rd of June,” the organisers told Ipea. Laming told the Guardian he was not invited at the last minute. He said he “was invited, confirmed and registered [on] June 12”. The second trip examined by Ipea was a trip to Melbourne on 26 June for Hort Connections, the flagship annual conference for the horticulture industry. Laming claimed about $4,000 in flights, Cabcharges and travel allowance. Laming’s wife also attended the conference in her own right, for the entirety of the conference, and the MP billed taxpayers for her travel home to Brisbane. Laming said his presence at the conference was necessary so he could develop a proposal for a “food hub” in Birkdale, Brisbane, in his electorate. But Ipea’s investigation found he had not arrived until 9.49pm on the last day of the conference. By Laming’s own evidence, the authority said, he was only at the event for “the final hour of the dinner that concluded the conference”. He told the watchdog he had attended after an award ceremony at the invitation of a sponsor. Ipea was damning of Laming’s approach to the investigation. “In general, and specifically in relation to the audit report, Mr Laming’s responses have been deficient in content and detail,” it said. “Further, in a number of instances where Ipea posed specific questions to Mr Laming he obfuscated, provided inconsistent answers or ignored the question altogether.” But Laming said the findings of the report were false and that the watchdog had “cherry-picked” evidence against him. He said the investigation had confirmed he travelled to address a national conference in Hobart, attend an industry gala dinner in Melbourne and meet with independent educators. “Each leg, every event and my participation in these events were in my view parliamentary, dominant in purpose and backed by independent third-party corroboration,” he said. “With the facts clearly before them, the IPEA conclusions are bizarre and will not survive independent scrutiny.”",News/Australia news,Andrew Laming says watchdog has done ‘nothing’ since he refused to repay expenses it found he wrongly claimed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/andrew-laming-says-watchdog-has-done-nothing-since-he-refused-to-repay-expenses-it-found-he-wrongly-claimed
5/13/2022,"Economists and advocacy groups have seized on the Morrison government’s objection to lifting minimum wages by the inflation rate, noting benefits such as pensions are tied to how consumer prices change. Prime minister Scott Morrison blasted comments by Labor leader Anthony Albanese on Wednesday that he would “absolutely” support wages keeping pace with prices. That call was “incredibly reckless”, Morrison said, adding that wage increases of 5%-plus were “like throwing fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising costs of living”. However, student loan repayment costs were this week raised by a formula based on the consumer price index (CPI), while many payments such as pensions are tied to a mix of CPI and cost-of-living changes, economists said. “It’ll be interesting to see which of those the government would want to cut,” said John Quiggin, an economics professor at the University of Queensland. “Their position [on opposing inflation indexation] doesn’t make sense at all really.” The fuel excise – halved for six months in the March federal budget – is among those indexed to CPI, regardless of international price trends. That temporary cut cost the budget $3bn and trimmed a quarter of a percentage point off the June quarter CPI that the RBA expects to come in at 5.5% by the end of next month. The ACTU sparked the minimum wages debate when it revised higher its submission to the Fair Work Commission. It called for those of the lowest pay packets to have their $20.33 hourly wage lifted by 5.5% – from a March demand of 5% – for the 2022-23 year to keep up with quickening inflation. The RBA predicts a 5.9% pace by late 2022. On Thursday, the peak union body claimed Scott Morrison’s own $550,000 salary made him the fifth highest-paid leader worldwide. It also noted pay for Australian politicians has increased 30% over the past 10 years, or about 50% more during that time than the RBA’s representative “basket of goods and services” had risen in price. Politicians’ salaries are set by an independent tribunal, with inflation taken into account. According to the government’s own data, they have increased faster than the average wage particularly after an adjustment a decade ago. Federal MPs' salaries are increased faster than average wages thanks in particular to a spike after 2011. pic.twitter.com/xQgTjoVuDW Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney’s Institute for Public Policy and Governance, said the sudden focus on wages and inflation was great for labour economists – “these were really sleeper issues”. Harcourt, who was one of the Fair Work Commission’s experts from 2013-18, said employers in the past had not objected much to the annual reset of the minimum wage because it helped give them some certainty to base wages on. “The important principle is that if wages increase at the rate of prices and productivity gains it’s basically not inflationary,” Harcourt said. He said the gap between minimum and average wages had widened after 1996, the year the incoming Howard government ended the 13-year Price and Incomes Accord agreement. Ian Henschke, chief advocate of National Seniors Australia, said pensions being linked to CPI did not address increasing poverty among senior Australians. According to the lobby group’s submission to this year’s federal budget, about one-third of the 1.5 million people living solely on the age pension are on or below the poverty line. The last major adjustment came with the Harmer pension review in 2009, and conditions – particularly for those pensioners who were in rental accommodation – had worsened. As an illustration of their plight, one 75-year-old woman in Victor Harbor in South Australia recently told Henschke her rent was $340 a week, reduced to $270 after rental assistance. On her remaining pension “she’s got $30 a day to live on”, he said. The pension “should be looked at for its inadequacy” not just whether it was tracking CPI, Henschke said. “Pensioners have been completely forgotten [in this campaign].”",News/Australia news,Morrison’s objection to lifting wages in line with inflation puts spotlight on pensions linked to CPI,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/morrisons-objection-to-lifting-wages-in-line-with-inflation-puts-spotlight-on-pensions-linked-to-cpi
5/13/2022,"A plan to “electrify everything” with rooftop solar, batteries and electric vehicles would save households across the country more than $5,000 a year and particularly benefit those living in outer Melbourne suburbs, according to a new analysis. Electrification would involve fitting every home with solar panels and batteries and replacing gas devices – cooktops, hot water and heating systems – and petrol cars with electric models. A report by Dr Saul Griffith, the founder of Rewiring Australia and a former adviser to the US government on energy policy, last year suggested a $12bn investment in household electrification over five years could eliminate a third of Australia’s emissions while saving households $40bn a year by 2028. New modelling breaks the savings down for each federal electorate. Griffith found the 10 seats expected to benefit the most include several in the outer suburbs and on the fringe of Melbourne. They were McEwen, Casey, Holt, La Trobe, Aston and Menzies. For the top ranking electorate, the Labor-held McEwen on Melbourne’s outer northern fringe, the annual savings by 2030 were estimated to be $5,570 per household and $315m across the community. Others in the top 10 included Wright, a safe LNP seat covering part of the Gold Coast hinterland, Labor-held Bean in the ACT, the emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor’s electorate of Hume near Canberra, and the defence minister Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson on the outskirts of Brisbane. The throughline for the top 10 was that households were on average highly reliant on cars to get around. Victorian electorates ranked particularly high because, compared with other states, they were more likely to rely on gas for heating and cooking. Gas is piped to most Victorian homes. Griffith said electrification was the most substantial climate action that an Australian household could take, and the benefits would be amplified if an entire community was electrified, in part because it would create skilled work in the area. He recommended the Australian Renewable Energy Agency conduct four pilot programs, costing up to $100m in total and covering 300-500 households per pilot in two urban and two rural communities, as a first step. “With any change, we need to show people how it works and iron out any issues before we move towards the mass electrification of the country. “Households in these communities would receive support in the process of electrification and subsidies for new electric appliances, solar, battery, energy control system and lease of an electric vehicle.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Greens had adopted Griffith’s model as part of their election platform. The party leader, Adam Bandt, said he would like to see $235m for pilot electrification programs in a suburb and a regional town. Griffith said the analysis was based on publicly available energy usage data. He said electric appliances were energy savers compared with alternatives and Australian rooftop solar was the cheapest form of home energy in the world.

An internal combustion engine car cost about 12 cents per kilometre to run when the price of petrol was $1.43 a litre. The price of petrol has increased significantly since then. He said it was a similar story with hot water. Heating a shower with a gas water heater cost about 89 cents in 2019, while using an electric heat pump cost 21 cents if grid electricity was used and a little more than 5 cents if it ran on rooftop solar. On cooking, Griffith said an electric induction stovetop was cheaper than a gas stove and was healthier as it did not release pollutants into the home.",News/Australia news,"Living costs in outer suburbs would be slashed under plan to ‘electrify everything’, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/living-costs-in-outer-suburbs-would-be-slashed-under-plan-to-electrify-everything-analysis-finds
5/13/2022,"The Coalition has made almost $3bn in spending promises across 10 marginal seats ahead of the election, including a surprising $300m to try to flip the Labor seat of McEwen in Melbourne’s outer north. The knife-edge seats of Bass in Tasmania and Gilmore on the New South Wales south coast have attracted the most pork-barrelling commitments from the Liberal party, with more than $500m committed to projects in Bass, held by Liberal MP Bridget Archer on a 0.4% margin, and $430m in Gilmore, held by Labor on a 2.6% margin. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, returned to Bass on Thursday to make a $45m mental health funding announcement, but also to pledge $180,000 for a local lawn bowls club upgrade at Beauty Point, north of Launceston. As part of the marginal seat campaign where hyper-local announcements are used to try to shore up support, the Coalition has promised about $300m for each of the marginal seats of Hunter and Leichhardt, $250m in Lindsay and $200m in Lingiari. The promises range from those in the tens of thousands, such as $100,000 for a playground upgrade in Kiola in Gilmore, to those in the hundreds of millions, such as the $336m regional road package targeting marginal seats in northern Tasmania. Labor, for its part, has pledged close to $1bn for its top ten marginals, with McEwen leading the list of commitments at $150m, as it seeks to fend off the challenge from the Liberals, followed by the Labor-held seats of Corangamite and Moreton. The government-held seats Labor has promised the most trying to win include Herbert, Leichhardt and Flynn in Queensland, Swan in Western Australia and Braddon in Tasmania. The commitments cover grants for local playgroups, sporting clubs and ethnic groups, along with larger infrastructure and education announcements. The largest of the local spending pledges in these seats is $50m for a new Central Queensland University campus in Cairns and a $40m upgrade to marine infrastructure in the Torres Strait, both in the seat of Leichhardt. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Leichhardt is held by the Liberals’ Warren Entsch on a 4.2% margin and has been won by the popular local MP in eight of the past nine elections. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, returned to Queensland on Thursday to campaign in marginal government-held seats, buoyed up by polling which suggests Labor is on track for a modest majority government. While the Coalition is understood to be holding its ground in Queensland, Morrison’s standing has collapsed in inner-city seats, fuelling concern it could lose a swathe of electorates in Sydney and Melbourne. But McEwen, held by Labor’s Rob Mitchell on a 5.3% margin, has become an unlikely target seat for the Liberal party based on its belief that the unpopularity of the Andrews state government might help drive a swing against the Labor party that could help it snare the seat. In a boost to its chances, the Liberals have secured preferences from the United Australia Party which is expected to poll well in the seat. The biggest commitment in the seat is $280m by the Coalition for a freight terminal in Beveridge along with highway upgrades, which Labor has partly matched with a $150m pledge. The Liberal candidate, Richard Welch, has also promised a range of other spending, including $8m for the Greenhill Sports Precinct, $15m in funding for the Macedon Ranges Regional Sports Precinct, $345,000 for a youth mental health project, and $895,000 for a suicide prevention program. Mitchell has pledged $50,000 for a new school playground at Hazel Glen college, and $15,000 for the Doreen Mernda Nepalese Association’s new year’s celebrations. Speaking in Bass on Thursday, Morrison was pressed on the government’s decision to fund an artificial turf upgrade for the bowling club. “If you don’t understand the importance of places like this and why you need to support them then you’re not just not doing the job,” he said.",News/Australia news,Coalition targets marginal seats with almost $3bn in election spending promises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/coalition-targets-marginal-seats-with-almost-3bn-in-election-spending-promises
5/13/2022,"Iranian authorities have arrested a French teaching union official and her husband and threatened to execute a Swedish-Iranian man who has been held in jail for six years by 21 May, in fresh moves against foreign and dual nationals. The threat to execute Ahmadreza Djalali, a scientist, is widely seen as a reprisal for Sweden starting the trial in Stockholm of Hamid Nouri, who is accused of war crimes and murder committed during and after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The trial of Nouri, arrested in 2019 on a trip to Sweden, is seen as unprecedented. Iran claims the two cases are not related and says Djalali’s death sentence will not be rescinded. The French foreign ministry has demanded the immediate release of Cécile Kohler and her husband, who were arrested as they prepared to leave Tehran for Paris on 7 May after a holiday in Iran. Iranian authorities have accused her of “attempting to create political chaos” by allegedly associating with representatives of the Iranian Teachers Trade Association during her visit. The ministry has summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in Paris to demand consular access to the couple. There are now four French nationals in Iranian jails. Days after Kohler and her husband were arrested the EU’s chief negotiator, Enrique Mora, landed in Tehran to try to revive the Vienna-based talks on the Iran nuclear deal. Those talks have ground to an effective standstill over whether the US is willing to lift sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards. Activists say Iran is engaged in a brazen policy of taking foreigners hostage to extract concessions from the west. Iran denies any such policy and insists all foreigners are tried according to due legal process. However it has repeatedly shown a willingness to exchange prisoners and taken part in swaps in the past. Djalali was arrested in Tehran and charged with spying after a university invited him to attend a workshop. He has been threatened with execution before, but his wife, Vida Mehrannia, has lobbied hard to keep him alive. She says she might be prepared to see her husband swapped for someone the Iranians want released, but not for Nouri – the only swap the Iranians are likely to accept. Djalali says he was forced to give a false confession under torture and threats, and his family vehemently deny the spying charge against him. Nouri has been charged with international war crimes and human rights abuses in connection with the murders of more than 100 people at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj. His trial is taking place under the principle of universal jurisdiction. The latest repression shows the continuing power of Hossein Taeb, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ intelligence, and the seeming lack of influence of Iran’s foreign ministry.",News/World news,Iran arrests French couple and threatens to execute Swedish-Iranian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/iran-arrests-french-couple-and-threatens-to-execute-swedish-iranian
5/13/2022,"Officially, the government’s position on Labour’s idea of a windfall tax on the profits of North Sea energy companies has not changed – ministers believe it is not the right idea overall, but all options remain possible. However, it is fair to say that in recent weeks the messaging on the idea has been somewhat inconsistent. Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, told Sky News the idea was frankly ill thought-through, arguing: “If you look at Labour’s policy of a windfall tax, that would damage investment in energy supplies we need and hike bills. It’s disastrous. It’s not serious.” At prime minister’s questions, Boris Johnson labelled the idea a “new tax on business”. He told MPs: “Labour’s thing raises only £6.6bn, and it clobbers the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country.” In a Q&A session with the Mumsnet website, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said that he feared the plan would put off investment in new oil and gas extraction. However, he added: “If we don’t see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that’s something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.” Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, seemingly disagreed with Sunak’s thoughts. Asked about them, he told Sky News: “I’ve never been a supporter of windfall taxes. I have been very clear on that publicly, I think it discourages investment and the reason why we want to have investment is because it creates jobs, it creates wealth and it also gives us energy security.” In an interview with LBC, Johnson said he did not “like” windfall taxes, saying: “I didn’t think they’re the right thing. I don’t think they’re the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.” Sunak told the BBC that while he was “not naturally attracted to windfall taxes in general”, he was nonetheless “pragmatic” about the idea: “These companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices. What I want to see is significant investment back in the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security, and I want to see that soon. If that doesn’t happen, then no options are off the table.”",News/Business,A windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas: what have ministers said so far?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/a-windfall-tax-on-north-sea-oil-and-gas-what-have-ministers-said-so-far
