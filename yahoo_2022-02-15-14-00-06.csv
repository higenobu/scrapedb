2/15/2022,"An accounting firm’s decision to cut ties with the Trump Organization spells very bad news for former President Donald Trump, according to conservative attorney George Conway. Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, sent a letter on Feb. 9 to Trump Organization executive vice president and chief legal officer Alan Garten notifying him of the firm’s decision to drop the business as a client. It also said that the financial statements it prepared for Trump between 2011 and 2020 “should no longer be relied upon.” Those statements are at the center of two investigations into whether Trump illegally inflated the values of his assets to defraud lenders. The Mazars letter was included in a court document filed Monday by New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office. According to Conway, who is married to Trump’s former senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, having a decade’s worth of financial statements pulled by accountants is “just about the most calamitous thing” that could happen to any business with outside financing or investors. “This is worse for him than being impeached twice,” he added. For any business (including a privately-held one) that has outside financing or investors, having your financial statements (let alone 10 years' worth!) pulled by your accountants is just about the most calamitous thing that could happen to it, other than perhaps being indicted. — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 The firm compiled the financial statements based on information provided by Trump and the business. In its letter, the firm said it had reached its decision based, in part, on filings made by the attorney general’s office last month and on its own investigation and information received from various sources. “While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based upon the totality of the circumstances, we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate,” the letter said. Conway interpreted the language for his followers: ""decision regarding the financial financial statements""=they are false because you lied""totality of the circumstances""=the D.A. is serious ""non-waivable conflict of interest""=we are now on team D.A.""not able to provide new work product""=sorry we're not going to jail for you https://t.co/jbK2WUjncypic.twitter.com/NbbDhUCbrL — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 Conway also spotted a detail in the numbering system used on the firm’s letter, which he said indicated that accountants had provided extensive materials to prosecutors. check out the Bates number on the Mazars letter pic.twitter.com/tPKLL7q8oF — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 It suggests that the accountants have produced at least 525,838 pages of material to prosecutors — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 Mazars USA’s letter could aid the New York attorney general’s civil probe. While no criminal charges can be filed in the case, the attorney general could sue Trump and the company to seek financial penalties or shut down parts of his business in the state.

 Marc Racicot, former Montana governor and ex-chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), penned an open letter to current RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Sunday saying the committee would regret censuring GOP Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) for their participation in the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021. Racicot's wrote in his letter, published in the Billings Gazette, that he never imagined the committee he once chaired would ""rebuke and desert"" two Republican House members for ""performing their assigned Congressional duties with honor and integrity."" In early February, the RNC voted to formally censure Cheney and Kinzinger, the only Republicans on the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The resolution accused the two lawmakers of taking part in the ""persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"" by sitting on the committee. Racicot, who served as RNC chairman from 2001 to 2003, shot back at such a characterization, noting the committee's stated purpose of investigating the circumstances that led to the attack on the Capitol. He wrote to McDaniel that confronting her and the committee in this way was difficult for him but said he felt compelled to do what he could to ""protect our democracy and way of life."" ""Based on my decades of engagement in Republican politics, my intuition tells me that you and the other members of the RNC will come to regret, if you don't already, the passage of the RNC Resolution,"" Racicot said. ""It appears possible, and maybe even probable, that the RNC Resolution, with its incendiary language and histrionics, has advanced the very threat that you accuse Representatives Cheney and Kinzinger of creating, namely the diminution of the chances for Republican electoral success in 2022,"" he added. He advised McDaniel and the RNC to be aware of the ""Great Middle of America,"" which he said was organizing itself not by party affiliation but by ""standards of decency, integrity, honor and faithfulness to the best interests of the Republic."" According to Racicot, many Republicans who are ""less dangerous than those who breached the Capitol"" are seeking a return to ""simple, timeless and enduring values."" He urged McDaniel to withdraw and dismiss the RNC's resolution censuring Cheney and Kinzinger. ""I urge the pursuit of this remedy with the understanding that we're human, that politics is a competitive enterprise and that sometimes we make mistakes,"" he wrote. ""But I also believe in such a situation the final measure of our character is whether we have the insight and courage to humbly and honestly correct them.""",Politics/The Hill,"Ex-RNC chair pens open letter to McDaniel: You will regret censure of Cheney, Kinzinger",https://news.yahoo.com/ex-rnc-chair-pens-open-030845288.html
