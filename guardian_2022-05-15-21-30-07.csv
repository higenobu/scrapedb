5/15/2022,"A food bank charity has called for the energy watchdog to intervene after a spate of reports of penniless families self-disconnecting from their gas and electricity, leaving them unable to wash clothes, use cookers or even switch on lights. Feeding Britain said people on low incomes who used prepayment energy meters were increasingly being pushed into destitution by rising costs, punitive debt collection rules and disproportionately high standing charges. Cases it has brought to the attention of Ofgem include a single mum who disconnected her heating and electric because she cannot meet a combined debt of £15, and a man who self-disconnected after running up an £8.75 debt. It called the recent energy cost increases the “worst financial crisis in the lifetimes of the all too many people on low incomes”, and urged Ofgem, the energy regulator, to upgrade its support package for the poorest consumers. The charity said it was concerned by the “intertwined issues of debt, standing charges, and self-disconnection” incurred by people on prepayment meters, who paid higher charges for energy despite having the lowest incomes. It has compiled for Ofgem a list of examples of energy bill-related problems encountered by people on prepayment meters who have approached its members for help with food parcels, and increasingly with fuel vouchers. These include the requirement that standing charges and debts are paid off before supply starts up, meaning that even adding a £30 fuel voucher’s worth of credit to a prepayment account is in some cases not enough to enable the customer to switch on lights, fridge and cooker. It has also highlighted onerous standing charges paid by prepayment meter customers, which can amount to 80p a day in some cases. The charges stack up, even when a customer is away or disconnects, creating problems for when they subsequently attempt to switch energy supplies back on. “We have been appalled to learn of people having to throw away food or, due to their hunger, storing and eating it in hazardous ways (and becoming ill) after disconnecting their fridge and freezer at home. People in this group are also unable to afford the hot water they need to wash themselves and their clothes as often as they need,” the letter said. Food banks have reported some clients request their charity food parcels contain no food that has to be cooked, or that needs to be stored in a fridge or freezer, because they cannot afford to top up energy supplies. Feeding Britain urges Ofgem to reform standing charges, restructure debt collection from repayment meters, and “introduce any other market protections that can help people fend off destitution”. Citizens Advice told the Guardian it had seen more than 3,600 cases of people unable to top up their prepayment meter so far this year, more than the whole of 2021. Its figures show self-disconnections began to rise rapidly last October, when the £20 a week boost to universal credit was withdrawn. About 4.5 million people in the UK have prepayment meters, more than half of whom earn less than £18,000 a year. They tend to pay more for the energy they use than people who settle bills through direct debit, a phenomenon called the poverty premium. All consumers have been hit hard by rising energy prices. At the start of April the average bill paid by customers on standard tariffs rose by £693 to £1,971 a year. However, for prepayment meter customers the increase was even higher – up £708 to £2,1017. Peter Smith, director of policy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action warned that prepayment customers would be “left out in the cold” without more support. They were least likely to benefit from the government’s “heat now, pay later” rebate, which must be repaid through the standing charge. An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Ofgem is doing everything we can to protect customers during what is an incredibly worrying time for many. Customers who are struggling to pay their energy bills should get in touch with their supplier to access the support that is available such as the warm home discount or affordable repayment plans. “However unfortunately there are limits to what we as the energy regulator – and the industry – can do to mitigate the impact of record gas prices. This is why we welcomed the government’s intervention to offer energy customers additional support earlier this year.”",News/Society,Watchdog urged to step in as UK’s poorest turn off energy supply,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/15/watchdog-urged-to-step-in-as-uk-poorest-turn-off-energy-supply
5/15/2022,"In a sign of how sexism and misogyny were so embedded in Northern Ireland, official minutes once recorded Ian Paisley Jr shouting “moo, moo, moo” at a female politician. The outburst against Monica McWilliams in 1997 was part of a boorish, sneering culture that deterred women from entering politics and sought to intimidate the few who dared. Change has come. Of the 90 newly elected assembly members who trooped into Stormont to sign the roll on Friday, 32 are women – a record 35%. Four of the top 10 candidates who polled highest in last week’s election were women. The leaders of the biggest and third-biggest party, Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin and Naomi Long of Alliance, are women. Female MLAs have beamed from the assembly steps, veterans and newbies, embodying what could be a new era for equality in Northern Ireland – assuming the political impasse that is blocking the formation of the assembly is resolved. “We are very happy with this increase! But there is still much more work to be done,” tweeted 50:50 NI, an advocacy group for women in Northern Ireland politics. Some wonder if this election represented progress, as a vicious brand of sexism and misogyny threaded the campaign, leaving some candidates shaken and fuelling demands for greater oversight of social media platforms. “It was an absolute nightmare, it was purposeful, cruel and malicious,” said Cara Hunter, who won a seat for the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) in East Derry despite being targeted for sexual harassment. Anonymous trolls circulated a 40-second clip from a pornographic film, which they falsely claimed featured the 26-year-old. It was shared via WhatsApp and forwarded thousands of times. “I can’t articulate how it’s impacted my whole family and circle of friends,” said Hunter. “This was an intimidation tactic to make me feel embarrassed and humiliated for something I didn’t do. Anyone can just create a lie to just blitz your reputation.” Trolls launched a similar smear campaign against Diane Forsyth, 38, who won a seat for the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in South Down despite weeks of false claims and innuendo, including a screenshot with explicit images placed alongside her election poster. While canvassing, people told her she was a disgrace and asked if she had been involved in pornography. Other candidates suffered more direct abuse. Three men in east Belfast surrounded Hannah Kenny, of the People Before Profit party. “They blocked her path, gripping her by the arm and throat before detailing the violence they would subject her to if she returned to the area,” the party said in a statement. Heartbreaking to hear this from @CaraHunterMLA . Too many women. Including @dianejforsythe Hannah Kenny and @elsietrainor suffered physical and digital violence over the course of this election. This level of misogyny cannot be allowed to continue! https://t.co/eN3d4LDd7w In south Belfast, two youths attacked and tried to grab the phone of the SDLP’s Elsie Trainor after she tried to stop them taking down her posters. “There’s a toxicity in this election and we need a real public conversation about protecting democracy and the ability to participate in elections without intimidation or threat,” tweeted Claire Hanna, an SDLP MP. Amnesty International cited research showing female politicians were 27 times likelier than male counterparts to face online abuse. A Belfast Telegraph survey in 2020 found that more than a quarter of female MLAs had been sexually harassed in their political careers and 70% had received sexist comments. It cannot be left just to police to tackle online abuse, said Connie Egan, an Alliance assembly member. “These social media platforms need to take responsibility for abuse and harassment. But they’re very slow to do so.” She also called for young people to receive better education about the impact of trolling. “It needs to be a whole society approach,” she added. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, a Fine Gael member of the Irish parliament, told a court in Dublin this week that she felt a “cold sense of dread” after being sent sexually explicit videos during a 2020 election campaign.

5/15/2022,"The first time most of us heard of the Smile was a year ago, when the band debuted at Glastonbury’s Live at Worthy Farm, Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, alongside Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinnner, delivering an enjoyably punchy performance. Away from Radiohead, both Yorke and Greenwood’s work has tended to the austere, whether electronic or classical, so it was a joy to hear them let loose on spiky post-punk tracks such as You Will Never Work in Television Again. As with Radiohead’s last album, 2016’s A Moon Shaped Pool, A Light for Attracting Attention relies on a lot of unreleased old material that has been played live by various incarnations of the Smile’s parent band over the past two decades, given a stately studio finish with the help of the London Contemporary Orchestra. Yorke is in excellent voice throughout, keening his dystopic madrigals with precision. He even makes self-immolation inspired by climate change seem teasingly romantic on The Smoke. The languorous, sadder songs have all the rich delicacy you could hope for, particularly Skrting [sic] on the Surface, Pana-vision and the stunning Free in the Knowledge.

5/15/2022,"Embracing a diet of plant-based foods and fewer animal products is “healthy, sustainable, and good for both people and planet”, says the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health. But while meat is known as an important source of nutrients, such as protein, iron and B12, is it possible to get the equivalent value from plant-based alternatives? “Yes, but it depends how you do it,” says Priya Tew, director of Dietitian UK. Relying on ultra-processed ready meals or plant-based “meatballs”, say, is not going to be nutritionally superior to meat. In fact, adds Tew, “that can be worse”. Instead, adopt a variety of plant-based sources – fruit, vegetables, legumes, soya, wholegrains, pulses, nuts, seeds – and cook as much as you can from scratch, which, of course, requires some planning. Here’s a start: easy ways to swap animal protein for plant-based alternatives. Tofu is a versatile and nutritious meat substitute, and the top choice for Tew and Dr Shireen Kassam, founder and director of Plant-based Health Professionals UK. “It contains a good range of nutrients, such as calcium and iron, and it’s a great protein source,” says Tew. Happily, this simple soya bean product comes in various forms, meaning there’s a tofu for every occasion: plain and firm (for stews and stir-fries); custardy silken (think sauces, “mayos”, scrambles), smoked (add to salads), fermented (eat as a condiment). Variety is, of course, the spice of life, and this goes for protein, too. “If you’re using chickpeas, which aren’t a complete protein, you’re going to be missing one or two of the essential amino acids that our body needs,” says Tew. This isn’t necessarily a problem, though, if you’re eating a range of sources – tofu, nuts, seeds, for example – throughout the week: “You’ll catch yourself up on all the protein and amino acids you require.”. Make friends with lentils and beans too, whether that’s adding the former to a pasta sauce or the latter to a casserole. “People assume a plant-based diet means a vegan diet, and it doesn’t have to,” adds Tew. “You can use less meat and add these additional plant proteins and benefits in.” Deep-fried firm tofu might make a fine alternative to white fish for a chippy night, but consider why fish is helpful in our diet in the first place. “It’s a source of omega-3 fatty acids and particularly the long-chain DHA and EPA. However, there is conflicting data on that, so it’s not clear how useful those sources are,” says Dr Shireen Kassam, founder and director of Plant-based Health Professionals UK. “Fish get those DHA and EPA from microalgae and other sea vegetables, so we can do the same.” So, get those essential omega-3 fatty acids by incorporating flax, chia and hemp seeds, leafy greens, walnuts and soya into your meals. You may think the biggest hurdle for a cheese substitute is the taste, but you also need to pay attention to what’s on the label of a plant-based cheese: “Some are based on coconut oil, so that’s not going to provide anywhere near the same nutrition as cheddar,” says Tew. “If you’re just using cheese as a flavour, then it doesn’t really matter, but if you need it as a protein source, you may want to add nutritional yeast flakes or sprinkle nuts and seeds on top.” Artisan nut cheeses are worth considering but, says Kassam, be wary of the salt and fat content – and don’t have them every day. Last year, the research agency Mintel found that nearly one-third of Britons drink non-dairy milks, so it’s hardly surprising just how many options there are: soya, oat, nut, rice, coconut, pea. “Soya milk followed by oat and pea are probably considered the most healthy and sustainable,” says Kassam – just make sure they’re fortified. “They don’t always have calcium, iodine and B12 added, so it’s important to check the label,” adds Tew. For children, Tew says it’s worth remembering that plant-based milks aren’t equivalent to cow’s. “They’re lower in fat, and often lower in protein. With oat milk, for example, I’d recommend a higher-fat version because children have additional needs for growth and development.” “You tend to be able to do a straight swap,” says Tew. “We don’t rely on yoghurt as we rely on milk – children can be drinking milk quite a bit.” For Kassam, soya is hard to better, and she picks the pots that are unsweetened, calcium fortified and, if it’s your thing, with live cultures. Eggs are high in protein, and a source of some B vitamins, vitamin D and iron (to name a few); from a cooking point of view, they give structure, moisture, and bind ingredients. What alternative you go for – aquafaba (AKA chickpea water) for “mayo”, mashed banana, or soaked flax/chia seeds for bakes –really depends on what you’re making. Kassam might kKnock up a tofu scramble (an 80g serving of tofu has 6g protein, is low in saturated fat, and contains choline, selenium, and iron)or a chickpea flour “omelette”, but, again, look at the bigger picture. “The overall quality of the diet is far more important than any individualcontribution by a single food.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Going green: the best plant-based alternatives,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/15/going-green-the-best-plant-based-alternatives
5/15/2022,"Two opera-goers in full evening dress sit before a folding table on the manicured lawns of Glyndebourne. They appear almost comically oblivious to a group of dairy cows closing in on the picnic. Tony Ray-Jones’s 1967 photograph is all affectionate mockery – of the couple, carrying on exactly as if they were at home, of the posh costume in the rural landscape, and most particularly of the proximity of man and beast, apparently separated by no land at all (the artist’s brilliant illusion is to conceal the ha-ha between lawn and field). Land and landscape, and the difference between them – this is the subject of Tate Liverpool’s fascinating exhibition. There are plenty of painted landscapes on show, it is true, from Constable’s luxuriantly verdant Flatford Mill to Paul Nash’s eerie standing forms to the rolling Wiltshire hills of Eric Ravilious, pictures of horses cut into the chalk. And there are many films, photographs and videos of land that is farmed, mined, mapped, walked or occupied. But you are in no doubt from the start that it is the coincidence of the two that matters here – who owns what, and what they do with the land. The show plants its first flag at Greenham Common from the 1980s onwards, with a whole gallery of still and moving images of the women’s protest. Greenham was about land more than landscape; about the storing of Nato warheads on British soil, in the telling parlance of the time. You were stuck on the scrubby verge along the perimeter fence with a view through to nothing more beautiful than vehicles, soldiers and ordnance. The severing of the fence was not about the right to roam those Berkshire fields so much as to prevent their abuse in the ramping up of the global nuclear threat. But barriers keep returning to mind all through this show. Here are photographs documenting the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in the Peak District in 1932, led by Benny Rothman, where you see the Duke of Devonshire’s gamekeepers beating the ramblers who are trying to walk through the vast open countryside. Here is the artist Jo Spencer, naked, on the ground between a car and a Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted notice. And a beautiful sequence of photographs by Rose English of what looks at first like a heap of white litter in the colossal ploughed field of some industrialised farm behind wires but which – as the camera homes in – turns out to be a couple asleep in the earth, which is drawn up over them like some comforting eiderdown. The land is perennial and familiar – John Nash’s cornfields, Tacita Dean’s glorious English oaks, the wondrous silver gelatin photographs of peas, broccoli and apples by Charles Jones, taken around 1900 when he was head gardener at Ote Hall in Sussex. Or the land is ancient and strange. It is Derek Jarman’s haunting golden filmic A Journey to Avebury, Bill Brandt’s monochrome photographs of anthropomorphic stones on the East Sussex coast, Edward Burra’s vast and magnificent watercolour celebrating the Northumbrian landscape as a sequence of rhyming female forms and rhythms. Sometimes it is the art itself that makes the landscape seem strange. There is an abundance of land art in this show, from Richard Long’s documented walks onwards. But more potent, it seems to me, is that strain of Wicker Man wildness that endures in our culture. It is epitomised here in Anthony McCall’s filmed performance, Landscape for Fire, where a bunch of solemn 70s conceptualists are seen lighting a great grid of fires in the gloaming. It ought to be absurd – the flares, the heavy manifesto – but in fact it is feels like haunting primitive rite. McCall appears in a very muddled section titled Art in a Climate Crisis. I have no idea why he is here; any more than Gustav Metzger’s five-screen Liquid Crystal Environment, which used to mesmerise the crowds at Cream concerts in the 1960s. And it is not obvious why pictures of the Scottish Burry Man, in his coat of burrs, are included at all unless you believe that he is some kind equivalent to England’s Green Man. In one photograph he is being helped to a drink in a pub. Presumably he is meant to represent the spirit of dissent. For Radical Landscapes is mainly what the title suggests: social and political history by other means. Constable gets the usual pasting for showing a rural England where the poor are free to farm and roam the land as if the Enclosure Acts had never happened. Peter Kennard stuffs Constable’s haywain with a sheaf of cruise missiles in his famous collage. And John Berger, on screen, presents his deathless take on Gainsborough’s Mr and Mrs Andrews sitting smugly before their landscape as a treatise on ownership. Trespassers Keep Out, reads the dropped-in cartoon sign. It is comparatively rare to find a museum show these days so unapologetically devoted to consciousness-raising. There is a vivid education to be had here. What happened at the M3 protests at Twyford Down; how people tried (and failed) to organise raves at Stonehenge; how the soap packet designer John Hargrave started a bizarre offshoot of the Scout movement called the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift in the 1920s, complete with costumes inspired by vorticism and Dada, which then turned into a more militant youth organisation, the Green Shirts. But the show is just a little too tame to be properly radical. The largest of its special commissions is Ruth Ewen’s Back to the Fields, which brings pots of living plants into the gallery. There must be more impressive grounds all over Merseyside. They should have invited the back gardeners, guerrilla gardeners and allotmenteers to come on in and take over.

5/15/2022,"At the beginning of Joanne Greenberg’s striking 1964 autobiographical novel, now reissued by Penguin Modern Classics, is a one-way journey. Deborah Blau, 16, is with her parents, who try to normalise the trip: stopping at a diner, catching a movie. But there’s no getting away from it – her parents look upon her as a “familiar face that they were trying to convince themselves they could estrange”. Deborah has schizophrenia, with episodes of psychosis that they can no longer manage, and they are taking her to a psychiatric hospital. Deborah has retreated to an imaginary world she calls Yr, speaking a language nobody else understands. As we unpeel her past – a tumour in childhood, experience of antisemitism – it’s not surprising that she doesn’t consider our world to be a good fit. But we see the anguish not only of Deborah but of those around her: no one is guilty here; all are suffering. When her parents return home, they are tortured by what they have done, but admit that the family now has periods of “calmness, even of happiness” without her. The hospital is blithely sold as “a sort of rest home”, but there isn’t much rest. Deborah spars with the staff – “Does anyone ever leave?” she asks. “I don’t know,” replies a nurse. “I haven’t been here that long” – while her world, and the book itself, is full of the attitudes of the time toward mental illness. When Deborah cuts herself, she is moved to “D ward”: D for disturbed. One patient, looking down on the others, views them “with the genteel horror of a countess visiting an abattoir”, though most cheerfully call themselves crazy, bats or loony. It isn’t pretty but it’s certainly lively – until it isn’t. As Deborah increasingly hides away in Yr, the book follows her, but a little of “the Plains of Tai’a” and “Eugenia was a carrier of the poisoned nganon” goes a long way. Still, if the intention was to serve the reader some of the tedium of institutional life, then mission accomplished. Amid the sharp horror there’s a recurring theme of something like gratitude that, as Orwell put it, “you have talked so often of going to the dogs – and, well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it”. Deborah’s mother feels relief at the wrist-cutting that sent her to hospital: “at last a dragging suspicion of something subtly and terribly wrong had had outlet in a fact.” Deborah, hitting rock bottom in D ward, feels “the comfort of the finality of being there”. She spends three years in the hospital, pinballing between boredom and fear, and nothing changes until everything does. Greenberg, in a new afterword, writes that once she left hospital in 1951, she didn’t want to talk about it: “lying about my… separation from reality” was the only option. But a decade later, she provided the truth as only fiction can. She also speaks of the slow increase in understanding of severe mental health problems, the falling away of prejudice. She is too modest to admit it, but her own book provides an important step on that journey for us all.

5/15/2022,"Bereaved spouses with the right to remain in the UK are facing destitution and deportation because the Home Office is charging them thousands of pounds to stay, the Guardian has learned. People whose British spouses or partners have died are calling on the Home Office to waive the £2,404 fee for the “bereaved partner concession”, which grants a husband or wife indefinite leave to remain. According to Home Office data published last month, the administrative cost of processing such a visa is an estimated £491 – about five times less than the cost to the applicant. Many of the bereaved have no recourse to public funds and are on very low incomes, especially after the death of their spouse, so struggle to pay the high fees. Eucharia, a Nigerian woman, met her husband, Patrick, in 2014 and married him in 2017. Eucharia had a good job in Nigeria and the couple first remained in their respective countries, visiting each other regularly. Eucharia has a 13-year-old daughter, Chimkasinma. Then Patrick fell ill. In January 2020, Eucharia moved to the UK permanently with her daughter to look after Patrick. Both of his legs and one of his arms were amputated after developing sepsis. She was granted a spouse visa. While he was alive, Patrick’s income had provided for the family’s needs. He died of end-stage renal failure in September 2021 and Eucharia was left struggling not only with her grief but with the difficulty of providing for herself and her daughter. She wants to remain in the UK with her daughter and is surviving on universal credit, which leaves them both £500 a month for all their basic needs after paying rent. She is applying for work in care homes. Eucharia said: “We asked the Home Office for a fee waiver for the bereaved partner concession but they said no. The whole thing has really crushed me. My daughter has been given cans of food to bring home by her school to help us out. She is always looking at my face to see if I have been crying. I don’t like her to see me down. I want her to be happy. “I have to find money for two applications – one for me and one for my daughter, which amounts to almost £5,000. I don’t have that money.” The Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London is campaigning for a fee waiver. Nick Beales,its head of campaigning, said the charity had come across at least six cases, including Eucharia’s, and that there could be many more. The charity is supporting two women whose husbands died of Covid, while the husband of a third was murdered. Beales said: “It’s difficult to think of any possible justification for the government introducing a concession to protect grieving widows such as Eucharia, but then pricing them out of actually being protected. This is all the more harsh and indefensible when you consider that only £491 of the £2,414 application fee covers administrative costs and the rest is government profit.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office does not make a profit from fees and to suggest that we do is inaccurate. Fees are set at a level to provide the resources necessary to operate a sustainable immigration system. Those who benefit from using the UK’s migration system should contribute towards the cost of operating it, reducing the burden on the UK taxpayer.”",News/Politics,"Home Office charging bereaved partners £2,400 to secure leave to remain in UK",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/home-office-bereaved-spouses-partners-leave-to-remain

5/15/2022,"Trade union bosses are seeking an urgent meeting with Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon amid uncertainty surrounding the future of the Grangemouth oil refinery. Grangemouth is one of just six oil refineries in Great Britain and supplies two-thirds of the petrol and diesel for forecourts in Scotland as well as large volumes for the north of England and Northern Ireland. Located at Falkirk in Scotland, it is owned by Petroineos, a joint venture formed in 2011 between the state-owned Chinese oil giant PetroChina and Ineos, part of the billionaire Jim Ratcliffe’s petrochemical empire. City sources have said PetroChina is keen to sell its stake. However, there are fears that the business could fall into administration if a buyer is not found. PetroChina is responsible for most of the financing requirements at the refinery, which made significant losses during the pandemic as oil demand collapsed. The Unite union has asked for meetings with Sturgeon and Alister Jack, the secretary of state for Scotland, to discuss the situation and whether the government might need to intervene to save jobs. About 2,000 people are employed at the Grangemouth site including 600 within the refinery itself. Refining has taken place at Grangemouth since 1919. Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of Unite, said the union has been informed that there is “no threat of sale or significant restructuring”. But he added: “We believe that in light of the strategic national importance of the site to the UK’s energy needs, and in the context of reducing our exposure to Russia, it would be diligent to assess potential scenarios that involve changes to the Grangemouth oil refinery.” In November 2020, Grangemouth scaled back its capacity from processing 210,000 barrels a day to 150,000. Petroineos Manufacturing Scotland took a £44.7m impairment charge as a result. In its latest accounts, losses grew to £89.9m in 2020, from a loss of £26.1m in 2019. In last week’s Queen’s speech, the government moved to adopt the draft Downstream Oil Resilience Bill, which grants the state the power to step in if there are signs that there could be disruption to fuel supplies. Rafferty added: “Any developments at Grangemouth would fall under the domain of these draft powers. The Scottish government also has a major role to play in these potential scenarios in relation to Grangemouth, which is why we have requested engagement with the first minister and the secretary of state for Scotland to discuss alternative scenarios, and what this could entail in terms of government support.” Petroineos could not be reached for comment.",News/UK news,Unite union seeks talks with Sturgeon over Grangemouth refinery,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/grangemouth-refinery-oil-union-meeting-nicola-sturgeon-scotland
