1/11/2022,"Two Marcus Rashford moments versus Aston Villa on Monday night to sum up his thus-far lost season. No 1: Manchester United are leading the FA Cup tie – somehow – 1-0 towards the end of the first half. A high ball is hit to the striker. Old Trafford has just sucked in a collective breath at witnessing a moment of clumsy, errant, how-can-Rashford’s sleekly tooled talent miscontrol that, from a similar pass. But, this time, he brings the ball down slickly and finds Edinson Cavani. Quelle surprise all round; the point here the shock felt that the 24-year-old executed smoothly and as expected a difficult but regulation skill for the high-performance, highly remunerated footballer.  No 2: towards the end of the game United are still – somehow – leading. Mason Greenwood sees a shot parried by Emiliano Martínez and as the goalkeeper scrambles to gather the rebound, an at-close-quarters Rashford refuses to press the Villa keeper. Instead, like a man deep in contemplation, out for a walk of serious soul-searching, United’s No 10 gazes at the action a few yards away and ambles on. The point, again, being the dislocation, the jarring sight. Is someone offside, maybe? Is this why Rashford seems oblivious? No, a replay confirms that a player whose attitude casts him as a future United captain is so self-immersed he cannot rouse himself to chase down a ball in front of the Stretford End. It was not supposed to be this way. This is the season when Rashford would be pain-free, unhampered by a longtime shoulder problem, having refused surgery to play on until after England’s run to the Euro 2020 final. The procedure happened later in July, ruling out Rashford until United’s 4-2 loss at Leicester City on 16 October. He scored, as he did in the next game (3-2 at home to Atalanta) and two games later (3-0 at Tottenham). But, since then, zero. This is all very strange because when news of his surgery emerged, Rashford explained how his output had dipped because of the pain. “I didn’t want to let anyone down but ultimately looking at some of my performances towards the end of last season I felt like I was. When I step on the pitch I always give 100%,” the forward said. “Physically my 100% just wasn’t possible. It’s been a hard one but I’m coming back physically and mentally stronger.” So far, though, he hasn’t. So far he seems less strong. What, then, is eating Rashford? He has gone 11 matches without a goal – his poorest run since 2016-17, a first full season in the team. His minutes for each of this term’s three finishes, 282, is a career low, as are the 0.7 chances created per game. More unquantifiable yet a glaring, inescapable truth to most witnesses is how a player with a zest for his adored home-town club and an admirable social conscience that brings an inner contentment carried the look, versus Villa, of a man simply not enjoying being Marcus Rashford, Manchester United footballer. This is odd to observe. It may be a temporary thing, of course: a mid-season rut Rashford will fight (his spirit is not in doubt) to reverse. The Villa display may soon be placed in an understandable perspective; may come to be viewed as an on-the-night happening; a self-perpetuating phenomenon in which, as touches went awry, passes were mis-hit and Rashford’s usual purr into pockets were a chug into traffic, he became caught in a spiralling, ever-decreasing circle of inward frustration. Maybe. But, for his sake and a seriously misfiring United, the sparkle has to be rediscovered. Quickly. Ralf Rangnick’s team may have only one defeat under him in seven outings but the opposition who failed to beat them – Crystal Palace, Young Boys, Norwich, Newcastle, Burnley and Villa – have been middling, at best. The sole loss was to a Wolves who came to Old Trafford to play and tore United apart. Rashford is not the only player whose performance graph is a downward slash but his is the one of the steepest angle. It is not too late, of course: a campaign heading for the annus horribilis file could yet be halted and changed. There is precisely half the Premier League season left for United – 19 matches. There are at least two more Champions League games – against Atletico Madrid in the last 16. There could be five more FA Cup ties. Rashford is good enough to transform the campaign into an annus mirabilis. Can he do so?",Sport/Football,Marcus Rashford looks out of form and cheer at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-looks-out-of-form-and-cheer
1/11/2022,"Maya Angelou has become the first Black woman ever to appear on a US quarter, after a coin featuring the late poet and activist’s image went into circulation on Monday. The quarter features an image of Angelou with her arms uplifted, a bird in flight and a rising sun behind her, with a portrait of George Washington on the “heads” side. The US Mint said the image of Angelou was “inspired by her poetry and symbolic of the way she lived”.  The poet and writer, who died in 2014, was the author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, in which she wrote about the racial discrimination she experienced growing up. The author of 36 books – and the recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees – she read her poem On the Pulse of the Morning at Bill Clinton’s 1992 inauguration, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010. “Each time we redesign our currency, we have the chance to say something about our country – what we value, and how we’ve progressed as a society. I’m very proud that these coins celebrate the contributions of some of America’s most remarkable women, including Maya Angelou,” said Janet Yellen, US treasury secretary. The Angelou quarter is the first in the US Mint’s American Women Quarters programme, which will include the physicist and first female astronaut Dr Sally Ride and Wilma Mankiller, the first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, later this year. The American public was invited to submit names of iconic women for the programme after a bill put forward by Democrat congresswoman Barbara Lee. “I will forever cherish the private moments I had the privilege to share with Maya, from talking in her living room as sisters to her invaluable counsel throughout the challenges I faced as a Black woman in elected office,” said Lee. “I am proud to have led this effort to honour these phenomenal women, who more often than not are overlooked in our country’s telling of history. If you find yourself holding a Maya Angelou quarter, may you be reminded of her words, ‘be certain that you do not die without having done something wonderful for humanity.’”",Arts/Books,Maya Angelou becomes first Black woman to appear on a US quarter,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/11/maya-angelou-becomes-first-black-woman-to-appear-on-a-us-quarter
1/11/2022,"Boris Johnson’s government has shown “a carelessness” about ethical standards, the head of the independent committee on standards in public life has warned, as the prime minister’s ethics adviser indicated he plans to push for stronger investigatory powers. Jonathan Evans, a crossbench peer and former director general of the security service, told MPs that a string of controversies, including over alleged lockdown-breaching government parties, and the financing of renovations to Johnson’s flat, risked undermining public confidence.  His comments to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC) came as Christopher Geidt, Johnson’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, indicated to the same committee that he expected his powers to be expanded, including the ability to initiate his own investigations. Geidt’s comments, in a letter to the chair of the PACAC, the Tory MP William Wragg, follow his strong criticism of the prime minister last week after it emerged Geidt had not been shown crucial evidence during his formal investigation into the flat renovations. Questioned by Wragg before the PACAC, Evans said that overall, the system to enforce ethical standards in governments was “very weak in comparison to where we believe it should be”. He pointed to a series of recent issues, including the most recent revelation that during the first lockdown a top official invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party, one reportedly attended by Johnson. Evans said: “We’ve seen a whole series of issues over the last few months: the Owen Paterson affair; the attempt to change the rules over standards and investigations in the middle of the investigation into Mr Paterson’s actions; the questions around the redecoration of Downing Street; the very bad processes that were clearly in place for keeping Lord Geidt properly informed; the Greensill affair; and now party-gate. “All of those, I think, have demonstrated that there is at least a carelessness amongst people in government over standards issues, possibly no more than that.” Newspaper headlines and polling indicated such subjects “have reached what they call cut-through” with the public, Evan added. Evans called for investigations into alleged misdeeds to happen automatically, and to be published promptly, pointing to the long delay over a finding about the home secretary, Priti Patel, and claims she bullied officials. “One of the issues that arose in respect of the investigation into bullying investigations for Priti Patel was that there was a very, very long delay between the conclusion of the investigation and the publication of it. And I think that undermines trust.” As Evans was speaking, the PACAC published a letter from Geidt, who criticised Johnson last week for failing to disclose a WhatsApp exchange with the Tory peer who funded a makeover of the Downing Street residence during an initial investigation. The 6 January letter was in response to one from Wragg, who had asked Geidt whether in future he should be able to initiate his own inquiries, without the permission of the prime minister. Geidt indicated he would be pushing for this. The episode of the missing messages “shook my confidence precisely because potential and real failures of process occurred in more than one part of the apparatus of government”, he wrote. “These failures were not, in my view, due to a lack of investigatory powers, but rather they showed insufficient care for the role of independent adviser. “I would expect by the time of my next annual report in April to be able to describe the role of independent adviser in terms of considerably greater authority, independence and effect, consistent with the ambitions for the office that the prime minister has set out.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s ethics adviser to push for stronger investigatory powers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/boris-johnsons-ethics-adviser-to-push-for-stronger-investigatory-powers
1/11/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  If you’ve followed gaming news over the past couple of years, it has been impossible to avoid the many appalling stories about workplace harassment and discrimination that have emerged as part of a long-overdue reckoning in the games industry. As a woman who’s worked in the games media for over 15 years, I can only say that I have been grimly unsurprised by the revelations. The consequences that women face for speaking out on these issues has meant that until recently, few were willing to do so publicly. Last month, however, marked a turning point, as Riot Games paid out $100m in a settlement to more than 2,000 women who brought a case against it for gender discrimination. Other scandal-hit publishers and developers will be quaking in their boots. It is not an exaggeration to say that workplace harassment is endemic in the video games industry. Off-colour humour, boys’-club mentality and sexist or racist ‘banter’ might once have been written off as “studio culture” (I have heard this with my own ears), but companies are now facing consequences for failing to protect their employees from the harmful people who have unfortunately found a home in game development. At this point, few of the biggest companies in gaming remain entirely untouched by allegations and lawsuits. So what is it that can actually be done to ensure that the people making games can count on a decent working environment free of creeps and bullies, especially at huge studios comprised of hundreds or thousands of people? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is difficult to get executives at big video game companies to comment on this. But I spoke to EA’s Chris Bruzzo, who as the company’s chief experience officer was put in charge of creating a more positive culture both for EA’s employees and its players, and seems committed to the task. “It was about four years ago that we as a leadership team spoke very clearly to the whole company about not tolerating harassment, abuse or misconduct,” he says. “We have made significant investments and seriously stepped up consequences in our offices all over the world, to ensure that people who feel that they’ve been harassed or abused get heard … I myself have exited several people from the company in the past five years.” EA has 11,000 employees globally, which of course increases the odds of someone, somewhere behaving inappropriately on any given day. Bruzzo acknowledges that there is a tremendous amount of work to be done to ensure a safe and welcoming work environment for everyone, but believes that the biggest companies in games have the resources to combat harassment at the source. Unconscious bias training is now mandatory at EA, reporting tools allow anyone to flag issues they may be experiencing, and the company has also diversified its hiring; as of this year, EA is one of few companies to have closed its gender pay gap, according to its internal reporting. When somebody is told that they’re breaking the code of contact, he says, they will generally apologise and change their behaviour. “When you tell people about what they’re doing and the harm it’s causing others, intentionally or unintentionally, 9 times out of 10 that’s all you gotta do.” Bruzzo tells me that he was previously himself the victim of a toxic working environment, involving a boss who was a bully, and so has first-hand experience of the toll it can take. “This person would call me late at night or on the weekends and scream and yell, threaten to fire me; in large meetings they would question why I was even at the company or why I was born,” he says. “I had to take anxiety medication, my health was deteriorating … it was pretty serious. When I resigned, people said, we didn’t know that you couldn’t take it. This is very personal to me.” There are, in Bruzzo’s opinion, three things that the biggest companies in gaming need to prioritise if things are going to change for the better. “First we have to really set the expectation, be on the record, that we will no longer be bystanders; and second we need great tools for investigating and enforcing. Third and most importantly we have to take concrete steps towards improving diversity and inclusion, in our company and in our games … We’re not going to get the kind of real gains we need to get until we start to hire our employees in a way that eliminates more biases and creates diversity.” I agree entirely that if actual, lasting change is going to be effected in the games industry, it needs to be a priority for every company that makes games. People known to be toxic can’t be allowed to simply bounce from studio to studio. Lip-service to diversity can’t take the place of actual investment of serious time, money and effort in rooting out problem people and solving hiring biases. It’s an expensive problem to solve – but given the legal, reputational and share-price cost to publishers and developers who have let these issues run riot, it’s going to be much more expensive to ignore it. It’s unlikely that you’ve escaped Wordle so far this year, a super-simple online word game that went from totally unknown to ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE in the last month, but if you’re still wondering what all those wee squares in your social media feeds are, this is it. It’s extremely simple: go to the Wordle website every day and try to guess a new five-letter word. You have five guesses and it’ll tell you which letters you got right. What’s particularly endearing about this puzzle game, as Simon Parkin explains in his review, is that it was made by a guy called Josh Wardle last year as a gift for his partner, and remains entirely unmonetised. Given how wantonly capitalistic the games industry mostly is, that makes for a nice change. A few weeks ago this newsletter took a critical look at the sketchy economy behind Roblox, the wildly popular game platform that’s valued at over $40bn and used daily by tens of millions of kids. For the Observer, Simon Parkin uncovered several truly alarming stories of abuse, exploitation and grooming from the platform’s young developers, which only highlights the urgent need for more scrutiny of these platforms. Speaking of kids and online safety, the UK’s data watchdog is “seeking talks” with Facebook owner Meta because a bunch of parents bought their kids an Oculus VR headset over Christmas and were shocked to discover that it has no parental controls, and apps like VRChat are basically unmoderated, resulting in a lot of inappropriate conversations with minors. I donned my Quest 2 headset and returned to VRChat after a couple of years’ absence to discover somewhere that reminded me of the wild west of the early internet: random, full of trolls and dominated by edgelord humour. So, pretty much like most other places online. Given what we all know about Facebook, and given how endemic toxicity is in all online worlds, at this stage I highly doubt that any big tech company has the will or the means to make the virtual world universally safe and pleasant. E3 – the June event at which every company that makes video games traditionally whips up a frenzy of hype for whatever’s next – will again be digital-only this year. For me, that means three days of sitting in front of a laptop watching an overwhelming barrage of game trailers and trying to calibrate what’s most interesting, as opposed to three days of running around a big sweaty conference hall in LA watching an overwhelming barrage of game demos and trying to calibrate what’s most interesting. For the wider games industry, this raises questions about whether these huge in-person events will ever return, and whether they should. The developers of forthcoming run-away-from-the-zombies game Dying Light 2 have proudly announced that it will take at least 500 hours to 100% complete it. The Internet has reacted to this news with either excitement or a kind of dead-eyed existential ennui, depending on the age and life circumstances of the player in question. Take-Two acquires FarmVille creator Zynga in £9.4bn deal Tux and Fanny review – a surreal lo-fi treasure of a game VR worlds are no better or worse than anywhere else online This week’s question comes from Pat McGibbon, who asks: As a keen gamer and also a hobbyist language learner, I often change the settings to play games in a foreign language. Do any other readers do this, or am I the only one? You’re definitely not the only one, Pat, because I am also a huge language nerd and I also do this! It’s how I learned one of the Japanese alphabets: in order to navigate the menus in the weird PS2 games I used to play on import as a teen, I had to be able to read katakana. I played the first Mass Effect with German subtitles to make myself feel better about playing it instead of studying for my German degree. The Yakuza games helped me keep up my Japanese for a while after living there. In Assassin’s Creed I switch to the “native” language of the game wherever possible. When you’re a native English speaker it can be really difficult to find films, TV or music to absorb in another language, because English is the global default – but plenty of games have full voicing in several languages, and I find that because you’re actually doing stuff in games rather than just watching, some of it actually sticks.

1/11/2022,"A police standoff with a man who is believed to be armed and has barricaded himself inside his house with his eight-year-old son has entered a third day. Police attended the property in Coventry at 12.20am on Sunday to conduct a welfare check on a man and child.  Armed officers have been seen pointing weapons towards the house and a large cordon remains in place, as the 41-year-old father continues to refuse to come out of the property. A spokesperson for West Midlands police said: “The 41-year-old has his eight-year-old son with him and there are some concerns for their safety. Several officers, including armed police and other specially trained officers, are at the scene to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.” Dozens of officers, including the armed unit, have been on the scene since Sunday as they aim to resolve the standoff safely, and negotiators have been heard shouting towards the house. Nearby Earlsdon primary school has remained closed for a second day, with pupils taking part in lessons from home. Several road closures are in place and residents within the police cordon have been told by officers to remain in their homes where possible, but to ask for an escort through the cordon if they need to go to the shops or work. In a update on Monday night, the Coventry police commander, Ch Supt Pete Henrick, said: “We understand that this situation is deeply worrying for some local residents and we want to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to bring it to a safe conclusion. “I ask that people bear with us as specialist officers remain at the scene.” Coventry city council said temporary accommodation was available to anyone unable to enter their homes, but a rest facility at the local library that opened on Monday has closed.",News/UK news,Armed police in three-day standoff with man at house in Coventry,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/coventry-armed-police-standoff-man-at-house
1/11/2022,"Marks & Spencer was the UK’s fastest-growing food retailer in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers returned to the high street after last year’s lockdown, according to an independent report. The retailer, which lost out in 2020 because most of its stores are on high streets or in travel hubs which were affected by lockdowns, outpaced discounters Aldi and Lidl with sales growth of more than 9% in the 12 weeks to 26 December. The figures were provided by analysts at NielsenIQ and based on a survey of more than 14,500 households. M&S only began selling food online, via Ocado, in August 2020.  Lidl, which sells almost no food online, was the next fastest-growing retailer at 8.5% in the three months as it opened eight new stores in December. Aldi, which had claimed to be the UK’s best performer in the run-up to Christmas, was next on 4.8%, helped by new store openings. Nielsen said shoppers had made 27m more visits to grocery retailers in the run-up to Christmas 2021 compared with a year before, while online orders accounted for 11.3% of total grocery sales, down from 12.1% a year earlier. Mike Watkins, the NielsenIQ UK head of retailer and business insight, said: “All retailers had more shoppers than this time last year and most had more visits, even if spend per visit was a little lower at just over £21.” He said British consumers were increasingly heading in-store for a regular weekly shop as well as for last-minute purchases and that such behaviour was likely to continue. Nielsen said shoppers spent £7.1bn in the two weeks to 26 December, ahead of the £6.8bn expected and £6.7bn in 2020 when supermarkets rang up bumper sales with many high streets in lockdown and restaurants and cafes closed. The figures indicate a stronger swing to dining and drinking at home amid fears of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus. Marks & Spencer is due to report its official Christmas sales figures on Thursday, but its shares have ticked up in recent days amid hopes of a strong performance. Tesco also reports on Thursday while Sainsbury’s reports on Wednesday. Lidl said on Tuesday that its sales rose 2.6% in the four weeks to 26 December and were 21% up on 2019, before the pandemic. The company said sales of Christmas puddings were up 23% and sparkling wine up 24%, while lamb proved a popular alternative to turkey with sales up 21%. The retailer’s fastest-selling product in its non-food “middle aisle” was the Lidl-branded Christmas jumper with one sold every two seconds on launch day.",News/Business,M&S outpaces rivals at Christmas as shoppers return to high street,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/m-and-s-christmas-shoppers-high-street-aldi-lidl
