2/15/2022,"Russia is sending thousands more troops to its border with Ukraine in a sign that Vladimir Putin could extend the crisis for weeks, as Boris Johnson warned the situation had become “very, very dangerous”. British officials estimate that a further 14 Russian battalions are heading towards Ukraine, each numbering about 800 troops, on top of the 100 battalions massed on the borders – a force already believed capable of launching an invasion.  Ministers are of the view that the Russian president has not yet decided to attack Ukraine and may never do so. But the continued buildup of forces in excess of 150,000 prompted Johnson to cut short a trip to Cumbria to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday. On Monday night, the prime minister spoke with Joe Biden and concluded, according to Downing Street, that there “remained a crucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine”. Britain said the two emphasised the importance of unity and, while neither the UK nor the US will send troops to defend Ukraine, they insisted that any further Russian incursion “would result in a protracted crisis for Russia”. Earlier, Johnson said: “This is a very, very dangerous, difficult situation. We are on the edge of a precipice, but there is still time for President Putin to step back.” He said it was important for western allies to remain united in the face of Russian pressure. Ukraine’s future membership of Nato could not be “bargained away” as part of western leaders’ efforts, he added. Britain believes Russia has committed about 60% of its ground forces to the buildup and doubled its available air power in the region, but thinks Putin could extend the crisis for weeks or even longer. Although Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has said “there could be a Russian invasion almost immediately”, on Monday she told MPs in a private conference call that Putin could keep up the military pressure on Ukraine for months, according to some of those who listened in. Parliament could be recalled if Russia invades Ukraine this week, No 10 indicated. Asked whether this was a possibility, Johnson’s official spokesperson said: “In that situation, you would expect that the prime minister would want parliament to be updated and for it to have its say.” Russia has always denied that it intends to invade. Its foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told Putin in a carefully staged public meeting on Monday that while negotiations between Russia and the west could not “go on indefinitely … I would suggest to continue and expand them at this stage”. Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, is due to visit Moscow on Tuesday, although no breakthrough is expected given Russia’s demands: that Ukraine never be allowed to join Nato and that the west withdraw troops from eastern Europe. Last week the US told allies that an invasion could come as soon as Wednesday, but the continued Russian buildup suggests the Kremlin did not believe it had assembled all the forces it could to threaten its smaller neighbour. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country would not be intimidated by Russia and that Wednesday should be “a day of unity”. “We want peace and we want to resolve all issues exclusively through negotiations,” he said, but added that the Ukrainian army was “many times stronger than eight years ago” and that Ukraine wanted freedom and was ready to fight for it should Russia invade. Nevertheless, the warnings prompted the UK to advise all British citizens in Ukraine to leave now, while commercial means were still available. It is estimated there are about 1,300 Britons in Ukraine, although 200 have said they do not want to leave. On Monday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the last few US diplomats in the Kyiv embassy would move west to Lviv “due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces”. On Saturday, a senior state department official had told reporters that a handful of US diplomats would stay in the capital “to be able to continue working closely with the Ukrainian government, and to be able to ensure we’ve got the best possible information for our senior leaders and the president about what’s happening broadly in society”. The change of mind two days later suggests US security assessments have darkened still further. The UK ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, had said she would remain in Kyiv with a core team of diplomats. Downing Street said British nationals should not expect a “military airlift” from Ukraine, and that they should leave via commercial means and there were still flights available. Defence sources said the plan for any Russian invasion would involve “a sudden thrust” aimed at encircling Kyiv, but that it would be accompanied by “multiple axes of attack” aimed at cutting off Ukrainian forces in the east of the country. Russia would seek to install a puppet government, they added. But Britain believes Putin is at risk of underestimating the level of Ukrainian popular resistance to any invasion and attempt at regime change. The UK view is that there is likely to be “a reasonably well-organised insurgency” and that Russia could become bogged down in a conflict that could claim tens of thousands of lives. The US, UK and EU have been working jointly on a package of economic sanctions that would target Russia in the event of an attack, and Truss indicated to MPs in the briefing that they would probably be implemented in waves. Oligarchs close to Putin would be the first to be targeted, she said, telling MPs the UK was “ready to press send” with list of names if an invasion began. But an economic crime bill planned for the next session of parliament, called for by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, would not be brought forward in an emergency. Layla Moran, the Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said: “The concern with the policy on sanctions is that it is too little, too late. We have known about Russian hostile activities and interference in our democracy for some time.”",News/World news,Russia sending thousands more troops to Ukraine border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/russia-sending-thousands-more-troops-to-ukraine-border
2/15/2022,"Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes will host the 94th Academy Awards this year, Variety reported on Monday. The trio of female comedic actors, who are expected to be formally announced on Good Morning America on Tuesday, will be the struggling show’s first hosts since 2018. Schumer, Hall and Sykes are tasked with providing some zest for a program whose ratings have flagged in recent years. Viewership for last year’s scaled-backed ceremony, held in Los Angeles’s Union Station, fell by more than half from the previous year, which itself was a record-breaking low.  In an attempt to juice up interest in what is traditionally Hollywood’s biggest night, the Academy hired a new producer, Girls Trip film-maker Will Packer, who in recent weeks has met with a laundry list of talent for the role as emcee. And in a bid to include audiences put off by small-market films, the Academy announced Monday that Twitter users will be able to vote on their favorite films, regardless of whether it’s nominated, with the hashtag #OscarsFanFavorite. The top-voted film by 3 March will receive recognition at the ceremony on 27 March, and three Twitter users will be selected to present at the Oscars in 2023. A “super-event” loophole will allow the ceremony, which will return to its standard Dolby Theater, to not require vaccinations; guests will instead have to provide a negative PCR test or a negative rapid antigen test on the day of the event. It’s as yet unclear how this year’s ceremony will work – Variety reported that Packer has toyed with a three-act structure – and none of the hosts have spoken about the job publicly. But in Schumer, Hall and Sykes, he’s booked veteran talent with broad appeal. Schumer, who will star in the 10-episode Hulu series Life & Beth later this year, has won 12 primetime Emmy awards including outstanding variety sketch series for Inside Amy Schumer. Hall, who starred in Packer’s Girls Trip, has appeared in the Scary Movie franchise films, starred in the series Black Monday, and anchored films such as The Hate U Give and Little. Sykes, a veteran stand-up comedian and writer, won her first primetime Emmy in 1999 for her writing on the Chris Rock show and is known for roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm, the New Adventures of Old Christine, and Black-ish. The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s repressed western on Netflix, leads the pack for the 2022 Oscars with 12 nominations, including nods for stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee. It’s followed by Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel, with 10 nominations. Steven Spielberg’s update of West Side Story and Belfast, Kenneth Branagh’s black-and-white autobiographical coming-of-age tale, follow with seven nominations each.",Arts/Film,"Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes to host the Oscars",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/amy-schumer-regina-hall-wanda-sykes-oscars
2/15/2022,"“What Mbappé thinks is what Benzema thinks, which is what Vinícius thinks, which is what Messi thinks,” Carlo Ancelotti said, pretty much saying it all, or at least trying to. And he hadn’t named half of them yet, the list lengthening a few minutes later even without citing Neymar when he added Marco Verratti, Ángel Di María and Mauro Icardi. “If you start to think about the names, you’ll lose your head,” he noted, looking for all the world like a man who never loses his. “It’s better to think about what we will do.” The point Ancelotti was trying to make is that, strip it all away and there is a football match to play: one delivered by a dodgy draw, neither club happy with the result when it was redone, and one that he said “could easily be the final”.  This is the trophy that Paris Saint-Germain have been “waiting 50 years to win” in the words of their coach Mauricio Pochettino, while Madrid have won it 13 times and have come to consider it their own, even as they seek to break from it. This matters for very different reasons but the aim is the same. “What they all think,” Ancelotti concluded, “is what we all think: to go through.” And nothing else. The prize, the game itself, provides all the focus any of them need, at least that’s the theory. Attention was drawn to whether Benzema will be fit to play after three weeks out – “I will have to see how I train now; I always ‘force’ for my team,” he said – to whether Neymar, who can seem like the eternal absentee at this stage, will be fully fit having not played this year. And even to whether Gareth Bale may play too, an unexpected alternative to Benzema should Ancelotti choose not to risk the Frenchman. Ancelotti admitted that Bale might have lacked motivation at times before but said he now seeks the end to his Real Madrid career “he deserves”. A fifth European Cup would be some finale. The very possibility has put some backs out but Ancelotti cares only for how useful he could be and the Italian insisted he had no problem with the Welshman. “I talk to him like I talk to all of them: I listen to their problems, talk. The personal relationship is good when a player is serious, professional, respects the rules and the people here and he has always done so, he has never let us down in that sense,” Ancelotti said. “He has had injuries, his contract is expiring. Maybe he has not had great motivation in the past, [but] now he is good. He wants to finish here the way he deserves because Bale has helped this team win Champions Leagues, the Copa del Rey … for him it would be good to finish here well too for his career.” Of all the elements that might emerge around this fixture, this was one few expected. Bale had disappeared, not playing a single minute since August until this weekend at Villarreal. There were so many other stories more significant. There are Luka Modric and Toni Kroos too, and for all that the Italian focused on the match itself, shrugging “it’s a top game”, all the other stuff is inevitable – part of what makes it so compelling. There were a couple of moments when Benzema had sat in the seat Ancelotti now occupied when he said: “friends is for afterwards.” He had been asked of course about Mbappé – as Ancelotti would be – and there had been a smile, a little flash of mischief, like a kid aware he shouldn’t say this but was going to anyway. “It’s a big game and to face Kylian is special because we play for France together and everyone knows he could play one day for Madrid.” One day soon, so everyone assumes. Mbappé’s contract at PSG expires at the end of June and he can officially talk to whoever he wants to now. “No, my decision on the future is not made; playing against Madrid changes a lot of things. Even if I am free to do what I want, I’m not going to go and talk to the opponent,” Mbappé insisted recently – a remark that made it sound even more like his mind was made up, it just wasn’t time to say so yet. Not, as Benzema has said, until afterwards. If PSG “won” in the summer, that may well only feel like victory if they do finally win this competition. Madrid believed that Mbappé would be at the Bernabéu last year, which feels symbolic as well as significant in sporting terms. At the Bernabéu, they complain aboutt the unfair advantage PSG have, the threat they pose offered as a reason to seek a new European order, but there are some things they cannot reach, some players they cannot retain. There is something of old order versus new order about these two clubs, a cold war. Mbappé is not alone, just one of countless connections, so many stories. Achraf Hakimi, the right-back who Mbappé declared the best in the world, began at Madrid but felt forced to chase opportunity elsewhere. Di María won Madrid’s 10th European Cup. Keylor Navas won their 11th, 12th and 13th. Sergio Ramos won’t be there because of a calf injury, Madrid’s decision to withdraw their contract offer and replace him with David Alaba appearing vindicated now. Neymar will be, though. And then, of course, there’s Lionel Messi, the man who did more damage to Madrid than anyone else when he was at Barcelona. The wisdom of his signing and PSG’s entire approach depends on him doing so again. Ancelotti managed both clubs. Pochettino has twice been on the verge of managing Madrid and looks and sounds like he’s on the verge of not managing in Paris much longer. His replacement in Paris could well be Zinedine Zidane. Departing may even come as a relief to judge by Pochettino’s tone, which could hardly be more different to Ancelotti’s. Asked which club was harder to manage, he smiled, raised an eyebrow and said: “for me it’s not difficult to train clubs like this, it’s a pleasure.”",Sport/Football,"‘What they think is what we think, to go through’ – Ancelotti ready for PSG test | Sid Lowe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/14/carlo-ancelotti-real-madrid-psg-champions-league
2/15/2022,"The Tory chairman has denounced what he claims is a “painful woke psychodrama” sweeping the west and sapping its confidence, arguing that people should not be “obsessing” over pronouns or “trying to decolonise” maths. Oliver Dowden, a senior Conservative and former culture secretary, made the remarks on “cancel culture” in a speech to the Heritage Foundation, a rightwing US thinktank.  Dowden said “woke” ideology was a “dangerous form of decadence” at a time when “our attention should be focused on external foes”. He said a west “confident in its values” would not be “obsessing over pronouns or indeed seeking to decolonise mathematics”, in comments that appear to mock the concerns of campaigners for trans rights and those pushing to confront the legacy of colonialism. Since entering No 10, Boris Johnson has hired or promoted several “anti-woke warriors”, including Munira Mirza, his former policy chief, who resigned this month, Kemi Badenoch, an equalities minister, and Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. However, Dowden’s preoccupation with the subject suggests the Tories could be willing to make it a platform of their next election campaign. He gave a speech at the Conservative party conference last year hitting out at “woke aggression” and cancel culture, which he described as “bullying and haranguing of individuals” for their views. He also claimed that Labour “has got woke running through it like a stick of Brighton rock”. In his speech on Monday, Dowden sought to suggest that “woke” ideology was weakening the west at a time when it is facing threats from aggressive states such as Russia. “Rogue states are seeking to challenge the international order. And at the precise point when our resolve ought to be strongest, a pernicious new ideology is sweeping our societies,” Dowden said. “It goes by many names. In Britain, its adherents sometimes describe themselves as ‘social justice warriors’. They claim to be ‘woke’, awakened to the so-called truths of our societies. But wherever they are found, they pursue a common policy inimical to freedom.” He claimed “woke” ideology was now “everywhere”. “It’s in our universities, but also in our schools. In government bodies, but also in corporations. In social science faculties, but also in the hard sciences,” Dowden said. “But I tell you, it is a dangerous form of decadence. Just when our attention should be focused on external foes, we seem to have entered this period of extreme introspection and self-criticism. “And it really does threaten to sap our societies of their own self-confidence. Just when we should be showcasing the vitality of our values, and the strength of democratic societies, we seem to be willing to abandon those values for the sake of appeasing this new groupthink.” Dowden said the west had become “obsessed by what divides us rather than what unites us”. He added: “The US and the UK may certainly be very different societies. But we are joined by the same fundamental values. Neither of us can afford the luxury of indulging in this painful woke psychodrama … Too many people have already fallen for the dismal argument that standing up for freedom is reactionary or that somehow it’s kind or virtuous to submit to these self-righteous dogmas. Well, it plainly is not.”",News/Politics,Tory party chairman says ‘painful woke psychodrama’ weakening the west,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/14/oliver-dowden-says-painful-woke-psychodrama-weakening-the-west
2/15/2022,"The title has a double edge: it means a suit of clothes, and also the mob. US screenwriter and novelist Graham Moore won an Oscar for scripting The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch as wartime codebreaker Alan Turing. Now he’s made his directing debut with his own co-written screenplay: an amusingly contrived single-location suspense thriller, full of twist and counter-twist, set in 1950s Chicago (the city of Moore’s birth). It sometimes feels like a more refined, more well-spoken and well-tailored version of Reservoir Dogs, with besuited gangsters turning guns on each other in an enclosed space and a shot tough guy seething in agony from his bullet wound. But it has a heavier tread than this: owing more, maybe, to Hitchcock’s Rope. Mark Rylance provides a solid centre with a typically calm, coolly composed, quietly spoken performance, often giving us an opaque and unnerving twinkle of mischief. He plays Leonard, a British tailor who left his homeland (for shadowy reasons) with nothing but his tailor’s scissors, and set up shop in Chicago. The reason he’s been able to make a success of things is that he is almost solely patronised by the local gangsters: the ageing capo is Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale), who runs this turf with his unreliable hothead son, Richie (Dylan O’Brien); Richie is snarlingly resentful that his old man now favours a smooth new lieutenant, Francis (Johnny Flynn).  These bad-mannered gangsters often order fancy suits from Leonard, but use his shop’s backroom as an HQ and hangout. Poor, sensitive Leonard has to quietly accept their boozy bullying (he’s actually fond of a drink himself) and get on with the trade about which he is passionate. It has given him a skill in sizing up men’s bodies and also their souls: he knows from the way they carry themselves what sort of people they are, and how to dress them. Leonard has a fatherly concern for his secretary, Mable (a nice performance from Zoey Deutch), who is keeping secrets from him. Things go terribly wrong when a rat in Roy Boyle’s organisation is suspected of selling them out to a rival gang and also the FBI, which has been tape-recording incriminating conversations using a device concealed with the rat’s help. Now the guys have managed to get hold of one of these tapes, and if they can play it, they will discover the bug’s location and get a fix on the rat’s identity. But what if the rat is higher up than anyone thinks? In truth, the “tape” MacGuffin is a bit laboured, and the whole movie seems sometimes to be moving at about 80–90% of its required speed and energy. And there is also something stylised and slightly non-realistic about the way the nationwide mob is imagined to be an occult secret organisation called “the Outfit”, slightly different from the Cosa Nostra we already know about. But there is also a theatrical charm and composure to the performances (and once again, it’s time to marvel at the way Brit actors such as Beale and Flynn get to play Chicago tough guys). We know that these soldiers of crime are underestimating humble civilian Leonard, but it remains for us to find out what has actually been going on. It’s an entertaining, fairly overwrought piece, a little tightly buttoned.  The Outfit screened at the Berlin film festival. It’s scheduled for release on 18 March 2022 in the US and 8 April in the UK.",Arts/Film,The Outfit review – Mark Rylance’s mob tailor makes the cut,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/the-outfit-review-mark-rylance-mob-tailor-berlin-film-festival-2022
