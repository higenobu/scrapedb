3/9/2022,"Dietitian and bodybuilder Holly Baxter said eating in a calorie surplus helped her build her physique. Bulking with high-calorie foods led to muscle gain and a healthier relationship with food, she said. Previously, she said she struggled with disordered eating, and bodybuilding helped her overcome unhealthy habits. World-class bodybuilder and dietitian Holly Baxter said that to build a strong, lean physique, she first had to break her habit of chronic dieting, since eating more is key for building muscle. For Baxter, a former track athlete, the idea of gaining weight on purpose was initially ""horrifying,"" after years of struggling with disordered eating and intense pressure to stay slim in her teens and college years, she told Insider. After obtaining a four-year degree in nutrition, she pursued a master's in dietetics, and found herself working with bodybuilders, where a client inspired her to try the sport for herself. Despite being conservative her first bulking cycle, which means eating in a calorie surplus for muscle growth, Baxter said the process ""worked incredibly well,"" leaving her looking and feeling stronger than ever. ""You really have to experience it and trust the process to be able to see the benefits on the other side,"" she said. Although bodybuilding was initially a way to control her anxiety around food and weight, Baxter said the process helped her better understand how to eat for health and performance, as well as physique. ""As I learned, I understood what was really good for my physical and mental health, and it helped me overcome that eating disorder,"" she said. It was also physically and emotionally rewarding to reconcile her body's needs with natural hunger cues, Baxter said. During the bulking phase, she realized at one meal she was too full to finish what was on her plate, after years of being constantly hungry. ""I started crying. Having my appetite regulating hormones doing what they're meant to do was overwhelming,"" she said. Baxter said bulking helped her see food — especially high-calorie treats — not as a source of anxiety, but as fuel to support a strong, healthy body. ""When I started seeing positive changes to my body by having more muscle, that really changed everything. I no longer feared those foods, I had them on a regular basis,"" she said. Like many people with disordered eating, Baxter said she had specific anxieties about foods like ice cream, Nutella, and sugary cereals. In a bulking phase, she found these easy-to-eat, calorie dense foods were helpful for putting on muscle. In the process, she stopped struggling with cravings and guilt about her ""fear foods."" ""I really distorted my relationship to those foods by telling myself I couldn't have them,"" she said. ""They're no longer up on a pedestal, and it normalized my relationship with those foods."" By building muscle, Baxter also increased her overall metabolism, allowing her to eat what she enjoyed while meeting her goals. ""Metabolic adaption was mind-blowing to me — that there was a way for me to eat foods I really enjoyed without putting on body fat. I wish I could go back in time and do it again,"" she said. Previously, Baxter said she would spend about eight months building muscle, and the rest of the year getting lean for competition. Bodybuilding also involves a fat loss phase through a calorie deficit. To do it safely after recovering from an eating disorder, Baxter regularly consulted a psychologist through the process. A competition-level physique isn't sustainable, however, so most of the time, Baxter eats to maintain her current physique, she said. ""It's not something I aspire to day-to-day. There's a nice compromise in the middle. she said. ""My diet is incredibly diverse, there aren't any foods that are off limits.""

3/9/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on Tuesday rejected opposition calls to consider joining NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying an application now would destabilize security in Europe. Sweden has not been in a war since 1814 and has built its foreign policy on non-participation in military alliances, but it has forged ever closer ties to NATO in recent years as tensions with Russia in the Baltic region have risen. Russia's invasion, which it calls a ""special military operation"", has renewed calls for Sweden to join NATO, alongside Finland, which has also remained outside the bloc. ""If Sweden were to choose to send in an application to join NATO in the current situation, it would further destabilize this area of Europe and increase tensions,"" Andersson told reporters. ""I have been clear during this whole time in saying that what is best for Sweden's security and for the security of this region of Europe is that the government has a long-term, consistent and predictable policy and that is my continued belief."" Russia does not want Finland or Sweden to join NATO and late last month, Moscow made its latest warning of ""serious military-political consequences"" if they did. Andersson was speaking after meeting opposition party leaders to discuss the worsening security situation. A poll on Friday by Demoskop and commissioned by Aftonbladet newspaper showed 51% of Swedes were in favour of NATO membership, up from 42% in January. People against joining fell to 27% from 37%. It's the first time such a poll has shown a majority in favour. Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the Moderates, called on the government to begin broad domestic political discussions about NATO membership, a debate that has already started in Finland. Finland and Sweden have close military ties and a move by one to join NATO would put added pressure on the other to apply. ""It is urgent,"" Kristersson told news agency TT. ""We can't get behind a wind-break and hope that it all blows over and then be surprised by a Finnish decision in a month or two.""

3/9/2022,"In his new book, former AG William Barr describes how Trump would treat guests at meetings. Barr writes that Trump would sometimes go above and beyond the standard one Diet Coke per person. Trump would offer cigars and deal out Hershey bars ""as if dealing cards,"" according to Barr. Former Attorney General William Barr has a passage in his new book about the lengths his old boss would go in order to charm guests at meetings. ""Always the attentive host, he would constantly ensure that everyone had a Diet Coke to drink,"" Barr writes. ""If he was feeling especially beneficent, he would open a cigar box and deal out his stash of big Hershey chocolate bars as if dealing cards. I always accepted; you have to play the hand you're dealt."" While parts of the Barr book — titled ""One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General"" — focus on disagreements he had with the former president, Barr takes a more sympathetic view when it comes to how Trump handled meetings. ""Despite allowing the frequent re-litigation of issues, the relaxed, ad hoc meetings in the President's little dining room, though always discursive, could be very productive,"" Barr writes. ""President Trump would sit at the head of the table, the TV playing in the background and a huge stack of documents to his left, which he worked his way through methodically—using his big, bold Sharpie to sign photos or annotate news clippings to send to cabinet secretaries."" Trump was known to watch up to 7 hours of TV, mostly cable news, in just a single morning before heading down to the Oval Office. Barr briefly notes that Trump having the TV on in the background did lead to some interruptions, but overall he recalls the meetings fondly. ""The conversation would meander along, winding through numerous diversions—some prompted by a TV item, some by new arrivals, some by the mysterious workings of the President's stream of consciousness,"" Barr writes. ""But we would eventually reach a decision, and it was often fun getting there.""

3/9/2022,"In Latvia on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine and accused him of “starving” cities in the country. Blinken compared the situation to the nearly 900-day German siege of Leningrad during World War II, and mentioned Putin’s infant brother, who was one of the hundreds of thousands of victims who died as a result of the Nazis' surrounding and cutting off the Soviet city. ANTONY BLINKEN: Every Russian has lived or learned about the horrific siege of Leningrad during World War II, in which that city's civilian population was systematically starved and intentionally destroyed over nearly 900 days, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths. That siege affected millions of Russian families, including President Putin's, whose one-year-old brother was one of the many victims. Now, Russia is starving out cities like Mariupol. It's shameful. The world is saying to Russia, stop these attacks immediately. Let the food and medicine in. Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine.",Politics/Yahoo News Video,"Blinken urges Putin to stop attack on Ukraine, compares it to WWII siege of Leningrad",https://news.yahoo.com/blinken-urges-putin-stop-attack-161217048.html
