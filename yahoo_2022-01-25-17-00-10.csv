1/25/2022,"Getty (2) Joe Biden found himself in hot water after his microphone appeared to pick up an insult directed at Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy at a White House press event on Monday. As reporters were being escorted from the room in which the event was held, Doocy, 34, yelled out: ""Do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?"" Upon hearing Doocy's question, Biden — who was seemingly unaware that his mic was still on — can be heard saying in a low voice, ""That's a great asset — more inflation. What a stupid son of a b----."" RELATED: Jen Psaki Says 'There's a Performative Aspect' to Her Exchanges with Reporters Like Fox News' Peter Doocy Fellow Fox News anchors, including Tucker Carlson and Tomi Lahren, were quick to call out Biden, 79, for his choice words against Doocy, with Lahren issuing harsh words of her own to the President about his relationship with the press on Twitter.

Appearing on Hannity after the exchange took place, Doocy told the longtime Fox News anchor that Biden reached out to him on his cell phone ""within about an hour of that exchange"" to talk through what happened. ""He said, 'It's nothing personal, pal,' "" Doocy told Sean Hannity. ""And we went back and forth, and we were talking about just kind of moving forward, and I made sure to tell him that I'm always gonna try to ask something different than what everybody else is asking. And he said, 'You got to.' And that's a quote from the president, so I'll keep doing it."" RELATED: Fox News' Peter Doocy on the White House Role That Got Him Singled Out by President Biden When Hannity asked Doocy if Biden had apologized during their chat, Doocy responded by saying, ""He cleared the air, and I appreciate it."" ""I don't need anybody to apologize to me. He can call me whatever he wants as long as it gets him talking!"" Doocy continued. ""I think that's enough. That's enough. So we can move on. We can now move forward. There will be years — three to seven years of opportunities to ask him about different stuff.""

Earlier this month, Doocy and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki went toe-to-toe when Doocy asked why President Biden calls the ongoing coronavirus outbreak ""the pandemic of the unvaccinated"" after both he and Psaki were diagnosed with breakthrough cases of COVID-19, even though they are ""triple-vaxxed."" ""The president has said — as have we, a number of times — that there will be breakthrough cases,"" Psaki told him. Added Psaki: ""There will be people who get COVID here, at different media organizations, at companies around the world, around the country who have been vaccinated. But there is a significant difference between being hospitalized or dying, and being vaccinated with more mild symptoms.""",Politics/People,Fox News' Peter Doocy Says Joe Biden Can 'Call Me Whatever He Wants' After President Swears on Hot Mic,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-peter-doocy-says-060340648.html
1/25/2022,"A middle-aged spread may be a sign a person has “lucky” genes which protect against some diseases, according to a new study. The genes control how a person’s body distributes its fat with some people storing 'visceral fat' predominantly around their vital organs. Others meanwhile have so-called “favourable” genes that prevent this and see fat stashed away from the organs and in less harmful locations, like as a paunch or double chin. Scientists say the findings explain why some obese people (with a BMI above 30) remain relatively healthy, while others suffer from debilitating conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Dr Hanieh Yaghootkar, a lecturer in biosciences at Brunel University London, who led the research, said: “Some people have unlucky fat genes, meaning they store higher levels of fat everywhere including under the skin, liver and pancreas. “That’s associated with a higher risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. “Others are luckier and have genes that mean higher fat under the skin but lower liver fat and a lower risk of diseases like type 2 diabetes.” In the study, published in the journal eLife and funded by Diabetes UK, researchers looked at 37 diseases thought to be linked to obesity. Twenty-one of these were found to have a causal link, where a BMI of at least 30 is a direct trigger of the disease. Twelve of the 21 - including coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes - were more specifically linked to these lucky genes which determine how and where the fat is stored. The other nine conditions were linked to obesity, but not the lucky genes. Instead, they are simply caused by a person weighing too much and putting added strain on their body. Deep vein thrombosis and arthritic knees are examples of this. But the researchers warn that even if a person is, by pure chance, in possession of these fortuitous genes, they would be in better health and less at risk of chronic disease if they were not obese. Dr Yaghootkar said: “To better prevent and measure risk of disease, it is important to understand if obesity is a causal risk factor and, if it is causal, which consequences of it – be they metabolic, mechanical or psychological – are deriving the risk. “Our results also provide evidence that everyone will benefit from losing their extra fat even if they are metabolically healthy.”",Health/The Telegraph,Don’t curse your double chin and pot belly – you may have ‘lucky genes’,https://news.yahoo.com/don-t-curse-double-chin-211842379.html
1/25/2022,"State Rep. Gerald Brady announced Friday he would be stepping down from his position as the representative of Delaware's fourth district effective February due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Brady, who served as a member of the Delaware Army National Guard during conflicts in the Middle East two decades ago, revealed he was diagnosed with PTSD and would be resigning from his position on Feb. 4, according to WDEL.

“The grim reality of this condition for those of us who live with it is long periods of silent suffering, which can be punctuated by episodes or conduct that may make little sense to people who do not understand the nature of PTSD,” he said in the statement.

“The challenges that returning veterans face can create situational stresses, which have a cumulative effect and take a great toll on an individual,” Brady continued. “Personal and professional challenges or other traumatic events can exacerbate PTSD.”

Brady’s announcement came months after he inadvertently sent an email on June 27, 2021, containing an anti-Asian slur to a person advocating for the decriminalization of prostitution. The email referred to Asian women as ""ch*nk broads"".

A spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus explained Brady was supposed to send the email to a private citizen who was helping him summarize a Princeton University study on the matter, NextShark previously reported.

Brady took to social media to apologize for his actions. He then announced days later that he would no longer run for re-election.

It iss unclear if the backlash is related to his decision to resign, as many had called on him to step down following the outrage in 2021.

A report from Delaware Online also revealed that Brady is being investigated for a shoplifting incident, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation confirmed.

A special election will be conducted to fill in Brady’s position in the House for the remainder of his term. His replacement will not be allowed to run for reelection in the next 10 months, as Brady’s district is set to be absorbed by neighboring districts to accommodate the population growth in Sussex County.
