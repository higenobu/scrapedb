1/27/2022,"The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise rates in March for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic struck the US as it attempts to curb rising prices.  After its latest two-day meeting the central bank announced that it would leave interest rates close to zero for now but signaled it was preparing to raise them at its next meeting. At a press conference, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said the central bank would continue to monitor the course of the pandemic, inflation and unemployment but gave his clearest signal yet that the US’s historically low interest rates would start to rise soon. “I would say the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so,” said Powell. “The economy no longer needs sustained monetary policy support,” he said. The central bank cut rates to close to zero when the coronavirus pandemic hit the US in March 2020 and began pumping money into the economy by buying financial assets in order to stave off a potential financial collapse. At this week’s meeting, the Fed committee approved one final round of asset purchases, which will bring that stimulus program to a conclusion by March. The Fed has a dual mandate: to maximize employment and to keep prices stable.In recent months inflation has risen sharply to an annual rate of 7% and the unemployment rate has fallen back 3.9%, close to pre-pandemic levels. It has signaled for months that rate rises are coming in order to tamp down price rises and Powell said there was “quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market”. But the end of the Fed’s easy money policy has rattled investors. The announcement follows days of wild swings on the stock markets where investors have worried about the speed with which the Fed will end its era of easy money and the impact on the global economy from rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine. US stock markets plummeted on Monday and Tuesday only to regain most of their losses. Nevertheless, by Tuesday the S&P 500 had recorded its worst-ever losses for the start of a year with the once hot tech sector contributing most of those losses. US stock markets recovered ground on Wednesday but fell as Powell outlined the Fed’s plans.",News/Business,US Federal Reserve indicates increase in interest rates as inflation rises,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/us-federal-reserve-rise-interest-inflation

1/27/2022,"Professional female footballers in England are to benefit from maternity and long-term sickness cover in a landmark change to their contracts. The move was hailed as a “great step forward” by the Sunderland Central MP, Julie Elliott, after she convened a debate in parliament on women’s experiences of playing football in England. The change has been agreed by the Football Association and Professional Footballers’ Association.  Players at the 24 clubs in the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship will be guaranteed such cover for the first time. Details have been finalised only recently and have yet to be unveiled. “I pay tribute to all those that have worked so hard to get to this point,” Elliott said. The FA said in March 2020 that maternity provisions were not in its standard player contract, which is drawn up in consultation with the PFA, and that maternity cover was at the discretion of clubs. Calls have grown for more to be done to support female players who choose to have children, with an increasing number deciding not to wait until they retire to start a family. They include high-profile players such as the US forward Alex Morgan, whose daughter Charlie was born in May 2020. Morgan returned to action, with Tottenham, that November. Fifa announced in the same month that it would introduce a set of minimum rights for contracted players globally, with measures that would lead to clubs facing fines and transfer bans if they discriminated against players during pregnancy. However, those proposals – a minimum 14 weeks of paid maternity leave with at least eight weeks after birth at two-thirds of a player’s salary - were criticised for not going far enough. “We’ve seen how long it has taken Alex Morgan, one of the best players in the world that probably has the best people around her and the best access to staff [to come back from having a baby],” said the Watford striker and mum of two Helen Ward at the time. “For everyone else you’ve got to think it’s going to take similar if not more. It’s a tough subject and one that needs a lot of work.” In a Westminster Hall debate convened by Elliott, female players’ experiences were discussed in light of the near collapse of Coventry United, where, two days before Christmas and highlighting the precarious nature of player contracts, the squad were told their contracts had been terminated and the club would be going into voluntary liquidation. Taiwo Owatemi, the MP for Coventry North West, said: “Women playing professional football are often faced with short contracts, low pay and poor working conditions. It is important that we look into how to best ensure that what almost happened to my local women’s team in Coventry before Christmas does not become the norm.” Several MPs urged the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, to announce whether and when there would be a review into women’s football after the fan-led review recommended one but he would not be drawn, stating that an answer would be included in the government’s reply to the report’s recommendations in the summer. Huddleston said the Women’s World Cup and Women’s Euros had met the criteria of having “a special national resonance” and would likely be added to the ‘crown jewels’ list of protected events. That means tournaments would be available on free-to-air TV to ensure the widest possible access to the biggest events in the women’s game.",Sport/Football,Female footballers in England get maternity cover after landmark change,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/female-footballers-in-england-get-maternity-cover-after-landmark-change
1/27/2022,"Those who survive the perilous sea crossing between the Bahamas and the US describe a nightmarish odyssey of vomit, sweat and fear. “It’s suicide – Russian roulette,” one Brazilian migrant recalled in a 2017 interview after at least a dozen fellow countrymen vanished while attempting the same illegal voyage across the Florida Straits.  Late last year, tears filled the eyes of one victim’s mother as she told the Guardian how her son had never made it back to their remote home in the Amazon after traveling to the Bahamas en route to the “American dream”. Despite the dangers, people from countries as far apart as Cuba and China continue, with the help of people smugglers, to use the islands as a springboard into the US – sometimes with devastating consequences. On Wednesday search teams were scouring the shark-infested waters off Florida for any sign of the 39 people lost when their vessel capsized more than three days earlier. One body has been found. The only known survivor, whose nationality was not revealed, told authorities the group had set off from the Bahamas’ Bimini island, 50 miles east of Miami, on Saturday night before encountering 9ft swells and 23mph winds. None of the passengers were wearing life jackets. Most of those taking the Bahamas route into the US hail from a trio of Caribbean countries. Between October 2020 and last September 838 Cubans, 1,521 Haitians and 742 Dominicans were apprehended by the US Coast Guard. Cuba is currently suffering its worst economic crisis since the 1990s and a political crackdown designed to quell a rare explosion of unrest, while Haiti, still recovering from 2010’s catastrophic earthquake, was thrown further into turmoil by another earthquake and its president’s assassination last year. But a growing number of South Americans are also reportedly using the route, among them Colombians, Ecuadorians and Brazilians, as well as east Asians. In January 2020 10 Chinese citizens were arrested trying to reach the US by boat, according to the Bahamian newspaper the Tribune. In 2017 an official from Brazil’s foreign ministry said its nationals had been using the smuggling route – seen as preferable to the trek across cartel-controlled deserts and mountains in Mexico – for at least five years. “[It’s] seen as being much safer and more comfortable. It doesn’t involve crossing a heavily monitored border on foot and so it has always been a very expensive route,” Luiza Lopes da Silva told the TV program Fantástico, which said coyotes charged up to 70,000 reais (£9,500) for the trip on a fishing boat. The Brazilian survivor recalled feeling duped by the aquatic coyotes who spirited him across the Florida Straits, albeit successfully, under the cover of darkness. “My crossing was a nightmare. It was a small boat, the sea was choppy, there were storms. There wasn’t enough food or water,” the man complained of the 12-hour ordeal. “When you’re in Brazil they promise you’ll be traveling in a top-notch vessel, like a yacht, with four people tops. But when you arrive they change everything. They send 15, 20, 30 people on a single boat, and won’t leave until they have enough people,” they added. The Florida shipwreck is the latest humanitarian drama to expose the Covid-fuelled migration crisis gripping Latin America and the Caribbean, where the pandemic has killed more than 1.5 million people and wreaked economic havoc. Last year more than 125,000, mostly Haitian migrants – among them elderly women and children - hiked through the Darién Gap, a snake-ridden jungle between Colombia and Panama, to reach the US after abandoning their homes in South America. “God got us out of there,” said Edner Michel, a 38-year-old Haitian who recently braved the Darién with his wife and newborn child after leaving Brazil because of the crunch. “The feeling I had was that 95% of people who went in there would die.” Meghan López, the International Rescue Committee’s vice-president for Latin America, predicted the exodus would continue in 2022 as families sought to escape pre-existing crises such as poverty, hunger, violence and political turmoil that had often been exacerbated by Covid-19. “These are crazy choices and yet they are not made by crazy people,” López said of their treacherous journeys. “They are made by desperate people making the very best decision that they can make in what are impossible conditions.”",News/World news,‘It’s Russian roulette’: migrants describe nightmarish route across Florida Straits,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/migrants-describe-nightmarish-route-across-florida-straits
1/27/2022,"In his spare time, Justice Stephen Breyer enjoyed taking the bench at humorous “mock trials” of characters such as Macbeth and Richard III for Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company. The case usually turned on epic battles over succession. Now Washington is about to be consumed by the question of who will inherit Breyer’s crown following his reported decision to retire from the US supreme court. At 83, he is its oldest member, one of three liberals outnumbered by six conservatives.  This is a perfectly timed political gift for Joe Biden, aware that choosing a supreme court justice is one of the most consequential decisions that any president can make. After a year in the White House, Biden was limping with a stalled legislative agenda, a tenacious pandemic and Vladimir Putin threatening Ukraine. He was a tired brand in desperate need of a relaunch, a tough ask at the age of 79. Breyer has provided it, instantly changing the conversation. “This has to feel like a political elixir right now,” observed Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s Meet the Press Daily show. A vacancy on the highest court enables Biden to rally the Democratic base and begin to cement a legacy that, despite early ambitions, had recently looked to be in jeopardy. Although the ideological balance of the court will not change, Biden could choose a young liberal who will serve for decades. The Senate, which must approve his choice, is divided between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans with Vice-President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaker vote. Breyer has given it enough time to confirm the president’s pick before the midterm elections could shift the balance of power. Democratic divisions have been on display of late but a supreme court vacancy typically unites a party like nothing else. Even senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who broke ranks over the Build Back Better plan and voting rights, have voted for every Biden nominee to the lower courts so far. Both will presumably regard this confirmation as an easy way to win back some favour with angry liberals. Not for the first time, however, Biden has raised expectations. At a debate in the 2020 Democratic primary, he declared: “I’m looking forward to making sure there’s a Black woman on the supreme court, to make sure we, in fact, get every representation.” His judicial appointments so far have been historically diverse, and Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters after the news of Breyer’s imminent retirement broke that Biden “certainly stands by” his promise. The upshot is that if he now nominates anyone other than a Black woman, there will be disappointment on the left. Sean Eldridge, founder and president of the progressive group Stand Up America, said on Wednesday: “President Biden promised to appoint the country’s first-ever Black woman supreme court justice, and he must make good on that promise. “The president and vice-president’s voters are watching eagerly to see that he follows through and makes history with his first supreme court nomination.” Potential candidates include the US circuit judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, California supreme court justice Leondra Kruger, civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill and US district judge Michelle Childs, a favourite of the South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, a Biden ally. Notably, when Jackson was confirmed last year to the influential US court of appeals for the DC circuit, often seen as a springboard to supreme court, the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with Democrats in favour. Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond, said: “I expect that the Democrats will remain united, as they have so far, because all Democratic members, including Senators Manchin and Sinema, have voted for all of Biden’s lower court nominees. “Most GOP senators have voted against many Biden lower court nominees. The major exception is Lindsey Graham, who has voted for many Biden lower court nominees in committee and on the floor. Senators Collins and Murkowski have also voted to confirm a number of Biden lower court nominees. If the Democrats vote together, they do not need GOP votes.” It remains an open question whether a handful of Republicans might back Biden’s nominee given the politicisation of the court in recent years – from Republicans blocking Barack Obama’s pick Merrick Garland to the rancour that surrounded Donald Trump’s three appointments, and the court’s imminent decision on the constitutional right to abortion. In an ominous statement on Wednesday, Graham said: “If all Democrats hang together – which I expect they will – they have the power to replace Justice Breyer in 2022 without one Republican vote in support. Elections have consequences, and that is most evident when it comes to fulfilling vacancies on the supreme court.” Meanwhile, Carrie Severino, president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, fired the first shots of a partisan battle to come. “The left bullied Justice Breyer into retirement and now it will demand a justice who rubber-stamps its liberal political agenda,” she said. “And that’s what the Democrats will give them, because they’re beholden to the dark money supporters who helped elect them.” Yet it is Republicans who waged a multi-generational project to tilt the court in their favour with the help of the Federalist Society, which created a pipeline of young, ideologically rightwing lawyers. Trump’s release during the 2016 election of a shortlist of judges for the court helped him secure the conservative base; his three justices are likely to be his most lasting legacy. Democrats were criticised for being slow to wake up to the threat and lacking similar aggression. Now, thanks to Breyer’s retirement, they find themselves with the unaccustomed comfort of having political momentum on their side.",News/US news,Battered Biden gets chance to change political narrative as Breyer retires,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/joe-biden-stephen-breyer-retires-supreme-court
1/27/2022,"The UK’s equalities watchdog has written to the Scottish government asking it to pause plans to simplify the legal requirements for gender recognition. LGBT+ equality campaigners hit back at the unexpected intervention by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, describing its approach as “deeply troubling” and “failing to stand up for equality for trans people”.  The EHRC, which monitors equality and human rights across England, Scotland and Wales, told Shona Robison, the minister responsible for the reforms, that “more detailed consideration” was required. The Scottish government is expected to bring forward plans to introduce a simplified system by which transgender people can change the sex recorded on their birth certificate – known as self-identification – towards the end of February. Proponents of the reforms underline that this change in the law does not affect the spaces or services transgender people use in their day-to-day lives, and would not see them gain any new rights in that regard that they do not already have. Responding to the letter, the Scottish government emphasised that “our support for trans rights does not conflict with our continued strong commitment to advance equality and to protect and uphold women’s rights.”. The LGBT rights charity Stonewall accused the commission of “calling for further delays to legislation that our communities have been waiting on for many years.”. In a statement, the charity said: “We are deeply troubled by the approach that the EHRC is taking to trans people’s human rights. Their approach appears to focus on pleasing a noisy minority of anti-trans activists, rather than promoting human rights for all LGBTQ+ people.” Tim Hopkins, director of the Scotland-wide Equality Network, questioned the independence of the EHRC from the UK government, which shelved plans for similar reforms to gender recognition legislation in 2020. “Its board is directly appointed by Liz Truss and the UK government ... We do not need UK government appointees telling us in Scotland how to legislate in devolved areas, and we look forward to the Scottish government proceeding with this legislation soon.” The EHRC responded that impartiality was “a core value” of the commission and that all decisions “are made independently of any government”. The letter, sent from ECHR chair, Baroness Kishwer Falkner, to Robison on Wednesday afternoon, raised concern “at the polarised debate” around transgender law reform. Kishwer Falkner wrote that “some lawyers, academics, data users and others have increasingly expressed concerns about the potential implications of changing the current criteria for obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate”. “The potential consequences include those relating to the collection and use of data, participation and drug testing in competitive sport, measures to address barriers facing women, and practices within the criminal justice system, inter alia”. “As such, we consider that more detailed consideration is needed before any change is made to the provisions in the act”. Vic Valentine, manager of Scottish Trans, pointed out that reform of gender recognition “is one of the most consulted-on policies of all time”, with two public consultations since 2017. “The EHRC itself responded to both public consultations, supporting reform”. A Scottishgovernment spokesperson said: “We will consider the EHRC’s views, which have changed from their response to the 2019 consultation, along with those of others ahead of introduction of the bill”. “We appreciate the range of views on proposals to reform the Gender Recognition Act. We have always been keen to seek consensus where possible, and to work to support respectful debate, and will continue to do so”. The letter was released at the same time as the EHRC’s response to the UK government’s consultation on conversion therapy, which ends next week and which campaigners likewise criticised, in particular for failing to challenge or reject the concept of “informed consent”.",News/Society,UK equalities watchdog urges Scotland to pause gender recognition reforms,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/26/uk-equalities-watchdog-urges-scotland-to-pause-gender-recognition-reforms
1/27/2022,"The regulator Ofcom is investigating the BBC over the reporting of an antisemitic attack in London last year, after the broadcaster apologised but denied claims of “victim blaming”. Ofcom said it had reviewed the broadcaster’s response to complaints around how it covered an incident in November 2021 when Jewish passengers on a bus were subjected to abuse.  The Board of Deputies of British Jews was critical of the accuracy and impartiality of the coverage of the events described, particularly in relation to the claim that an alleged anti-Muslim slur had been heard from inside the bus. On Wednesday the BBC published the findings of the executive complaints unit (ECU) in relation to a complaint, concluding that there was an “overriding focus” on those who directed abuse at the passengers on the bus and there “was no evidence to support any claims of victim-blaming in our reporting”. Ofcom has said it will launch its own investigation. A spokesperson said they had reviewed the BBC’s response, adding: “We consider it raises issues under our due accuracy rules and have launched an investigation.” On 2 December 2021 the BBC published an article about the incident and BBC One broadcast a report on the story in its main news bulletin at 6.30pm. Afterwards, the BBC received representations from individuals, including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the chief rabbi, critical of the coverage. The director general instructed the BBC’s ECU to investigate the complaints as a matter of urgency. It found the inclusion of “an alleged slur” was done in “good faith, following a great deal of editorial scrutiny”. It found, however, that more could have been done, “subsequent to the original report, to acknowledge the differing views and opinions in relation to what was said”. The BBC apologised for “not doing more to highlight that these details were contested.” The broadcaster amended the story online and issued a clarification in relation to the news report. Earlier in the month the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, questioned the BBC’s complaints process over its coverage of the story. In a letter to Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, seen by the Guardian, Dorries asked him to explain how the corporation has responded to concerns from Jewish leaders over the corporation’s coverage of an incident in November on Oxford Street and how he plans to “resolve the issue in a suitably timely manner”.",News/Media,Ofcom investigates BBC over reporting of antisemitic attack,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/26/ofcom-investigates-bbc-over-reporting-of-antisemitic-attack
