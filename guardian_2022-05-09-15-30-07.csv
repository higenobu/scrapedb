5/9/2022,"The New York Times has removed the word “fetus” from its Wordle answers to keep the game “distinct from the news”, a move apparently related to last week’s leaked Roe v Wade supreme court draft ruling. The change caused confusion as it was only implemented for some of the game’s players. “Today, some users may see an outdated answer for Wordle that seems closely connected to a major recent news event. This is entirely unintentional and a coincidence – today’s original answer was loaded into Wordle last year,” the New York Times said in a statement. The game’s answer-list is pre-written and assigned to a date. “When we discovered last week that this particular word would be featured today, we switched it for as many solvers as possible,” the newspaper said. The Times acquired Wordle earlier this year after it became a viral hit. The switch away from the word appears to be a move by the Times to avoid using a politically-charged term. Last week’s leaked supreme court draft majority opinion supported overturning the landmark Roe v Wade decision, putting in jeopardy rights to abortion across the United States and sparking a bitter national debate. “At New York Times Games, we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news,” the Times said. It’s not the first time Wordle has offered up different solutions. In March, baffled users tweeted their confusion over two correct Wordle answers. In that instance, the solution could be either “harry” or “stove”. In that case the Times confirmed the answer had been changed as it removed potentially obscure or insensitive words “in an effort to make the puzzle more accessible”. When the Times acquired Wordle it also removed words such as “lynch,” “slave” and “wench”.",News/Media,New York Times drops ‘fetus’ as an answer to Wordle – but not for all players,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/09/new-york-times-drops-fetus-as-an-answer-to-wordle
5/9/2022,"With anxieties rising about the future of cinema these last few years, the 50th anniversary of The Godfather allows Hollywood to remind viewers they made a perfect thing once, and could do so again. This year’s Oscars featured a tribute to the 1972 classic, with director Francis Ford Coppola offering brief remarks while flanked silently by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Now, the Paramount+ limited series The Offer chronicles the film’s turbulent production, as told by Al Ruddy, who serves as the show’s executive producer and main character portrayed by Miles Teller. Featuring numerous monologues on the magic of cinema and an endearing let’s-put-on-a-show vibe, the series fashions itself as a love letter to the era of New Hollywood, when maverick directors like Coppola battled Hollywood suits for creative control and won, conjuring some of cinema’s most lasting works in the process. There is, however, a dark underbelly to the series, and the era it depicts, which Hollywood isn’t so keen to examine. Put simply, The Offer has a nostalgia problem. It portrays and pines for an antiquated era, when male producers could sleep with their employees, while neglecting their supportive women partners at home. It relegates the majority of its female characters to the sidelines, framing them as obstacles the men must overcome to achieve their artistic and professional goals. The exception is Bettye, Ruddy’s intrepid assistant played heroically by Juno Temple, but while the show treats her as an equal to her male bosses, it does so only by defining her through the same tired male cliches. We see her walk brazenly into the office of a mob boss to ask a favor, and we are floored by her moxie, even though we’ve already seen Ruddy do it several times. Ultimately, The Offer turns both its men and women into caricatures, so it’s hard to get too worked up about its inequality. It’s a routine case of Hollywood self-mythology, but it’s frustrating this is the myth Hollywood is investing in right now. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, one might have hoped the industry would be more introspective about its past, and more honest about the women who were harassed and treated unfairly under the old system. Instead, it appears they are doubling down on the male-dominated canon and reinforcing the status quo. In addition to The Offer, there is another project on the way about the making of The Godfather – directed by Barry Levinson and starring Oscar Isaac as Coppola —–while Ben Affleck is slated to direct a film on the making of Chinatown. Apparently, Hollywood thinks that celebrating a film by Roman Polanski, a convicted rapist, is the right move in 2022. It’s especially frustrating because the female artists have their own stories to tell. Incredible film-makers like Barbara Loden (Wanda), Stephanie Rothman (The Student Nurses), and Joan Micklin Silver (Hester Street) never got the studio support that their male counterparts did, and their careers stalled before they really began. Then there’s the case of Elaine May, who produced two hits right off the bat, A New Leaf and The Heartbreak Kid, but was considered too difficult to work with by the studios. “Difficult” is rarely an attribute that sinks the career of talented male directors, as long as their films make money and win awards. The stories of these women deserve to be remembered and incorporated into the legend of this era, at least if we’re serious about making changes in Hollywood. While the industry itself seems content to ignore the realities of their own past, efforts are being made elsewhere. Missing Movies, an organization dedicated to finding and distributing lost films, is putting a special focus on female film-makers like May and Mary Harron since their works are more likely to fall out of print than those of male directors. Books are being written, like Maya Montañez Smukler’s Liberating Hollywood: Women Directors and the Feminist Reform of 1970s American Cinema, that highlights the great gains made by woman directors in the era. Even Hollywood recognizes these achievements: they gave Elaine May an honorary Oscar this year, although it was bumped to a pre-telecast ceremony to make room for, among other things, a tribute to The Godfather. It’s a pitched battle, with scholars and historians on one side, and Hollywood’s guardians of power on the other. In defense of the industry, it’s understandable why executives would choose to make a series or film about the making of The Godfather, instead of Loden’s 1970 film Wanda or May’s Mikey and Nicky, which had its own famously troubled production. After all, they want people to see their project, and those films have nowhere near the cultural footprint of The Godfather. That’s a self-perpetuating cycle Hollywood needs to break. There is no proven audience for stories about these films because they never made it into the canon in the first place – and that’s because their female directors were marginalized at the time, by executives, producers and the journalists who created the legend of New Hollywood. You know, the same characters who are lionized in shows like The Offer. But perpetuating that marginalization only ensures that it will continue, and it’s hard to believe the industry is taking its problems with women seriously when, at the first sign of trouble, they revert to the same, old man-made myths.",Arts/Television & radio,Why the Godfather making-of series The Offer has a nostalgia problem,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/09/the-offer-the-godfather-francis-ford-coppola
5/9/2022,"The first single I ever boughtThe first one I remember buying was Love Is Strange by Sylvia Robinson, when she was part of a duo called Mickey & Sylvia. It came out in 1956, right after Elvis – that’s when I started buying 45s. But the first record I made was a 45 called It Should’ve Been Me, recorded in 1954 [when he was 11]. The song that is my my karaoke go-toElvis Presley’s Can’t Help Falling in Love. It is one of the most romantic songs ever, and has all the elements of its time. It’s a schmaltzy ballad, but with the power of rock music. The song tells a story everyone can relate to. The song I inexplicably know every lyric toFor me that would be At Last by Etta James. She was the Whitney Houston of her day: every song she sang was a knockout, and that is one of the greatest arrangements in R&B history; it set up the story and the lyrics were outstanding. People are still trying to better the version she made when she was 18. The last song I streamedI’m working on a new record, so I’ve been listening to a lot of things but it was Nat King Cole, Unforgettable. Like Sinatra, he always had the best of everything on his recordings, starting with the best songs. Everything begins with the song, and then the orchestrations were done by the best people at the time. And the best musicians played on them, starting with himself. The song I want played at my funeralMona Lisa, one of my favourite songs of all time. Pittsburghers who know me as Lil’ Georgie Benson would remember me for that song. I used to sing it on street corners when I was seven years old and I was performing for coins The song I can’t help singingBe My Love, originally by Mario Lanza. It was the first No 1 hit in US recording history by a classical artist. It was a phenomenal recording – he had a great voice – and then he became a film star. He set the tone for the great classical singers, ending with Pavarotti. When I went to his home town they just called him Luciano, and I didn’t know who they were talking about. And then I realised they meant Luciano Pavarotti. The song I pretend to hate that I secretly likeI don’t even pretend to hate songs! I love songs! The song that is my favouriteJust Friends by Charlie Parker, because I learned so much from it. My father had been telling me all about him when I was still Lil’ Georgie Benson. My set was jukebox hits, and my father would say: “Why you play that mess?” Because that’s what people want to hear! “Play like Charlie Parker.” Charlie who? “Now I know why you can‘t play anything.” George Benson plays across the UK from 17 to 29 June.",Arts/Music,‘I used to sing Mona Lisa on the street for coins’: George Benson’s honest playlist,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/george-benson-honest-playlist
5/9/2022,"If you plan to carry foreign currency – and most people like to have at least £100 of local notes and coins when they arrive – then use a site such as TravelMoneyMax, run by Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert.com. Enter your postcode, indicate when you want the cash and it will provide a list of the best deals. Essentially, you have three options: home delivery, collection from a bureau or at the airport. Some firms require a minimum order value. Sometimes you will get a better rate if you buy more, while smaller orders may attract extra fees. Exchange rates are constantly updated. We used TravelMoneyMax to do a price check on £300-worth of euros. When we opted for delivery, Travel FX came out top, giving us €347.81 after all charges, while Tesco came in at a pretty good €344.42. A better rate was on offer when we selected collection from central London: Currency Online Group’s locations in Waterloo and Trafalgar Square came top, giving €353.76. Andrew Hagger of the financial website Moneycomms.co.uk says supermarkets – in particular Tesco and Asda – are also pretty competitive. Don’t buy currency at the airport unless you are desperate. You might get a good deal if you purchase it in advance and order it to collect just before you fly. We tried this option at TravelMoneyMax but collecting from the airport did not throw up much in the way of results. The site says because of the Covid pandemic, “many providers have paused some or all travel money services”, so it has fewer than usual on its site. Pick the wrong credit or debit card to use abroad and you will end up spending more than necessary. The financial data provider Moneyfacts warns that a holidaymaker taking out £250 from an overseas ATM with a debit card will typically face charges of £11.88. Use a credit card and you could incur up to £14.95 in fees, before interest is applied. Overseas purchases can be costly, too. Some banks apply a foreign currency purchase fee (50p at Lloyds and Halifax; £1 at TSB) on each transaction outside Europe, in addition to the conversion fee when you buy something in anything other than sterling, so if you make lots of small purchases you could face a hefty bill. The good news is that there are several fee-free debit and credit cards. Most use Mastercard’s exchange rate in their calculations. The digital bank Chase’s newish current account comes with a debit card with zero fees and charges when used to pay for things or withdraw cash outside the UK. You can also earn 1% cashback on eligible debit card spending at home and abroad for 12 months. And Starling Bank is another current account provider that does not charge fees for overseas spending and cash withdrawals. In terms of fee-free credit cards, Halifax’s Clarity is probably the best-known and is still a good deal, Hagger says. Whatever you spend abroad is converted to sterling by Mastercard. There’s also the Barclaycard Rewards Visa card, which offers the added perk of 0.25% cashback on everyday spending. Remember that with many credit cards, including Clarity, interest charges will apply immediately to cash you take out. Also, be aware that some overseas ATM providers charge fees. Generally, it is better to make one or two larger withdrawals than lots of smaller ones. If there are several weeks until your holiday, consider applying for a fee-free card or account now. Otherwise, check the overseas charges that apply to your debit or credit card before you set off. You then can adapt your spending to get the best deal. If you plan to hire a vehicle, make sure your card has enough credit. Car hire desks will often seek to block off a sizeable sum on your card as a deposit for the duration of the rental if you do not buy their excess insurance. Check your credit limit before you travel and, if necessary, ask your card provider to increase it, perhaps for a short period. Car hire firms will usually insist on a credit card, as opposed to a debit or prepaid card, and typically it needs to be in the name of the hirer. When using your card overseas, watch out for the dynamic currency conversion trick at some shops, restaurants and ATMs, where the cost or withdrawal sum is presented in pounds rather than the local currency. DCC allows businesses to calculate the bill according to their own – more favourable to them – currency rates. The general advice is to always pay or withdraw money in the local currency. Prepaid cards can be useful for people on a tight budget or who do not want to carry lots of cash. They are easy to obtain, and once you have loaded them up from your UK bank account at a typical currency conversion fee of 1-2.5% they can be used abroad like any other bank card. Which? warns that almost all prepaid cards come with a variety of fees and charges, for example, an application fee or a charge for ATM withdrawals. The Caxton Currency card is one of the best-known, with no overseas ATM fees and “no hidden charges”. Meanwhile, Which? highlights the free Revolut Standard account and card. How much you pay for data, calls and texts will depend on your provider and where you are going, so check this before you travel. Be aware that some mobile operators have reintroduced roaming charges for UK consumers travelling to Europe. For example, with Vodafone, if your plan does not include roaming on the continent, it will cost £2 a day, although it has eight- and 15-day passes that reduce the daily price to £1. One popular option is to make sure your phone is unlocked and buy a local sim card when you arrive. For example, if you are going to Mexico, some bloggers recommend buying a Telcel sim card from an Oxxo store. But the best advice is, where possible, to use the free wifi in hotels, cafes, museums, airports and other locations.",Lifestyle/Money,"Travel money: how to get the best deals on cash, cards, mobiles and more",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/09/travel-money-best-deals-cash-cards-mobiles-holiday
5/9/2022,"Traumatised Ukrainian refugees who have sought sanctuary in the UK may have to wait two years before they can get specialised therapy to help them heal from the horrors of war, according to experts. Therapists who specialise in treating war trauma say they have seen NHS waiting lists of two years before refugees can access the specialist treatment they need. Services across the UK are patchy with some areas “treatment deserts when it comes to trauma”, according to Emily Palmer-White, a psychotherapist and community manager at the charity Room to Heal, which provides support for people who have fled persecution. “There are often extremely long waiting lists. I have been told two years. You can’t separate the psychological from the practical – it’s more difficult to help people if they’re preoccupied with survival,” said Palmer-White. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said officials recognised the trauma Ukrainians were facing and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them. However, beyond having access to NHS care officials did not cite any specific provision to provide newly arrived refugees with trauma support. Prof Cornelius Catona, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the visa delays of several weeks would likely exacerbate mental illness for those already struggling and that the refugee schemes should have included a mechanism for spotting signs of trauma early. Viktoriia Liamets, a Ukrainian child and family therapist who recently arrived in the UK after fleeing the war, said Ukrainians arriving in Britain had multiple and complex traumas to contend with. “People are in shock at leaving behind the place they call home,” said Liamets. “Some have left elderly parents and other family members behind taking only a small backpack with them because they thought they would be returning soon. There are so many layers of trauma that it takes a while to process it. People need to be in a safe environment before they can start to do that. But being in a new country with a new language and no income can make them feel vulnerable. Your whole internal construction becomes unstable.” She said children may be particularly badly affected by fleeing the war to the point where it may even change their personalities. Kirsty McNeill, an executive director at Save the Children UK, said there was a worrying lack of mental health support for the “incredibly traumatised” children arriving from Ukraine. She said: “By definition, these children are traumatised. The speed at which their lives have fallen apart is something that needs specialist support to come to terms with. There are kids that went to school as normal on a Monday and by the weekend they were sitting on the floor of a Romanian gym. Their lives got completely turned around in a week. We’re not seeing any real urgency from the UK government about scaling up specialist mental health support, nor are we seeing very many new caseworkers being recruited.” Prof William Yule, an emeritus professor of applied child psychology at King’s College in London and an expert in child stress and trauma and the needs of refugees, said: “The situation in Ukraine is incredibly complicated. One of the important things to remember there is that the war started in 2014. People might be both bereaved and traumatised if they have seen loved ones being killed.” He said children should be allowed to speak and be listened to if they wanted to talk about the war and added that a lot of expertise had been gained in dealing with the issue of traumatic stress from work done in this area following the war in the former Yugoslavia two decades ago.",News/World news,Ukraine refugees in UK face waits of up to two years for war trauma therapy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ukraine-refugees-uk-face-waits-two-years-war-trauma-therapy
5/9/2022,"Standup comedy is regularly listed as one of the toughest jobs in the world, featuring heavily in 90% of people’s top 10 fears. But a course helping some of the most vulnerable people in the country by teaching them to be comedians is proving so successful that it is being socially prescribed by NHS trusts and private practices across the country. “I’ve taught comedy for 10 years, and students often told me how much stronger, more resilient and happier they were after exploring their personal histories through standup comedy,” said Angie Belcher, founder of Comedy on Referral and comedian-in-residence at Bristol University. “That inspired me to prove that the models, exercises and games used in a standup comedy course can help people to recover from emotional problems such as mental illness, postnatal depression, PTSD and anxiety disorders,” she said. After completing a highly successful six-week NHS course for trauma survivors in Bristol, Comedy on Referral has now won NHS funding to help men at risk of suicide in London. Belcher is also in discussions with a private practice to extend the course to young people with autism and ADHD. “My course for trauma victims encourages them to process their trauma in a different way, so they can change who the victim is and choose the narrative. They can actually go right down into ‘This is what I was thinking and then this thing happened to me’,” said Belcher. “This enables survivors to consciously use comedy to change their perspective of their experiences, but it also puts them in a physically powerful position because being on stage is very powerful,” she said. “You can speak directly to an audience about important things, which means you have the opportunity to change their lives. As a comedian, you could be the reason why someone in your audiences does something differently.” Belcher’s course, initially piloted with Spear, the Wellspring Social Prescribing for Equality and Resilience team in Bristol, is the result of a year-long research project on the effects of comedy as a therapeutic device on people’s wellbeing and mental health. The course takes clients referred by the social prescribing team through the writing, performance and analysis of their personal stories to create a five-minute standup comedy set, using games, group and one-to-one work. This week, Belcher won a grant from the North West London Integrated Care System (NW London ICS), one of the largest health and care partnerships in the country working across 10 NHS trusts and eight London boroughs to achieve a national 10% reduction in suicides by 2020-2021. Belcher will work alongside psychologists and men who have experienced suicidal events, to help up to 20 men aged 18 and over to take part in a comedy event at the end of the course for an audience of at least 100 people. “We’ve never done anything like this before and we’re very excited about it because we’re hoping it will reach men who, even though they’ve been diagnosed as at high risk of suicide, don’t think they have an issue and so won’t go to counselling or attend anything signposted ‘suicide prevention’,” said Lourdes Colclough, head of suicide prevention at Rethink Mental Illness, which is distributing the NW London ICS grant. “This is a different way of engaging with this hard-to-reach group.” Belcher said she is conscious of the fine line between telling personal stories and triggering former traumas. To prevent this, psychologists support participants during their introduction to therapeutic writing techniques while local services, GPs and Samaritans are signposted throughout the course. “I hope that participants will use what they learn on the course in their practical everyday life, so that they go into future endeavours with joy, hopefulness and playfulness rather than taking out their bully teenager-persona or their depressed 20-something persona or their grieving mother-persona or whatever it is,” said Belcher. “I want participants to leave the course with a different part of themselves – their comedic persona – so that they can enjoy their lives in a different way and hopefully in a better way.” In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or by email at pat@papyrus-uk.org. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by email at jo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

5/9/2022,"Carolyn Egan has seen people cross the Canada-US border for abortions – going north to south. In the years before Canada’s supreme court legalised abortion in 1988, it was common for Canadians who needed abortions to travel to the US. “We had a network of people who could make referrals and help them get there [to the US]. If it’s necessary, that probably would happen again – but the other way,” said Egan, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. If, as a leaked draft decision indicates, the US supreme court votes to overturn Roe v Wade, many Americans in need of surgical abortion could be forced to travel not just across state lines but, once again, across international borders – both along the northern border to Canada and the southern one to Mexico. On Tuesday, Canada’s minister of families, Karina Gould, reaffirmed that Americans can access abortion services in Canada. “If they, people, come here and need access, certainly, you know, that’s a service that would be provided,” she told CBC News. An estimated 26 states are likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an American sexual and reproductive health rights research organization. That includes Michigan, which sits across the water from southern Ontario, where there are plenty of abortion clinics. “If a state like Michigan banned abortion, certainly there would be interest in coming across the border,” Egan said. Michigan has a 1931 ban that could automatically kick in when Roe v Wade ends. Michigan residents could also travel to Illinois or Pennsylvania, as those states are unlikely to outlaw the procedure, according to Guttmacher data, and many Americans would be expected to travel internally between states. Those travelling internationally won’t find it free – people without immigration status in Canada are charged about C$500 (US$388) for a surgical abortion, Egan said – but Americans do not need a health card to access clinics in Canada. Wait times vary, from one to two weeks in Ontario to several weeks or months in the Atlantic provinces. Crossing the border will probably only be possible for those who can afford to do. Abortion advocates in the US have underscored that after Roe v Wade falls it will be wealthier white women who have the means – including travelling – to access abortion, while people on lower incomes and those who face socioeconomic barriers including African American, Latino and Indigenous women and transgender people may struggle more. “You have to have the financial resources” to travel between states or internationally, Doherty said. “There will be a limited number of people who will be able to do that.” She added that not everyone has dependable childcare, the ability to take time off work or a valid passport. The cheapest option early in pregnancy will probably continue to be abortion pills, obtainable either through the mail or via telehealth services. But after working for more than 10 years at clinics in Ireland while abortion was illegal, Doherty says she has no doubt that people will cross borders. “Over 5,000 women a year travelled to the UK, so we know that abortion restrictions don’t stop women from accessing abortion – it just places more burden on them.” South of the US border, Mexican advocates are preparing for an increase in Americans visiting to access abortion services. In 2021, Mexico’s supreme court ruled it was unconstitutional to criminalise abortion, although access still varies by state. The advocacy group Las Libres is part of a network that helps people on both sides of the border access abortion pills. Vero Cruz, advocacy coordinator with Las Libres, said Americans can technically obtain surgical abortions in public clinics in certain Mexican states for free, though she doesn’t know of anyone who has done so yet. Cruz said surgical abortions were available in Sinaloa, Coahuila and Baja California, but only up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. “The women who are crossing into Mexico are coming to Monterrey, Tijuana and other cities to have abortions using medication,” she said. The abortion pills are free, too. “It’s completely free, it costs nothing.” She said both private and public clinics in border cities in Mexico were planning for an American influx; both Tijuana and Coahuila recently set up services, she said. Egan said Americans in Canada will be warmly received, too. “For a cabinet minister to say that Americans would be welcome here, gives the sense that the government is considering the possibility, and making it clear they would not be interfering in that.” Many Canadians are upset about the looming end of Roe v Wade, she said. “There’s tremendous upset, distress and anger that Americans would be in the situation of having to face this kind of thing. So my sense is people will do everything they can to make access easier.”",News/US news,Canada and Mexico prepare to accept Americans seeking abortions,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/canada-mexico-abortions-american
5/9/2022,"Last November, when David Booker picked up a billhook for the first time, it felt uncannily familiar. The tool, a sort of stubby sickle, fitted so comfortably in his hand that he thought his handling of it “was there in me, ready and waiting to come out”. Now the tool has helped him to find a new sort of living – and unearthed a hidden connection with his father. Booker was 65 when he enrolled on a short course in hedgelaying, or “pleaching” – the ancient rural art of cutting and training hedges into secure boundaries. He now lives in the Clun valley in Shropshire, where he pleaches the hedges of neighbouring farmers and friends. Each is a fresh conundrum. On “the aesthetic level”, Booker says, he sees a well-laid hedge as a form of cubism. But there are also environmental benefits. Pleaching strengthens hedges as nature corridors and carbon-capturers. It also improves soil structure, “whereas if you’re flailing a hedge – cutting with a massive chainsaw on the back of a tractor – you’re destroying it”. “When it comes down to it,” Booker says, pleaching is “a private tussle with a hedge that’s intertwined over years: the blackthorns grown into the hawthorns into the hedge maple into the hazel into the guelder rose … all these things twisted together like a puzzle”. Some nights, his wife, Jan, has to pick the thorns from his skin. The challenge for the pleacher is to “decide what to sever, how to lay the trunk down into the previous pleach – and then how to make sure that it all lives again”. As a boy, Booker’s father’s work in construction took the family all around the Black Country. They lived in a caravan until Booker was 11. But at weekends or in the summer, when Booker’s mother worked picking fruit, they would escape into the Clun valley, where he loved playing in and around the hedges. Although he was an avid reader, Booker failed his 11-plus and, in 1972, at 16, became an apprentice boiler maker. It was being “a working-class boy”, Booker says, that taught him to value learning. Industries were closing. “Every move to a new job was a move down.” He became a sheet metalworker, then a windscreen fitter. “You were constantly looking to gain new skills to stay employed … The whole idea of lifelong learning was built in me purely out of need, because unemployment was just around the corner.” Although Booker loved the factory, “it wasn’t feeding this other side of me” – the bookish side. One evening, he got talking to a woman at a hotel bar and they discovered a mutual love of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. “We just sparked each other,” he says. “And I realised I had to find a different way in life.” He and Jan have been together for 43 years. At the age of 26, “purely through hard work and night school and reading”,Booker got a place at Oxford University as a mature student. He studied English and, after graduating, became a teacher, then a vice-principal, working mainly with schools that offered the international baccalaureate (IB). Something about the ethos of the IB chimed with his own experience, “this wonderful idea that what we are involved in is lifelong learning,” he says. That seems to be what he is doing now, with these hedges, which are “almost like a private church. The wind and the rain are whistling around you. The birds are singing their heads off. Really, it’s a private, deep joy, knowing that you’re giving life to the future.” A few weeks ago, his father visited, and Booker took him up to a large hedge he pleached for a neighbour. “I was showing him the cuts, and he started to tell me about his years working on a farm, when he left school at 14. Suddenly all these memories came tumbling out.” Booker had never known his father, now 90, had worked on a farm, nor that he too laid hedges, and had kept his old billhook. “I’m 66 now, and it’s taken all these years for me to know more about him and this common interest.” Now, his father’s old billhook hangs, sharpened, on the wall of Booker’s wain house, beside his own. And the hedges he has laid are showing new growth.

Bold Street swaggers down from Saint Luke’s church to the centre of town. Hollowed out by a bomb, it’s a reminder that broken things can still be beautiful, and valuable. Matta’s International Foods is a fine Liverpool institution. Its herbs and spices are now indispensable but they must have been a revelation 40 years ago. Bold Street’s independent spirit also blows through Leaf, an argy-bargy of tables in a majestic old cinema and former 1920s tearoom. Its the first place I take visitors, because its combination of cosiness and glamour feels so Liverpool. If you’re here to see Liverpool play, go to Homebaked Bakery next door to Anfield.

I’ve returned from Ireland dozens of times by ferry, and the sight of that fairytale waterfront, its Three Graces (the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building) floating over the river, weightless and beautiful as a mirage, still overwhelms me. If you can’t do that, catch the Dazzle Ferry, painted in Sir Peter Blake’s extraordinary “dazzle” livery – and try not to look back at Liverpool until you’re on the return trip. Greek poet Peter Cavafy, who lived here, wrote about the joy of entering a new harbour for the first time. I wish you that. The Georgian Quarter spreads its elegant skirts out from Falkner Square and is great for a stroll. For a newer Liverpool, head to Lodge Lane. Once depressed and depressing, it’s now buzzing thanks to enterprising refugees and asylum seekers from Yemen, Syria and Iran. But to truly understand Liverpool, walk around Chinatown. We often talk about the city’s Irish influence, but the Chinese one is just as pervasive, and goes back centuries. Liverpool is blessed with parks and each has a jewel at its heart. Just across the road from Strawberry Fields, the rolling acres of Calderstones Park are home to the thousand-year-old Allerton Oak, purportedly the site of a medieval Hundred Court. In a courtyard at the Mansion House are the Calder Stones – six neolithic standing stones. The cafe and exhibition rooms are run by The Reader, a charity that promotes shared reading. There’s something very Liverpool about the fusion of the loftiest literature with ice-cream cornets, park swings and beauty. Sefton Park has as its centrepiece the Victorian Palm House, restored by volunteers. The park is full of happy memories – of childhoods, or recent weddings and concerts – and you can feel the pride and sense of ownership as you walk in. Pubs The Monro in Chinatown, the Roscoe Head and The Pilgrim have retained their bohemian identity. But stags and hens head for Concert Square, and the streets between Duke Street and Wood Street bristle with bars. Liverpudlians are open and friendly. Strolling around, you will almost certainly be asked to tag along with a crowd. My favourite night-time spot is the car park at the Irish Ferries terminal, with a view back across the river to the constellated lights of the waterfront under the Liver Building’s harvest moon of a clock. Hope Street (doubles from £103) on the edge of the Georgian Quarter has gorgeous views and quietly gets everything right. I’m also drawn to The Titanic (doubles from £105) at historic Stanley Dock. It’s at the mouth of the Mersey but has views of a vast ruined Gormenghast of a warehouse. The corridors are so magically lugubrious you could walk past Hagrid in the shadows and not notice him. Liverpool is perhaps the last British imperial city, and the Titanic is the place to go to contemplate the folly of empire, over a full English.Frank Cottrell-Boyce’s most recent book is Noah’s Gold (Pan Macmillan, £7.99).

5/9/2022,"I’ll never forget my first game at White Hart Lane. As I walked to the stadium, my hand in my father’s, I could feel the crowd swelling around me, the language as colourful as the sea of flags swimming in the air. This was a world detached from everyday reality. The environment was electric. Adrenaline coursed through my veins. I was terrified and exhilarated at the same time. When I reached the stands, I saw my heroes for the first time in the flesh. As a young boy, watching Tottenham play was a chance to see myself in something that I could never find in TV or books. Garth Crooks, a young black English centre-forward, played alongside Argentinian players Ossie Ardiles and Ricardo Villa. My parents came to the UK from Guyana, a black-majority country on the South American coast; this was representation like nothing I’d experienced before. Crooks was an idol for young supporters like me. He was the forward in a Spurs team that won back-to-back FA Cups and a European trophy. But behind the glory, Crooks experienced such rampant abuse that he couldn’t talk about it. For so many black people like me who worshipped the game, football has always been a world of paradoxes. A New Formation explores these paradoxes and complexities in the stories of black footballers in Britain. A mixture of interviews and analysis by authors such as Musa Okwonga and sports broadcaster Jeanette Kwakye MBE, collated by editor and writer Calum Jacobs, it delves deep into the lives of these individuals as well as the trials and tribulations of what it means to be black in the beautiful game. It does not aim to explain these lives solely through the lens of racism, but instead tells multifaceted stories of individuals who lived lives of both triumph and torment. It is not a story of despair. It is a story of struggle. Take the life of Justin Fashanu, thoughtfully analysed by Okwonga in the second chapter. Fashanu became Britain’s first £1m black footballer when he signed for Nottingham Forest, who had won the European Cup the year previously. In 1990, he became the first, and only, professional English footballer to publicly come out. But the backlash that stuck wasn’t the jokes from his fellow players. It was the way that the tabloids dragged the story through the dirt. Tony Sewell, who would go on to release a report denying the existence of institutional racism in the UK, wrote in response to Fashanu coming out: “We heteros are sick and tired of tortured queens playing hide and seek around their closets. Homosexuals are the greatest queer-bashers around. No other group of people are so preoccupied with making their own sexuality look dirty.” Fashanu’s life ended tragically in suicide and there has still not been a black professional footballer who has come out since. Although elements of overt racism still occur, some of the abuse that fans and players experienced in the era of the dark old days has gradually faded thanks to several factors, including the modernisation of stadiums and the exceptional work of activists, former footballers and pressure groups such as Show Racism the Red Card. But as Jacobs rightly identifies: “This fixation on the obviously racist hooligan obscured the more nuanced and complex forms of racist expression that permeated British football.” It is the manifestation of subtle forms of abuse, through the words of the media and often those involved in the game, that seeps into the population and social media. This is well reflected in the final chapter, which focuses on the life of Raheem Sterling and is written by Jacobs himself. Sterling was born in Jamaica but moved to Neasden, in London, at the age of five. The winger broke into the Liverpool first XI quickly, becoming a regular starter and England international at the age of just 17. But in these early years of his career, the tabloids constantly criticised Sterling’s personal life, becoming overtly racist when the Sun ran the infamous headline “Prem rat of the Caribbean” on its front page. Acutely aware of the backlash many face when speaking out, Sterling’s decision to push back against those who had sought to bring him down by shining a spotlight on the abuse that he and other black players have experienced showed true bravery. Unafraid to combine the pride of his ancestral history with his reputation in British society, Sterling has immeasurably changed the lives of those inspired by his courage by bending the arc of history in the right direction. Sterling’s story reflects a theme that runs throughout this powerful book. Black players have their lives picked apart in ways that simply do not exist for their white counterparts. Demba Ba, for instance, whose award-winning performances and exceptional goal-scoring record at Newcastle earned him a move to Chelsea, was described as “sluggish” by his own manager due to fasting during the month of Ramadan. Whether they like it or not, black players have scrutiny thrust upon them. The experiences of black footballers are nuanced and varied. By ignoring the rich complexity of black British society, our institutions and leaders constantly cast black people as a monolith; the policies of our government and the words in our newspapers reflect this. A New Formation powerfully pushes back against this narrative by exploring the lives of black women, black Muslims and the black LGBTQ+ community, all within the context of football. There are many factors that bind these groups together but also important stories that need to be heard and understood individually and on a personal level. Each tale brings with it a sense of optimism that things will be better for the successors of these players. Anita Asante, a Champions League-winning defender at Arsenal, describes her hope that “the younger generation now feel more empowered” and that they have the self-confidence to achieve their goals by merit. However, change does not come about through hope alone. There is a common understanding among these players that they are blazing a trail, but with this leadership comes responsibility. Many have no choice but to be a role model; by being successful and black, you have already become one. In my lifetime, I have seen the success of black footballers from Archway-born Real Madrid forward Laurie Cunningham to GB star and pundit Alex Scott. Times have changed. New heroes have been born. A New Formation tells the stories of these legends in their own words on their own terms. This is cultural expression, social history and black pride at its finest.

5/9/2022,"Q I’m in my early 20s and just about to finish university. Through university scholarships and working, I have been able to save about £20,000. I want to buy a property once I start working (I’m due to start earning £30,000 from September) but know I won’t be able to afford somewhere in London on a single salary for many years, even with all that I’ve saved. I’m reluctant to buy into a shared-ownership scheme as I have concerns about being priced out of buying the rest of the property as property prices continue to rise, alongside the rent that I would have to pay in addition the mortgage. Therefore, I was considering buying a flat in another city (such as Nottingham, Glasgow or Birmingham), so that I could rent it out while still living at home and continue to save for my next property. Are there any drawbacks to this? I am worried about taking on the responsibility of renting out a property but, equally, do not want my savings to devalue in my account as inflation and property prices continue to rise. I am unsure how long it would be before I would be able to afford a nice flat in London that didn’t have more than an hour of commuting time.TA A Yes, there are drawbacks. The main one is that buying a property to rent out – rather than a home to live in – means that you won’t qualify for first-time buyer relief from stamp duty land tax (SDLT). The makes the first £300,000 of the purchase price of a property costing up to £500,000 SDLT-free, with the amount over £300,000 charged at 5%. It will also mean that if you go on to buy a property for yourself without selling the rental property, you will have to pay SDLT at the higher rate (standard rate plus three percentage points) on the purchase price of your home. Then there’s the fact that buying a rental property will mean that you have to take out a buy-to-let mortgage rather than a residential one. The downside of this is that buy-to-let mortgages typically don’t let you borrow more than 75% of the mortgage lender’s valuation of the property (which is not the same as the purchase price). So with a cash deposit of £20,000, the most you would be able to borrow would be £60,000, meaning spending no more than £80,000 on a property, which could be a struggle, even in the provinces. With a residential mortgage, some lenders are prepared to lend up to 95% of the value of a property, so, in theory, your £20,000 deposit could help you buy a £400,000 property. However, in practice, given your earnings, it’s unlikely that you would be able to borrow as much as £380,000. Taken with your concern about becoming a long-distance landlord, the financial realities suggest that it may be time to reconsider your options – and maybe reinvestigate shared ownership – if you don’t want your savings to lose real value in a low-interest savings account.

5/9/2022,"Boris Johnson will get the chance to give his government a mini relaunch when his legislative agenda for the next year is set out at the state opening of parliament in the Queen’s speech. Governments always try to give the Queen’s speech a theme – this year’s will be growing the economy, easing the burden on families and levelling up – but all Queen’s speeches tend to be a mix of flagship manifesto measures and more routine bits of legislative housekeeping. Although ministers routinely claim in interviews they “cannot anticipate what will be in the Queen’s speech”, it is well known what bills are in the pipeline and some of them are specifically announced in advance. Here is a guide to what to expect on Tuesday: Schools bill Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, says the bill is designed to “create a school system that works for every child, parent and family”. Presented as part of the government’s levelling up agenda, the bill will make it easier for schools in England to join multi-academy trusts and strengthen their regulatory framework. It will also introduce a new national funding formula for schools, intended to make school funding fairer, and set up compulsory registers for children not in school. Higher education bill The centrepiece of this bill will be the introduction of a “lifelong loan entitlement”, allowing people a loan equivalent to four years of university education (£37,000) that they can use over their lifetime to fund technical training. The government claims this will amount to a “seismic shift” for post-18 education. Levelling up and regeneration bill Designed to stop high streets being blighted by empty shops, this bill will give councils in England the power to force landlords to rent out commercial properties. It will also give local authorities new powers to take control of empty buildings through beefed-up compulsory purchase orders. The bill will also reportedly allow councils to double council tax on second homes that are not occupied. British Bill of Rights Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, said in an interview with the Sun on Sunday that this long-promised Tory bill, which is designed to limit some of the influence of Labour’s Human Rights Act and give UK judges more freedom to diverge from European court of human rights rulings, would ensure “public safety gets more priority than the rights of offenders”. In particular, he wants to use it to make it easier for the government to deport foreign offenders and to limit the extent to which the ECHR can be used to muzzle the press on privacy grounds. Brexit freedoms bill Boris Johnson has promised what he calls a “Brexit freedoms bill”, which is intended to facilitate the removal of EU regulations retained after Britain’s departure from the EU. Other Brexit-related bills will include one to allow gene-editing, a procurement bill to make it easier for small firms to bid for public sector contracts and a data reform bill. Broadcasting bill A bill is expected to implement the proposed privatisation of Channel 4. Economic crime bill The government has promised an economic crime bill giving Companies House new powers to check on people suspected of registering companies fraudulently after the emergency economic crime bill introduced recently creating a register of overseas entities and their beneficial owners. Animal welfare (animals abroad) bill This bill will impose a ban on the import of hunting trophies and ban the sale and advertising of holidays that involve cruelty to animals. But plans for the bill to include a ban on the import and sale of foie gras and fur have reportedly been dropped. Draft mental health bill This legislation, being published in draft, will overhaul the Mental Health Act 1983. It will limit the extent to which the act can be used to detain autistic people and people with learning disabilities and it will ensure more consideration is given to the treatment preferences of patients detained under the act. The bill will implement most of the recommendations of a review of the act by Prof Sir Simon Wessely in 2018. Draft conversion therapy bill A draft bill is expected on banning conversion practices – although, controversially, not for trans people. Four bills are being carried over from the last session: the online safety bill, the animal welfare (kept animals) bill, the higher education (freedom of speech) bill and the high speed rail (Crewe-Manchester) bill. The government has been working on a bill that will be framed as being about protecting the Good Friday Agreement – but which, in practice, would empower the government to ignore parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. A highly controversial measure, it is not clear yet whether this will be referenced directly in the Queen’s speech – or whether at this stage it is just an option being held in reserve. A planning bill Last year’s Queen’s speech promised a planning bill. But Tory MPs reacted very badly to the plans, amid fears it would lead to a massive expansion of housing in southern England approved by a planning algorithm. The bill was dropped, and instead more modest changes to planning are expected to be included in the levelling up bill. Employment bill The government has also reportedly dropped an employment bill that had been intended to strengthen workers’ rights.",News/UK news,Queen’s speech: which bills to expect,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/queens-speech-what-bills-to-expect
5/9/2022,"Good morning. It never feels like a quiet time in the news at the moment, and today is no exception: ongoing atrocities in Ukraine, the fallout from an unprecedented election result in Northern Ireland, the “Beergate” controversy – and the list goes on. Even so, it’s remarkable how quickly Covid-19 has slipped from the agenda. Two years ago a tickle in your throat or a mild temperature was enough to send most people spiralling. Now, a combination of a robust vaccination programme and effective testing measures has meant that in the UK things seem to be inching “back to normal” (whatever that means). At the same time, though, coronavirus is still lingering in the background, causing heartache and hardship, and disrupting our daily lives. To find out exactly where we are in the pandemic, I spoke to Hannah Devlin, the Guardian’s science correspondent. First, here are the headlines. Ukraine | 60 people are feared dead after an airstrike on a Ukrainian school being used as a bomb shelter. The attack was part of an intensified Russian onslaught ahead of today’s symbolic Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. Cost of living crisis | More than two million adults in the UK have gone without food for a whole day over the past month, according to a survey on the “catastrophic” impact of the cost of living crisis. Northern Ireland | The Democratic Unionist party will stall power-sharing at Stormont if the Northern Ireland protocol is not modified, its leaders will tell Boris Johnson. The move comes after Sinn Féin became the largest party at the assembly for the first time. ‘Beergate’ | Labour denied that a leaked internal memo showing an evening meal in Durham had been pre-planned was evidence Keir Starmer had broken lockdown laws. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, called Starmer “Mr Rules”. Television | Jodie Comer and Matthew Macfadyen were among the winners at Sunday’s television Baftas, along with BBC prison drama Time. The acclaimed Channel 4 series It’s A Sin was surprisingly ignored in every category. For all intents and purposes, and for most people, it would be fair to say it feels like the pandemic is over. Mask mandates, lockdowns, even self-isolation – these restrictions on our behaviour now seem like relics from a bygone era. But viral respiratory diseases don’t cease to exist just because we want them to: 2 February marked the highest daily rise of Covid deaths in over a year, a month after all restrictions were dropped. So what are the numbers – and more importantly – what do they mean in a time when the general consensus is that we must “live with Covid”? Infection rates are stable … for now Overall, infection and hospitalisation rates seem to have returned to where they were before the BA.2 variant of Omicron became more widespread. However, there is a tension, Hannah says, between where we are as a society and where we are as individuals when it comes to Covid rates: “We’re in this sort of strange in-between stage where, for most individuals, Covid is not the severe risk to health that it once was.” According to data analysed by the Financial Times, the majority of people infected with Covid-19 are now at a marginally lower risk of dying than people who catch the seasonal flu. But when we look at the bigger picture things become less clear. “[Covid] doesn’t quite sit yet within our normal range of winter illnesses. We’re still experiencing these huge waves of infection,” Hannah says. Even though it looks like the worst of the pandemic is over, at least in terms of severe illness and death, another surge could put further pressure on an already strained NHS, which was pushed to its limits during the other waves of the pandemic. Death rates dictate the road ahead A rise in infection rates was expected once all restrictions and guidance ended at the end of February, but it is death rates that ultimately seem to determine how the government responds to the pandemic. In total, more than 175,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the UK since the outbreak of the virus, while the WHO says there have been nearly 15 million excess deaths worldwide. At the height of the pandemic, the death toll was more than 1,000 deaths on average each day. Now, according to data from the Office for National Statistics, the daily count stands at just over a fifth of that number, with Covid now the sixth-leading cause of death in the UK (it was the leading cause of death for several months in 2020 and 2021). That is clearly a significant change, achieved despite the end of all restrictions and the seeming infeasibility of a zero-Covid strategy. “We’ve seen from the lockdowns – achieving zero Covid comes at an impossibly high price at this point,” Hannah tells me. However, that is still more than 200 deaths a day from Covid in the UK. While vaccines and education have changed the Covid crisis for the better, there’s an almost inevitable desensitisation to the mortality rates. As we move from pandemic to epidemic, the government – and the country more broadly – has decided the goal is mitigation and management rather than eradication. The future of vaccines It would be understandable to assume that research on Covid-19 vaccines is largely over – or at the very least not as urgent as it once was. There’s good reason to think this: overall, the vaccination programme in this country has worked well – 93% of people over the age of 12 have had one dose, 87% have had two, and 58% have had a booster, too. But that is only part of the picture. Globally, there is still huge vaccine inequality – as of April, only 15.2% of populations in low-income countries have received one dose of the vaccine. As Covid continues to run rampant in certain parts of the world, with numbers on the rise in countries including South Africa and India, the threat of a variant that could escape immunity still exists. So, what happened to the variant-specific vaccines? The short answer is that the pharmaceutical industry is still working on it. “Companies are pushing ahead with their variant vaccines – Moderna has been successful, targeting the release by autumn for their Omicron vaccine,” says Hannah. “The idea is that it’s supposed to give double immunity”. It is, she adds, “an evolving picture”. The reason why there seems to be less urgency than at the start of the pandemic is that, ultimately, the vaccines we have are still good at preventing severe disease and death. Broader vaccines that target multiple variants and, hopefully, future strains are also in development, as is a nasal spray which is supposed to prevent people from catching Covid in the first place (to learn more about them, take a look at this explainer by Ian Sample). Realistically, it looks like these boosters will be limited to those who are older or are clinically vulnerable – which begs the question, what about everyone else? It’s hard to predict the future when it comes to an ever-shifting and mutating virus, and researchers are still learning about it. “It’s not clear what that landscape will look like, because we’re still learning about how immunity wanes over time,” says Hannah. “Until we know that, we can’t really predict what proportion of the population will need boosters and what will be fine.” While everyone from Boris Johnson to Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, has declared that the pandemic is over, that doesn’t feel true for everyone. “More than three million people in the UK are clinically vulnerable, and some of these people don’t respond well to vaccines,” Hannah explains. “Those people feel like they’re left behind, they don’t feel politically important. It must be particularly dreadful to see everyone going back to normal but you can’t – everyone seems to have forgotten you.” There are still many question marks around what “living with Covid” means for our futures. What’s clear, however, is if we want to continue enjoying our renewed freedom, we can’t simply pretend that the virus that changed the world two short years ago has now disappeared. Football | Chelsea secured a third consecutive Women’s Super League title on the final day of the season, pipping Arsenal to the trophy after twice coming from behind for a thrilling 4-2 victory against Manchester United. Football | Manchester City thrashed Newcastle United 5-0 to open up a three point lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table. Liverpool had only been able to draw 1-1 with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday evening. Formula One | Max Verstappen came from behind to win the Miami grand prix, pipping Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc to the chequered flag. Only a fool would think Sinn Féin’s success in the Northern Ireland assembly elections means a united Ireland is imminent, writes Fintan O’Toole – but “only a bigger fool would think that it has not, in some form, come closer”. Archie Meanwhile, results in England, Scotland, and Wales which you might have expected to spell the end for Boris Johnson have instead been overshadowed by the ‘Beergate’ story about Keir Starmer. Gaby Hinsliff sees it as an attempt to “deflect from the sleaze by suggesting that everyone else was at it too”.

Nimo The Guardian leads with “More than 2m Britons can’t afford to eat every day” and the Mirror is also concerned about the cost of living in its lead: “Direct debit bills hell”.
