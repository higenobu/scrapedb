2/6/2022,"Somehow, West Ham slithered out of this barnstorming FA Cup tie with their place in the fifth round secure. After Declan Rice, who was sent on by David Moyes at half-time to bring some order to an abject performance, struck in second-half stoppage time to take the game to extra time, Jarrod Bowen prevented penalties by popping up at the back post to snaffle a 121st-minute winner with 13 seconds of added time left to play. The Kidderminster manager, Russell Penn, could only pull his snood over his face, while his assistant, Jimmy O’Connor, swivelled on the touchline in disbelief. West Ham had got out of jail to avoid an embarrassing exit and burst sixth-tier Kidderminster’s bubble, after Alex Penny sparked delirium by opening the scoring.  For Kidderminster, an extraordinary journey that began against Sporting Khalsa in the second qualifying round of the competition in front of a crowd of 687 at the Garden Warehousing Stadium and took in a third qualifying round replay against Ware ends here. A couple of minutes before half-time, a punchdrunk Kidderminster supporter gave the chairman, Richard Lane, who stood behind the directors’ box taking everything in, a whopping kiss on the cheek. Seats were at a premium – tickets for this game sold out within hours of going on sale – and after Saïd Benrahma ballooned a wayward shot into the North Stand terrace, a capacity crowd sensed they were little more than 45 minutes from a historic victory, an iconic “I was there” moment. West Ham had done their homework – one of Stuart Pearce or Alan Irvine attended Kidderminster’s previous four games – but their first-half performance was laboured, disjointed and a pale imitation of the kind that has seen the visitors soar to fifth in the Premier League, 113 places above the hosts. Kidderminster made their presence felt and the captain, Sam Austin, who scored against Reading in the previous round, forced Alphonse Areola to parry a shot from the edge of the box after a poor clearance by Ryan Fredericks, one of eight West Ham players promoted to the starting lineup. Aside from Michail Antonio, who landed in London on Friday after international duty with Jamaica, a full-strength West Ham squad arrived in the Worcestershire town and Moyes had to dip into his rich reserves sooner than planned. He turned to his bench at the break, introducing Rice and Craig Dawson in place of Alex Kral and Issa Diop, who endured a torrid time alongside Kurt Zouma in defence, as well as Tomas Soucek and Aaron Cresswell after the hour. The selfless Amari Morgan-Smith proved a handful for Diop and, moments after Omari Sterling-James snatched the ball from a dawdling Andriy Yarmolenko on halfway, the West Ham defender conceded a foul wide on the Kidderminster left after clipping the striker. Sterling sent in the subsequent free-kick but Areola and Diop inadvertently collided after both attempting to beat Nathan Cameron to the ball, and Diop’s headed clearance dropped kindly for the right-back Penny, who side-footed into an empty net. Cue pandemonium in the stands and on the touchline, with Penn and O’Connor spilling on to the pitch in celebration.Sterling scored a peach of a free-kick en route to a comprehensive National League North victory against Leamington FC in midweek and almost repeated the trick after Ashley Hemmings was fouled on the edge of the box, but his piercing strike dropped wide of a post. West Ham’s approach play appeared aimless and they were outfought in midfield. The Kidderminster centre-back Matt Preston made a superb raking challenge on Benrahma on halfway that brought many home supporters to their feet and soon after Fredericks sent a wayward cross straight out of the stadium. Ben Johnson, who was replaced by Cresswell, could only shake his head after sending a pass meant for the captain, Mark Noble, bouncing straight out of play. “Can we play you every week?” came the sarcastic refrain from a raucous North Stand.Penn geed his players from the edge of a muddy technical area amid a carnival atmosphere and they continued to press West Ham into problems. The visitors did at least cause some panic in the Kidderminster box in the second half. Mark Carrington made a desperate block to prevent Benrahma from converting a cross at the front post and Preston made a heroic challenge to deny Bowen as the clock ticked towards 60 minutes after a rare burst by Yarmolenko, who later made a fool of himself when diving in the area. Penn stewed as West Ham tried to find a spark and the arrival of Pablo Fornals helped provide it. Rice powered forward from halfway, playing a one-two with the Spaniard before cutting inside Preston and lashing into the roof of the net. Kidderminster were understandably deflated but not about to roll over. When the left-back Caleb Richards missed a clearance eight minutes into extra time, he sprinted back to make amends. Yarmolenko spread play wide to Benrahma, whose across arrived in the six-yard box, but Richards intervened just as it seemed Bowen would prod home. West Ham had the ball in the net on 110 minutes through Bowen but Yarmolenko strayed offside in the buildup when latching on to a pass by Fornals. But West Ham still had a cruel winner left in the tank.",Sport/Football,Bowen saves West Ham’s blushes in extra-time Cup win over Kidderminster,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/kidderminster-west-ham-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"More than 150 workers at the Jon Donaire Desserts plant in Santa Fe Springs, California, have been on strike since early November over wages, healthcare coverage and working conditions. The dispute centers on food workers, hailed as heroes early in the pandemic, who are struggling to cope with spiraling costs of living as the company that employs them posts billion-dollar revenues.  Workers at the plant, which makes ice-cream cakes for companies such as Baskin-Robbins, Walmart and Safeway, are asking for a $1 an hour raise every year for three years with no cuts to their healthcare costs. Rich Products Corporation, the plant’s owner, has made two offers to the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union, which represents the workers. One proposed a 50¢ raise over one year and 55¢ raises for the following two years. The other offered an overall wage increase of $4.10 an hour, but included significant increases to the cost of workers’ healthcare. “Right now, we’re paying around $130 a month for healthcare. They want to increase it to $480 for a single person and $780 for a family plan,” said Miguel Perez, who has worked at the Jon Donaire plant for 12 years. “The Rich Corporation is not fulfilling its obligation to take care of its employees. They had us working through the whole pandemic. Everybody showed up to work. We all met our quotas as far as production [is concerned], and now that the contract is up they’re trying to nickel-and-dime us into an unacceptable raise.” Workers have highlighted the company owners’ immense wealth and profits in their pressure to secure the raises they are on strike to receive. The chief executive and owner of Rich Products, Robert Rich Jr, has a net worth of $4.9bn. In the first year of the pandemic, Rich Products reported more than $4bn in revenue. Perez also described workplace grievances, including being informed of forced overtime with just a few minutes left at the end of a shift, often being denied permissions to take time off from work to go to a doctor’s appointment, and the treatment of a workforce that is roughly 90% women by supervisors who are mostly men. “Every week we see a woman coming out of the office crying, because she felt like she was disrespected,” added Perez. “We have a lot of that going on. Sometimes the male supervisors are cursing at them, yelling at them, or even making inappropriate gestures.” Jon Donaire denied these allegations, claiming the union has never addressed these grievances with the company. “There are unfortunately many stories with baseless claims that we’ve had to refute throughout this process – and we will continue to do so,” said a spokesperson. It also cited long tenures of employees and an internal survey of workers in March last year, where 80% of Santa Fe Springs’ employees said they would recommend Rich’s to others as a “great place to work”. Cristina Lujan has worked at the Jon Donaire plant for 19 years. Most recently she was on the cake assembly line, decorating cakes at a rate of around 13 a minute. Throughout her time at the plant Lujan said production demands have gotten higher and higher but her pay has not kept up with the increased demands on her nor with the costs of living in the Los Angeles area. “When I started, I was well above minimum wage,” said Lujan. “Now, 19 years later, I’m barely above minimum wage. Our raises have been pennies every contract.” Workers at the plant make on average less than $17 an hour, compared to workers at a Rich Products’ facility in Tennessee, who are paid on average $6 an hour more. “I think he [Robert Rich Jr] can afford to pay us the $1 more that we’re asking for,” said Lujan. “Everything is going up, gas, food, rent and we’re living paycheck to paycheck. Everybody’s tired of feeling that frustration and stress daily. Their big company model is based on family first, but the way they treat us, I don’t think that’s the way you treat family.” On 17 December, workers rejected the company’s contract offer, continuing the strike. Rich Products responded by declaring an impasse in new union contract negotiations and enacting the wage increases they proposed to workers who crossed the picket line, which the company said amounts to almost 60 workers. The company also paid workers who crossed picket lines back pay and a gain sharing bonus. The union has filed unfair labor practice charges against the company for imposing a contract on the unionized workforce that was voted down by workers, which is currently under review at the National Labor Relations Board. Several elected officials, including the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, 25 congressional representatives and seven US senators, have called on the Rich Corporation to bargain in good faith with the union and reach a fair contract. “Rich’s is especially concerned about what the strike has meant for striking associates who have now gone weeks without a paycheck, are not eligible for state unemployment benefits, and will soon forfeit the high-quality healthcare they told the company they wanted to retain,” said a spokesperson for Rich Products. “We are pleased many of our associates have continued to come to work since the strike began and plant production has continued. They deserve the wage increase we proposed and to retain their uninterrupted high-quality healthcare. “We welcome back all striking workers with open arms and will provide the same considerations to them.”",News/Environment,‘Our raises have been pennies’: US cake-makers strike for fair deal as company makes billions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/05/us-cake-workers-california-rich-products-corporation
2/6/2022,"Arsenal had to come back from a goal down against a capable Manchester United side to secure a vital point in the WSL title race. They could have had all three but it was the return of familiar failings in their defence that denied them the chance to really put some distance between themselves and their closest challengers, Chelsea. The hosts were missing two first-choice defenders in Leah Williamson and Lotte Wubben-Moy, with Jen Beattie and Steph Catley replacing them in a rigid back four. Both found it difficult to stifle United’s interchangeable front three, and it seemed as if the United manager Marc Skinner had planned it that way, with his team set up in a 4-3-2-1. There was an obvious target in all this: Katie McCabe, who was facing Alessia Russo on the left flank.  With the United forwards’ darting runs causing problems on the counter, midfielders Jordan Nobbs and Tobin Heath were often having to track back out of position to help McCabe. The combination marking, however, was not enough to prevent Russo popping up to score with a header from Katie Zelem’s corner after 10 minutes to make it 1-0 to the visitors. Confusion in the Arsenal defence continued and it seemed likely that Russo would add to her tally. There was no reprieve on the attack either for the hosts. Though Arsenal were working to create opportunities, United’s high press effectively cut out spaces for their runs. Vivianne Miedema changed the pattern with a moment of magic. The forward made her trademark run down the middle of the United defence but her fierce shot rattled the bar. It was exactly what Arsenal needed to breathe some life into their attack. Where Heath and Beth Mead had cut lonely figures in what should have been quite an attacking 4-3-3, they were now making frequent runs into the United box. The response from Arsenal at the break was to replace Heath with Caitlin Foord. The Australian international slotted in a slightly more central position, perhaps to facilitate the defensive midfield as much as the attack. It was an approach that yielded results, providing more stability in the middle, giving the wide forwards Mead and Miedema some more space to operate in. The latter was really coming to life after moving from the centre to the left wing. Eidevall then shifted from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2. That meant Lia Wälti was back in defence and Kim Little pushed up higher into the attack. The impact was immediate, resulting in one of Arsenal’s best chances of the game. It was Mead who made a swashbuckling run from midfield, delivering a fierce cross that was met by Foord’s left-footed volley, only narrowly parried away by Mary Earps. Arsenal’s second wind wasn’t without its risks. United really should have made it 2-0 halfway through the second half when Ella Toone latched on to a stray pass from Nobbs. She was through on goal but uncharacteristically her strike flashed past the post into the side-netting, a miss that would come back to haunt her. Arsenal’s Katie McCabe was shown a second yellow for a tackle on Ona Battle and as they had already made all their three substitutions the only option looked to be to double up in midfield and abandon their high press. In typical Eidevall style Arsenal did the opposite, and it was the substitute Blackstenius who blazed through to slot the ball past Earps, levelling the game against the run of play with 11 minutes remaining. Both teams were able to hold on through seven minutes of added time and the points were shared. Arsenal will be the more disappointed of the sides, both at their defensive failings and at what this might mean for their hold on top spot in the league. Eidevall and his side will hope a resurgent Manchester City can beat Chelsea on Sunday.",Sport/Football,Stina Blackstenius goal saves point for Arsenal against Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/arsenal-manchester-united-wsl-match-report
2/6/2022,"Where do you stand on sharing your Wordle results? In recent weeks, that innocuous little grid of yellow, green and black squares has become as much a staple of social media as pedantry and passive aggression; it is a cute little flashback to when people’s annoyance at online content peaked with seeing too many pictures of what a stranger had for breakfast. The word-guessing game continues to grow and grow and millions of people are now playing it. One newish poll by Morning Consult suggested that as many as 14% of Americans have joined in and that 59% of players share their results, either “often” or “sometimes”. Whether people post often or sometimes, a kind of grid rage is growing. Perhaps it is the sudden influx, or the sense that people are showing off, or talking about something of little interest to others, all of which are about as standard on the internet as someone choosing My Way on Desert Island Discs. MI6 chief Richard Moore caused a minor stink last week when he tweeted that he was “thinking of unfollowing those who post their Wordle results”, which led to the double whammy of winning support from Anneka Rice and a jovial apology from GCHQ in the form of a mocked-up Wordle page.  I’ll admit, I had a moment. I popped over to Facebook to check in on the conspiracy theorists – odd that Facebook has seen its first ever drop in usage; I can’t think what might be putting people off – and I saw a few grids and clicked away even more hastily than usual. But then I mentioned this to my partner, who promptly told me off for being a misery. “What’s the harm?” she said, pointing out, with irritating reasonableness, that it was quite a nice thing to do. Much of Wordle’s appeal is its niceness. It’s not too hard, not too demanding, and even when it dares to use American spellings or double-vowelled monstrosities, sharing the fact that nice old Wordle is being a pain in the arse is also a very unifying thing to do. Josh Wardle, its creator, sold the game to the New York Times last week and it’s hard to blame him for cashing in. After “Black Thursday”, plenty of households will be looking down the back of the sofa for a Wordle. For now, it will remain free, which is nice. “At the time it moves to the New York Times, Wordle will be free to play for new and existing players,” said the buyer, although I note that it was choosing its words carefully. Once seen, it cannot be unseen. At first, the commemorative plates, teacups and mugs made in China to be sold in the UK, created to commemorate the Queen’s platinum jubilee, look like any other lot of royal memorabilia. Elegant-ish portrait, bit of heraldry, a few flowers, the special dates and a crown. But look closer and it’s there. This batch of 10,800 items failed to commemorate the Queen’s platinum jubilee. Instead, it pays tribute to Her Majesty the Queen on the occasion of her Platinum Jubbly. Lovely. A Jubbly may not sound quite as regal, but something about this affair is fundamentally British, which should please the play-the-national-anthem-on-the-BBC types. Four days off for a Jubbly? I’ll take it. It sounds like one of those old folk traditions, like cheese-rolling or shin-kicking. A competition to invent a special commemorative Jubbly pudding? I’ll order mine today, because it sounds delicious. Plant some trees for the Jubbly? As if schoolchildren won’t love it. Karl Baxter, the entrepreneurial boss of the clearance website that is selling them, told the BBC he is pitching the items as “limited edition” and “unique”. This is the kind of behaviour that wins people The Apprentice, if not the world. It isn’t quite a degree in Taylor Swift studies, but students at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute can study a three-month course on the star, which “proposes to deconstruct both the appeal and aversions to Taylor Swift through close readings of her music and public discourse as it relates to her own growth as an artist and a celebrity”. It will be taught by Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos and, as someone who has read a collection of academic essays on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I have some envy for those who made it on to the course. Apparently, there is a long waiting list. Look what she made you do. I would definitely read, for example, a paper that deconstructed the rise and fall of the Squad, though I do wonder what can be taught in the field of Swiftology that thousands of internet theorists have not already painstakingly pieced together and analysed. After all, this is a woman who can write a scarf into a song and revive that scarf’s status as an international obsession an entire decade later. I have no time for snobbery about the study of pop culture, whether that’s an MA in the Beatles at the University of Liverpool or a module in Beyoncé, gender and race at Copenhagen University. But on hearing about Swift studies, my first thought was clearly conditioned by the shocking expense of higher education in this country. I didn’t think, that sounds intriguing. I thought, that sounds like it would be an expensive frivolity and that seems like such a shame.

2/6/2022,"In the middle of Paris’s third Covid lockdown last March, a hashtag appeared on Twitter with a photo of a lock on the Canal Saint-Martin that runs through the north of the city clogged with litter, plastic bags and bottles. Images of Paris looking worse for wear are nothing new but, within days, dozens of pictures of overflowing bins, broken pavements and graffiti-covered walls appeared with the same hashtag – #SaccageParis – which roughly translates as Trashed Paris.  Today, less than a year on, the hashtag has been used more than 2.7m times on Twitter alone and has become the battle cry for those who fear the once beautiful city is losing its soul. To others, it is a political smear campaign aimed at the Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, also a candidate in this year’s presidential election. Unlike traditional protests, Saccage Paris photographs the streets instead of occupying them. The informal campaign has given disgruntled Parisians a catchy hashtag under which to complain about anything from potholed pavements and roads to ugly park benches, litter, flytipping and graffiti. Whatever the motivations behind the hashtag – the account PanamePropre that coined it remains resolutely anonymous – the movement is gathering momentum and has prompted City Hall to publish a “manifesto for beauty” to smarten up the city, which hosts the Olympic Games in 2024. Jacques Desse does not look or sound like an extreme urban warrior. The softly spoken bookseller would almost certainly prefer to bury his nose in a rare manuscript than speak to the press. But he is angry, and he is not alone. A member of Saccage Paris, he laments the destruction of the city’s historic symbols. Much of the movement’s fury has been targeted at City Hall removing, neglecting or replacing Paris’s instantly recognisable architectural heritage, notably the street furniture, much of it dating from the 19th-century second empire of Napoléon III. “For many of us, Saccage Paris has no political motive. It’s a citizens’ movement and there’s a wide mix of political opinions. What we reproach Anne Hidalgo and her team for is that they have the power to do something about this but they do not use it positively,” Desse told the Observer. “City Hall is annoyed with us because what we show damages its image… but we have no other way.” To outsiders – especially fans of Netflix drama Emily in Paris – the French capital is the picture-postcard city of romance and dreams, of baguettes and boulevards, of high culture and haute couture. Parisians, who live in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, often paint a different picture. Last month, France’s best known royal commentator, Stéphane Bern, announced he was moving out of Paris because it had become dirty, violent and was “a rubbish bin”. “What has happened to the City of Light?,” he said. However, Bern pointed the finger at ordinary Parisians not Hidalgo. “Her job is far from easy, and, as far as I’m aware, she’s not the one making it dirty, nor are the refuse collectors at fault. The biggest culprits are first and foremost the people. She certainly has her share of responsibility but she doesn’t deserve all the attacks aimed at her,” Bern added. Art historian Didier Rykner was less forgiving in his recent book La Disparition de Paris (The Disappearance of Paris), a detailed critique of Hidalgo’s management of the city. But even writing books about the state of Paris is hardly novel. In 1832, Victor Hugo published a pamphlet decrying the “vandals” razing the crumbling medieval towers and churches to build replacements in the then fashionable neoclassic style, and Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, credited for the vast 19th-century transformation of Paris and creator of the celebrated grands boulevards, faced bitter opposition and controversy. PanamePropre has said he is only expressing “the anger of seeing the city I have lived in for more than 20 years deteriorate before my eyes. Thousands of Parisians, and Paris lovers from all over France, ordinary citizens like me, spontaneously united under this hashtag,” he wrote. “It’s amazing how it has caught on,” said Quentin, a young engineer and Saccage Paris activist, who preferred not to give his full name. We are in a cafe near the Porte Saint-Martin in Paris’s 10th arrondissement, where a local hairdresser has painted a large pair of scissors on the pavement under the 17th-century arch. “That is the sort of thing Saccage Paris is about. I’ve reported it but it’s still there,” he said. “It’s true the hashtag has been used by some on the far right, but it’s a hashtag, anyone can use it. That’s just an excuse, the real issue is the damage and removal of the very things that make up Paris’s heritage: its fountains, lampposts, the grilles around the trees, the Metro entrances, the benches … if you see a picture of these things you know exactly where you are. You don’t need a picture of the Eiffel Tower to know it’s Paris, it is instantly recognisable. But the city authorities have been wilfully destroying them for years. When they replace an old bench seat with a new concrete one, it is the identity of Paris they are destroying. It’s deliberate vandalism of the city.” He denied supporters of Saccage Paris are architectural reactionaries. “They say we are against anything modern, that we are opposed to change, but again that’s an excuse. There are some very good modern things, but is a modern concrete bench that is ugly a good thing?” Desse’s cavernous bookshop, behind an anonymous-looking door in the Goutte d’Or, in what is called a “quartier populaire” – a poor, working-class area, with a large migrant population – is down from the Porte de la Chapelle, the northern “gate” where visitors arriving by road meet the chaos of the city head on. The bookseller, who lives above the shop, says the local community feel the municipal authorities have abandoned them. “We have seen the destruction of the urban landscape and disorganisation here and across the city over the last 10-15 years,” Desse said. “The authorities try to do something – more social housing, more cultural centres, more of this and that – but the result is more often than not catastrophic, and they don’t listen to us. It’s like a company run by a bad boss – things are bad all the way down and nothing works. “They are not in touch with reality: perhaps they consider this is normal, that in the north-east of Paris it’s normal to have poor districts where everything is dirty, where there are social problems and drug problems and nothing is done about them. Perhaps they will only notice these problems when they spread elsewhere. Before it was just a few districts like ours that suffered, but now…” City Hall maintains that the movement can be traced back to supporters of the far right and is orchestrated by Hidalgo haters. Like the rubbish on the streets, it is easy to see why, when a social media post about the state of Paris often sparks virulent, sometimes defamatory, attacks on the mayor. Still, officials have reacted to the barrage of criticism. One of Hidalgo’s deputies, Emmanuel Grégoire, recently announced City Hall would publish a three-volume “manifesto for beauty” with plans to smarten up the city and admitted Saccage Paris had made some “useful” points, though he accused it of exaggerating. Grégoire said measures included replacing ugly urban furniture, zero tolerance for rubbish dumping and increased efforts to combat graffiti tagging and illegal fly-posting. Carlos Moreno, a French Columbian scientist, university professor who has lived in Paris for 42 years and acted as an independent adviser to Hidalgo, said the problem was one of centralised authority and lack of joined-up thinking, particularly on rubbish collection and disposal. He urged officials to delegate more to local mayors and appoint an international “chief city designer” with a team of urban experts to oversee aesthetic changes at street level. “The beauty manifesto isn’t enough. These things shouldn’t be decided by civil servants, we need experts,” Moreno said. “Of course, we should keep things that are part of Paris’s heritage, but that doesn’t mean everything old should be kept. And, of course, Paris shouldn’t be a museum so we should have things that are modern and cool but not if they are ugly.” Moreno pointed out Paris has unique challenges caused by its density and the fact it was one of the most visited cities in the world. “It’s not right to say Paris is a rubbish bin; there have been some failures but there have also been some great successes under Anne Hidalgo. Say what you want about her, she has a great vision for the city and I am optimistic for the future,” he said. One thing both sides agree on is that the future for the City of Light is, or could be, bright. “When we started this, City Hall claimed we were all reactionaries. We’re not, but they need to start listening to us,” “I’m optimistic, but I must fight for this city and its heritage,” Quentin said. “We have to find a way to make Paris beautiful again.”",News/World news,Sacre bleu!

2/6/2022,"The Covid booster campaign has stalled, and declining trust in the prime minister is part of the problem, say scientists. Only 26,875 people in England had a third dose or booster on 1 February, the latest complete figures available, and 6 million people are at least six weeks overdue for their shot.  Behavioural scientists, including government advisers, and public health leaders say the huge drop in take-up in just one month is fuelled by the widespread belief that Boris Johnson flouted his own Covid rules. Although Omicron is less deadly than previous variants, it remains a significant health risk to the estimated 5.1 million unvaccinated people aged over 12 in the UK, and the rolling seven-day average of deaths in Britain is above 240. Double-jabbed people have a substantially lower risk of dying. But they remain more vulnerable to infection that can lead to long-term health problems and being taken to hospital, as well as death, in some cases. The perception that Omicron is less dangerous is a major reason why only 64.6% of over-12s in England have had their booster, according to behavioural scientists. The winter surge in infections has also had an impact, since people have to wait 28 days after their infection has cleared before they can be boosted. “Worry about infection has fallen to 52% of adults,” said John Drury, professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex, referring to ONS data published last week. “You can trace that to 27 January when the government announced that we didn’t need to have any measures. That communicates something about risk, that infection is OK because it’s not associated very strongly with death.” UCL’s Covid Social Study, which has tracked attitudes to pandemic measures, released a report last week showing that unvaccinated and double-jabbed people were much less worried about catching Covid, becoming seriously ill, developing long Covid, or possible future variants. But they were more concerned than triple-jabbed people about being asked to get more vaccinations. “In addition, most people who aren’t vaccinated have chosen not to because of a lack of trust,” Drury said. “And who has trust in this government now?” Research by Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University, showed that the partygate scandals had created “variant fatigue” with some participants in his December study saying they would ignore rules at Christmas because of the Downing Street parties. “Trust in authorities has taken a battering recently,” he said. “One of the predictors of vaccine decisions is trust in authorities – we saw that in a big study in Denmark – and trust has certainly not got any better recently.” He cited opinion polls showing declining trust, including a YouGov survey in December showing that one in 10 people would not follow Covid rules. Prof Susan Michie, director of the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change and part of the SPI-B group that advises the government’s Sage group, said: “We know vaccine hesitancy is often associated with not trusting authority. The ‘get boosted’ message was heralded by the prime minister and recent events have meant that trust in politicians has decreased, undermining the ‘get boosted’ message.” The NHS has been attempting to reverse the decline in booster uptake by reminding people to come forward. It sent texts to 2.4 million people last week and has opened 1,000 walk-in “Grab a Jab” centres. It is also working with employers to vaccinate people in workplaces. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS England vaccination programme, said new ONS research showed the risk of death involving Covid was 93% lower for people who had had a booster or third dose of vaccine compared with unvaccinated people. She said: “It is vital that as soon as you can get the vaccine you take up the offer and book a guaranteed slot online. “Despite the Omicron variant seeming milder, it is important we don’t lose sight of the fact that Covid is still a very serious illness that is affecting thousands of people’s lives every day.” Dr Doug Brown, the chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, said: “Three doses of the vaccine doesn’t completely stop transmission but the rate of transmission is halved between people.” Immuno-compromised people, such as cancer and kidney patients, did not respond as well to vaccines as those with healthy immune systems, he added. “By getting your booster, that reduction in transmission really does play an important role in not just keeping ourselves safe, but those who are more clinically vulnerable as well. Prof Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: “I know people are tired. I know the government wants to move on. But we will only be able to get through this with people getting the vaccine. We need to establish who hasn’t been vaccinated, and how we help them.” National Immunisation Management System data shows that by 11 January, 78.7% of people over 18 in the richest areas had had a third dose, compared with 46.9% in the most deprived. ONS data shows that 35.9% of pupils eligible for free school meals have received a first dose, compared with 58.9% for those not eligible. “It’s heartbreaking to see the discrimination and the health inequalities between the poorest in our country,” Rae said. She said that ministers must continue to fund the vaccination programme. “I think the Treasury is trying to recoup the money that it spent during the pandemic and they want the Covid response money back. I think it’s right and proper that some of the private sector spending on test and trace does go back, because I’m not convinced all of it was spent effectively. But what I don’t want is further cuts to the public health system. “The booster campaign was introduced at the last minute. Throughout this pandemic, they have been three weeks behind every sensible action or decision – the first lockdown was a classic example. The virus has outrun them the whole time. “We need to keep up momentum because we’ve still got another few months of winter to go with all the vulnerabilities that brings. I’m not comfortable that 350 people a day are dying in our country. I think that’s shocking – absolutely shocking.",News/World news,Booster campaign stalls as ‘partygate’ undermines trust in official advice,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/booster-campaign-stalls-as-partygate-undermines-trust-in-official-advice
2/6/2022,"Superstar televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker was a queer ally; with her tattooed lip liner and drag queen makeup, she was a queer icon too. Disappointingly, Michael Showalter’s biopic couldn’t be straighter. Based on the 2000 documentary of the same name by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, Jessica Chastain and Andrew Garfield star as Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker, a husband-and-wife duo whose cheery evangelical sermons and handmade puppets help them develop a cult following. By the mid 1970s, they’ve become successful enough to start their own TV network, a business venture that funds their opulent lifestyle. Their lakeside palace is a riot of cream, gold and fur. For Tammy Faye, it’s evidence that their piety has been rewarded – except Jim has been fudging the accounts.  The film smiles politely at Tammy Faye’s tacky aesthetic without ever fully embracing it, a bad-faith approach to its heroine. It reveres her feminist impulses – one scene sees her literally drag a seat up to a table of men – but then implies she had no agency when Jim drove them into debt. Her lust for money is glossed over; there is the sense that acknowledging her complicity could make her a less blandly likable heroine. The real Tammy Faye was more complex. Chastain, ordinarily so good at projecting innocence, is unable to imbue the character with a sense of inner life. Beneath the prosthetics, she’s simply a collection of tics and mannerisms, all pawing hands and Betty Boop giggle.",Arts/Film,The Eyes of Tammy Faye review – disappointingly straight biopic of a queer icon,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/05/the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-review-jessica-chastain-andrew-garfield-bakker
2/6/2022,"A father who was released without charge after ploughing his car into a knife attacker to try to stop him killing a woman has said it was his “duty” to act. Abraham, 26, who was originally arrested on suspicion of murder, said he had prayed for God’s forgiveness following the incident in Maida Vale, west London.  Yasmin Chkaifi, 43, a mother of two, died on 24 January when she was ambushed in the street by her former partner Leon McCaskie, 41, who also used the surname McCaskre. Witnesses tried unsuccessfully to stop McCaskie, before Abraham ran him over in his blue Renault Clio. McCaskie was pronounced dead at the scene. Abraham, reportedly an electrician and married father with two children under five, told the Daily Mail: “Should you see an evil it is your duty to stop it with your hands. “If you cannot, then you should stop it by speaking out. So I was thinking: ‘How could I face God if I don’t help? It is my duty, my religion.’ In that moment I knew I had to act.” Abraham, originally from Chechnya, said he was on his way to work when he heard shouting and screaming and saw a man with a steel blade in his hand stab a woman on the floor three times in the chest, an experience that left him “shocked and terrified”. He said: “I thought: ‘I cannot go away and leave her.’ I had to help, to try to save her. I did not have time to consider. I thought the safest and quickest option was to push the man away from the woman with my car. “So I put my car into first gear and drove up the kerb and on to the pavement. It was a short distance, 10 or 12ft, and I pushed him, I made an impact. I managed to avoid the woman. “Then I took my foot off the gas but my car didn’t stop. The momentum continued and I knew the man was under my car. I opened the door and I saw his hand sticking out from under it. That sight stays with me and always will: the man’s hand sticking out. “My car hit a garden wall and stalled and I tried to reverse but the engine wouldn’t turn over. I kept trying to start the car, to free the man, but I couldn’t. I shouted for help.” The Metropolitan police originally launched a murder investigation against the 26-year-old, but said on Tuesday that investigators had reviewed the law around self-defence and defence of another person, and now considered Abraham “a vital witness”, rather than a suspect. Det Ch Insp Neil Rawlinson, who has led the investigation, added that Abraham would be “offered support from professionals to help him come to terms with the terrifying situation he was confronted with”. More than 75,000 people had signed a petition in support of Abraham, and his lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said members of Chfaiki’s family had hailed him as “a hero”, called for his release and were in the process of arranging a private meeting with him. Abraham said he was in “shock” when he was arrested. He added: “I took my head in my hands and thought: ‘How has this happened?’ I’d tried to save a woman’s life and I’d killed a man. I said a prayer: ‘God forgive me for what I have done.”’ McCaskie, it emerged, was wanted by police after failing to turn up to court on 4 January over allegations that he had breached a stalking order by approaching Chkaifi in west London in July last year.",News/UK news,Londoner who drove car at knife attacker says it was his ‘duty’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/05/londoner-who-drove-car-at-knife-attacker-says-it-was-his-duty
