2/26/2022,"A woman realized she was being catfished by one of her dating app matches after receiving green texts messages from him. While there are jokes — and even real studies — about the differences between Android and iPhone users, in this case Jocelyn (@jjustjocelyn) wasn’t turned off because she was texting an Android user, but by the fact that it contradicted something in the man’s Bumble profile. See this bedroom turn into a vibrant oasis after an incredible one-day renovation: Jocelyn uploaded a video explaining that she had matched with a “good looking” guy named Myles and, after exchanging a few messages, decided to give Myles her phone number. Myles reached out to make dinner plans and Joceyln was confused by the green messages because Myles was clearly wearing an Apple Watch in one of the photos on his profile. “What does green mean?” Jocelyn asked, referring to Myles’ texts. “It means he does not have an iPhone.” While it’s not impossible to own an Android and wear an Apple Watch, pairing the two devices is not recommended because of the number of issues that will crop up with the two different operating systems. Plus, an Apple Watch needs to be connected to an iPhone during the initial setup. Before replying to Myles’ text about dinner, Jocelyn decided to do some investigating. “I do a reverse image search of some of the pictures that he used on his profile and what do we have here? An Instagram model from New York,” Jocelyn said. “I live in Ontario.” Jocelyn’s video has since racked up over 1 million views since she posted it, with Bumble’s TikTok account even commenting an apology. “We’re so sorry to hear about this!” Bumble wrote. “We’ve found the member and permanently removed them.” In a follow-up video, Jocelyn added that she tried looking up Myles’ number, per a suggestion someone wrote in the comments, and couldn’t find it or its service provider online. She claimed this could mean he had been using a separate app to send her texts. Fake dating app profiles are not exactly rare — a 2019 study found that around 10% of dating profiles are fake. Unfortunately, it seemed like many commenters had similar stories to Jocelyn’s. “This happened to me too,” a commenter wrote. “I almost drove two hours to see him but something in my gut told me there was something off.” Watch this tiny bedroom get an organization overhaul in just one day: The post Woman catches Bumble catfish after seeing his texts appeared first on In The Know.

The images and videos show a missile striking a Russian military airfield near the border of Ukraine, but it is unclear who is responsible for the incident, CNN reported. A source in the law enforcement agencies near the airbase told local outlet Komsomolskaya Pravda it was a Ukrainian Tochka-U missile that hit the facility. The attack on the airfield in Millerovo, Russia, was done by Ukrainian armed formations, according to CNN, which cited local outlet Rostov Gazeta. Videos show several fires on the runway in the facility that is 10 miles from Ukraine's border, CNN noted.

2/26/2022,"By Luc Cohen NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - A new prosecutor has been chosen to lead a criminal probe into former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Manhattan district attorney's office said on Friday, after the departures of two top lawyers threw the investigation's future into question. Susan Hoffinger will now lead the probe into Trump and the practices of his family business, the Trump Organization, according to Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney. This week Special Counsel Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz - who had been leading the probe begun by former District Attorney Cyrus Vance - resigned. The New York Times reported they left after Bragg indicated to them he had doubts about pursuing a case against Trump. Reuters has not been able to reach Dunne or Pomerantz for comment. Ron Fischetti, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hoffinger's appointment. On Wednesday, Fischetti said the departures indicated ""the case is over"" and that Bragg would not bring charges against Trump. Both Bragg's probe and a separate civil investigation by New York State Attorney General Letitia James focus on whether Trump misrepresented the value of his real estate properties. Investigators are looking into whether values were inflated to obtain bank loans and reduced to lower tax bills. Trump, a Republican who left office in January 2021, has previously denied wrongdoing and said both the state and city investigations were politically motivated. He has not ruled out seeking the presidency again in 2024. Both Bragg and James are Democrats, as is Vance, who did not seek re-election. The criminal probe resulted last July in tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Both Weisselberg and the company pleaded not guilty. Neither the Trump Organization nor its lawyer Alan Futerfas immediately responded to requests for comment. Last week, a state judge overseeing James' probe directed Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, to answer questions under oath in depositions. The Trump family will appeal that ruling, their lawyer said. James said on Friday that the appeal would not affect her team's investigation. ""Make no mistake: My office will continue to pursue this case without fear or favor because no one is above the law,"" James said in a statement. Hoffinger worked at a private law firm focusing on criminal defense before joining Bragg's office as executive assistant district attorney and chief of investigations in February, according to her LinkedIn profile. She had previously served in the Manhattan District Attorney's office in the 1990s.
