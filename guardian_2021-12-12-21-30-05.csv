12/12/2021,"The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts. With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community’s hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.  Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate. In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war. A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission’s decisions to block high-profile figures including the warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army and son of the former dictator, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, and the interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, from standingfrom standing for the presidency. It said in a statement on Saturday thatit could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was “keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements”. Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid. In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force. Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi. He denies wrongdoing. The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognised. In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel. Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens. The international community’s ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser. Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections. The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections. The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said “refusing to go to the elections and mobilising to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power”.",News/World news,Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/libya-plan-for-presidential-election-on-24-december-close-to-collapse

It’s the colossal love of his new owner, 12-year-old Emily Elizabeth (Darby Camp of Big Little Lies) that transforms the red Andrex puppy with velvet CGI fur from the size of a child’s slipper into a cuddly, 10ft giant. “It’s New York, no one will notice,” insists Jack Whitehall’s irresponsible Uncle Casey in this benign live-action adaptation of Norman Bridwell’s popular picture books. Whitehall adopts an American accent, only to break into his natural voice to annoying comic effect.

12/12/2021,"It’s tempting to see a Hollywood trajectory, a yuletide miracle, in Sir Matthew Bourne’s life. As a teenager, almost every night, he would take the bus down to London’s West End to hang around at stage doors to collect autographs from the stars. Four or five decades on he can look back on a string of shows that have seen his own name in lights as probably the most famous and innovative choreographer and dance impresario of his generation. To prove the happy ending, having once crossed his fingers and made a wish for Barbra Streisand’s signature, he’s now on her Christmas card list. (“We get one every year,” he says, “‘From Barbra and Jim.’”) Bourne grew up in a rented house in Walthamstow on the outer edge of north-east London and the number 38 bus into town would take him along Islington High Street. He’d look out from the top deck and think: “This is where I’ll live one day” – without the first idea of how he’d get there. Fast forward again and he now lives in the Georgian suburb in a house in which the choral arrangement for Hark! The Herald Angels Sing was written. It’s a wonderful life.  We meet in his favourite local brasserie, Bellanger, for brunch on a chilly Saturday. There’s a proper Manhattan clamour and clatter to the place, a big echoey room in which, at noon, everyone seems to be taking off hats and coats while enthusiastically greeting old mates. Bourne has been a regular here for five years. He and his long-term partner, Arthur Pita, also a choreographer (and formerly one of the swans in Bourne’s celebrated all-male Swan Lake) like it partly because it is not just dog-friendly but positively dog-loving. They bring their Russian toy terrier Ferdinand (named after the bull in the Disney story, who preferred flowers and poetry to fighting), and he sits and watches the north London world go by while waiters tempt him with filtered water and homemade biscuits. As Bourne orders a big plate of eggs florentine and a coffee, the waiter reminds him that he was also here last night. He has a rare day off from visits to his acclaimed new touring show, The Midnight Bell, which he wrote and devised based on the Hangover Square novels of Patrick Hamilton and 1930s Soho – as well as intensive rehearsals for The Nutcracker down in Plymouth. Bourne first reimagined The Nutcracker in a more contemporary setting 30 years ago. It’s been a decade since his company, New Adventures in Dance, put it on so there’s a proper excitement to it again. “For most dance companies,” he says, “it’s the annual fixture that brings in the money. They have to do it every year, and they all start to hate it. We’re lucky to have lots of Christmas shows that we do. So for most of our dancers in it, it’s very new to them, the music is even unfamiliar.” Also, of course there‘s still the undeniable thrill and relief of being back in the studio after the long months of isolation and lockdown. Bourne made a poignant little film while the theatres were closed of some of his dancers performing at home or in their gardens their parts in his staging of The Red Shoes, which was in the middle of a sold-out run when the pandemic started. As a company they’ve fared better than most, he says, because they have only a small number of full-time staff and – fortunately – no permanent building. “But it’s been awful for the dancers. Their career is often quite short and these are precious years, lost.” Many have found the return quite tough, psychologically. “We’ve encountered a lot of lack of confidence,” Bourne says. Dancers are used to daily repetition, constantly fine-tuning the muscle memory that goes with performance, the lay-off has interrupted that. Bourne recalls how, when he first started working as a choreographer and stopped dancing regularly himself, he completely lost his nerve about being on stage again, even in minor roles. “As soon as you stop,” he says, “you realise what a big deal it is to go and stand in front of people and say: ‘I’m good enough for you to watch. Look at me. I’m worth your money.’” On a selfish level, however, he says, he quite enjoyed the downtime of the break, a unique interval in a schedule that has taken him all across the country and the globe for 30 years. While the theatres were closed he finished The Midnight Bell, worked on renovating a flat he and Pita have bought in Brighton, and also he says, no stranger to nostalgia, catalogued all of his autograph collection from years ago. That addiction began when his mum took him to see Dame Edith Evans and Friends, the actress’s final outing at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 1974, when he was 13. “It happened to be the opening night, and all these famous people were there. Mrs Bridges from Upstairs Downstairs, for one, I remember.” After that he was hooked on first nights, premieres. “I got Charlie Chaplin, Fred Astaire, Bette Davis face to face,” he says. Among the collection were signatures that surprised him. “Three Freddie Mercurys, for example, that I’ve got no memory of getting.” Looking back, the autograph habit was, he understands, a way of wanting to connect with a world that seemed out of reach. But it was also a kind of education in new plays, new actors. He saw everything. “Now of course, if you were thinking of a career in the arts you might think about what college to go to.” His parents fed his passion. His mum was a secretary and his dad worked at Thames Water; they spent all their spare money on theatre tickets. “We were always singing at home; my dad thought he was Frank Sinatra. But West End musicals, never opera or dance.” The first ballet Bourne saw was Swan Lake when he was 18, at Sadler’s Wells; he was captivated, he says, not by the beauty of it but the weirdness and eccentricity. He taught himself to dance at home. “My first ever dance class was my audition for dance college when I was 21,” he says. He’d come out three years before, but never really to his parents. “It just became apparent,” he says, “and they were always welcoming to my friends. That was a charmed existence, compared to some stories.” With savings from his first job filing at the BBC he went to New York, stayed at the Y – “in that golden moment before Aids” – saw Angela Lansbury in Sweeney Todd, got Andy Warhol’s autograph, and then went to the west coast and did the bus tours of Hollywood homes. It was Bourne’s landmark Swan Lake that gave him an entry into that world full time. He took the production to LA and was the hottest ticket in town. All the stars came backstage afterwards. “I remember Warren Beatty insisting I call him any time,” he says. “I was invited to Barbra Streisand’s house for lunch [hence the Christmas card]…” His great fear after that was that he would be a one-hit wonder, defined by Swan Lake. His answer to that was to never stop creating. He has over the years been tempted to choreograph three passion projects from his childhood – Mary Poppins, Oliver!, My Fair Lady – for others. But he has always returned to his regular company. “The important thing for me has been to form a team of people to work with,” he says. “In New Adventures, there are people who have been with me for 30 years. And that’s why the work gets better, I think. There’s so much shorthand that you don’t have if you start from scratch all the time, though it gets hard to find something original as you get older.” The other thought that crept into his mind during the enforced period of rest was that familiar assessment of where he was up to in life. His parents died a decade ago and since then he has worked to create an alternative family. “I’m 62 in January,” he says, “and beginning to think: ‘Do I want to keep touring and so on?’” He is aware his role has changed, too, in rehearsals: in Plymouth he obviously can no longer get up and demonstrate what he wants from The Nutcracker, as he could when he first devised it. But even as he’s explaining this to me, finishing up a post-brunch beer, I can sense the process has lost none of its original adventure for him. As he well knows, what better balletic drama is there than to dream of a future and to wake up each morning and remember it came true?

12/12/2021,"The US describes its newly announced diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, backed by Britain and other western countries, as a protest against China’s “egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang”, where the Chinese Communist party (CCP) is accused of genocide, as well as its evisceration of Hong Kong’s democracy. Yet a separate, lurking worry informs Washington’s action: that China may turn the games into a propaganda extravaganza, showcasing its growing strength to a global audience. Think Gladiator, and then think Xi Jinping, China’s authoritarian president, acting like a latter-day Roman emperor exercising power over life and death.  It’s not a fanciful image. An independent tribunal’s report last week described the ghastly reality facing thousands of Uyghurs who suffer “acts of unconscionable cruelty, depravity and inhumanity”, including torture and organised gang rapes, in Xinjiang’s concentration camps. As the world’s athletes get a thumbs up to perform at the “people’s games”, Emperor Xi gives his uncounted, unseen victims a callous thumbs down. It’s difficult to regard Xi – with his unassailable dictatorial powers, his techno-fascist surveillance state that stifles dissent and oppresses minorities, and his aggressively expansionist foreign policy – as anything other than a totalitarian control freak with imperial fantasies. Empires, especially Britain’s, get a bad press nowadays. Their close association with colonialism, racism, slavery and other evils is reason enough. But the assumption that such abuses have been banished ignores what is happening in today’s world, right under our noses. Imperialism, in all its awful forms, still poses a threat. But it is no longer the imperialism of the west, rightly execrated and self-condemned. Today’s threat emanates from the east. Just as objectionable, and potentially more dangerous, it’s the prospect of a totalitarian 21st-century Chinese global empire. Historically speaking, empire-building relies on three factors, or projections. First come overseas trade networks or hubs, via maritime links and land corridors. Following close behind comes the establishment of overseas military bases to secure and defend these new interests, with or without local consent. Last, nascent empires establish an (often delusional) narrative, or “mission statement”, to justify their activities. British imperialists claimed to be a civilising force, bringing law and Christianity to the great unwashed. The postwar American empire was, supposedly, all about championing democracy. Almost as if it had made a study, the CCP is following this western imperialist handbook to the letter – with one important caveat. Beijing does not fight distant foreign wars to sustain its dominance, as the US did in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and Britain did all over the world. Not yet, anyway. The first phase of China’s new imperial age is already in train. Xi’s ambitious belt and road investment and infrastructure initiative (BRI) touches 60 countries. China is the world’s largest trading nation and largest exporter, with $2.6tn worth of exports in 2019. The CCP’s focus is meanwhile shifting to empire phase two: military bases. US media reported last week that the port city of Bata in Equatorial Guinea could become China’s first Atlantic seaboard naval base – potentially putting warships and submarines within striking distance of America’s east coast. In what could serve as a case study of Chinese neo-imperial strategy, Beijing offered billions in loans to Equatorial Guinea’s corrupt dictator, who the US in contrast accuses of serious human rights abuses. In such ways are alliances forged and empires built. China already has a naval base in Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa. It is said to be considering an island airbase in Kiribati that could in theory threaten Hawaii. Meanwhile, it continues to militarise atolls in the South China Sea. A Pentagon report last month predicted China will build a string of military bases girdling the world, including in the Arctic. CCP “target” countries include Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya and Angola, it said. US concerns about Chinese inroads in Central America centre on Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua. Nor is Europe immune to CCP power projection: witness the worries over Huawei, espionage, and the Piraeus port “gateway to Europe” scheme. Xi makes no bones about his aim to achieve global ascendancy, remake the international order in China’s image, and dominate emerging 21st-century technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced computing, information management and the weaponisation of space. At the same time he spins a softer message, the sort of comforting narrative predatory imperial powers prefer. China is no threat, he says. Rather, we are your benevolent friends, partners for global prosperity. Last week, marking Joe Biden’s “summit for democracy”, to which it was not invited, Beijing even claimed, absurdly, to be the only truly functional democracy and an example to others. In a speech in July marking the party’s centenary, Xi offered a less reassuring insight into his combative ideas. Imperial might is right, he suggested. Where Britannia once bobbed about, now China rules the waves. “We have never bullied, oppressed, or subjugated the people of any other country, and we never will. By the same token we will never allow anyone to bully, oppress or subjugate [China],” he said. “Anyone who tries will find themselves on a collision course with a steel wall forged by 1.4 billion people.” By key measures – the number of overseas bases, alliances, military strike-power – America still greatly outstrips China’s regime; likewise in terms of respect for human values and rights. Xi’s BRI ambitions are meeting increased pushback. But too often, the west appears unsure how to handle China’s challenge. The partial Olympics boycott smacks of weakness. After two centuries on imperialism’s receiving end, the Chinese empire strikes back. Trouble is, Xi’s vision of future global dominion is centrally controlled, collectively oppressive, individually crushing totalitarianism. He promises only misery for the masses.",Opinion/Opinion,"In China’s new age of imperialism, Xi Jinping gives thumbs down to democracy | Simon Tisdall",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/xi-jinping-china-beijing-new-age-of-imperialism
12/12/2021,"Down the ages there has been no shortage of central bankers intent on squeezing inflation out of the system, but Paul Volcker is in a class of his own. Appointed by Jimmy Carter in 1979 when the US annual inflation rate was well into double digits, Volcker administered brutal shock treatment to the world’s biggest economy, at one point pushing official interest rates above 20%. Fans of the 6 ft 7in (2.04m) chairman of the Federal Reserve continue to be in awe of his single-minded approach to price stability. Volcker is the inflation hawks’ hawk.  Judged by its own lights, the strategy worked. Inflation peaked in 1980, and was one of the reasons Carter lost the presidency to Ronald Reagan that year, but then started to fall rapidly as sky-high interest rates led to business failures and mass job losses. The US inflation rate is currently 6.8%, its highest for 39 years, but in 1982 it was coming down not going up. Inevitably, comparisons have been drawn between Volcker’s no-nonsense approach to inflation and that of the current Fed chairman, Jerome Powell. Official interest rates in the US have been pegged at close to zero since the start of the pandemic almost two years ago, even though the economy is likely to grow by around 6% this year and unemployment has been falling fast. Powell is a Republican but many in his own party think the removal of the stimulus provided by the Fed in early 2020 is long over-due. It is about time, according to his critics, he started to emulate Volcker since otherwise US inflation will continue to spiral higher. The jury’s out on that because while the Omicron strain of Covid-19 will add to supply bottlenecks and so push up the price of goods, it has already led to a fall in the cost of crude oil, which will mean Americans have to pay less to fill up at the pumps. As things stand, it looks as if the headline rate of US inflation might have peaked but the core rate – which excludes energy and food – is likely to remain stubbornly high. Even so, Powell is not remotely considering becoming Volcker redux – and nor could he do so without triggering a monumental financial crisis, not just in the US but in the rest of the developed world and in emerging economies as well. Volcker was a big man in every sense of the word but his get-tough approach to tackling inflation had some unfortunate side-effects, of which four are worth mentioning here. For a start, as anybody who listens to the music of Bruce Springsteen from the early 1980s can testify, bringing inflation down so quickly had a devastating impact on America’s manufacturing sector. Many communities in the Mid-West were one-company towns and they were hollowed out when those business closed or moved their operations overseas to countries with cheaper labour costs. All sorts of problems – physical and mental – resulted from this de-industrialisation. Political problems too, because without the wipeout of industry in Ohio and Pennsylvania Donald Trump would never have made it to the White House. Some of the American companies that survived Volcker’s monetarism moved their operations south to Mexico, but many others outsourced across the Pacific to China, where the economic reform programme under Deng Xiaoping was just getting underway. It could be argued that it was only a matter of time before China emerged as a manufacturing superpower but there is no doubt Volckerism gave Beijing a helping hand. Few among the American policy establishment would have imagined four decades ago that China would have moved so rapidly from low-cost manufacturing to a position where it is a rival to the US in hi-tech sectors such as artificial intelligence. Nobody sees China as a backwater these days, and the economic threat it poses to a century-long US hegemony is a cause of growing geopolitical tension. The third side-effect of crushing US inflation in the early 1980s was the Latin American debt crisis. Countries that borrowed heavily in dollars from US banks in the late 1970s found the loans unpayable when American interest rates rocketed and the global recession that resulted choked off their exports. Many developing countries are in an analogous position today: they have borrowed in dollars at the low interest rates that have prevailed since the global financial crisis and have used future export earnings as collateral. The International Monetary Fund says up to 40 of the world’s lowest-income countries are either in debt distress or at risk of it, so a Volcker-like increase in interest would be ruinous for them. Last, but not least, the Volcker era altered the balance of the US economy, making industry weaker and finance stronger. From the late 1970s and early 80s onwards, the driving force behind the American economy has not been its still-significant manufacturing sector but its banks. As the economy has become increasingly “financialised” so Wall Street has ceased to be a conduit for providing capital to growing businesses but instead has come to serve nobody but itself. Keynes once said the job was unlikely to be well done if speculation was the primary focus of financial markets, and his words have never been truer. Financialisation has gone so far in the US that the Federal Reserve now cannot take the sort of action Volcker deployed 40 years ago because it would lead to a crash just as severe – and perhaps worse – than that of 1929. Powell is therefore trapped. He has to respond slowly and carefully or risk a full-blown sell off. Wall Street has the whip hand these days, not the Federal Reserve. And for that, despite his reputation, Volcker is partly to blame.",News/Business,Tame US inflation carefully or risk some nasty side-effects,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/12/us-inflation-must-be-tamed-carefully-or-risk-the-nasty-side-effects-of-80s-monetarism
12/12/2021,"A flatbed rail wagon speeding through south-west Russia last week carried an ill omen for negotiations to avert a larger war with Ukraine. On board was a Buk-M1, the kind of medium-range surface-to-air missile system that became notorious in 2014 after a missile fired from territory controlled by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine shot down a Malaysian airliner, killing all 298 people aboard.  If Russia goes to war in Ukraine, it still needs to take a number of steps: establishing fuel supply lines, opening field hospitals and deploying air-defence systems such as the Buk that would protect its heavy weaponry and troops near the front. Even as Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin were sitting down to talks meant to end the crisis, Russia was inching closer to being ready to launch a full-scale ground invasion of its neighbour. “These data allow us to conclude that despite the negotiations between Biden and Putin, the concentration of Russian troops in the areas bordering the territory controlled by the Ukrainian authorities continues,” wrote the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) – an online research group that has used social media, railway schedules and other data to reveal details of Russia’s military buildup on the border. Putin may still decide not to launch an invasion, as he leaves troops near the front as leverage for negotiations. But Russian and western analysts are predicting that this military buildup – the second one this year – portends a series of future crises over Ukraine as Putin seeks to reverse its trajectory towards the west. “Even if Putin gets something from the west, serious talks or discussions about guarantees – will that be enough for Putin?” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R.Politik. “We are witnessing the dawn of a new geopolitical adventurism from Russia.” Despite the Putin-Biden talks, the crisis is growing deeper. On Thursday, Russia’s FSB said it had intercepted a Ukrainian ship in the Sea of Azov near Crimea for failing to obey orders. A day later, Russia closed nearly 70% of the Sea of Azov, a shared body of water also used by Ukraine, for firing drills. Then there is the escalating rhetoric. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has said Russia and the US may be hurtling towards a repeat of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. And Putin said that the situation in eastern Ukraine “looked like genocide” in a recent meeting, raising fears he could seek a pretext to send his troops into the country. With its military threat on the table, Russia’s foreign ministry released its list of demands for how to end the crisis on Friday. Chief among them was for Nato to “officially disavow the decision of the 2008 Bucharest Nato summit that ‘Ukraine and Georgia will become Nato members’”. Putin has spent the last two decades trying to fight Nato expansion, but the possible accession of Ukraine into the military alliance has always touched deeper emotions, and in part motivated him to order the annexation of Crimea and provoke a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 14,000 people. “I told them: please don’t touch Ukraine or there’s going to be a problem,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, an influential Russian foreign policy analyst, of his discussions with western colleagues about Nato’s enlargement in the 2000s. “There is a real red line. Right or wrong … this kind of engagement with Ukraine on security and military affairs – that is seen here as absolutely unacceptable.” Lukyanov said Putin saw it as his “duty as president” not to leave the “Ukrainian problem” – meaning its trajectory towards the west – for the next Russian leader. The US has sought to persuade Russia that Ukraine would not join the alliance any time soon, but on Friday Moscow demanded a more formal declaration. That was a non-starter, Nato head Jens Stoltenberg said within hours of the demand being made public. “Nato’s relationship with Ukraine is going to be decided by the 30 Nato allies and Ukraine – no one else,” he said during a press conference with Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz. In Ukraine, support for joining Nato has jumped considerably in recent years as the country has sought protection from an increasingly aggressive Russia. And for the nations on Nato’s eastern flank, allowing Russia to dictate the alliance’s policy on Ukraine is seen as the first step down a slippery slope towards recognising a Russian sphere of influence. “History shows that pledges of neutrality by Ukraine or any other country in the region do nothing to abate Putin’s appetite; rather, they feed it,” wrote Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in an article published by Foreign Affairs on Friday. “The best way to respond to such ultimatums is to ignore them altogether.” There are doubts whether Russia really wants to strike any deal at all. Analysts noted that despite Moscow building up its forces for months, Russian diplomats had not prepared any formal documents or even formulated the country’s demands until last week. And the idea of mustering nearly 100,000 troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian border (the US has said that Russia could increase that number to 175,000 by the end of January) just to hold talks with Biden has struck western observers as overkill. That brings us back to the Buk, which, as CIT noted, had its numbers crudely painted over in an effort to prevent identification. Russia employed similar tactics during its clandestine invasion of Ukraine in 2014. The clock is ticking. Putin could pull back, but it would be embarrassing to do so without a solid win in hand. And Russia’s demands look impossible to fulfil for the west: “Putin thinks that if Biden wants, he can move mountains, he can convince allies and convince Kyiv [to make concessions],” said Stanovaya. “This problem could lead Putin to demand the impossible and push the stakes so high that everything ends in war.”",News/World news,Russia edges closer to war as new arms arrive on Ukraine’s border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/russia-closer-to-war-ukraine-border-putin-buk-missiles
12/12/2021,"People have been admitted to hospital with the Omicron variant in Britain, a government minister has confirmed, as a senior public health adviser said further curbs may be needed. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said he could confirm there were “cases in hospital with Omicron”. “We’ve been able to test people who are in hospital over the past two weeks, and so there is a lag to hospitalisation,” he told Trevor Phillips on Sky News.  Speaking to the BBC, Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser of the UK Health Security Agency, said hospitals were diagnosing Omicron in an increasing number of people coming into emergency departments and that the numbers in hospital were expected to increase. No deaths have been reported so far from Omicron, although it is just over two weeks since the variant was first detected in the UK, and there is normally a time lag of three to four weeks between infection and death, should that happen. “I think it’s too early to make any assumption at this point in time,” Hopkins said. Hopkins said it was “inevitable that we’re going to see a big wave of infections” but that it was not yet clear how many of these cases would be severe. The reports follow a warning on Saturday from leading scientists that a failure to impose tougher Covid restrictions could lead to a further 25,000 to 75,000 deaths – or 175,000 to 492,000 hospital admissions – over the next five months. The researchers, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, predicted that a massive wave of infections was likely to sweep the nation in January. A major unknown is the extent to which vaccines will protect against more serious disease. Hopkins said further restrictions could be needed to protect the NHS but that it would take another two weeks to know whether the UK was heading into a more optimistic scenario in which Omicron causes milder illness, or the more extreme end of projections. “The challenge is there’s a big difference between 2,000 and 10,000 admissions a day,” she said. Asked whether there were plans to vaccinate children aged five to 11, Zahawi, the former vaccines minister, added: “There is no plan at the moment to vaccinate primary school children for the reason that the Joint Committee on Vaccination [and Immunisation] is still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection it would offer those.” He added: “The most important thing is to boost the most vulnerable – that is absolutely the priority.”",News/World news,"UK has Omicron Covid patients in hospital, government confirms",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/uk-has-omicron-covid-patients-in-hospital-government-confirms
12/12/2021,"On a farm in rural Iceland, Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) is visiting his brother, Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason). Expecting lunch with Ingvar and his wife, Maria (Noomi Rapace), he’s perplexed by a third guest at the table. “What the fuck is this?” he asks. Audiences might well ask the same throughout Icelandic film-maker Valdimar Jóhannsson’s fun, freaky debut feature. In the first act, hot hipster couple Ingvar and Maria deliver a lamb. A cut to their awestruck faces tells us that this creature is … different. They name her Ada and declare her a blessing. Jóhannsson’s film is not quite a horror, though it flirts with the genre’s motifs. There is the constant sense of danger lurking in the frostbitten depths of the nearby lake, or just behind the postcard-perfect mountain that looms over their home. Maria has creepy dreams of curly-horned rams with sinister, glowing eyes; the ewe that gave birth to Ada waits stubbornly outside her bedroom window. Inside, Maria swaddles the lamb in a blanket, cooing and singing her to sleep. In one adorable scene the pair bathe together. When Ada disappears, she becomes feral with fear and maternal rage.  A yellow cable-knit cardigan becomes a harrowing talisman, not unlike the red raincoat in Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now. Jóhannsson teases the possibility of a monster, but waits to reveal his hand. When he does, there’s more than a touch of gallows humour.

12/12/2021,"The government has brought in new rules for the arms trade that experts fear will make it easier to ignore human rights concerns when deciding whether to allow international sales of UK-made weapons. The revised Strategic Export Licensing Criteria could also make it harder for critics to challenge any deal in court, warned Martin Butcher, policy adviser on conflict and arms for Oxfam, who said the changes “would reduce accountability and transparency and will lead to more UK arms being used to commit war crimes and other abuses.”  The secretary of state for international trade, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, introduced the revised criteria for licensing arms sales in a written statement to parliament on Wednesday. Ministers now appear to have more discretion to allow sales. One new provision allows exports if a minister decides there is only a “theoretical” risk that a buyer would break rules about the use of weapons. Under the new rules “[the government] will not refuse a licence on the grounds of a purely theoretical risk of a breach of one or more of those criteria”, Trevelyan’s statement said. This means that export licences could be issued to governments implicated in serious abuse, Butcher said. “This gives a lot of wriggle room and lessens transparency over arms licensing,” he said. “In the context of arms sales to Saudi being used in Yemen, this means that if the minister believes there is only a theoretical risk of arms being used to target civilian infrastructure or residential areas, they will issue the licence.” Even under previous tighter export-control rules, two-thirds of countries classified as “not free” because of their dire record on human rights and civil liberties received weapons licensed by the UK government over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2020, the UK licensed £16.8bn of arms to countries criticised by the US-funded human rights group Freedom House. Of the 53 countries castigated for a poor record on political and human rights on the group’s list, the UK sold arms and military equipment to 39. The UK government has already admitted that a Saudi-led coalition has attacked Yemen using weapons made by British companies. The UK supplied more than half of combat aircraft used by the kingdom for its bombing raids, in a campaign that has faced accusations of serious human rights abuses. The changes also appear to allow the government to decide whether it should take sanctions, embargoes and other restrictions into account when making decisions about handing out licences. “The new criteria allow government ministers to weigh up different factors and if, ‘overall’, they think a transfer should go ahead, they can ignore factors which should be used to deny a transfer,” Butcher said. The new rules seem to be modelled in part on the US arms-licensing stance, and will allow the country to put political or strategic decisions ahead of concerns about violating international humanitarian law, he added. “This is a radically different approach to the past criteria … it seems that if the UK government’s allies are in a conflict, this will be taken into account when considering licences.” The Department for International Trade said that the “UK takes its export control responsibilities very seriously” and the changes “in no way represent a weakening in the UK’s export control regime”. MP Alyn Smith, who represents Stirling for the SNP, said: “The UK arms export regime wasn’t much cop to begin with, given the dubious regimes around the world it already somehow justifies exports to, but these changes will weaken it even further. Worse still is the sneaky way they have tried to bounce it under everyone’s radar while so much of the political class are distracted by the shambles of a government.”",News/World news,New rules on UK arms trade make it ‘easier’ to sideline human rights,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/new-rules-on-uk-arms-trade-make-it-easier-to-sideline-human-rights
