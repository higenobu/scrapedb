2/16/2022,"The weakness of Prince Andrew’s legal position and fears over his own performance in the witness stand left his legal team with few options other than reaching a settlement with Virginia Giuffre that is likely to cost him $10m (£7m) or more, according to several international lawyers. Ann Olivarius, the senior partner of the McAllister Olivarius law firm who has acted in cases on both sides of the Atlantic, said she expected Prince Andrew’s settlement to be worth at least £10m ($13m), based on previous cases settled with wealthy individuals.  “The size of the compensation is probably massive by any British standards, and it’s probably very substantial by American standards – and American standards are very high,” Olivarius said. “You can anticipate this would be probably in excess of £10m, even £20m perhaps. I don’t know what it is for a fact but as someone who does these agreements all the time it could easily be up there. And frankly it could be far higher.” Mark Stephens, an international lawyer at Howard Kennedy and expert in reputation management, said he expected Prince Andrew’s settlement to reach around $10m after paying for his own legal fees, using the proceeds from the prince’s recent sale of a Swiss chalet, initially valued at $25m but which Stephens believes was sold for a “fire sale” $18m. Olivarius said that Prince Andrew’s position was undermined by his previous statements that provoked ridicule, such as his claim that he was unable to sweat, and others that appeared implausible, such as his claim that he had no recollection of meeting Giuffre despite a photograph of him with his arm around her. The prince’s Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis also pointed to how he would struggle to cope with probing and detailed questions during his deposition. Under cross examination, the prince would have been quizzed about what he saw or experienced during his friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. None of which would have been easy for him – or for the royal family. Stephens said that within the “careful diplomatic language” in the settlement document, Andrew had managed to avoid confirming allegations that he was aware that Giuffre had been sexually trafficked, allowing him to avoid further disgrace during the Queen’s jubilee if proceedings had dragged on throughout the year before a possible court appearance in December. “Essentially he knows he’s being consigned to a metaphorical tower at Balmoral, but he’s avoided all the gory details coming out during the Queen’s jubilee year,” Stephens said. Nick Goldstone, head of dispute resolution at Ince Gordon Dadds, agreed the settlement could “quite easily” run into many millions of dollars on top of Giuffre’s legal costs. “The damages and the “substantial” charitable donation should surely be in the millions of dollars on their own. The Prince’s legal costs will be enormous too,” Goldstone said. He thought the result would come as a “huge relief” for the royal family as an institution. “In terms of “the court of public opinion” this looks like an admission of bad conduct on the part of Andrew and I suspect he will remain ‘off-stage’ from the royal family for the rest of his life,” said Goldstone. “Perhaps he intends to rehabilitate himself by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and supporting its victims over the years. What appears to have truly motivated him has been his loss of honorary titles and royal associations.” Olivarius said that it made sense for all the parties to settle, and that Giuffre had got everything she said she had wanted from the proceedings. The prince has insisted he had never met Guiffre, and his lawyers had suggested the claim she had brought was “baseless” and was designed to win her a “payday.” Yet the agreed statement between the parties published on Tuesday included this key passage. “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.” Olivarius said: “She said she wanted an apology, she wanted an amount of money and she wanted him to acknowledge what he’s done. It seems to me that she has gotten those things. “She got an apology because he has now praised her for being courageous. She’s gotten money for a charity in trafficking, and she got him to settle which is an admission, clearly, that he is frightened to go forward, he has got too much exposure, he cannot afford on a risk management basis to go forward. “She had leverage, she used it and she triumphed. I say this is good news all round, and it’s good news for him because we know he couldn’t have handled this deposition, it was going to be a disaster,” Olivarius said.",News/UK news,Why Andrew had to settle with Virginia Giuffre: lawyers say he had little choice ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/why-andrew-had-to-settle-with-virginia-giuffre-lawyers-say-he-had-little-choice
2/16/2022,"Scientists appear to have cured a third person, and the first woman, of HIV using a novel stem cell transplant method, American researchers in Denver, Colorado, said on Tuesday. The patient, a woman of mixed race, was treated using a new method that involved umbilical cord blood, which is more readily available than the adult stem cells which are often used in bone marrow transplants, according to the New York Times.  Umbilical cord stem cells also do not need to be matched as closely to the recipient as bone marrow cells do. “We estimate that there are approximately 50 patients per year in the US who could benefit from this procedure,” said Dr Koen van Besien, one of the doctors involved in the treatment. “The ability to use partially matched umbilical cord blood grafts greatly increases the likelihood of finding suitable donors for such patients.” The group of researchers revealed some of the case details at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver. The woman is being called the “New York patient” by scientists, because she received the treatment at the New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center. In 2013, she was diagnosed with HIV. Four years later, she was diagnosed with leukemia. In a procedure known as a haplo-cord transplant, she was given cord blood from a partially matched donor to treat her cancer. A close relative also provided her with blood to boost her immune system as she underwent the transplant. After patients receive an umbilical cord blood transplant, they are then given additional adult stem cells. The stem cells grow quickly but are eventually replaced by cord blood cells. Although cord blood is more adaptable than adult stem cells, it does not yield enough to serve as effective treatments of cancer in adults. As a result, in haplo-cord transplants, the additional transplant of stem cells helps make up for the scarcity of cord blood cells. “The role of the adult donor cells is to hasten the early engraftment process and render the transplant easier and safer,” said Van Besien. Since the woman’s transplant in August 2017, she has been in remission from her leukemia for more than four years. Three years after the transplant, she and her doctors discontinued her HIV treatment. Fourteen months since, she has yet to experience any resurgent virus. According to the scientists, the majority of donors in registries are of Caucasian descent. As a result, allowing for only partial matches can open up the potential to treat patients who have both HIV and cancer, and also those who come from more diverse racial backgrounds. “The fact that she’s mixed race, and that she’s a woman, that is really important scientifically and really important in terms of the community impact,” Dr Steven Deeks, an Aids expert at the University of California, told the Times. Even though more than half of the world’s 35m HIV cases are found in women, women only make up 11% of participants in cure trials. Although Deeks was not involved in the case, he acknowledged that “these are stories of providing inspiration to the field and perhaps the road map. “Umbilical stem cells are attractive,” he added. “There’s something magical about these cells and something magical perhaps about the cord blood in general that provides an extra benefit.”",News/Science,Third person apparently cured of HIV using novel stem cell transplant,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/15/hiv-aids-cure-third-person-woman
2/16/2022,"US attorneys representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein have hailed Tuesday’s settlement between Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre as a “victory” for survivors, with one claiming the royal’s “arrogance” stood in the way of settling sooner.  Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against the Duke of York in New York last year, accusing the prince of sexually abusing her when she was 17. The move represents a remarkable turnaround for the duke, who had always denied having a sexual relationship with Giuffre and vowed to clear his name in court. In the settlement, the prince said he regretted his association with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019 while facing trial for sex crimes. “It’s another banner day for the survivors,” Robert Lewis, a New York-based lawyer for Sarah Ransome, who was abused at the age of 22 and settled a lawsuit with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2018, told the Guardian. He said he felt the victims had “been heard, and were no longer silenced” after Maxwell, the disgraced British socialite, was convicted in December on charges of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004, but he said Tuesday’s developments would further empower them. “They understand the pain and suffering that other survivors have gone through and they’re happy to see other survivors get some vindication, whether it’s the money paid or even more importantly just an acknowledgement that their claims are legitimate, that they’ve been wronged and that the truth is out.” Lisa Bloom, attorney for several of Epstein’s victims, said in a tweet that Giuffre had achieved “what no one else could: getting Prince Andrew to stop his nonsense and side with sexual abuse victims”. “I consider this a great victory for Virginia,” Bloom added in an interview with Talk Radio. However, Lewis said he was surprised the prince had not settled the case sooner. Asked if there had been “any element of arrogance” in the prince’s delay in settling, Lewis said: “That’s absolutely the case.” “It’s true for Epstein, it’s true for Maxwell, it’s true for the Catholic church, it’s true for the prince … they think the law on some level applies only to everybody else. “The settlement does not surprise me. What does surprise me is that he and his advisers and lawyers didn’t see this earlier and come to terms with it much earlier.” The court document that revealed news of the settlement on Tuesday said: “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.” However, Lewis said he believes the royal’s previous conduct, from his claim of not remembering meeting Giuffre to denouncing her allegations as “baseless” has been questionable. “What I observed, and what the world observed, was that for the last however many years he’s been dodging the whole matter. He sat for that terrible [Newsnight] interview in 2019, that didn’t come off well at all. Then they fought jurisdiction in New York and lost, and moved to dismiss, and lost. “So he was a couple of weeks from being deposed and having to answer questions under oath to lawyers, who had a lot more information about the situation than journalists did. “Given that, and the further diminution in his public standing, which is obviously important to him, it was a good time for him to settle.” Bloom said the settlement means the royal would not “malign [Giuffre] any more”. “Folks need to understand how extraordinarily difficult and painful it is to litigate a sexual abuse case, and Virginia has shown more courage in one day than most of us show in an entire lifetime, by not only going after Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, but now Prince Andrew, and standing up to him,” Bloom said. “Part of this settlement is acknowledging her pain and what she has gone through, and that he did not intend to malign her character. He’s not he’s not going to malign her any more. “He states publicly that he regrets his association with Jeffrey Epstein, which frankly, he should have said a long time ago. These are good accomplishments. It would have been nice for all of us to see this trial … but at the end of the day Virginia gets to decide what’s best for her. She does not have to carry the weight of the world’s interest.”",News/UK news,"Prince Andrew’s ‘arrogance’ prevented earlier settlement, lawyers say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/prince-andrew-lawyers-settlement-arrogance-jeffrey-epstein
