1/14/2022,"YORK, Maine — Town officials released video footage late Wednesday that shows a police officer in Maine using a K-9 to subdue a man during a traffic stop more than two years ago. The release of the footage comes about a week after the man, Stephen Brennan, announced through his attorneys he had reached a $325,000 settlement agreement with the town and Patrolman Jonathan Rogers, who had released the dog during the encounter on Sept. 20, 2019. In a joint statement released with the footage, York Town Manager Steve Burns and Acting Police Chief Owen Davis said Rogers “simply did his job to keep York a safe place.” Brennan was 63 at the time of the incident and ran a pediatrics practice. He suffered multiple injuries, including dog bites that his attorneys said required months of follow-up and wound care. The 21-minute video, which was released in response to a public records request from Seacoast Media Group, includes audio and dashboard camera video. There was no body-worn camera used during the encounter, Burns said. Rogers pulled over Brennan for allegedly flashing his high beams. The video shows Brennan stepped out of his vehicle before Rogers' cruiser had fully stopped. As Brennan walked toward the police cruiser, Rogers shouted at him to put his hands up. Brennan complied at first, but he continued walking while Rogers yelled three times for him to stop. Brennan stopped for a moment with his hands raised, then he dropped them and turned back toward his own vehicle. Rogers left his cruiser and approached Brennan, telling him to stop moving. Rogers had his gun drawn and pointed at Brennan. Brennan turned again toward Rogers, who repeatedly warned that he would sic the K-9 on him if he did not turn around and comply. After Rogers told Brennan six times to get on the ground, Brennan dropped to his knees. Rogers told Brennan to get on the ground one more time as the K-9 ran toward Brennan and knocked him to the ground. No more than 40 seconds elapsed between when Rogers' patrol car came to a stop on scene and when his K-9 can be seen in the video running at Brennan. While Brennan was on the ground with the police dog on top of him, Rogers told him to get on the ground again and put his hands behind his back. Brennan rolled onto his stomach as the dog appeared to continue biting down on his leg. At the same time, Rogers told Brennan to stop resisting. Rogers was on the ground atop Brennan while the K-9 continued to subdue him. Rogers eventually pulled the dog off of Brennan, who remained on the ground with his hands behind his back. The K-9's engagement with Brennan lasted about 80 seconds. Several officers and an ambulance arrived to assist Rogers and tend to Brennan’s injuries. Rogers told Brennan he was under arrest for refusing to submit to arrest or detention. Rogers can be heard telling the other officers about Brennan's injuries. “He looks like I beat the f---ing s--- out of him. I really didn’t,"" Rogers said. ""I just released the dog.” Emergency medical technicians told Rogers one of Brennan’s eyes had bled and he couldn’t see out of it. Rogers told the EMT that he had smacked Brennan with his hand in the area that the eye was bleeding. When an ambulance arrived 13 minutes into the interaction, Rogers informed the responders Brennan’s leg had been chewed and was bloody. Brennan’s interaction with police, the K-9 and EMTs lasted about 16 minutes before Brennan was placed in an ambulance. Brennan was charged with refusing to submit to arrest, but the charge was dismissed after six months, according to York County District Attorney Kathryn Slattery. The DA's office is not involved in disciplinary investigations against police officers, Slattery said. At the time, York police said the response by Rogers was warranted because, they said, Brennan had been an aggressor. Brennan’s attorney, Alexander Spadinger of Shaheen and Gordon, said the settlement makes clear that initial attempts by York police to paint Brennan as the aggressor were untrue. They said Brennan was in the process of getting down on the ground to surrender when the K-9 was released. The decision to release a trained police dog was neither reasonable nor necessary, Spadinger added. Brennan suffered multiple injuries as a result of the dog bites that required months of follow-up and wound care treatment, including puncture wounds to both legs and his left arm, as well as a chest wall injury and trauma to his left eye, according to the statement. “As a result of this case, Dr. Brennan is hopeful that the York Police Department will take steps to ensure that next time one of its officers is faced with a situation like this, they turn first to their de-escalation training before resorting to physical force,” Spadinger added. In contrast, Burns said the settlement was decided by the town’s insurer and does not reflect wrongdoing by York police. “The settlement is because we have insurance so that the insurance company dictates anything that has to do with financial risk to them. They make the decisions, they pay that settlement. The town does not pay that,” Burns said. “It does not cost the taxpayers anything, other than if the insurance premiums go up.” Burns said Rogers still works for York police. Burns declined to comment on whether the town believes the settlement was fair. Burns said the incident between Rogers and Brennan triggered an internal investigation by the York police command staff that did not lead to any disciplinary action. Rogers was told not to use such vulgar language, but that was it, Burns said. No changes have been made to YPD use of force and dog policies in response to this incident, Burns said. Acting Police Chief Owen Davis said York police conducted a ""thorough investigation"" that found Rogers' actions followed all department operating procedures and used ""the appropriate amount of force necessary to gain control of the situation while ensuring the safety of both parties."" Davis said Rogers used numerous verbal commands to deescalate the situation and Brennan refused to comply, which prompted Rogers to employ “non-lethal force” to take Brennan into custody. Three witnesses to the event came forward and provided statements in support of Rogers’ actions, Davis said. In the statement, Burns said police have a difficult job. “I’m often told I have a difficult job, and that people wouldn’t want my job. I look at the job our Police Officers do … and think, my job is easy by comparison,” Burns said. “Police Officers are kind and caring, and provide all manner of public service to our residents. However, at any moment they are prepared to jump into action to keep our community safe.” Despite the settlement, Kasia S. Park, the attorney who represented the town and Rogers, continued to deny any wrongdoing on the part of Rogers, Sgt. Brian Curtin and the York Police Department. ""There was no finding of wrongdoing on the part of Officer Rogers, the Town or any other York officer,"" Park said. ""The parties decided to mediate this case and a settlement was reached. There was no admission of wrongdoing or liability. ""This was not a routine traffic stop,"" Park said. ""Dr. Brennan jumped out of the car before Officer Rogers even stopped his cruiser and started heading towards Officer Rogers. Officer Rogers did not know the identity of the driver at the time, did not know why the driver was jumping out of the car or if he was armed, or if there was anyone else in the car. There were three civilian witnesses who came forward describing Dr. Brennan as being the aggressor during the encounter.""

1/14/2022,"The 911 call made by the sheriff’s deputy that shot and killed a Black man in North Carolina has been released. The city council has now requested that the U.S. Department of Justice get involved in the investigation. Deputy Jeffrey Hash called 911 after he shot Jason Walker on Saturday, Jan. 8, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The almost four-minute call records Hash as saying, “I just had a male jump on my vehicle and broke my windshield. I just shot him. I am a deputy sheriff.” “You said you shot him?” the dispatcher asked the deputy. “Yes, he jumped on my car, please,” he responded. When the dispatcher asked for his name, Hash said, “I am a lieutenant with the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office.” Later in the call, the dispatcher asks Hash if he is near the victim, he replies, “I am. He’s gone. He’s gone, ma’am.” “Is he breathing?” the dispatcher inquires. The deputy answered, “No, ma’am, he is not. He’s gone.” Hash then asks for “units out ’cause there’s people gathering.” During the call, the deputy tells the dispatcher that his vehicle is a red Ford F-150. He then states, “He shattered my windshield.” Also heard on the call is an exchange that Hash had with a witness, Elizabeth Ricks, the woman who tried to assist Walker after he was shot. The call captures Hash telling her to leave the scene. “Just keep moving, ma’am,” he says to Ricks. She replies to him, “I’m a trauma nurse.” To her qualifier, he says, “I’m a deputy sheriff. Come here. He jumped on my vehicle. I just had to shoot him.” The dispatcher joins in the conversation and asks for clarity on what actually happened, to which Hash submitted his version. “I was driving down the road and he came flying across Bingham Drive, running, and then I stopped so I wouldn’t hit him and he jumped on my car and started screaming; pulled my windshield wipers off, and started beating my windshield and broke my windshield,” Hash recalled. “I had my wife and my daughter in my vehicle.” The dispatcher asked, “Did he have any weapons, sir?” Hash said that Walker did not have a firearm, and again, asserted his version of the story, “He just tore my wipers off and started beating. … He busted my windshield.” Turning her attention to the victim, who Hash had already said was not breathing, the dispatcher about how many people are present at the site of the crime. “There’s tons of cars and people gathering around,” he stated. The 911 call continued to pick up conversations from those who gathered around Walker’s body. One key voice is Ricks, the trauma nurse Hash told to “keep moving.” Ricks can be heard saying that the man is still alive. Hash finally asks for help, saying, “He has a light pulse right now. I need EMS now.” The dispatcher asks where the man was shot, but neither Hash nor Ricks has the information. Hash reveals to the dispatcher, “I’m seeing blood on his side, ma’am.” Ricks is heard trying to save him, notwithstanding Hash’s request for EMS’s arrival on the scene. The call records her in the background asking for a shirt or something to stop the bleeding. Others in the background-repeat the dispatcher’s questions about where Walker was shot, but Hash continues to say that he doesn’t know and repeats his version of what happened, “He was on the front of my vehicle. He jumped on my car.” Ricks snaps, “I don’t care about that, where is the entry point?” Hash responded to her and says to the dispatcher, who tells him to stop talking to the people on the scene, “People are hostile right now.” Hash’s “hostile” comment was captured on the two-minute cellphone video of the aftermath of the shooting, recorded by Chase Sorrell, Ricks’ boyfriend. Ricks and Sorrell are key witnesses to the fatal shooting. The Fayetteville Observer reports that the two say they were driving about two car lengths behind Hash when the nurse saw Walker standing on the side of the road. Ricks maintains that Walker waited for one car to go by before he started to cross the street. That is when Hash’s truck came by and struck the 37-year-old Black man, and Hash got out the car and shot the man four times, the nurse says. After that, she got out of her car to attempt to save his life as he lay dying next to the back wheels of the Ford pickup truck. Ricks’ account of Walker being hit by a car contradicts police claims released earlier this week. Fayetteville Police Chief Gina Hawkins said on Sunday, Jan. 9, the pickup truck had a “black box” that would have registered if the vehicle struck “any person or thing.” She also added that one eyewitness said to her office that Walker was not hit by the truck. The Fayetteville newspaper reports that Ricks says she gave a witness statement to police at the scene of the shooting. Since the shooting, Hash has acquired representation. Parrish Daughtry, his lawyer, shared on Tuesday that her client was “devastated” about the incident. She said, “Lt. Hash is devastated for Mr. Walker’s family, his own family, the greater community and devastated by these events. Beyond that, I’m really prohibited from discussing the facts.” Walker’s family also acquired the services of a lawyer. Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney that has represented victims in many high-profile cases such as those of George Floyd and Trayvon Martin, will represent the interests of the family of the deceased. NEWS ALERT: @AttorneyCrump has been retained by the family of Jason Walker, a 37-year-old man who was shot and killed by off-duty Cumberland County deputy Jeffrey Hash on January 8. pic.twitter.com/ENO0uhiMOn — Ben Crump Law, PLLC (@BenCrumpLaw) January 11, 2022 His office released the following statement, “We have reason to believe that this was a case of ‘shoot first, ask later,’ a philosophy seen all too often within law enforcement. We look to the North Carolina SBI for a swift and transparent investigation so that we can get justice for Jason and his loved ones.” The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is solely handling the investigation around Walker’s death. The Fayetteville City Council voted unanimously during its first regular session meeting on Monday, Jan. 10, to invite the U.S. Department of Justice to assist in this case.

1/14/2022,"Hattie Boydle is an Australian bodybuilder and fitness coach. She told Insider she ""hates training abs,"" but still does exercises to strengthen and sculpt her core. Boydle shared her top four functional exercises, including weighted deadbugs and half Turkish get-ups. Hattie Boydle is an Australian bodybuilder, coach, and fitness influencer, but ""fricking hates training abs,"" she told Insider. The 32-year-old focuses on functional exercises that allow her to perform and move more efficiently, which build the abs as a result. ""When training my abs I think about anti-rotation work, and breaking up my upper and lower abs,"" she said. Boydle strengthens her core with movements like deadbugs, single-leg hanging leg raises, and side planks. To do a deadbug, lie on your back with your lower back flush to the floor. Raise your arms straight up towards the ceiling and create a table-top position with your legs bent at 90 degrees both at the hip and the knee. Your shins should be parallel to the ground and the ceiling. This is your starting position. Lower one arm above your head while stretching out the opposite leg (keeping it off the floor), pushing your heel away from you, exhaling, and maintaining contact between your spine and the floor. Return both outstretched limbs to the starting position before performing the movement on the other side. Boydle likes to make these more challenging by holding weights or using a resistance band. These involve hanging from a bar above your head and lifting one leg up to 90 degrees and back down, while engaging the core to stabilize the body. Bodybuilder Sunny Andrews told Insider she also loves the move for working the abs. A Turkish get-up is a full body exercise that begins on the back, lying on the floor, and ends with standing. They can be performed holding a weight in the raised arm, or using just bodyweight. Lying on your back, press the weight up and fully extend your right arm. Bend your right knee and place your right foot flat on the ground. The left leg will remain extended flat on the ground, and should be off to the left side at a 45 degree angle. This is the starting position. From here, curl up using your abs and push off of your left forearm. End the movement by coming up onto your left hand. Keep your right arm extended and eyes on the weight. Push up through your right foot to raise your hips off the floor. Sweep your left leg back and rest on your left knee. Reverse the motion to return to the floor. Boydle favors the bottom half of the movement, finishing in a one-legged kneeling position: ""They're really good for your anterior sling and obliques."" Side planks can be performed at varying levels of difficulty, on the forearms or hand, with the lower leg bent and resting on the floor, both legs straight and feet apart for stability, or feet stacked on top of each other. Engage the whole body, don't collapse in your supporting shoulder, and create a straight line down your torso to your feet. Hold the position while bracing the core.

1/14/2022,"WEST PALM BEACH — Corey Johnson will spend the rest of his life in prison for the 2018 sleepover stabbing of 13-year-old Jovanni Sierra. Palm Beach County Judge Cheryl Caracuzzo sentenced Johnson to life in prison Thursday at the end of a threer-hour hearing in West Palm Beach.

Johnson killed Sierra, whose family spoke at the sentencing hearing and asked the judge to sentence Johnson to life in prison. The family also shared memories of Sierra during the hearing. ""I do not think rehabilitation is likely,"" Caracuzzo told Johnson in announcing his sentencing, citing his willingness to kill for extremist views. Prior to Caracuzzo's ruling Johnson apologized for “contributing to the spread of evil” in killing Sierra. “I’d like to apologize not because it will change anything, but because I’m really truly sorry,” Johnson, who was 17 when he killed Sierra and now is 21. Johnson also denounced the Islamic extremist group ISIS. His attorneys argued during his trial last fall that its teachings radicalized the teen before the stabbing. He had discovered them online. Johnson told the court he wanted to make the world a better place and help people turn toward God to help “balance out” the crime he committed. The murder took place at the BallenIsles Country Club home of Elaine Simon, whose son, Kyle Bancroft, was Johnson's closest friend. Her younger son, Dane, was a close friend of Sierra, whose birthday was March 11. The boys had met at his birthday party that night and slept over at Simon's home afterward. Johnson also attacked Simon and Dane Bancroft. Prosecutors said Johnson killed Jovanni Sierra after the 13-year-old made a remark Johnson considered offensive to his newly professed Muslim faith.

1/14/2022,"Unfortunately, the misinformation on cures for coronavirus have continued and apparently gotten more creative. Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker claims he is sitting on a ‘mist’ that could rid your body of the virus, reported the Washington Post. Walker said in a Glenn Beck podcast interview he had a “dry mist” that could clean anyone from covid and was also FDA-approved, According to the Post. Well, that doesn’t sound like a product someone is trying to sell you from under their trench coat at all. Read more Remember when Novak Djokovic called out Naomi Osaka for not following the rules? The Xbox One Is Officially Dead Liberty Walk Worked Its Magic On A Mitsuoka Orochi And Won The Tokyo Auto Salon Before It Even Started Biologists Shocked to Find Millions of Icefish Nesting Near Antarctica The Airline Passenger Rights Everyone Should Know The Daily Beast reported Walker interrupted a discussion on law enforcement to drop Beck a piece of information he “shouldn’t tell.” From the Daily Beast:
 “Do you know right now, I have something that [you can bring] into a building, that will clean you of COVID, as you walk through this, this dry mist?” Walker asks. Beck, processing this information, squints. Walker interprets this as an invitation to proceed. “As you walk through the door, it will kill any COVID on your body,” he continues. He leans in and adds, “EPA-, FDA-approved.” “When you leave—it will kill the virus as you leave, this here product,” Walker says. He adds that he has a second unspecified miracle product, a “spray” possibly indicated for use after the dry mist treatment. “They don’t want to talk about that. They don’t want to hear about that,” Walker says. “And I’m serious.” Now, this man is running for office by the way. The Post wrote Walker is expected to face Sen. Ralph Warnock in Georgia’s Senate contest all while having little-to-no experience in politics yet loads of support from the Republican Party, including an endorsement from Trump. Maybe Walker wanted to be seen in Trump’s likeness. The former president did spend a lot of time spreading misinformation about the virus, including a suggestion to drink house cleaning products as a homemade remedy. “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that,” said Trump, via the Daily Beast. Aside from making up anti-covid aerosols, the former Dallas Cowboys running back, is currently facing allegations of threatening to kill two women, one of them being his ex-wife, reported the Post. That didn’t seem to hurt any of his political support. The Post reported that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had concerns about said allegations but endorsed Walker  anyway. However, Walker stirred the anti-vax pot instead. More from The Daily Beast: In October, the Heisman winner had to cancel a fundraising event hosted by a donor whose Twitter profile featured an image of syringes in the shape of a swastika. (A Walker spokesperson initially defended the image as not being anti-vaccine, but “clearly an anti-mandatory vaccination graphic,” adding that “Herschel unequivocally opposes antisemitism and bigotry of all kinds.”) The prior month, Walker expressed support for Nicki Minaj, whose apocryphal claim that the vaccine caused her cousin to develop swollen testicles had gone viral. “Hey @NICKIMINAJ, It’s always okay to ask questions. It should be encouraged to be inquisitive in order to make sure we’re putting our country’s best interest at heart,” Walker tweeted. “Thank you for speaking out!!!” Lordt!

The video starts with one of the workers unloading a package from a truck. The employee drops the package, which suddenly explodes the moment it touches the ground. Smoke then fills up the entire area.

A video posted on Chinese social media shows the aftermath of the explosion that left debris where the incident occurred. Ambulances and the authorities were later called to the scene.

A report posted on Baidu claims that the package contained a type of firecracker that ignites on impact.

It is unclear whether the employee who handled the package was injured after the incident occurred.

1/14/2022,"Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema declared Thursday that she will not vote to suspend the filibuster in order to pass two voting bills championed by her party, all but guaranteeing that President Biden’s top legislative priority will fail. Speaking on the Senate floor, Sinema reiterated her well-established commitment to preserving the filibuster and rejected the argument — made by her party leaders and Biden himself — that the rule represents an unacceptable obstacle to passing the Freedom to Vote Act and For the People Act. “There’s no need for me to restate my longstanding support for the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation. There’s no need for me to restate its role in protecting our country from wild reversals of federal policy,” she said before the chamber Thursday. “This week’s harried discussions about Senate rules are but a poor substitute for what I believe could have and should have been a thoughtful public debate at any time over the past year.” “But what is the legislative filibuster, other than a tool that requires new federal policy to be broadly supported by senators, representing the broader cross-section of Americans?” the senator asked. “Demands to eliminate this threshold from whichever party holds the fleeting majority amount to a group of people separated on two sides of a canyon, shouting that solution to their colleagues.” The Arizona Democrat said that she is dedicated to making her public service in Congress reflect the diversity of her constituency and the nation at large, and urged her colleagues to stop viewing the American people as an ideological monolith that will automatically get on board with every progressive proposal. The House of Representatives passed legislation Thursday that merged both bills, but it will not advance in the evenly divided 50–50 Senate given Sinema’s opposition. Moderate Democratic senator Joe Manchin, who has also repeatedly refused to endorse any effort to weaken the filibuster, applauded Sinema for standing firm Thursday. “Very good. Excellent speech,” he said. Biden is reportedly heading to Capitol Hill Thursday in a last-ditch effort to convince the pair of Democratic holdouts to lower the filibuster hurdle for the voting bills. Biden delivered a speech in Georgia on Tuesday lobbying Republicans to join Democrats in moving the voting legislation forward, warning that they risk falling on the wrong side of history if they don’t. “At consequential moments in history, they present a choice,” said Biden in his speech. “Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Despite having supported the Senate 60-vote threshold throughout his political career, Biden announced: “I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking actions on voting rights.” In rebuttal, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell slammed his rhetoric as a “rant,” “incoherent,” “incorrect,” “beneath his office,” and “unbecoming of a president of the United States.” McConnell had threatened retaliation Tuesday in the event that Democrats changed the filibuster, claiming that such a move would backfire, stifle the legislative process, and usher in a “procedural nuclear winter.” The Democrats had settled on a carve-out exception to the filibuster for the voting bills rather than a push to flat-out kill it. “You could not invent a better advertisement for the legislative filibuster than what we’ve just seen, a president abandoning rational persuasion for pure, pure, demagoguery,” he said. “A president shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants is proving exactly why the Framers built the Senate to check his power.” Ilhan Omar Says Senate Democrats Obstructing Effort to Eliminate Filibuster ‘Are Killing our Democracy’ Schumer Threatens to Nuke Filibuster If GOP Stands Ground on Voting Bill Manchin Says He Will Never Vote to ‘Eliminate or Weaken the Filibuster’ in Op-Ed",Politics/National Review,Sinema Deals Death Blow to Biden’s Final Push to Suspend Filibuster,https://news.yahoo.com/sinema-deals-death-blow-biden-180152300.html
