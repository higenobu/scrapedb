4/29/2022,"The Eden Project in Cornwall has installed plastic grass in a children’s play area to stop them getting muddy. The garden is one of a number of organisations and public bodies laying artificial turf in what environmental campaigners say is an epidemic of plastic being laid across the UK. There was a surge in interest across the UK in buying artificial grass during lockdown, according to data on Google Trends. The growing fashion of installing plastic in place of natural lawns comes as artificial grass retailers are making increasingly loud environmental claims about their products. The latest development is artificial grass known as “air”, which manufacturers say is capable of purifying air pollution by oxidising organic components and malodours at a molecular level. Campaigners describe this as greenwash, and point out that natural grass already “cleans the air” via photosynthesis, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Grass also provides habitats for insects and worms, attracts birds that feed on invertebrates, and helps rainwater drain away. Richard Dowling, a campaigner, said the speed and scale at which natural gardens were being removed and replaced with plastic, was “a disaster” unfolding. “This is something that is rapidly taking over, and we need to treat it as a disaster now. If we lose all our gardens, our wildlife – which is already being pushed out by intensive agriculture and pesticides – will have nowhere to go.” The UK has lost more of natural biodiversity since the industrial revolution than almost anywhere in Europe, a study by scientists at London’s Natural History Museum found. Dowling has launched a petition to introduce an ecological damage tax on artificial grass. Carlisle city council – which says in its mission statement on climate change it wants to play a full role in protecting the environment, was recently criticised for spending £50,000 on a pop-up park that used artificial grass. Somerset county council laid plastic grass on a roundabout and then sent an official to cut it with a strimmer. The Eden Project confirmed it had used plastic grass in a children’s play area. Its mission statement says it is dedicated to improving collective understanding of the connections between all living things … fresh air, clean water, fertile soil, rich biodiversity.” A spokesperson said: “To ensure the safety of the children enjoying this temporary play area, we took the decision to use durable and soft artificial grass that will be reused many times over. Real grass, in this context, would become mud within a few hours and therefore would not have been sustainable.” Research shows that plastic grass – which is most often made from a mix of plastics – polypropylene, polyurethane and polyethylene – increases the heat in areas where it is used. When it breaks down it can release microplastics into the environment, which are thought to be harmful to humans. There is little data on the carbon footprint of artificial grass, most of which is manufactured in China and Vietnam and shipped to the UK. “It is a fossil fuel product,” said Charlotte Howard, a gardener from Wiltshire campaigning for natural gardens. Howard says the boom in fake grass is being turbo-charged by social media influencers such as Mrs Hinch. Howard specialises in helping families in new-build homes whose gardens have poor soil as a result of developers stripping off and selling the top soil, leaving the garden with poor soil and no drainage. “When I have gone in to remove artificial lawns the mess is horrendous. They often stink, and when you lift up the plastic grass you find a sea of dead worms,” she said. Howard said despite the claims of manufacturers, artificial lawns were not maintenance-free. Pet faeces have to be scraped off, the grass pile has to be swept, weeds creep through, pet urine causes bad smells, and the plastic eventually breaks down, she said. Dr Robert Francis, an ecologist at King’s College London, is researching the ecological impact of plastic grass. “Artificial lawns meet the cultural requirements of ‘good’ lawns”, he wrote. “Yet they do so at the expense of any remaining ‘naturalness’ and embodiment of life.” He said his research had found artificial grass can increase urban flood risk because rainfall cannot drain away into the soil, leaving more of it to run off.

4/29/2022,"Clinton McCracken, an art teacher in Orange county, Florida, grew up in a small midwest town where he didn’t experience a person out as LGBTQ until he went away to college. He’s concerned Florida’s recent controversial “don’t say gay” bill is dangerous, hateful legislation that poses many risks to LGBTQ youth in the state. “I wasn’t able to walk to any classroom and see rainbow stickers on the door that says this is a safe place where you can be who you are,” said McCracken. “We have that now. That’s what we’re trying to create for our students. This law, I see as an effort to take away the years that we’ve put in trying to make this a better place for kids so they don’t have to grow up like I grew up, where I thought I was all alone and then I barely made it through high school.” Florida’s teachers, students, and LGBTQ community are continuing to speak out against the bill that was signed by right-wing Trump-supporting governor Ron DeSantis last month. The National Center for Lesbian Rights, Equality Florida, and Florida families have filed a lawsuit challenging the bill, arguing it is unconstitutional . The legislation has already begun to have a chilling effect on teachers, students and the LGBTQ community, though it doesn’t go into effect until July. The bill, called the Parental Rights Education bill by its Republican authors, prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as well as any instruction characterized as inappropriate – vague language that has incited concerns the bill will be used to suppress and intimidate mere acknowledgment of the LGBTQ community in public schools. “Don’t say gay” also grants parents the right to sue for damages and attorney fees if a school district doesn’t resolve their complaint about a child’s education, which essentially forbids discussion of LGBTQ issues or identities. A teacher in St Johns county was reprimanded by their school district after a parent complained about his T-shirt, which said “Protect Trans Kids.” McCracken characterized the bill and copy-cat legislative efforts spreading in other parts of the US as part of a war on gay cvil rights ignited by Republicans and is deeply concerned about the negative impacts of the bill on students and teachers. “As a gay man, I find it both hurtful and insulting. It’s hurtful, because I don’t believe there’s anything inappropriate about my life as a gay man,” he said. “I have a loving husband, we have a wonderful life together. I believe that I’m a good teacher and have positively impacted students and that me being gay not only hasn’t been detrimental to their learning, but it has probably been helpful for a lot of people – not only LGBTQ+ students, but other students as well who see that I’m willing to live my life openly and that I believe everyone should be able to live their life with dignity and respect and we should be treating each other like fellow humans.” Many other Florida teachers agree. “The vagueness of the language in this bill opens an unfortunate door into allowing bigotry to continue,” said Caitlin Pearse, an elementary school music teacher in Hillsborough county, Florida. “What we’re talking about here is the right to be seen and represented in classrooms. We have lots of books in elementary school showing heterosexual couples, they have parent characters that are moms and dads, things like that. We want to be seen the same way that straight couples are seen in media.” The bill was supposedly incited by a lawsuit filed by parents against Leon county, Florida, who claimed they were not involved by the school in a discussion about their child’s gender identity, though emails obtained by the Tallahassee Democrat revealed the mother of the child had worked with a teacher on how to handle the situation. Florida Republican state senator Dennis Baxley, a sponsor of the bill, in remarks on the state senate floor, made claims of a big uptick in the number of children coming out as gay and framed the bill as a response to that. Through his political career, Baxley has also fought against same-sex marriage, equated the children of people with substance use disorders to the children of lesbian parents, voted in 2015 to permit private adoption agencies to refuse to place children with LGBTQ parents, and supported other anti-LGBTQ legislation. “This bill, for me, is a sign of pure hatred,” said Javier Gomez, a high school senior at iPrep Academy in Miami, Florida, and president of his school’s Gay-Straight Alliance club. “They’re targeting a demographic that can really benefit from all these teachings about gender identity and sexual orientation, about differences in cultures, and learning about accepting themselves for who they are, because a lot of kids at a very young age know who they are. I knew that I was gay at five years old.” Florida was already a poor climate for LGBTQ students. A 2019 survey of 848 students in Florida conducted by GLSEN found the majority of students were regularly exposed to anti-LGBTQ remarks from other students or staff and high percentages of students reported being physically harassed or assaulted due to their sexual or gender identity. A report conducted by the Trevor Project estimates that at least one LGBT youth between the ages of 13 and 24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds in the US. “Many students who are not graduating are petrified. They’re scared, they’re horrified,” said 17-year-old CJ Walden, a high school student in Boca Raton, Florida, and vice-president of the LGBTQ advocacy non-profit PRISM FL. “Many students want to return to the closet, they are scared of being who they are, they’re scared of expressing themselves. And now that if teachers or counselors have to out or report students, if a student doesn’t have a supportive household, and now they can’t turn to an adult on campus, what are they supposed to do? We’re being left defenseless without the support we need and we are continuing to face homophobia from our government.” Proponents of the “don’t say gay” legislation are manufacturing smear campaigns in support of expanding the bills to other states, including claims that Disney is attempting to “sexualize our children” as part of a progressive LGBTQ agenda. These accusations have been promoted by Chris Rufo, a rightwing thinktank fellow who leaked videos of Disney executives, claiming Disney has a “not so secret gay agenda”. This is just a few weeks after Disney faced criticism from employees and the LGBTQ community for refusing to make a statement in opposition to Florida’s don’t say gay bill. Rufo previously worked as a fellow for the Claremont Institute, which has a troubling record of anti-gay politics and pushing for conversion “therapy”. “I’m gay too so this hits me doubly hard,” said Jean Eckhoff, a history teacher of middle school and high school students in Live Oak, Florida, for 17 years. “I’m 52 years old, and I’ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime.” Eckhoff said she has been horrified not only by the bill’s passage in Florida, but by similar legislation being pushed in other states with Republican majorities around the US. Proponents of these bills are inflaming homophobic hate and chipping away at civil rights of the LGBTQ community under the guise of helping students and parents. Similar bills are advancing or received calls for passage by Republicans in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. “They’ve unearthed these really debasing insults, calling anybody who disagrees with the bill a groomer and a pedophile, and that is a very serious charge for a teacher. It’s basically saying that you shouldn’t be in the classroom,” Eckhoff said. “It’s disgusting. It’s humiliating. Every time I turn on the news, every day in the newspaper, on Twitter or on Facebook, we’re being insulted every single day.”",News/World news,‘Hurtful and insulting’: Florida teachers react to the ‘don’t say gay’ bill,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/dont-say-gay-bill-florida-teachers-react
4/29/2022,"I’ve been giving considerable thought recently to the way we teach science at school – and whether we have the balance right between catering for those children who will become the scientists and engineers of the future (and how would we be able to tell this anyway?), and those who don’t think they have a natural aptitude for science, or are simply more interested in other subjects. The issue goes beyond which science topics we should be teaching, and in what depth. I’m more concerned by the obsession with making children memorise scientific “facts”, and whether this is what we should be focusing on so much. Perhaps spending more time learning how we “do” science – what’s called the scientific method – is more valuable than simply “knowing” stuff. After all, science isn’t a collection of facts about the world. That’s just called “knowledge”. Rather, science is a process – a way of thinking and making sense of the world, which will then lead to new knowledge. This is a very important distinction. We’ve often heard it said that we should be teaching children not what to think but how to think. This is an admirable sentiment, but what would it mean in practice? Why spend so much of the school science curriculum loading up children’s brains with facts about the world that they can just look up anyway? Wouldn’t it be more useful teaching them how to find reliable scientific knowledge – which these days inevitably means online rather than in books – and how to assess and critically analyse and absorb that knowledge when needed? I have no doubt that those who develop the school science curriculum, and probably a few teachers too, would balk at this idea. After all, I am not a professional educationist. They might argue that we still have to teach the scientific nuts and bolts – chemical formulas, the bones of the human body, Newton’s law of gravitation, electricity and magnetism, and so on – particularly to those who will end up studying their subject in greater depth at university and go on to take science up as a profession. And what about the rest of society? Surely, everyone needs a basic scientific understanding. Just as everyone should have some understanding of, say, history or literature, we all need to know some science: facts about the world to help us make informed decisions in our everyday lives, from what precautions to take during a pandemic and the importance of vaccines, to the risks of vaping, the benefits of flossing or why recycling our waste is good for the planet. A scientifically literate society is one that can see the world more clearly, and can make more informed decisions about important issues that face us all. Yet what seems to be missing today is an understanding of the way we gain this scientific understanding of the world. And yes, you may be thinking: so what? Adopting the scientific method could help us all become more tolerant and less polarised in our views – to disagree without being disagreeable – particularly online. No one can, hand on heart, deny that the internet is a wondrous invention, utterly transforming our lives over the past three decades. Even social media, that easiest of scapegoats for all of society’s ills, has played a vital role in disseminating and democratising information. That said, far too many people use it not as a useful tool, but as a medium for ill-informed, often toxic opinions, and for spreading disinformation. But the internet and social media have only really amplified societal problems that have always been with us. On top of this, our attention spans are inevitably getting shorter, and we don’t take the time to question our biases, or ask whether the information we are getting is reliable and trustworthy. This is where thinking scientifically can help. I don’t mean being able to manipulate equations or interpret complex statistics, but rather adopting some of the ways that good science is practised, such as critically assessing what we believe and examining the trustworthiness of evidence; questioning our own biases before we attack views we don’t like; and being prepared to admit our mistakes and change our minds in the light of new evidence. This is what we should be teaching more of in schools: better critical thinking skills, better information literacy (an understanding of data), how to cope with complexity, and how to assess uncertainty – to keep an open mind about information we only have partial knowledge about. All these skills are part of the scientific approach. This remarkable way of seeing, thinking and knowing, is one of humankind’s great riches and the birthright of everyone. And, most wonderfully, it only grows in quality and value the more widely it is shared. To expect any kind of radical review or reassessment of what children are taught at school – given how disruptive and time-consuming even minor tinkering with the syllabus can be for many teachers – let alone asking wider society to adopt a more rational way of thinking, is probably too much to ask; but surely we have to do something. Humankind came up with the scientific method to make sense of a confusing physical universe. But even in our exceedingly more complex and confusing universe of human affairs, adopting some of the lessons from the way we progress in science can be empowering and liberating. Thinking scientifically is much more than just knowing stuff. It gives us a way to see the world beyond our limited senses, beyond our prejudices and biases, beyond our fears, insecurities, ignorance and weaknesses.

4/29/2022,"Texas, with its wide-laned roads and supersized highways, seems like an unlikely place for a rebellion against the supremacy of American car culture. But last week a band of residents from across Texas descended upon the state’s department of transportation (DoT) to voice fury over new highway expansions that are set to displace thousands of people and raze hundreds of businesses, schools and churches. Meanwhile, the state is actively crushing local plans to encourage more cycling and walking as an alternative to driving. Festering concern over the seemingly endless swelling of highways has even sparked an unusual intervention from the federal government, with Joe Biden’s administration launching a civil rights investigation last year into the Houston project that has paused its construction. “Federal transportation department monitoring and intervention on civil rights grounds is rare,” said Theodore Shaw, director of the center for civil rights at the University of North Carolina. “The courts have not done much about it.” Holding signs riffing off familiar tropes in this conservative state, such as a picture of a bicycle under the words “Come and take it”, several dozen protesters rallied outside the Texas department’s headquarters in the shadow of Texas’ pink-hued capitol in Austin. “It’s just plain Jane boring lanes, more and more lanes,” said Fabian Ramirez, a structural engineer whose property in Houston’s Northside district is set to be flattened as part of a controversial $9bn project to widen and realign the city’s highways. “There’s no train, there’s no bus, there’s no anything that supports mass transportation. It doesn’t exist. They [Texas DoT] love concrete. I mean, geez. I love building stuff, but I also have a moral compass.” Ramirez said repeated expansions of highways in Houston have invariably destroyed homes in Black and Latino neighborhoods like his. “All of these Black and brown neighborhoods are being attacked by this expansion,” he said. “I should be able to enjoy being Mexican in Houston in 2022 without somebody trying to push me out of my neighborhood.” City leaders in Texas, meanwhile, have also started to question the car-centric status quo. San Antonio planned to narrow a two-mile stretch of Broadway Avenue, a key thoroughfare, and add protected bike lanes, only for Texas DoT to overrule the city in January to halt it, citing fears over worsened traffic congestion. Ron Nirenberg, San Antonio’s mayor, accused the state of “1950s thinking” and a “religious fascination” with highway expansions. “Five years ago the idea that there would be any elected officials publicly opposing a freeway widening would seem farfetched,” said Jay Crossley, executive director of Farm and City, a non-profit that works on Texas urban living issues. “A lot is changing in Texas.” But the federal government is still funneling $350bn to the states for highways via the infrastructure bill, a situation that experts warn could wreck the US’ climate targets by spurring more car driving and planet-heating emissions. While some states, such as California, have started to recognize studies that show if you sow more asphalt you simply reap more traffic, Texas is pushing ahead with an unprecedented blitz of new road space for cars. “This is a make-or-break moment. How the states use those highway funds will basically determine whether we meet our transportation emissions goals,” said Ben Holland, an urban design and land use expert at RMI, a clean energy non-profit. Beyond the highway expansion in Houston, Texas is upsizing major roadways that carve through Austin and El Paso, as well as eliminating the planned bike lanes and pedestrian crossings in San Antonio. The frenzy of road building is championed by Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, as a response to the state’s ballooning population, which grows by about 1,100 people a day, and driver frustration over gridlock. “Highways are essentially fossil fuel infrastructure but we haven’t really heard about them in climate discussions until now,” Holland said. “It’s just been universally accepted that it’s too hard to get people out of their vehicles and provide alternatives. There is certainly a car culture here, but in large part that’s because it’s been mandated.” In Texas, the mandate for the supremacy of roads comes via the state constitution, which requires that highways are funded to the exclusion of almost anything else that moves people around. About 97% of the $30bn a year the state gives its transportation department is spent on highways, leaving very little for buses, trains or bicycles. This focus is etched into the stone of the department’s headquarters, which is named the State Highway Building, a title carved above a triptych of native Americans on a horse, a pioneer wagon and a car. Last week, the monthly public meeting of Texas’ four transport commissioners was thronged with protesters who took turns to denounce the highway expansions. A teacher spoke of students who missed school because no one with a car was able to take them, while a young man recounted how he has to walk alongside a busy highway each day to get to work. Several demanded that San Antonio, and other cities, be allowed to give room to cyclists and pedestrians. “The constant never ending buzzing of cars, the honking, revving of engines at all hours and exhaust from vehicles idling in traffic causing a stream of pollution, make it hard to sleep and enjoy being outside in my own neighborhood,” said Tiffany Valle, a Houston resident. “The sounds of song birds are drowned out by the cacophony of cars from the unnatural river of concrete.” Several protesters also decried the death toll on roads which has, across the US, increased since the start of the Covid pandemic. “I am done accepting that people have to continue to die in cars,” said Kelsey Hughes, an Austin resident who said she lost four members of her church group in a car crash. “We’re here to say we’ve had enough. We want to live in a world where we walk to school, into grocery stores, where we bike to work and where we take high-speed trains to visit our family members.” Despite a high-profile road safety campaign by Texas DoT, more than 4,480 people were killed on the state’s roads last year, a situation critics say is exacerbated by the creation of ubiquitous, wide highways that encourage fast driving, coupled with a lack of safe pedestrian crossing points or bike paths, which are included along just 0.5% of the 80,000 miles of road overseen by Texas DoT. Houston is the deadliest major metropolis in the nation for drivers, their passengers and those who are mown down by cars, according to the Houston Chronicle. Across the US, more than 90% of the top pedestrian fatality hotspots are on roads with three or more lanes, according to a federal government analysis released in January that also found that fatalities among pedestrians and cyclists are rising faster than those within vehicles. “People walking and biking suffer disproportionately from serious injuries and fatalities when a crash occurs compared to people in vehicles,” the report adds. America’s zeal for large, wide roadways can be traced back to the federal highway act of 1956, which spawned what was the largest public construction program in US history. A new network of 41,000 miles of highway would crisscross the country, connecting cities, improving travel times and helping upgrade roads that were in a dangerous condition. Dwight Eisenhower, then US president, called the project “essential to the national interest”. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the highways were, however, pushed through the core of America’s cities, mostly through communities of color that didn’t have the political clout to avoid being uprooted. An estimated 1 million people were forced from their homes as hulking highways cleaved neighborhoods in half, transforming dense, walkable communities into dislocated, often forlorn places that were left with a stew of toxic air pollution from the rumble of passing cars and trucks. As the highways filled up with traffic, a series of road expansions and widenings occurred, causing more displacement and in many places failing to alleviate the congestion. This is because of what economists call “induced demand”, a theory that was put forward as early as the 1960s to argue that building more roads only leads to more cars. This concept has been bolstered by subsequent research that has shown that the amount of added road capacity in US cities has caused a lockstep increase in the number of miles driven. Essentially, wider highways may provide some temporary respite to congestion, but this just encourages more people to drive in the “improved” conditions, leading to more traffic and eliminating any initial benefit. Trains and buses can share the load, especially for people unable to afford the punishing expense of a car, but experts say the root of the issue is that most roads are free to use and subsidized by government. “Anytime you make something cheaper and more convenient to use, then people will use more of it,” said Holland. A prime example of this self-enforcing loop is found in Texas, where the Katy Freeway purportedly became the widest freeway in the world when it was broadened in 2008 at a cost of $2.7bn. Covering 26 lanes, including its feeder roads, the freeway spears into into the west flank of Houston and was touted as the ashen jewel in the city’s crown, a sea of grey that would conquer congestion. Instead, commute times for most drivers worsened. “The Katy Freeway is the classic example of hope over experience, that this will be the 12ft of pavement that will make congestion go away,” said Michael Manville, an expert in urban planning at the University of California. “If gasoline was free and we simply built more gas stations when we had a shortage that would be an insane scenario, but we suspend that understanding with roads. We just build more lanes.” If wide roads did solve congestion, Houston would be a freewheeling race track. Hefty, capacious highways encircle and burrow into the city like a tangle of concrete serpents, taking visitors on an often bewildering journey where nothing but highways can be seen, as if the roads themselves constituted the fabric of the city, rather than people or homes or parks. Houston has 6,200 miles of roads – enough to stretch to Moscow – but less than half of those miles have sidewalks and fewer still adjoin any sort of shared public park or plaza, an epitome of US city design that is all corridors and no living room. “We are habituated to driving everywhere,” said Asha Weinstein Agrawal, an urban planning expert at San Jose State University. “But it’s not innate to the American genome. If you show people there are alternatives that are cheaper and better, they are intrigued.” The latest highway expansion and re-routing, called the North Houston Highway Improvement Project, will in certain sections bring a 24-lane highway to Houstonians, more than doubling the width of the roadway in locations near downtown to 570ft. More than a thousand residencies are to be torn down as part of this vision, along with five churches, two schools, the city’s Mexican consulate and hundreds of businesses ranging from dentists to Vietnamese restaurants. A Texas DoT spokesman said is a “false assertion” that the paused project will worsen congestion, adding that the strong population growth around Houston would have left the city and surrounding county in “far worse shape” if the Katy Freeway hadn’t been expanded. “[Texas DoT] has implemented an unprecedented effort to listen, be responsive and inclusive to delivering transportation solutions for this corridor that would prove to be least invasive, unifying and contemplative of building a project that will improve safety, operations, enhance quality of life, be a catalyst of economic development and promote livable and enjoyable places and spaces for all,” the spokesman said. The pattern of such enlargements can be measured in family histories. Tanya Debose’s grandfather once owned a home next to where the I-45 runs now, only for the dwelling to be torn down when it widened. Her grandmother lost a home to the expansion of the I-10 in Houston’s Fifth Ward. Debose is now a community liaison and organizer for Independence Heights, an historic black neighborhood that is set to lose dozens of homes as well as its Greater Mount Olive Baptist church, a century-old structure that is perched next to the relentless automotive white noise of the I-45. Debose is disheartened by the cycle of displacement but is hoping to draw funding commitments from Texas DoT to help reinvigorate Independence Heights, bringing back the sort of walkable place she grew up in where Black-owned grocery stores, hairdressers and other businesses clustered in a tight-knit community. The threat of flooding – a number of houses around the church are still boarded up or have tarpaulin roofs from when Hurricane Harvey dumped a trillion gallons of rain on Houston five years ago – will also need to be addressed before another storm sloshes down the extra miles of impervious, flood-prone concrete. “The civil rights investigation is only a drop in the bucket, they need a civil rights investigation into housing, health, everything,” she said. “They need to rethink this highway so it doesn’t just benefit one neighborhood and trash another neighborhood. It’s always communities of color that are displaced. We don’t know which way to turn, we are kind of stuck in limbo.” Others will struggle to ameliorate the impact of the latest highway outgrowth. Bruce elementary school, located within sight of Houston’s downtown skyscrapers, already sits next to a coil of different roads at the I-69 at I-10 interchange, all at different heights and angles, giving the impression of a constant moving wall of metal and noise. The project will bring the highway to the school’s gate line, within 40 meters of its students. Texas DoT claims the project will actually improve because of improving vehicle emissions technology and the addition of “express lanes”that will carry buses, car pools and future autonomous vehicles but Bruce elementary already has an asthma rate double that of the city average and Air Alliance Houston, an environmental group, estimates emissions of benzene, a carcinogen, will increase here by 175% once the highway is closer. About eight crossing guards are deployed to help protect the children who have to traverse the highways to get to and from Bruce but the fence of the school still has to be repaired several times a year due to cars crashing into it. “When I think about the commute and air quality and things like that, that’s when we do become concerned,” said Shawn Nickerson, Bruce’s principal. Nickerson said the school is looking to install air pollution monitors and keep children indoors during recess on smoggy days. “The highway is coming closer and closer and you think, ‘Where are the kids going to play?’ Around here you see some people walk out of necessity, but just walking around to enjoy your neighborhood? That’s not something you really see here.”",News/US news,‘It’s just more and more lanes’: the Texan revolt against giant new highways,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/texas-highway-expansions-project-displacements-protests

4/29/2022,"India and Pakistan have been experiencing extreme and dangerous heat over recent days. High temperatures are not uncommon at this time of year in India, with April and May typically being the hottest months before the monsoon season brings welcome rain and slightly cooler temperatures from June. However, the high temperatures so far have been unusually widespread and follow a very warm March. The average maximum temperature for March across India was the highest since records began 122 years ago. Although one particular weather event cannot be directly attributed to climate change, climate scientists are clear that the severity and duration of heatwaves are expected to increase in the future. On Wednesday, 45.6C was recorded at Rajgarh, India. On the same day, temperatures topped 47.5C in Nawabshah, Pakistan. On Thursday, the highest temperature in Pakistan was 47.5C at Dadu, with 45.8C recorded in the north-eastern Indian city of Medininagar. These extreme temperatures are close to record levels for April in India, with 48.3C the highest reliable April temperature ever recorded, back in 1958. It is feared many people will succumb to the exceptional heat, with India’s poorest and eldest communities, who have limited access to air conditioning, expected to be worst affected. There are also concerns for the impact on local and global food supplies. India is a big supplier of wheat globally and the largest wheat-producing states in northern and central parts of the country have been hit particularly hard, with crop harvests down on normal. Temperatures are forecast to remain above normal this weekend and next week, with temperatures in New Delhi remaining above 40C. Meanwhile, at the start of the week parts of Australia experienced extreme rainfall. Moisture-laden air from a tropical low-pressure system combined with an upper-level trough to produce heavy rainfall.

4/29/2022,"Cost of living was the biggest issue on the political agenda today, after new figures showed a huge jump in wholesale electricity prices. Iceberg lettuce also became a surprise talking point. Anthony Albanese emerged from Covid isolation and Scott Morrison ratcheted up a war of words with the prime minister of Solomon Islands. Meanwhile the debate about debates continued to be a sideshow. Morrison travelled to the marginal Tasmanian seat of Bass – which Liberal MP Bridget Archer is attempting to hold on to at the election – to reannounce Bell Bay as the site of a clean hydrogen industrial hub. The Liberal party is also attempting to hold on to the Tasmanian marginal seat of Braddon and to win Lyons from Labor. The prime minister said the government was providing up to $70m for the Tasmanian government’s Green Hydrogen Hub Project, and up to $3m for Origin Energy’s Green Ammonia Project for Export (GRAPE) project at Bell Bay. He also said Lark Distilling had received $4.5m for a new single malt distillery. Albanese started the morning in Sydney – out from Covid isolation – with three breakfast TV interviews and a walk with his dog, Toto. The Labor leader also spoke to media briefly before boarding a plane to Perth. Albanese will campaign in Western Australia – where Labor is hoping to win up to three seats from the Liberal party. In a sign of the importance Labor is placing on WA for its electoral prospects, Albanese is preparing to launch the Labor campaign in Perth on Sunday. Solomon Islands: The prime minister of Solomon Islands accused the Australian government of hypocrisy over his country’s security deal with China, saying Australia’s own Aukus pact was far from transparent but he “did not become theatrical and hysterical”. Manasseh Sogavare said Solomon Islands “should have been consulted to ensure that this Aukus treaty is transparent since it will affect the Pacific family by allowing nuclear submarines in Pacific waters”. Morrison returned fire, suggesting that Sogavare had changed his view based on “other influences” and that there was a “remarkable similarity between those statements and those of the Chinese government”. Lettuce price shock: Morrison was asked about the cost of living at his press conference today, including how long Australians would be confronted with paying $5 for lettuce. He emphasised “external influences on the economy are going to continue for some time”, adding: “You can’t necessarily change the price of a lettuce, but what you can do is you can halve petrol tax, and that’s exactly what we did.” That is a six-month temporary measure. Albanese had raised the issue earlier in the day, saying “the cost of everything is going through the roof, and everything’s going up except people’s wages”. Albanese said he had “done some online shopping this week” and it cost $5.50 for an iceberg lettuce. Border force video: The commander of Operation Sovereign Borders released a video in multiple languages warning against unauthorised boat journeys. Rear Admiral Justin Jones said in the video that “no one who attempts to travel illegally by boat will settle here”. News Corp reported that the video was prompted by intelligence including online chatter in recent weeks pointing to a renewal of interest by people smugglers. Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen, a former immigration minister, later told the ABC such chatter was “constant”. Bowen said it was “deeply irresponsible” for Scott Morrison to cast doubt over Labor’s commitment to maintaining Operation Sovereign Borders. Messaging wars: A majority of voters agree with key Labor campaign messages that Scott Morrison is “all announcement no delivery” and Labor will “put the care back into aged care”, according to new research. A poll of 1,000 voters, commissioned by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, suggests Labor’s messages are the most effective of the campaign so far, although Coalition claims about handling of the economy also test well. It’s 100% not my fault. – Malcolm Heffernan, a candidate for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party who said he was “massively annoyed” after being referred to the Australian Federal Police for allegedly nominating to run in two different seats on opposite sides of the country. He told Guardian Australia he had “no idea” he was a candidate for the far-right party.

The fresh dog poo bag is a real treat https://t.co/DXXsKMYphF The Australian government signed up to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, which means transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable energy if we’re going to address the climate crisis. The deputy prime minister and leader of the Nationals, Barnaby Joyce, has come out saying he’s refusing to use the word “transition” because he thinks transitioning to cleaner energy means job losses and unemployment, but is this true? Antoun Issa checks the facts in this video. Cost of living is a key issue this election and Labor has argued its policies will lead to higher wage growth in Australia. In today’s episode, Paul Karp joins Jane Lee to discuss the details of the policies and how they compare with the Coalition’s plans.

4/29/2022,"Pop culture has long taught us that the worst possible thing that could happen to a woman is for her to end up alone – with cat ladies serving as warnings of the fate awaiting anyone left without someone to love her. By those standards, the premise of Grace and Frankie should have been the beginning of the end for its main characters: two septuagenarian frenemies discovering that their husbands had been having an affair for two decades. How easy it would have been for them to check out of their final chapters and simply run down the clock. And yet this week, when Netflix’s longest-running original series drops its final episodes, it will also be the end of one of television’s greatest female friendships, brought to life by the irresistible chemistry of Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, real-life friends for 40 years. When Grace and Frankie premiered in 2015, it lulled viewers into something of a false sense of security. Appearing to be a cosy sitcom about the older generation, it offered a classic farcical setup: a hasty odd-couple arrangement, with each woman refusing to move out of a shared beach house. The stage was set for gags about older people misbehaving. Those gags are certainly in there but, more important, so is a revolutionary narrative of women finding meaningful relationships beyond their familial structures. Initially boxed into their respective types – Grace (Fonda), the entitled, uptight cosmetics magnate and Frankie (Tomlin), the free-spirited, irresponsible artist – these women became each other’s catalysts for rediscovery. Grace and Frankie took women who already knew themselves (or thought they did) and proved that the platonic enmeshing of two lives can happen at any age. These are women acquainted for 40 years, for the entirety of which they have failed to see eye to eye. But it is only at the age when they are becoming invisible to the wider world that Grace and Frankie finally see one another in vibrant colour. And so there is a sense of urgency: time is not on their side. This is not a friendship built on hopes for the future but on making the most of the present (and sense of the past). It is true that this is a show about extremely wealthy white women but, in many ways, it is that level of privilege that allowed Grace and Frankie to home in on age as its primary antagonist. Grace and Frankie’s big friendship moments happen against a backdrop of failing bodies, assisted suicide, cancer, grandparenting, dementia, alcoholism and arthritis-friendly vibrators. Together, they are allies – each other’s “emotional support witches” – as they briefly end up in a retirement home, Frankie has a stroke and, perhaps most seismic of all, Grace marries a younger man. But while many of their specific problems are age-related, their friendship issues are age-old: when to prioritise friendship over romance, how to respect boundaries when you’re cohabiting and what to do when your bestie leaves you in the lurch. Perhaps most vital is the way the show allows this friendship to evolve over time. Reaching a point of mutual respect happens fairly early on, as does the realisation that they could stand to learn a little something from one another. If it were a romcom, that’s where things might end, but Grace and Frankie is interested in what happens beyond the happily ever after. And so, they let each other down as often as they build one another up. They are variously jealous, needy, inconsiderate and judgmental and, more than once, they “break up”. But when they reconcile – confessing that they are each other’s “first person” – it is with refreshing honesty and mutual vulnerability, freed from the constraints of romantic love. Ultimately, the marriages that betrayed them were the defining relationships of Grace and Frankie’s lives. But only because they led them to something far, far more important: each other.  The final season of Grace and Frankie is on Netflix now.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Emotional support witches’: farewell to Grace and Frankie, TV’s greatest female friendship ",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/emotional-support-witches-farewell-to-grace-and-frankie-tvs-greatest-female-friendship
4/29/2022,"Keir Starmer is a grownup. He is serious, capable, responsible, authoritative and realistic – or so he and Labour would like us to believe. Ever since he became leader, two years ago this month, one of his main goals has been to present himself as a much-needed political adult: repairing the damage done to the party by the supposed perpetual adolescent Jeremy Corbyn; poised to rescue the country from the naughty schoolboy Boris Johnson. From his strict suits and haircut to his no-frills speaking style and carefully researched Commons questions, Starmer has sought to come across as a sober prime minister in waiting, a reassuring figure in troubled times. He is 59, and if Labour wins the next election, he is likely to be the oldest successful candidate for prime minister since Harold Macmillan in 1959. It’s almost possible to imagine Starmer as a politician back in those more stable times. This old-fashioned, rather severe persona has sometimes been pretty effective. We are in one of those periods now, with Starmer easily dismissing Johnson’s shoddy homework in the Commons, and Labour ahead in the polls and expected to do well at next week’s local elections. With the Tories seemingly running out of talent and policy options, a Starmer government is starting to become imaginable. Yet at other times during his leadership, his “grownup” act has fallen flat – and it could easily happen again. Next to Johnson’s antics and the drama of the pandemic and Ukraine, any opposition leader would sometimes struggle to get attention. And Starmer, with his methodical, rather than intuitive, approach to strategy, his slightly yelping voice and stiff body language, is not a political natural. He is a workmanlike leader, partly because that’s his character, as the modest but growing number of Starmer biographies make clear. More importantly, his leadership style also reveals a lot about his party and our wider politics. Ever since Labour’s crushing defeats and loss of confidence in the 1980s, to be a grownup Labour leader, in the eyes of most journalists, Labour MPs and strategists, has meant moving to the right. Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband led in very different circumstances, from the highly favourable to the near-impossible. But all reacted by shedding leftwing policies and acquiring more rightwing ones, by courting conservative interests and cutting adrift Labour’s radicals. Electorally, this approach only worked for Blair: a rare talent whose tenure also coincided with a particularly weak and divided Tory party. Otherwise, many voters, after initially being intrigued, have tended to conclude that Labour leaders who offer ideologically “moderate” maturity are a bit boring, inauthentic, or not to be trusted. The same newspapers that help persuade Labour leaders to shift rightwards often then tell their readers that the party has not shifted enough. Kinnock, for example, got a good press for bashing the left in his early years as leader; but when he looked as if he might actually win an election, in 1992, the tabloids destroyed him. Yet Labour’s urge to seem grown up persists. Partly it’s sustained by the conviction that a less respectable, more leftwing party would do even worse at elections – which is why it’s so important both to New Labour veterans and Starmerites that the huge vote for Corbyn in 2017 is forgotten. Behind this conviction is another layer of pessimism: a belief that Britain, by which the Labour grownups usually mean England, is fundamentally a conservative country. In this environment, the argument goes, Labour can only exist as a significant force if it looks safe and sensible. The importance of retired voters in general elections, and the collapse since 2010 in the proportion of them choosing Labour, from about a third to about a sixth, add to the pressure on Starmer to be conventional. In today’s Britain, growing up, political maturity and the renunciation of leftwing politics seem to go together more than ever. As leader, Starmer has reinforced this connection. In his youth, he was part of a radical collective that produced Socialist Alternatives, a short-lived 1980s magazine which argued presciently that the left should pay more attention to the environment and feminism. Yet on Desert Island Discs in 2020, he mocked his days at the magazine: “We were out to change the world … I said some things that were daft.” He had become less dogmatic, he continued, “as I’ve grown up”. But the idea that radicalism is always immature and naive is itself a form of dogma. During the 1990s and 2000s, when much of the west was relatively stable and prosperous under centrist governments, this cautious view of politics was fairly easy to justify. Yet today, with the climate emergency and capitalism lurching from crisis to crisis, it is the anti-radical position that often seems unrealistic. When the climate activist group Just Stop Oil began blockading fuel depots this month, Labour called for “immediate nationwide injunctions” to halt the protests, because they “cause misery for motorists”. This stance may please some voters at the local elections, but it’s unlikely to seem wise in years to come. The same goes for Starmer’s neglect of the young left that Corbyn mobilised, which could have been Labour’s future. In our era of flux, is there a chance that Starmer’s leadership could change? In Oliver Eagleton’s persuasive new biography, The Starmer Project: A Journey to the Right, his trajectory seems set: an idealistic lawyer protecting civil liberties gradually metamorphoses into a paternalistic party leader promising voters “security”. In theory, the latter offer still has radical potential, as one of the main causes of insecurity in Britain is our version of free-market capitalism. As leader, Starmer has repeatedly said that he wants an economy which is no longer “rooted in insecurity and inequality”. Were he to become prime minister, however, the pressure to drop this goal would be considerable: many businesses have done very well out of Britain’s harsh economic model. Taking advantage of the Tories’ difficulties with some employers over Brexit, Starmer has already been trying to woo the private sector by calling Labour “the party of business”. To his admirers and lieutenants, such manoeuvres are simply grownup politics. If you want an end to Tory rule, they argue, this stern man in a suit is the person to deliver it. They may be right. But being a fully functional prime minister, like being a fully functional adult, isn’t just about professionalism and authority. It’s also about the ability to charm, communicate effectively, show empathy. We’ve yet to see those sides of him – if we ever will. Without them, a Starmer government, however welcome at first, will be hard work for him and for us.

4/29/2022,"China’s ministry of foreign affairs has accused Nato of messing up Europe and stirring up conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region, after the UK’s foreign secretary told China it should “play by the rules”. In a speech at Mansion House in London on Wednesday, Liz Truss renewed calls to boost Nato in the wake of the Ukraine war, and said the coordinated moves to isolate Russia from the world economy proved that market access to democratic countries was no longer a given. Truss also delivered a direct warning to China. “Countries must play by the rules. And that includes China,” she said. On Thursday Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, dismissed Truss’s comments and accused Nato of demanding other countries abide by basic norms while it has “wantonly waged wars and dropped bombs in sovereign states, killing and displacing innocent civilians”. “Nato, a military organisation in the North Atlantic, has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region to throw its weight around and stir up conflicts,” Wang said. “Nato has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?” In her speech Truss said Nato had to pre-empt threats in the Indo-Pacific and extend its outlook to democracies outside its membership, like Taiwan, which Beijing claims is a breakaway Chinese province it must retake. She suggested China’s economic rise – now the world’s second largest economy to Britain’s sixth – could be targeted. “[China] will not continue to rise if they do not play by the rules. China needs trade with the G7. We [the Group of Seven] represent around half of the global economy. And we have choices,” Truss said. “We have shown with Russia the kind of choices that we’re prepared to make when international rules are violated.” China has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, one of its closest allies, drawing criticism and urgings from European and other governments to use its influence on Moscow. A recent China-EU summit was reportedly strained as Chinese representatives rebuffed pressure by European counterparts to help end the war. Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would pursue peace “in its own way”. Beijing firmly opposes linking the Ukraine war to its relations with Moscow and has said it will defend the rights of Chinese individuals and companies. On Thursday Wang said China’s position on the conflict had been “consistent and clear”. “We have always made independent judgments based on the merits of the case,” he said, adding no further detail. Truss has previously accused China and Russia being “aggressors working in concert”, telling Australian media she couldn’t rule out China using Russia’s invasion as an opportunity to launch its own act of aggression.",News/World news,China says Nato has ‘messed up Europe’ and warns over role in Asia-Pacific,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/china-says-nato-is-messing-up-europe-and-warns-over-role-in-asia-pacific
